In China, quite a few of Citrus are cultivated in acidic soils (pH < 5.0). 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) and 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) (C. sinensis were more tolerant to low pH than C. grandis) seedlings were irrigated daily with nutrient solution at a pH of 2.5, 3 or 5 for nine months. Thereafter, we examined low pH effects on growth, and superoxide anion production rate (SAP), malondialdehyde (MDA), MG, antioxidants, and enzymes related to ROS and MG detoxification in roots and leaves in order to (a) test the hypothesis that low pH affected ROS and MG metabolisms more in roots than those of leaves, and (b) understand the roles of ROS and MG metabolisms in Citrus low pH-tolerance and -toxicity.Compared with control, most of the physiological parameters related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greatly altered at pH 2.5, but almost unaffected at pH 3. In addition to decreased root growth, many fibrous roots became rotten and died at pH 2.5. pH 2.5-induced changes in SAP, the levels of MDA, MG and antioxidants, and the activities of most enzymes related to ROS and MG metabolisms were greater in roots than those of leaves. Impairment of root ascorbate  was the most serious, especially in C. grandis roots. pH 2.5-induced increases in MDA and MG levels in roots and leaves, decreases in the ratios of ascorbate/(ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) in roots and leaves and of reduced glutathione/(reduced+oxidized glutathione) in roots were greater in C. grandis than those in C. sinensis.Low pH affected MG and ROS metabolisms more in roots than those in leaves. The most seriously impaired ascorbate  in roots was suggested to play a role in low pH-induced root death and growth inhibition. Low pH-treated C. sinensis roots and leaves had higher capacity to maintain a balance between ROS and MG production and their removal via detoxification systems than low pH-treated C. grandis ones, thus contribute to the higher acid-tolerance of C. sinensis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694237>Effects of Endurance and Endurance-Strength Training on Endothelial Function in Women with Obesity: A Randomized Trial.</a></h1><p>Some investigations have demonstrated that a combined endurance-strength training is the most effective in the treatment of obesity. The aim of the research was to access how different trainings influence: endothelial function, lipid , and risk of atherosclerosis in women with obesity. In a randomized trial, 39 obese women aged 28-62 completed endurance (n = 22, 60-80% HR) or combined training (n = 17, 20 minutes of strength exercises, 50-60% 1RM and 25 minutes of endurance training, 60-80% HR). Before and after the intervention vascular endothelial function (endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), blood total antioxidant capacity (TAC)), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP)as well as visceral adiposity index (VAI), total-body skeletal muscle mass and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were determined. After the trainings, in both groups total cholesterol and total-body skeletal muscle mass increased ( < 0.05). In the group undergoing combined training, lower ( < 0.05) VAI, AIP, CRP and LDL-C were noted. In the group undergoing endurance training TBARS concentration decreased ( < 0.01), while the HDL-C ( < 0.01) concentration as well as eNOS ( < 0.05) activity increased. No significant differences between groups were found, either before or after the programs. Both training programs led to the improvement of lipid , but only endurance training alone favorably changed indicators of endothelial functions in women with obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698196>Seasonal variations in the dose-response relationship of acetylcholinesterase activity in freshwater fish exposed to chlorpyrifos and glyphosate.</a></h1><p>The herbicide glyphosate [N- (phosphonomethyl) glycine; PMG] and the insecticide chlorpyrifos [O, O-diethyl O- (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl) -phosphorothioate, CPF] are widely used in agricultural practices around the world and can reach aquatic environments. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the toxicity of these pesticides on non-target species. The use of biomarkers as a tool to assess responses of organisms exposed to pollutants requires the understanding of their natural fluctuation and the dose-response relationship. In the present work, the effect of the exposure to PMG and CPF on the acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE, biomarker of neurotoxicity) in Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, a native teleost, was evaluated in different environmental conditions. Semi-static bioassays of acute toxicity were carried out under controlled conditions during the four weather seasons of the year using animals of homogeneous size. Circannual rhythms in the basal levels of AChE activity in homogenates of the anterior section were confirmed. Statistically significant average inhibition of AChE activity (47.1 ± 0.7% for 1 μg CPF × L; 69.7 ± 2.5% for 5 μg CPF × L; 23.1 ± 1.1% for 1 mg PMG × L and 32.9 ± 3.3% for 10 mg PMG × L) was determined during summer, winter and spring weather seasons. Interestingly, animals exhibit an increased susceptibility to exposure during the autumn season (inhibition of 55.4 ± 0.6% for 1 μg CPF × L; 81.9 ± 3.3% for 5 μg CPF × L; 41.4 ± 1.7% for 1 mg PMG × L and 61.1 ± 0.3% for 10 mg PMG × L). A different sensitivity of the enzyme between seasons was evaluated by in vitro tests. The inhibition pattern for chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon, the active metabolite of CPF) was not affected when test was performed using homogenates of unexposed specimens of summer or autumn. Otherwise, PMG in vitro inhibitory effect was not observed in a wide range of concentrations. The results confirm that AChE activity is a sensitive biomarker for exposure to CPF and PMG, even at environmentally relevant concentrations. Finally, this work highlights the existence of seasonal variations in the dose-response relationship, which could be due to variations in the  of the pollutants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned  that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.© 2019 Kopp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696959>1,2,4-Triazole-conjugated 1,3,4-thiadiazole hybrid scaffolds: A potent ameliorant of carrageenan-induced inflammation by lessening proinflammatory mediators.</a></h1><p>Inflammation acts as an alarming signal for the progression of various biological complications. Various reports in the literature have revealed that heterocycle-containing synthetic compounds have a restorative capability against acute and chronic inflammatory stages. In the current study, we synthesized a series of 1,2,4-triazole-conjugated 1,3,4-thiadiazole hybrid scaffolds and evaluated their impacts against carrageenan-induced paw edema and proinflammatory markers in Wistar rats. Further, 3D QSAR study (three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships), ADMET (absorption, distribution, , and excretion) profiling, and docking studies were performed to determine the possible mechanism of the action of the derivatives. The study shows that the most active derivatives, 13f and 13g, have optimal logP, a higher anti-inflammatory activity score, and poor  at various sites of cytochrome P450. The docking studies recommended that the synthesized compounds have a similar affinity as the ligands A307, 63X, and S58 to interact with tumor necrosis factor-α, COX-1, and COX-2. So, these molecules will definitely hold a promise for the future drug development initiative.© 2019 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696597>Ghrelin receptor antagonism of fentanyl-induced conditioned place preference, intravenous self-administration, and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in rats.</a></h1><p>The extended occurrence of fentanils abuse associated with the dramatic increase in opioid fatal overdoses and dependence strongly emphasizes insufficiencies in opioid addiction treatment. Recently, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1A) antagonism was proposed as a promising mechanism for drug addiction therapy. However, the role of GHS-R1A and its endogenous ligand ghrelin in opioid abuse is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to clarify whether the GHS-R1A antagonist JMV2959 could reduce the fentanyl-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), the fentanyl intravenous self-administration (IVSA), and the tendency to relapse, but also whether JMV2959 could significantly influence the fentanyl-induced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in rats, that importantly participates in opioids' reinforcing effects. Following an ongoing fentanyl self-administration, JMV2959 3 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally 20 minutes before three consequent daily 360-minute IVSA sessions under a fixed ratio FR1, which significantly reduced the number of active lever-pressing, the number of infusions, and the fentanyl intake. Pretreatment with JMV2959 also reduced the fentanyl-seeking/relapse-like behaviour tested in rats on the 12 day of the forced abstinence period. Pretreatment with JMV2959 significantly and dose-dependently reduced the manifestation of fentanyl-CPP. The fentanyl-CPP development was reduced after the simultaneous administration of JMV2959 with fentanyl during conditioning. The JMV2959 significantly reduced the accumbens dopamine release induced by subcutaneous and intravenous fentanyl. Simultaneously, it affected the concentration of byproducts associated with dopamine  in the NAC. Our findings suggest that GHS-R1A importantly participates in the rewarding/reinforcing effects of fentanyl.© 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696743>High-fat diet effects on the prostatic adenocarcinoma model and jaboticaba peel extract intake: protective response in  disorders and liver histopathology.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer (PCa), overweight and obesity are frequent worldwide health problems. Clinical studies have shown that increased high-fat diet (HFD) consumption is associated with higher incidence of PCa. Brazilian berries, such as  (Vell.) Berg, present high polyphenol concentration in the peel and exhibit positive effects on  disorders and hepatic lesions. Therefore, the aim of the study herein was to investigate the patented jaboticaba peel extract effects (PJE) on different  parameters and liver histopathology in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model, receiving a either normolipid diet or HFD for 8 weeks. The results showed that PJE reduced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, decreased hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammatory markers such as PPARγ and TNFα, respectively. In conclusion, the PJE treatment promoted protective effects in the  of insulin and glucose and liver imbalance caused by HFD intake in the PCa model, suggesting that it may be a good protector against  disorders present in overweight and associated with PCa.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697461>Light-regulated synthesis of extra- and intracellular enzymes related to wood degradation by the white rot fungus Cerrena unicolor during solid-state fermentation on ash sawdust-based medium.</a></h1><p>The light-dependent  of the white rot basidiomycete Cerrena unicolor FCL139 has already been demonstrated using transcriptomic and Biolog-based approaches. To further analyze the influence of light on C. unicolor wood degradation, we measured the activity of an array of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) and enzymes involved in the redox system of fungal cells associated with lignolysis. Extra- and intracellular enzymatic extracts were obtained from solid-state ash sawdust C. unicolor cultures cultivated for 14 days under red, blue, green, or white light conditions, or in the dark. Light greatly influenced the synthesis of MnP, total cellulases, endo-1,4-β-glucanase, endo-1,4-β-xylanase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. The production of MnP and catalase was evidently stimulated by white light. It is also worth noticing that blue light caused a gradual increase in the activity of total cellulases throughout the entire period of C. unicolor growth. Moreover, endo-1,4-β-glucanase showed the highest activity on day 13 of fungus cultivation and the production of laccase and β-glucosidase appeared to be the least influenced by light. However, the strongest activity of the endo-1,4-β-xylanase was observed in the dark. It seemed that light not only influenced the regulation of the synthesis of the wood-degrading enzymes at different levels, but also acted indirectly by affecting production of enzymes managing harmful lignin by-products causing oxidative stress. The ability of the fungus to decompose woody plant material is clearly influenced by environmental factors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694752>Association of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and cardiovascular events in rheumatoid arthritis: results of the CARMA study.</a></h1><p>To assess the plasma apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and its potential association with cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).A baseline analysis was made of the CARdiovascular in rheuMAtology Project (CARMA), a 10-year prospective study evaluating the presence of at least one CVE in 775 Spanish patients with RA. Of them, 29 had already experienced CVE prior to the inclusion in the study. We assessed the association between the elevation of the apoB/apoA1 ratio with the presence of CVE according to a logistic regression model for possible confounding factors. We also analysed the main parameters of activity of RA and parameters related to lipid . RA patients were classified according to treatment: patients treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs without biologics and those undergoing biologic therapy (anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-6 receptor, and other biologic agents).The apoB/apoA1 ratio of patients who had experienced CVE was higher than that of patients without previous CVE (0.65 vs. 0.60). However, the difference between both subgroups did not reach statistical significance (p=0.197). It was also the case after the multivariate analysis [OR: 1.48 (95% CI: 0.15-14.4); p=0.735]. RA patients from the group with CVE were more commonly receiving lipid-lowering treatment with statins than those without CVE history (41.4% vs. 20%, p=0.005). High HAQ and high atherogenic index were significantly associated with the presence of CVE. There was no statistical association between the type of biologic therapy used in RA and the presence of CVE.No association between ApoB/apoA1 ratio and CVE was found at the baseline visit of patients with RA from the CARMA study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693001>Go with the flow-hidden vascular passages in bone.</a></h1><p>The circulatory system in long bones is incompletely understood.

These phenotypic traits are sustained even up to 45 °C, what makes it a relevant candidate for industrial biotechnology applications, such as ethanol production. It is therefore of much interest to get more insight into the  of this yeast. Recent studies suggested, that thermotolerance is achieved by reducing the number of growth-determining proteins or suppressing oxidative phosphorylation. Here we aimed to find related factors contributing to the thermotolerance of K. marxianus.Here, we reported the first genome-scale  model of Kluyveromyces marxianus, iSM996, using a publicly available Kluyveromyces lactis model as template. The model was manually curated and refined to include the missing species-specific  capabilities. The iSM996 model includes 1913 reactions, associated with 996 genes and 1531 metabolites. It performed well to predict the carbon source utilization and growth rates under different growth conditions. Moreover, the model was coupled with transcriptomics data and used to perform simulations at various growth temperatures.K. marxianus iSM996 represents a well-annotated  model of thermotolerant yeast, which provides a new insight into theoretical  profiles at different temperatures of K. marxianus.

Bordetella pertussis the causative agent of whopping cough remains a significant health issue. The transcriptional regulator, BpsR, represses a number of Bordetella genes relating to virulence, cell adhesion, cell motility, and nicotinic acid . DNA binding of BpsR is allosterically regulated by interaction with 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6HNA), the first product in the nicotinic acid degradation pathway. To understand the mechanism of this regulation, we have determined the crystal structures of BpsR and BpsR in complex with 6HNA. The structures reveal that BpsR binding of 6HNA induces a conformational change in the protein to prevent DNA binding. We have also identified homologs of BpsR in other Gram negative bacteria in which the amino acids involved in recognition of 6HNA are conserved, suggesting a similar mechanism for regulating nicotinic acid degradation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697717>Protein synthesis rates of muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage, and bone tissue in vivo in humans.</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle plasticity is reflected by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and breakdown, with basal muscle tissue protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.09%/h. Though it is evident that other musculoskeletal tissues should also express some level of plasticity, data on protein synthesis rates of most of these tissues in vivo in humans is limited. Six otherwise healthy patients (62±3 y), scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee arthroplasty, were subjected to primed continuous intravenous infusions with L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine throughout the surgical procedure. Tissue samples obtained during surgery included muscle, tendon, cruciate ligaments, cartilage, bone, menisci, fat, and synovium. Tissue-specific fractional protein synthesis rates (%/h) were assessed by measuring the incorporation of L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine in tissue protein and were compared with muscle tissue protein synthesis rates using a paired t test. Tendon, bone, cartilage, Hoffa's fat pad, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament, and menisci tissue protein synthesis rates averaged 0.06±0.01, 0.03±0.01, 0.04±0.01, 0.11±0.03, 0.07±0.02, 0.04±0.01, and 0.04±0.01%/h, respectively, and did not significantly differ from skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (0.04±0.01%/h; P>0.05). Synovium derived protein (0.13±0.03%/h) and intercondylar notch bone tissue protein synthesis rates (0.03±0.01%/h) were respectively higher and lower compared to skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Basal protein synthesis rates in various musculoskeletal tissues are within the same range of skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, with fractional muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage, ligament, menisci, fat, and synovium protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.13% per hour in vivo in humans.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in  and energy homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance, we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high-lipid (HL)-induced insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of insulin resistance via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Specifically, we found that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, mediates the protective effects of adiponectin, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin against insulin resistance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693215>Cytosolic phospholipase A and F isoprostanes are involved in semen quality and human infertility-A study on leucocytospermia, varicocele and idiopathic infertility.</a></h1><p>Phospholipase A (PLA ) is involved in eicosanoid release, and F -isoprostanes (F -IsoPs), as free radical-generated eicosanoids released by PLA , are indicators of oxidative stress in different human conditions.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced radionuclide technique that has been available for decades. Originally used as a research tool that contributed to advances in the understanding of cardiovascular pathophysiology, it is now becoming established in clinical practice and is increasingly used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with ischemic heart disease. PET myocardial perfusion imaging has a mean sensitivity and specificity of around 90% for the detection of angiographically significant coronary artery disease, and is also highly accurate for assessing the prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease. Depending on the radiotracer used, it can provide information not only on myocardial perfusion but also on myocardial , which is essential for viability assessment. The potential of this imaging technique has been further increased with the introduction of hybrid scanners, which combine PET with computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, offering integrated morphological and functional information and hence comprehensive assessment of the effects of atherosclerosis on the myocardium. The scope of this review is to summarize the role of PET in ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Early and non-invasive diagnosis of these diffuse hepatopathies calls for possible imaging markers. The purpose of this study was to explore the changes in global hepatic glucose  following hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, or cirrhosis on F-2-fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET)/computed tomography (CT).A total of 178 subjects (51 healthy controls, 41 patients with hepatic steatosis, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 36 patients with hepatic cirrhosis) were recruited, and their hepatic F-FDG PET/CT images were reviewed retrospectively. The hepatic volume (HV; cm), mean standardized uptake value (SUV) in the global liver, and accordingly, global hepatic glycolysis (GHG; cm) were measured. SPSS 19.0 was used for statistical analysis with ANOVA and LSD t-tests, and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Statistical differences were observed in SUV among the hepatic steatosis group (2.44 ± 0.40), hepatitis group (2.47 ±0 .37), control group (2.23 ± 0.42), and hepatic cirrhosis group (2.01 ± 0.36) except between the steatosis group and hepatitis group.

An assessment of the evidence.</a></h1><p>As a major metabolite of kynurenine in the oxidative  of tryptophan, kynurenic acid is of considerable biological and clinical importance as an endogenous antagonist of glutamate in the central nervous system. It is most active as an antagonist at receptors sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) which regulate neuronal excitability and plasticity, brain development and behaviour. It is also thought to play a causative role in hypo-glutamatergic conditions such as schizophrenia, and a protective role in several neurodegenerative disorders, notably Huntington's disease. An additional hypothesis, that kynurenic acid could block nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine in the CNS has been proposed as an alternative mechanism of action of kynurenate. However, the evidence for this alternative mechanism is highly controversial, partly because at least 8 earlier studies concluded that kynurenic acid blocked NMDA receptors but not nicotinic receptors and 5 subsequent, independent studies designed to repeat the results have failed to do so. Many studies considered to support the alternative 'nicotinic' hypothesis have been based on the use of analogs of kynurenate such as 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, or putatively nicotinic modulators such as galantamine, but a detailed analysis of the pharmacology of these compounds suggests that the results have often been mis-interpreted, especially since the pharmacology of galantamine itself has been disputed. This review examines the evidence in detail, with the conclusion that there is no confirmed, reliable evidence for an antagonist activity of kynurenic acid at nicotinic receptors. Therefore, since there is overwhelming evidence for kynurenate acting at inotropic glutamate receptors, especially NMDAR glutamate and glycine sites, with some activity at GPR35 sites and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptors, results with kynurenic acid should be interpreted only in terms of these confirmed sites of action.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692282>Excess postexercise oxygen consumption decreases with swimming duration in a labriform fish: Integrating aerobic and anaerobic  across time.</a></h1><p>Many vertebrate animals employ anaerobic  during high-speed exercise, even if it imposes an energetic cost during postexercise recovery, expressed as excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). In ectotherms such a fish, the initial anaerobic contribution to exercise is often substantial. Even so, fish may recover from anaerobic  as swimming exercise ensues and aerobic  stabilizes, thus total energetic costs of exercise could depend on swimming duration and subsequent physiological recovery. To test this hypothesis, we examined EPOC in striped surfperch (Embiotoca lateralis) that swam at high speeds (3.25 L s ) during randomly ordered 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min exercise periods. We found that EPOC was highest after the 2-min period (20.9 mg O  kg ) and lowest after the 20-min period (13.6 mg O  kg ), indicating that recovery from anaerobic  improved with exercise duration. Remarkably, EPOC for the 2-min period accounted for 72% of the total O consumption, whereas EPOC for the 20-min period only accounted for 14%. Thus, the data revealed a striking decline in the total cost of transport from 0.772 to 0.226 mg O ·kg ·m during 2- and 20-min periods, respectively. Our study is the first to combine anaerobic and aerobic swimming costs to demonstrate an effect of swimming duration on EPOC in fish.

However, all  mutation carriers do not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension, and inflammation could trigger the development of the disease in  mutation carriers. Circulating levels and/or lung tissue expression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-18 are elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and could be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We consequently hypothesized that cytokines could trigger endothelial dysfunction in addition to impaired BMPRII signaling. Our aim was to determine whether impairment of BMPRII signaling might affect endothelium barrier function and adhesiveness to monocytes, in response to cytokines.  was silenced in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs) using lentiviral vectors encoding microRNA-based hairpins. Effects of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 on HLMVEC adhesiveness to the human monocyte cell line THP-1, adhesion molecule expression, endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK were investigated in vitro. Stable  silencing in HLMVECs resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and constitutive activation of P38MAPK. Adhesiveness of -silenced HLMVECs to THP-1 cells was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-18 through ICAM-1 adhesion molecule. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-α induced activation of P38MAPK and disrupted endothelial barrier function in -silenced HLMVECs. Altogether, our findings showed that stable  silencing resulted in impaired endothelial barrier function and activation of P38MAPK in HLMVECs. In -silenced HLMVECs, cytokines enhanced adhesiveness capacities, activation of P38MAPK and impaired endothelial barrier function suggesting that cytokines could trigger the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension in a context of impaired BMPRII signaling pathway.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694194>The Alanine World Model for the Development of the Amino Acid Repertoire in Protein Biosynthesis.</a></h1><p>A central question in the evolution of the modern translation machinery is the origin and chemical ethology of the amino acids prescribed by the genetic code. The RNA World hypothesis postulates that templated protein synthesis has emerged in the transition from RNA to the Protein World. The sequence of these events and principles behind the acquisition of amino acids to this process remain elusive. Here we describe a model for this process by following the scheme previously proposed by Hartman and Smith, which suggests gradual expansion of the coding space as GC-GCA-GCAU genetic code. We point out a correlation of this scheme with the hierarchy of the protein folding. The model follows the sequence of steps in the process of the amino acid recruitment and fits well with the co-evolution and coenzyme handle theories. While the starting set (GC-phase) was responsible for the nucleotide biosynthesis processes, in the second phase alanine-based amino acids (GCA-phase) were recruited from the core , thereby providing a standard secondary structure, the α-helix. In the final phase (GCAU-phase), the amino acids were appended to the already existing architecture, enabling tertiary fold and membrane interactions. The whole scheme indicates strongly that the choice for the alanine core was done at the GCA-phase, while glycine and proline remained rudiments from the GC-phase. We suggest that the Protein World should rather be considered the Alanine World, as it predominantly relies on the alanine as the core chemical scaffold.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696620>Energy flux controls tetraether lipid cyclization in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.</a></h1><p>Microorganisms regulate the composition of their membranes in response to environmental cues. Many Archaea maintain the fluidity and permeability of their membranes by adjusting the number of cyclic moieties within the cores of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids. Cyclized GDGTs increase membrane packing and stability, which has been shown to help cells survive shifts in temperature and pH. However, the extent of this cyclization also varies with growth phase and electron acceptor or donor limitation. These observations indicate a relationship between energy  and membrane composition. Here we show that the average degree of GDGT cyclization increases with doubling time in continuous cultures of the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639). This is consistent with the behavior of a mesoneutrophile, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Together, these results demonstrate that archaeal GDGT distributions can shift in response to electron donor flux and energy availability, independent of pH or temperature. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on GDGTs thus capture the energy available to microbes, which encompasses fluctuations in temperature and pH, as well as electron donor and acceptor availability. The ability of Archaea to adjust membrane composition and packing may be an important strategy that enables survival during episodes of energy stress. This article is protected by copyright.

Endogenous EpFAs are further metabolized into corresponding diols by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Through inhibition of sEH, many studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of EpFAs; however, the role of sEH inhibition in modulating the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders is less well described. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge surrounding the effects of sEH inhibition and EpFA action in neuroinflammatory disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), stroke, depression, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as the potential mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of sEH inhibition.Copyright © 2019.

Indeed, unsaturated fatty acids act as precursors of bioactive molecules such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, resolvins and related compounds. As components of phospholipids, they have a pivotal role in cell biology by regulating membrane fluidity and membrane-associated cellular processes. Finally, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are also endowed with ligand properties for numerous membrane or nuclear receptors. Although myeloid cells are dependent on the  context for the uptake of essential FAs, recent studies showed that these cells autonomously handle the synthesis of n-3 and n-6 long chain PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Moreover, targeting PUFA  in macrophages influences pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, by modulating macrophage functions. Omics evidence also supports a role for macrophage PUFA  in the development of cardiometabolic diseases in humans. Currently, there is a renewed interest in the role of n-3/n-6 PUFAs and their oxygenated derivatives in the onset of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Purified n-3 FA supplementation appears as a potential strategy in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, the ability of immune cells to handle and to synthesize very long chain PUFA must absolutely be integrated and better understood.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

CYP24A1 is the key enzyme for  inactivation of active VD (1,25(OH)D). We examined whether common germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP24A1 gene could affect the association between adult weight gain and breast cancer (BC) risk.The population-based case-control study included 818 patients with primary BC and 935 residence and age matched healthy controls. We studied the relationships between CYP24A1 gene SNPs (rs2209314, rs2585428, rs2762941, rs3787555, rs4809959, rs73913757, rs912505, and rs927a650), adult weight change and BC risk. Gene-weight change interactions were analyzed.Neither of CYP24A1 gene SNPs was associated with BC risk in the study participants. However, we found consistent gene-weight interactions with increasing adult weight gain for CYP24A1-rs2762941 (P-interaction = 0.0089) and CYP24A1-rs927650 (P-interaction = 0.0283). Adult weight gain has a higher premenopausal BC risk with double variant T alleles of rs927650 compared to women carrying at least one wild-type C allele (OR for TT = 1.82, 95% CI 1.10-3.01; for CT = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14; for CC = 1.12 95% CI 0.93-1.35). Women with double wild-type A alleles were at a higher postmenopausal BC risk compared to those carrying at least one variant-type G allele (OR for AA = 1.51, 95% CI 1.29-1.76; for AG = 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30; for GG = 1.22 95% CI 0.95-1.57). When stratified by CYP24A1 SNPs genotypes, weight gain in adulthood increased postmenopausal BC risk of women with homozygous allele compared to women with heterozygotes allele.Significant interactions of weight change with CYP24A1 polymorphisms suggest CYP24A1 as a potential link between weight change and BC risk and the possibility that the impact of adult weight gain on postmenopausal BC risk may be enhanced by homozygous alleles of CYP24A1 SNPs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697062>High enantiomeric excess D-[methyl-11C]methionine for use as a diagnostic PET radiotracer in bacterial infection.</a></h1><p>Currently, there exists no accurate, non-invasive clinical imaging method to detect living bacteria in vivo. Our goal is to provide a positron emission tomography (PET) method to image infection by targeting bacteria-specific . Standard of care meth-odologies either detect morphologic changes, image immunologic response to infection, or employ invasive tissue sampling with associated patient morbidity. These strategies, however, are not specific for living bacteria and are often inadequate to detect bac-terial infection during fever workup.

Here we report an automated and >99% enantiomeric excess (ee) synthesis of D-[11C]Met from a linear D-homocysteine precursor, a significant improvement over the previously reported synthesis utilizing a D-homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride precursor with approximately 75-85% ee. Furthermore, we took additional steps towards applying D-[11C]Met to infected patients. D-[11C]Met was subject to a panel of clinically relevant bacterial strains and demonstrated promis-ing sensitivity to these pathogens.

Although high salt intake is a proposed risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the relationship between AD and high salt intake has not been clarified. We examined the effect of high-salt challenge on a mouse AD model. Approach and Results: AD was induced in male mice by continuous infusion of β-aminopropionitrile and Ang II (angiotensin II). High-salt challenge exacerbated aortic wall destruction in AD. Deletion of  (IL-17KO [IL (interleukin)-17A knockout]) did not affect the AD phenotype at baseline, but it abolished the high salt-induced worsening of the aortic destruction. Unexpectedly, aortas of IL-17KO mice exhibited global changes in ECM (extracellular matrix)-related genes without alteration of proinflammatory genes, altered architecture of collagen fibers, and reduced stiffness before AD induction. The aortas of IL-17KO mice were less sensitive to AD-inducing stimuli, as shown by the induction of phenotypic modulation markers SMemb and vimentin, suggesting a reduced stress response. The aortas of IL-17KO mice had a higher population of smooth muscle cells with nuclear-localized phosphorylated Smad2, indicative of TGFβ (transforming growth factor-beta) signal activation. Consistently, pretreatment of smooth muscle cells in culture with IL-17A blunted the activation of Smad2 by TGFβ1.These findings indicate that high salt intake has a worsening effect on AD in the context of high aortic wall stiffness, which is under the control of IL-17A through ECM . Therefore, salt restriction may represent a low-cost and practical way to reduce AD risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695927>Mechanisms of action of coffee bioactive components on lipid .</a></h1><p>Coffee consumption is associated with reduced risk of  syndrome, obesity and diabetes, which may be related to the effects of coffee and its bioactive components on lipid . Coffee contains caffeine, a known neuromodulator that acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, as well as other components, such as chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, cafestol and kahweol. Thus, this review discusses the up-to-date knowledge of mechanisms of action of coffee and its bioactive compounds on lipid . Although there is evidence that coffee and/or its bioactive compounds regulate transcription factors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol regulatory element binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. AMP-activated protein kinase) involved in lipogenesis, lipid uptake, transport, fatty acid β-oxidation and/or lipolysis, needs for the understanding of coffee and its effects on lipid  in humans remain to be answered.© The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694152>Acute Ingestion of a Mixed Flavonoid and Caffeine Supplement Increases Energy Expenditure and Fat Oxidation in Adult Women: A Randomized, Crossover Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>This randomized, double-blinded, crossover study measured the acute effect of ingesting a mixed flavonoid-caffeine (MFC) supplement compared to placebo (PL) on energy expenditure (EE) and fat oxidation (FATox) in a  chamber with premenopausal women ( = 19, mean ± SD, age 30.7 ± 8.0 year, BMI 25.7 ± 3.4 kg/m). The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a  chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for  data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696157>Insulin Resistance and Serum Magnesium Concentrations among Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects ∼1 in 10 women worldwide. Hypomagnesemia may worsen insulin resistance (IR) due to the role magnesium (Mg) plays in glucose . This review explores the relation between serum Mg and IR among women with PCOS. A review of primary research focusing on both serum Mg and women with PCOS was conducted from 2011 to 2019. Studies reviewed included human subjects, written in the English language, and limited to community-dwelling women aged ≥18 y. A total of 7 articles were reviewed. The findings from 4 epidemiological analytic studies evaluating serum Mg status suggest there may be a relation between serum Mg concentrations and IR among women with PCOS. However, among the 3 experimental trials, Mg supplementation inconsistently impacted IR among women with PCOS. Women with PCOS are more likely to underconsume Mg-rich foods and have a greater likelihood of lower serum Mg concentrations. Although it remains unclear if dietary Mg and/or supplementation should be a nutritional strategy for all women with PCOS, current research indicates an association between adequate Mg status and improved IR. Further research evaluating dietary interventions and supplementation is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698191>Generation of a PARK2 homozygous knockout induced pluripotent stem cell line (GIBHi002-A-1) with two common isoforms abolished.</a></h1><p>Loss of function mutations in PARK2 (encoding PARKIN) cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD), which often manifests at a juvenile age.

Healing is a complex process and includes many steps that are regulated by coding and noncoding RNAs, proteins and other molecules. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of these small molecule regulators and its function has already been associated with inflammation and angiogenesis during adult healing.Our results showed that NO is also an essential component during embryonic scarless healing and acts via a previously unknown mechanism. NO is mainly produced during the early phase of healing and it is crucial for the expression of genes associated with healing. However, we also observed a late phase of healing, which occurs for several hours after wound closure and takes place under the epidermis and includes tissue remodelling that is dependent on NO. We also found that the NO is associated with multiple cellular  , in particularly the glucose  pathway. This is particular noteworthy as the use of NO donors have already been found to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic healing defects (including those associated with diabetes) and it is possible that its mechanism of action follows those observed during embryonic wound healing.Our study describes a new role of NO during healing, which may potentially translate to improved therapeutic treatments, especially for individual suffering with problematic healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695851>Graphene quantum dots rescue protein dysregulation of pancreatic β-cells exposed to human islet amyloid polypeptide.</a></h1><p>The amyloid aggregation of peptides and proteins is a hallmark of neurological disorders and type 2 diabetes. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix , no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693171>A new mechanism for Cannabidiol in regulating the one-carbon cycle and methionine levels in Dictyostelium and in mammalian epilepsy models.</a></h1><p>Background and Purpose Epidiolex , a form of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) derived from Cannabis plants has demonstrated seizure control activity in patients with Dravet syndrome, without a fully-elucidated mechanism of action. We have employed an unbiased approach to investigate this mechanism at a cellular level. Experimental Approach We use a tractable biomedical model organism, Dictyostelium, to identify protein controlling the effect of CBD and characterize this mechanism. We then translate these results to a Dravet Syndrome mouse model and an acute in vitro seizure model. Key Results CBD activity is partially dependent upon the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system component, GcvH1 in Dictyostelium, orthologous to the human GCSH protein, which is functionally linked to folate one-carbon  (FOCM). Analysis of FOCM components identified a mechanism for CBD in directly inhibiting methionine synthesis. Analysis of brain tissue from a Dravet syndrome mouse model also showed drastically altered levels of one-carbon components including methionine, and an in vitro rat seizure model showed an elevated level of methionine that is attenuated following CBD treatment. Conclusions and Implications Our results suggest a novel mechanism for CBD in the regulating methionine levels, and identify altered one-carbon  in Dravet syndrome and seizure activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, a large number of high-quality transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets for apple were made available to the public, which could be helpful in inferring gene regulatory relationships and thus predicting gene function at the genome level. Through integration of the available apple genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets, we constructed co-expression , identified functional modules, and predicted chromatin states. A total of 112 RNA-seq datasets were integrated to construct a global network and a conditional network (tissue-preferential network). Furthermore, a total of 1,076 functional modules with closely related gene sets were identified to assess the modularity of biological  and further subjected to functional enrichment analysis. The results showed that the function of many modules was related to development, secondary , hormone response, and transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is closely related to epigenetic marks on chromatin. A total of 20 epigenomic datasets, which included ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and DNA methylation analysis datasets, were integrated and used to classify chromatin states. Based on the ChromHMM algorithm, the genome was divided into 620,122 fragments, which were classified into 24 states according to the combination of epigenetic marks and enriched-feature regions. Finally, through the collaborative analysis of different omics datasets, the online database AppleMDO (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/AppleMDO/) was established for cross-referencing and the exploration of possible novel functions of apple genes. In addition, gene annotation information and functional support toolkits were also provided. Our database might be convenient for researchers to develop insights into the function of genes related to important agronomic traits and might serve as a reference for other fruit trees.Copyright © 2019 Da, Liu, Yang, Tian, She, Ma, Xu and Su.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696578>Analysis of the CodY RNome reveals RsaD as a stress-responsive riboregulator of overflow  in Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h1><p>In Staphylococcus aureus, the transcription factor CodY modulates the expression of hundreds of genes, including most virulence factors, in response to the availability of key nutrients like GTP and branched-chain amino acids. Despite numerous studies examining how CodY controls gene expression directly or indirectly, virtually nothing is known about the extent to which CodY exerts its effect through small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Herein, we report the first set of sRNAs under the control of CodY. We reveal that staphylococcal sRNA RsaD is overexpressed> 20-fold in a CodY-deficient strain in three S. aureus clinical isolates and in S. epidermidis. We validated CodY-dependent regulation of rsaD and demonstrate that CodY directly represses rsaD expression by binding the promoter. Using a combination of molecular techniques, we show that RsaD post-transcriptionally regulates alsS (acetolactate synthase) mRNA and enzyme levels. We further show that RsaD redirects carbon overflow , contributing to stationary phase cell death during exposure to weak acid stress. Taken together, our data delineate a role for CodY in controlling sRNA expression in a major human pathogen and indicate that RsaD may integrate nutrient depletion and other signals to mount a response to physiological stress experienced by S. aureus in diverse environments.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693602>The Monocle Sign in FDG-PET: A Sign of Contralateral Facial Nerve Palsy.</a></h1><p>We report three cases of unilateral F-FDG uptake in the orbicularis oculi muscle in subjects with contralateral peripheral facial nerve palsy.

Calculated free and bioavailable testosterone were estimated using an algorithm proposed by the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male.Men diagnosed with MS showed a statistically significant decrease in plasma levels of DHEA in comparison to healthy ones: 11.579 (8.39-15.56) vs 14.014 (9.611-17.125) ng/mL; p = 0.0350, SHBG: 47.46 (35.78-62.83) vs 71.965 (54.45-91.56) nM/L; p<0.0001 and total testosterone: 5.2 (3.8-6.5) vs 6.3 (5.4-8.25) ng/mL; p = 0.0001 (values presented as a median with Q1-Q3).The results suggest that SHBG is a good early marker for  dysregulation in MS, considering its strength of association and significance is comparable to, or better than, those of MS criteria.© 2019 Jarecki et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698145>A review on mPGES-1 inhibitors: From preclinical studies to clinical applications.</a></h1><p>Prostaglandin E (PGE) is a lipid mediator of inflammation and cancer progression. It is mainly formed via  of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and the terminal enzyme microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). Widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX activity, resulting in decreased PGE production and symptomatic relief. However, NSAIDs block the production of many other lipid mediators that have important physiological and resolving actions, and these drugs cause gastrointestinal bleeding and/or increase the risk for severe cardiovascular events. Selective inhibition of downstream mPGES-1 for reduction in only PGE biosynthesis is suggested as a safer therapeutic strategy. This review covers the recent advances in characterization of new mPGES-1 inhibitors in preclinical models and their future clinical applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the lipid moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696669>Aromatase Inhibitors and Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: unconventional therapies for functional hypogonadism?</a></h1><p>Functional hypogonadism increases in prevalence due to ageing as well as an overall increase of obesity. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) could be an alternative for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), but have not yet been established as common clinical practice.We conducted a thorough search of the literature published between 2009 and 2018. Only RCTs published in English were included. We assessed the impact of AIs and SERMs on gonadal steroids, sexual function and semen parameters, body composition and glucose homeostasis, physical function, bone mineral density (BMD), anemia, as well as potential adverse effects.12 RCTs were included, with a total number of 645 patients. 145 men were included in RCTs comparing AIs versus placebo or TRT and 476 men in RCTs with SERMs versus placebo or TRT. One RCT compared AIs versus SERMs in 24 men. Inclusion criteria were heterogenic. Most studies only included a small number of patients (range 11-256) and follow-up time was relatively short (6 weeks to 12 months). AIs as well as SERMs increased serum testosterone levels. Overall, there was no effect on sexual symptoms nor on semen parameters. Following aromatase inhibition, only minimal improvement of body composition and physical function was observed in some of the trials, but spinal BMD decreased. SERMs only induced a small improvement in body composition. The effect of SERMs on physical function and on BMD was not assessed. No major adverse effects occurred.AIs are not recommended as treatment for functional hypogonadism because of insufficient efficacy as well as a decrease in BMD. SERMs might be an alternative for TRT, but more research is needed to evaluate their effect on hypogonadal signs and symptoms, as well as on their long-term safety profile.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694877>The interaction between ABCA1 polymorphism and physical activity on the HDL-cholesterol levels in a Japanese population.</a></h1><p>Few studies have investigated the interactions between HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C)-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association (GWA) study and physical activity (PA) on HDL-C. First, we conducted a sex-stratified GWA study in a discovery sample (2,231 men and 2,431 women) and replication sample (2,599 men and 3,109 women) to identify SNPs influencing log-transformed HDL-C in Japanese participants in the baseline survey of Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. We also replicated previously reported HDL-C-related SNPs in a combined (discovery plus replication) sample (4,830 men and 5,540 women). We then analyzed the interactions of the HDL-C-related SNPs with PA on HDL-C. The sex-stratified GWA analyses identified 11 and 10 HDL-C-related SNPs in men and women as targets for an interaction analysis. Among these, only 1 interaction of ABCA1 rs1883025 with PA was statistically significant in men, after Bonferroni correction (P-interaction = 0.001 [α = 0.05/21 = 0.002]). The per-major-allele (C) increase in log-transformed HDL-C was lost in men with low PA (β = 0.008) compared with those with medium (β = 0.032) or high PA (β = 0.034). These findings suggest that the benefit of carrying a C allele of ABCA1 rs1883025 on enhancing HDL-C may be attenuated in inactive men.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696090>Cell cycle regulatory markers in melanoma: New strategies in diagnosis and treatment.</a></h1><p> Melanoma has been known as an aggressive type of skin cancer in recent years. Reports have distributed the spread rate of melanoma among white skin populations. Also, many studies have mentioned several causes of melanoma. Ultraviolet radiation was represented to be the most important reason for occurrence of melanoma. However, recent studies have found that a combination of factors, such as environmental and genetic factors, can contribute to occurrence of various cancers, specifically melanoma.  Different studies have been conducted on the efficacy of genetic disorders in melanoma. These surveys marked the key role of specific biomarkers in molecular and cellular processes, and investigations have found the expression of several genes in these processes. In addition, aberrant expression of these genes due to mutation and methylation can affect the whole process.  The expression process of these genes is regulated by microRNAs. These new biomolecules have been considered as negative regulators because of managing molecular and cellular processes. MicroRNAs are small conserved regulators attached to their targets leading to rearrangement of gene expression. Adherence of these noncoding RNAs can cause mRNA degradation or inhibit its translation.  Recently, the application of specific genes in melanoma has been studied. In this review, the way melanoma is regulated because of these biomarkers and their demand through cell cycle in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic periods was considered.

However, few reports have focused on the effects of different fatty acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on liver mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) , as well as to investigate cecal microbiota composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15% fat diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of liver ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal microbiota, and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal microbiota may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA.

Bisphosphonates (BPs), as a representative kind of osteoclast inhibitors, are proven to possess excellent osteogenic induction capability. Accordingly, various physical and chemical strategies are developed to functionalize bone tissue scaffolds with BPs to achieve controlled release profiles. Compared with traditional treatment modalities, local release of BPs from these composite scaffolds will contribute to continuous bone integration without the risk of many complications. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of BPs on bone  and analyzes the appropriate concentrations of BPs that promote bone regeneration. The advanced BP loading strategies, implant modification technologies, and BP-loaded composite scaffolds based on different matrices are summarized. Finally, the latest advances and the future development of BP-modified scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration are discussed.

Previous studies have identified mitigation of wear particle-induced inflammation and bone resorption as the main approaches to treat PPO. Recently, wear particle-induced reduction of bone formation around the prosthesis was identified as a major factor in the development of PPO. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a derivative of frankincense, has been shown to play a potential role in bone . However, whether AKBA enhances bone formation in wear particle-induced osteolysis remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether AKBA attenuates titanium particle-induced osteogenic reduction.  Titanium particles were used to induce osteolysis in murine calvaria, and micro-CT and histological analyses were used to evaluate the results. Mouse osteoblast cells, MC3T3-E1 were co-cultured with titanium particles to determine their effect on osteoblast formation .  We demonstrated that AKBA treatment significantly inhibited titanium particle-induced osteogenic inhibition by enhancing osteogenesis both  and . AKBA treatment also enhanced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, decreased the degradation of β-catenin, and increased the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Taken together, these results showed that AKBA treatment attenuated titanium-induced osteogenic inhibition by activating the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.  These findings suggest that AKBA is a promising new target in the prevention and treatment of PPO.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694321>Effect of Heat Stress on Bacterial Composition and  in the Rumen of Lactating Dairy Cows.</a></h1><p>Heat stress negatively impacts the health and milk production of dairy cows, and ruminal microbial populations play an important role in dairy cattle's milk production. Currently there are no available studies that investigate heat stress-associated changes in the rumen microbiome of lactating dairy cattle. Improved understanding of the link between heat stress and the ruminal microbiome may be beneficial in developing strategies for relieving the influence of heat stress on ruminants by manipulating ruminal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites in heat stressed and non-heat stressed dairy cows. Eighteen lactating dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups, one with heat stress and one without heat stress. Dry matter intake was measured and rumen fluid from all cows in both groups was collected. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the ruminal fluid were sequenced, and the rumen pH and the lactate and acetate of the bacterial metabolites were quantified. Heat stress was associated with significantly decreased dry matter intake and milk production. Rumen pH and rumen acetate concentrations were significantly decreased in the heat stressed group, while ruminal lactate concentration increased. The influence of heat stress on the microbial bacterial community structure was minor. However, heat stress was associated with an increase in lactate producing bacteria (e.g.,  and unclassified ), and with an increase in , , and unclassified , all of which utilize soluble carbohydrates as an energy source. The relative abundance of acetate-producing bacterium  decreased during heat stress. We concluded that heat stress is associated with changes in ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites, with more lactate and less acetate-producing species in the population, which potentially negatively affects milk production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695981>Changes in Serum and Urinary Potassium Handling Associated with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.</a></h1><p>Objective This study aimed to (i) compare the extent of urinary potassium (K) excretion in addition to the changes in serum K concentration: and (ii) clarify the association between changes in serum K concentration, urinary K excretion, and acid-base status with or without renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. Methods Six hundred and ninety-one patients with advanced CKD (CKD G3b, 161; G4, 271; G5, 259) were retrospectively evaluated. Differences in serum K concentration, urinary K excretion, and serum sodium and chloride differences (Na-Cl) were compared among patients with RAAS inhibitors, RAAS inhibitors and diuretic agents, and without either medication in each CKD stage. Results Serum K concentrations in patients with RAAS inhibitors were significantly higher than in those with RAAS inhibitors and diuretics in CKD stage G3b and the other two treatment groups in CKD stage G4. Urinary K excretion among the three groups did not differ significantly in each CKD stage. Serum Na-Cl differences in patients with RAAS inhibitors were significantly smaller than in those with RAAS inhibitors and diuretics in CKD stages G3b ( = 0.006) and the other two groups in CKD stage G4 (vs. RAAS inhibitors and diuretics, p <0.001; vs. without either medication,  = 0.008). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that RAAS inhibitor use might be associated with hyperkalemia via not decreased urinary K excretion but rather K redistribution from intracellular to extracellular fluid induced by the progression of  acidosis in patients with advanced CKD, particularly stages G3b and G4.Copyright © 2019, Ueda et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692432>Effects of Aging and Diet on Cardioprotection and Cardiometabolic Risk Markers.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of several diseases increases by age, including cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aging, as a complex process characterized by graduated senescence, triggers various  such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation,  dysfunction, but also telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated autophagy. A better understanding of the senescence underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies for the age-related pathologies and extend the healthy lifespan. Modulating lifestyle risk factors and adopting healthy dietary patterns remain powerful tools which may delay the aging process, decrease age-associated co-morbidities and mortality, increase life expectancy, and, consequently, prevent the development of the cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, such a strategy represents the most cost-effective approach, and the subjects' quality of life may be significantly improved. An integrated, personalized approach targeting at cardiometabolic aging and frailty is suggested in daily clinical practice. However, it should be started from an early age, while there is a need for further well designed and controlled studies in order to elucidate a link between the time of feeding, longevity and cardiovascular prevention.

However, there is little information on the global gene expression of BRs under LT stress in wucai. In this study, the molecular roles of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) after exogenously application, were explored by RNA sequencing under LT conditions.According to the Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, photosynthesis was significantly enriched after spraying EBR under LT. The transcripts encoding the photosystem II (PSII) oxygen-evolving enhancer protein, photosystem I (PSI) subunit, light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes I and II, and ferredoxin were up-regulated after the application of EBR. Transcripts encoding several key enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were also up-regulated, accompanied by significant differences in the contents of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX), Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX), protochlorophyllide (Pchl), and photosynthetic pigments. Notably, transcriptional and physiological analyses revealed that under LT stress, plant responses to EBR involved a major reorientation of photosynthesis, as well as porphyrin and chlorophyll .This study explored the role of EBR as an LT stress tolerance mechanism in wucai.

As they can be influenced by individual genetic background, it is conceivably that the identification of variants in genes potentially involved could be used in genetic testing for the prevention of adverse effects during drug administration. Most genetic studies on severe DHRs have documented HLA alleles as risk factors and some mechanistic models support these associations, which try to shed light on the interaction between drugs and the immune system during lymphocyte presentation. In this sense, drugs are small molecules that behave as haptens, and currently three hypotheses try to explain how they interact with the immune system to induce DHRs: the hapten hypothesis, the direct pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors hypothesis (p-i concept), and the altered self-peptide repertoire hypothesis. The way of interaction will depend on the nature of the drug and its reactivity, the metabolites generated and the specific HLA alleles. However, there is still a need of a better understanding of the different aspects related to the immunological mechanism, the drug determinants that are finally presented as well as the genetic factors for increasing the risk of suffering DHRs. Most available information on the predictive capacity of genetic testing refers to abacavir hypersensitivity and anticonvulsants-induced severe cutaneous reactions.

Spexin, a peptide hormone released from adipose tissue, is the most down-regulated gene in obese, compared to non-obese adipose tissue. Hence, it potentially contributes to the progression and development of  diseases. This study was designed to evaluate serum concentration of spexin in patients with MetS compared to weight-matched and normal-weight controls.  In this case-control study, 153 participants (51 per group) were collected from October 2014 to June 2016. The study groups were all matched for age and sex and included overweight/obese individuals with MetS and 2 control groups without MetS (including weight-matched and normal-weight participants). Body composition and serum concentration of spexin and leptin were measured.  Serum leptin and spexin levels were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in normal-weight compared to overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p< 0.02). No significant difference was observed in serum leptin and spexin concentrations between the overweight/obese groups with/without MetS (p≥ 0.05). Also, spexin, with cutoff value of 4.6, had 78% sensitivity and 82% specificity for diagnosing overweight/obese from normal-weight participants. Spexin had 78% sensitivity and specificity, with cutoff value of 4.35, in diagnosing MetS participants from normal-weight group.

However, research to simultaneously monitor the alterations of transcriptome and proteome between a bacterial pathogen and aquatic animal host through integrated dual RNA-seq and dual iTRAQ of tissue during infection is currently lacking. The important role of a diguanylate cyclase gene (L321_RS15240) in pathogenicity of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida against Epinephelus coioides was suggested by previous dual RNA-seq of our lab. Then L321_RS15240-RNAi strains of P. plecoglossicida were constructed with pCM130/tac, and the mutant with the best silencing effect was selected for follow-up study. The RNAi of L321_RS15240 resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial virulence of P. plecoglossicida. The E. coioides spleens infected by wild type strain or L321_RS15240-RNAi strain of P. plecoglossicida were subjected to dual RNA-seq and dual iTRAQ, respectively. The results showed that: RNAi of L321_RS15240 led to 1)alterations of host transcriptome associated with complement and coagulation cascades, ribosome, arginine and proline , and oxidative phosphorylation; 2)high expression of host proteins which related to phagosome and  responses ( of glutathione, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar); 3)the highly differentially expression of host lncRNAs and miRNAs.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is a multi-domain protein that binds various ligands and aids in their transport, distribution, and  in the circulatory system. In the present study, the HSA-EGCg interaction in the absence or presence of fatty acid has been investigated. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to determine inter- and intra-domain distances in the protein with and without EGCg and palmitic acid (PA). By labeling Cys-34 with 7-(diethyl amino)-4-methylcoumarin 3-maleimide (CPM), the distance between Trp-214 at domain IIA and CPM-Cys-34 at domain IA could be established. A small amount of PA decreased the distance, while a large amount increased the distance up to 5.4 Å. EGCg increased the inter-domain distance in HSA and HSA-PA up to 2.8 and 7.6 Å, respectively. We concluded that PA affects protein conformation more significantly compared to EGCg. Circular dichroism (CD) established that EGCg affects protein secondary structure more significantly than PA. PA had little effect on the α-helix content of HSA, while EGCg decreased the α-helix content in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, EGCg decreased α-helix content in HSA and HSA-PA to the same level. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data revealed that both PA and EGCg increased HSA aggregation. EGCg increased HSA aggregation more significantly and promoted formation of aggregates that were more heterogenous. Any of these effects could impact the ability of serum albumin to transport and stabilize ligands including EGCg and other polyphenols.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693883>Glycogen Dynamics Drives Lipid Droplet Biogenesis during Brown Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h1><p>Browning induction or transplantation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or brown/beige adipocytes derived from progenitor or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can represent a powerful strategy to treat  diseases. However, our poor understanding of the mechanisms that govern the differentiation and activation of brown adipocytes limits the development of such therapy. Various genetic factors controlling the differentiation of brown adipocytes have been identified, although most studies have been performed using in vitro cultured pre-adipocytes. We investigate here the differentiation of brown adipocytes from adipose progenitors in the mouse embryo. We demonstrate that the formation of multiple lipid droplets (LDs) is initiated within clusters of glycogen, which is degraded through glycophagy to provide the  substrates essential for de novo lipogenesis and LD formation. Therefore, this study uncovers the role of glycogen in the generation of LDs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To date, no animal model exists to study mitoribosome composition and mitochondrial translation coordination in mammals in vivo. Here, we create MitoRibo-Tag mice as a tool enabling affinity purification and proteomics analyses of mitoribosomes and their interactome in different tissues.

However, the role of ferroptosis,a newly discovered form of oxidative cell death, has not been evaluated widely.Panx1, an ATP-releasing pathway family, has anti-inflammatory effects during kidneyinjury. Here, we demonstrated that panx1 deletion protected against renal IRI byregulating ferroptotic cell death. In panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI,decreased plasma creatinine, MDA contents in kidney tissue, and tubular cell death(decreased TUNEL positive renal tubular cells) were found compared to those inpanx1 wild type (wt) mice. In cultured human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells, erastin inducedferroptotic lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation were significantly attenuated bysilencing panx1 expression. Moreover, panx1 silencing significantly modulatedferroptosis related protein expression. Furthermore, Panx1 deletion induced theexpression of a cytoprotective chaperone, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), andmodulated the MAPK/ERK pathway. In this study, we first discovered that panx1deletion protects against renal IRI by attenuating MAPK/ERK activation and inducingHO-1 expression in a ferroptotic way. Our findings provide new insights tounderstand the mechanism of panx1 in ferroptotic cell death and highlight a newtherapeutic target for acute kidney injury(AKI) treatment during the perioperativeperiod.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698478>Short-Term Effects of Growth Hormone on Lipolysis, Glucose and Amino Acid  Assessed in Serum and Microdialysate of Healthy Young Men.</a></h1><p>We investigated direct effects of a therapeutic growth hormone dose on lipolysis, glucose and amino acid .This crossover microdialysis trial involved six healthy male volunteers receiving single subcutaneous injections of both growth hormone (0.035 mg/kg) and placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). The investigation comprised three test days with standard diet. The first day served for adaptation, the second and third one for determining study data during 9 night hours with or without growth hormone. Abdominal subcutaneous microdialysate and blood were continuously collected and forwarded to a separate room next door where hourly taken samples were centrifuged and frozen until analysed.Growth hormone achieved the peak serum level after 3 h followed by a plateau-like course for the next 6 h. Glycerol in microdialysate started to rise 2 h following growth hormone injection achieving significance compared to placebo after 9 h (<0.05).

Calcificationpropensitycan be monitored by the maturation time of calciprotein particles in serum (T test). A high calcification propensity (i.e. low T-value) is an independent determinant of mortality in various populations. Aim was to investigate Tlevels with indices of calcium  and disease status in T1DM patients.As part of a prospective cohort study, T1DM patients were examined annually. At baseline T was determined in 216 (77%) patients (57% male) with a mean age of 45 (12) years, diabetes duration 22 [15.8, 30.4] years and HbA1c of 60 (12) mmol/mol (7.6 (1.0) %).

Late diagnosis at an advanced, inoperable stage makes chemotherapy a treatment of choice, yet, with low response rates. The hedgehog signaling pathway (HHSP) is often reactivated in cancer. We identified miR-182-5p as a regulator of GLI2, a transcriptional regulator of the HHSP, and explored the role of the miR-182-5p/GLI2 axis in carcinogenesis and cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Expression of miRNAs and target genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR, expression of the GLI-protein family in LADC and adjacent lung tissue (n=27 pairs) by immunohistochemistry. MiR-182-5p was manipulated, and data were generated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, proliferation/viability, dual-luciferase-, and colony forming assays. MiR-182-5p was down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant LADC cells and directly targeted GLI2. Interference with miR-182-5p or GLI2 silencing resulted in modulation of cell proliferation, clonogenic potential, and cisplatin-sensitivity. HHSP was markedly reactivated in LADC tissue compared to adjacent non-malignant lung tissue. Our results indicate that the miR-182-5p/GLI2 axis modulates tumorigenesis and cisplatin-resistance in LADC cells, by influencing the HHSP. Therefore, this axis might be considered as a potential biomarker and future therapeutic target in LADC patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor  involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1α in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacological (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-Glucose, U-13C-Glutamine and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative , which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genetic interference with PGC1α rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CREB regulates the expression of PGC1α in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and beta-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity. Collectively, we have unraveled the mechanistic underpinnings of c-MET inhibition and identified novel combination therapies that may enhance its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695560>Ginseng extracts modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics of live cardiomyoblasts: a functional comparison of different extraction solvents.</a></h1><p>The root of , a member of Araliaceae family, has been used as herbal medicine and functional food in Asia for thousands of years. According to Traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng is the most widely used "Qi-invigorating" herbs, which provides tonic and preventive effects by resisting oxidative stress, influencing energy , and improving mitochondrial function. Very few reports have systematically measured cell mitochondrial bioenergetics after ginseng treatment.Here, H9C2 cell line, a rat cardiomyoblast, was treated with ginseng extracts having extracted using solvents of different polarity, i.e., water, 50% ethanol, and 90% ethanol, and subsequently, the oxygen consumption rate in healthy and -butyl hydroperoxide-treated live cultures was determined by Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.The 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng possessed the strongest antioxidative and tonic activities to mitochondrial respiration and therefore provided the best protective effects to H9C2 cardiomyocytes. By increasing the spare respiratory capacity of stressed H9C2 cells up to three-folds of that of healthy cells, the 90% ethanol extracts of ginseng greatly improved the tolerance of myocardial cells to oxidative damage.These results demonstrated that the low polarity extracts of ginseng could be the best extract, as compared with others, in regulating the oxygen consumption rate of cultured cardiomyocytes during mitochondrial respiration.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695789>Yin Yang 1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma cell lipid  and tumor progression by inhibiting PGC-1β-induced fatty acid oxidation.</a></h1><p>Lipid accumulation is a driving force in tumor development, as it provides tumor cells with both energy and the building blocks of phospholipids for construction of cell membranes. Aberrant homeostasis of lipid  has been observed in various tumors; however, the molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated.  Yin yang 1 (YY1) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was analyzed using clinical specimens, and its roles in HCC in lipid  were examined using gain- and loss-of function experiments. The mechanism of YY1 regulation on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) and its downstream genes medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were investigated using molecular biology and biochemical methods. The role of YY1/ PGC-1β axis in hepatocarcinogenesis was studied using xenograft experiment.  This study showed that YY1 suppresses fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to increase of cellular triglyceride level and lipid accumulation in HCC cells, and subsequently induction of the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells. Molecular mechanistic study revealed that YY1 blocks the expression of , an activator of fatty acid β-oxidation, by directly binding to its promoter; and thus downregulates PGC-1β/MCAD and PGC1-β/LCAD axis. Importantly, we revealed that YY1 inhibition on  occurs irrespective of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α), enabling it to promote lipid accumulation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of developing type II diabetes and intensifies pathophysiological processes during the development of type I diabetes. Tobacco smoke is also additional source of free radicals. Moreover, smoking causes variety of adverse effects on organs, that have no direct contact with the tobacco smoke itself. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of tobacco smoke on the serum concentrations of relevant oxidative stress markers such as total protein (TP), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as renal (creatinine, urea) and liver function (alkaline phosphatase, ALP; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST) among animals with induced diabetes after administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, ip).The markers of oxidative stress and biochemical parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods. As a biomarker of exposure to tobacco smoke, cotinine was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD).Tobacco smoke exposure of diabetic rats was manifested by significantly elevated liver enzymes activity - ALT (p < 0.05) and ALP (p < 0.01), higher creatinine and urea concentration (p < 0.01), lower GSH amount (p < 0.05), and higher GST activity (p < 0.05).Tobacco smoking induce liver and renal damage through the mechanisms including increased oxidative stress.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

However, how mA writers attain substrate specificities remains unclear. We report the 3.1 Å-resolution crystal structure of human CCHC zinc finger-containing protein ZCCHC4, a 28S rRNA-specific mA methyltransferase, bound to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The methyltransferase (MTase) domain of ZCCHC4 is packed against N-terminal GRF-type and C2H2 zinc finger domains and a C-terminal CCHC domain, creating an integrated RNA-binding surface. Strikingly, the MTase domain adopts an autoinhibitory conformation, with a self-occluded catalytic site and a fully-closed cofactor pocket. Mutational and enzymatic analyses further substantiate the molecular basis for ZCCHC4-RNA recognition and a role of the stem-loop structure within substrate in governing the substrate specificity. Overall, this study unveils unique structural and enzymatic characteristics of ZCCHC4, distinctive from what was seen with the METTL family of mA writers, providing the mechanistic basis for ZCCHC4 modulation of mA RNA methylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693892>Metformin Improves Mitochondrial Respiratory Activity through Activation of AMPK.</a></h1><p>Impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity contributes to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-fat- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in obesity. We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration. These findings suggest a mechanism for metformin's anti-tumor effects.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of  and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better  profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia.

In this paper, an integrated metabolomic method was presented for a systematic discovery of potential active components in Fangji Huangqi Tang (FHT), a well-known TCM prescription for nephrotic syndrome treatment, based on "correlations between chemical and  profiles." Firstly, a metabolomics study was carried out to select representative biomarkers of nephrotic syndrome. Then, after drug administration, the dynamic process of serum composition was investigated by the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) technique to detect the prototypes and related metabolites of relative components from FHT. Pearson correlation analysis was finally used to find out the correlations between the endogenous  spectrums and the chemical serum spectrums. As a result, 17 biomarkers for nephrotic syndrome indication were identified, and the main   of their concern included linoleic acid ; cyanoamino acid ; alpha-linolenic acid ; glycine, serine, and threonine ; arachidonic acid ; and glycerophospholipid .

Diagnosis of asymptomatic people to assess the risk for development of DM should be done in overweight or obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m) of any age along with person having one or more additional risk factors like physical inactivity, first degree relative with DM, high risk race/ethnicity, hypertension etc.To correlate glycated hemoglobin (HbA) levels with body mass index (BMI) and waist hip ratio (WHR) in prediabetic patients.The present case control study was performed at Pt. B. D. Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak includes thirty prediabetic patients of age group 20-40 years diagnosed on the basis of HbA (5.7-6.4%). Thirty healthy and age matched control were taken. After taking written consent, they were subjected to physical examination and anthropometric measurements as per protocol and findings were noted. Venous blood sample was withdrawn for estimation of HbA levels.The correlation coefficient between BMI (27.01 ± 2.91 kg/m) and HbA (5.94 ± 0.21%) is r = 0.583 with p value = 0.001 and between WHR (0.87 ± 0.38) & HbA is r = 0.495 with p value = 0.005. Both BMI & WHR are positively correlated with HbA.Obesity is a risk factor for glycation of hemoglobin & hence, it is an effective measure for prevention of prediabetes and diabetes.Copyright © 2019 International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC).

However, till date, the role of RecA in the deadly foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes remains unknown. In this study, the authors show that L. monocytogenes expresses recA more than two-fold in vivo upon exposure to the DNA damaging agents, methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet radiation. The purified L. monocytogenes RecA protein show robust binding to single stranded DNA. The RecA is capable of forming displacement loop and hydrolyzes ATP, whereas the mutant LmRecA fails to hydrolyze ATP, showing conserved walker A and B motifs. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes RecA and LmRecA perform the DNA strand transfer activity, which is the hallmark feature of RecA protein with an oligonucleotide-based substrate. Notably, L. monocytogenes RecA readily cleaves L. monocytogenes LexA, the SOS regulon and protects the presynaptic filament from the exonuclease I activity. Altogether, this study provides the first detailed characterization of L. monocytogenes RecA and presents important insights into the process of homologous recombination in the gram-positive foodborne bacteria L. monocytogenes.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, energy  in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high-fat diet (60% fat; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved  homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous fat tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired  compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696297>Recent progress in nanomaterial-based electrochemical and optical sensors for hypoxanthine and xanthine.

Sequential  abnormalities accompanying glucotoxicity are some of its implications. Glucotoxicity most likely corresponds to the vascular intricacy and  alterations, such as increased oxidation of free fatty acids and reduced glucose oxidation. More than half of those with diabetes also develop cardiac abnormalities due to unknown causes, posing a major threat to the currently available marketed preparations which are being used for treating these cardiac complications. Even though impairment in cardiac functioning is the principal cause of death in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), reducing plasma glucose levels has little effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of sodium glucose transporter (SGLT) represent a putative therapeutic intervention for these pathological conditions. Several clinical trials have reported the efficacy of SGLT inhibitors as a novel and potent anti-diabetic agent which along with its anti-hyperglycaemic activity possesses the potential of effectively treating its associated cardiac abnormalities. Thus, hereby, the present review highlights the role of SGLT inhibitors as a successful drug candidate for correcting the shifts in deregulation of cardiac energy substrate  together with its role in treating diabetes related cardiac perturbations.© 2019 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695748> exhibiting a modified route for uptake and catabolism of glycerol forms significant amounts of ethanol from this carbon source considered as 'non-fermentable'.</a></h1><p>Due to its inevitable formation during biodiesel production and its relatively high degree of reduction, glycerol is an attractive carbon source for microbial fermentation processes. However, glycerol is catabolized in a fully respiratory manner by the eukaryotic platform organism . We previously engineered   strains to favor fermentative  of glycerol by replacing the native FAD-dependent glycerol catabolic pathway with the NAD-dependent 'DHA pathway'. In addition, a heterologous aquaglyceroporin (Fps1 homolog) was expressed to facilitate glycerol uptake. The current study was launched to scrutinize the formation of 's natural fermentation product ethanol from glycerol caused by the conducted genetic modifications. This understanding is supposed to facilitate future engineering of this yeast for fermenting glycerol into valuable products more reduced than ethanol.A strain solely exhibiting the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement produced ethanol at concentrations close to the detection limit. The expression of the heterologous aquaglyceroporin caused significant ethanol production (8.5 g L from 51.5 g L glycerol consumed) in a strain catabolizing glycerol via the DHA pathway but not in the wild-type background. A reduction of oxygen availability in the shake flask cultures further increased the ethanol titer up to 15.7 g L (from 45 g L glycerol consumed).The increased yield of cytosolic NADH caused by the glycerol catabolic pathway replacement seems to be a minimal requirement for the occurrence of alcoholic fermentation in   growing in synthetic glycerol medium. The remarkable  switch to ethanol formation in the DHA pathway strain with the heterologous aquaglyceroporin supports the assumption of a much stronger influx of glycerol accompanied by an increased rate of cytosolic NADH production via the DHA pathway. The fact that a reduction of oxygen supply increases ethanol production in DHA pathway strains is in line with the hypothesis that a major part of glycerol in normal shake flask cultures still enters the catabolism in a respiratory manner.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692782>Sesamol intervention ameliorates obesity-associated  disorders by regulating hepatic lipid  in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Obesity has currently become a serious social problem to be solved. Sesamol, a natural bioactive substance extracted from sesame oil, has shown multiple physiological functions, and it might have an effect on the treatment of obesity.This study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of sesamol on the treatment of obesity and  disorders in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.C57BL/6J male mice were fed HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by supplementation with sesamol (100 mg/kg body weight [b.w.]/day [d] by gavage) for another 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and liver. Chemistry reagent kits were used to measure serum lipids, hepatic lipids, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. ELISA kits were used to determine the serum insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels involved in lipid  in the liver.Sesamol significantly reduced the body weight gain of obese mice and suppressed lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver. Sesamol also improved serum and hepatic lipid profiles, and increased insulin sensitivity. In the sesamol-treated group, the levels of serum ALT and AST decreased significantly. Furthermore, after sesamol treatment, the hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1c) decreased, while the phosphorylated hormone sensitive lipase (p-HSL), the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC1α) increased, which were responsible for the fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid β-oxidation, respectively.Sesamol had a positive effect on anti-obesity and ameliorated the  disorders of obese mice.

It is currently undergoing clinical trial in China as an antidepressant.In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole time-of-flight mass tandem mass spectrometry method was established to identify the metabolites of PPD in human plasma and urine following oral administration in phase IIa clinical trial.A total of 40 metabolites in human plasma and urine were identified using this method. Four metabolites identified were isolated from rat feces, and two of them were analyzed by NMR to elucidate the exact structures. The structures of isolated compounds were confirmed as (20,24)-epoxydammarane-12,23,25-triol-3-one and (20,24)-epoxydammarane-3,12,23,25-tetrol.

However, the mechanistic  principles remain poorly understood. In the framework of a multi-organ investigation of age-associated changes of ceramide species, a unique and distinctive change pattern of C and C ceramide species was detected in aged skeletal muscle. Consistently, the expression of CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA, encoding the ceramide synthases (CerS) with substrate preference for C and C acyl chains, respectively, was down-regulated in skeletal muscle of aged mice. Similarly, an age-dependent decline of both CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was observed in skeletal muscle biopsies of humans. Moreover, CerS1 and CerS5 mRNA expression was also reduced in muscle biopsies from patients in advanced stage of chronic heart failure (CHF) suffering from muscle wasting and frailty. The possible impact of CerS1 and CerS5 on muscle function was addressed by reversed genetic analysis using CerS1 and CerS5 knockout mice. Skeletal muscle from mice deficient of either CerS1 or CerS5 showed reduced caliber sizes of both slow (type 1) and fast (type 2) muscle fibers, fiber grouping, and fiber switch to type 1 fibers. Moreover, CerS1- and CerS5-deficient mice exhibited reduced twitch and tetanus forces of musculus extensor digitorum longus. The findings of this study link CerS1 and CerS5 to histopathological changes and functional impairment of skeletal muscle in mice that might also play a functional role for the aging skeletal muscle and for age-related muscle wasting disorders in humans.© 2019 The Authors.

Blood samples were collected and analysed for glucose, insulin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and leptin.Seventeen participants (10 females and 7 males; age 24 ± 6.8 years; BMI 22.9 ± 2.5 kg/m2) participated in the study. The total area under the curve (AUC) values of glucose, insulin, active GLP-1 and leptin were similar for the aspartame and sucralose treatment groups compared to the baseline values in healthy participants. There was no change in insulin sensitivity after NNS treatment compared to the baseline values.These findings suggest that daily repeated consumption of pure sucralose or aspartame for 2 weeks had no effect on glucose  among normoglycaemic adults. However, these results need to be tested in studies with longer durations.

Acromegaly is a rare disorder caused by overproduction of growth hormone (GH) and is associated with functional and structural differentiation of adipose and muscle tissues. Acromegalic subjects are also at risk of vascular diseases and  dysfunctions. We aimed to determine the altered levels of irisin in subjects with active acromegaly and controlled acromegaly and in controls, and to ascertain whether there is an association between irisin and hormonal and cardiometabolic parameters.We enrolled 40 subjects with active acromegaly, 30 subjects with controlled acromegaly, and 40 control subjects of matched age, gender, BMI, and occurrence of hypertension, diabetes, and  syndrome distribution in the present cross-sectional study. Hormonal and  parameters, carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), and epicardial fat thickness (EFT) of the subjects were evaluated. Irisin levels were measured using ELISA.Circulating levels of irisin were significantly higher in acromegalic subjects compared to both controlled acromegalic subjects and controls. Moreover, irisin levels were elevated in controlled acromegalic subjects compared to controls. Irisin displayed a positive correlation with insulin resistance, cIMT, EFT, BMI, GH, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in acromegalic subjects. Irisin levels were independently associated with cIMT and EFT according to multiple regression analyses. There was an independent relationship between irisin and IGF-1.Elevated irisin levels in acromegalic subjects were associated with cIMT and EFT, suggesting that irisin is a surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk in acromegalic subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697995>Engineering unnatural methylotrophic cell factories for methanol-based biomanufacturing: Challenges and opportunities.</a></h1><p>Methanol is a very promising feedstock alternative to sugar-based raw materials for biomanufacturing because it does not compete with food production, is abundant and potentially sustainable in the future.

The maximum two-photon absorption cross-section values (δ) of the developed probe increased from 115 ± 16 GM to 188 ± 27 GM, after the probe was chelated with Zn. The emission spectrum of TEO-MPVQ probe increased and red-shifted about 60 nm, resulting in the ratiometric determination of Zn with high sensitivity and selectivity. The present fluorescent probe also demonstrated good biocompatibility, high spatial resolution and deep penetration depth for Zn detection. Accordingly, TEO-MPVQ was able to track the endogenous Zn release in neurons and also successfully applied for larval zebrafish imaging.

Relevant and reliable animal models in which muscle wasting can be monitored non-invasively over time are instrumental to investigate and develop new therapies. In this work, we developed a fully automatic deep learning algorithm for segmentation of micro cone beam CT (µCBCT) images of the lower limb muscle complex in mice, and subsequent muscle mass calculation. A deep learning algorithm was trained on manually segmented data from 32 mice. Muscle wet mass measurements were obtained of 47 mice and served as a dataset for model validation and the reverse model validation. The automatic algorithm performance was approximately 150 times faster than manual segmentation. Reverse validation of the algorithm showed high quantitative metrics substantiating the robustness and accuracy of the model, i.e. a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.93, a Hausdorff distance of 0.4 mm, and a center-of-mass displacement of 0.1 mm. A high correlation (R=0.92) was obtained between the CT-derived muscle mass measurements and the muscle wet masses. Longitudinal follow-up revealed time-dependent changes in muscle mass that separated control from lung tumor bearing mice, which was confirmed as cachexia. In conclusion, this deep learning model for automated assessment of the lower limb muscle complex provides highly accurate non-invasive longitudinal evaluation of skeletal muscle mass. Furthermore, it facilitates the workflow and increases the amount of data derived from mouse studies, while reducing the animal numbers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694077>Regulation of Systemic Glucose Homeostasis by T Helper Type 2 Cytokines.</a></h1><p>Obesity results in an inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissue, leading to the deterioration of tissue protective mechanisms. Although recent studies suggested the importance of type 2 immunity in an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in adipose tissue, the regulatory effects of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines on systemic  regulation are not fully understood. Recently, we identified the roles of the Th2 cytokine (interleukin 4 [IL-4] and IL-13)-induced adipokine, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), in adipose tissue in regulating systemic glucose  via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation.

This pilot study investigated behavioural parameters in relation to blood metabolites and trace elements in a cohort of 10 typically developed controls (TC) and 17 children with ASD at baseline and following a 3-month treatment with a modified KD regimen. A non-targeted, multiplatform metabolomics approach was employed, including Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Associations between plasma metabolites, trace elements, and behavior scores were investigated. Employing a combination of metabolomics platforms, 118 named metabolites and 73 trace elements were assessed. Relative to TC, a combination of glutamate, galactonate, and glycerol discriminated ASD with 88% accuracy. ASD had higher concentrations of galactose intermediates, gut microbe-derived trimethylamine N-oxide and N-acetylserotonin, and lower concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate and selenium at baseline. Following 3mo KD intervention, levels of circulating ketones and acetylcarnitine were increased. KD restored lower selenium levels in ASD to that of controls and correlation analysis identified a novel negative correlation between changes in selenium and behaviour scores. Based on the different behavior responses to the KD, we found that high responders had greater concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate and ornithine, with lower galactose. These findings enhance our current understanding of  derangements present in ASD and may be of utility in predicting favorable responses to KD intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697807>AMP-activated protein kinase links acetyl-CoA homeostasis to BRD4 recruitment in acute myeloid leukemia.</a></h1><p>Altered  fuels two hallmark properties of cancer cells, unlimited proliferation and differentiation blockade. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of bioenergetics crucial for glucose  in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its inhibition delays leukemogenesis, but whether the  function of AMPK alters the AML epigenome remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that AMPK maintains the epigenome of MLL-rearranged AML by linking acetyl-CoA homeostasis to BET protein recruitment to chromatin. AMPK deletion reduced acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation, displacing BET proteins from chromatin in leukemia-initiating cells. In both mouse and patient-derived xenograft AML models, treating with AMPK and BET inhibitors synergistically suppressed AML.

Compared to the intensively investigated transcriptome and proteome, the  response to heat stress is not sufficiently characterized. Mitochondria have been recognized to play an essential role in heat stress tolerance. Given the compartmentalization of the cell, it is not clear if the heat stress-induced  response occurs in mitochondria or in the cytosol. Therefore, a compartment-specific metabolite analysis was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced  response in mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In this work, the isolated mitochondria and the cytoplasm of yeast cells grown at permissive temperature and cells adapting to heat stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Over a hundred metabolites could be identified, covering amino acid , energy , arginine , purine and pyrimidine , and others. Highly accumulated citrulline and reduced arginine suggested remodeled arginine . A stable isotope-labeled experiment was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced  remodeling of the arginine , identifying activated  ornithine biosynthesis to support arginine and spermidine synthesis. The short-term increased spermidine and trehalose suggest their important roles as heat stress markers.

However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high-fat diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced lipid  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal lipid  and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle.

Modulation of the appetite-regulating hormone ghrelin may explain suppression of insulin secretion and weight loss observed in previous studies with fish protein hydrolysates.This study aimed to assess the effect of a single, low dose of cod protein hydrolysate (CPH) before a breakfast meal on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration and sensations associated with appetite in healthy subjects.In this explorative trial with a crossover design, 41 healthy individuals (15 males and 26 females, age 51 ± 6 years) completed 2 study days separated by 4-7 days of washout. On both study days, a test drink containing 20 mg CPH or casein (control) per kg body weight was given immediately before a standardized breakfast meal. Acylated ghrelin concentrations were measured before test drink/breakfast (baseline) and at time 0, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min postprandially. Sensations associated with appetite were measured by a Visual Analog Scale (100 mm) at baseline and 0, 20, 40, and 180 min postprandially.Statistically, no difference was observed between CPH and control for postprandial acylated ghrelin concentrations (mean difference geometric mean: 1.05 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.13,  = 0.266), or between the total area under the curve (tAUC) for acylated ghrelin after CPH (tAUC = 17518 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-47941) and control (tAUC = 17272 pg/mL × min, 95% CI: 0-48048,  = 0.991). No differences were found between CPH and control for sensation of appetite, according to tAUC of postprandial scores for satiety ( = 0.794) and the feeling of fullness ( = 0.996).We did not find an effect of a single dose of CPH on postprandial concentrations of acylated ghrelin or sensations related to feeling of hunger, compared to control. Further studies should aim to evaluate the effect of a supplement with CPH given daily over a period of time.© 2019 Hanna Fjeldheim Dale et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694658>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids status and cognitive function in young women.</a></h1><p>Research indicates that low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) may be associated with decreased cognitive function. This study examined the association between n-3 PUFA status and cognitive function in young Australian women.This was a secondary outcome analysis of a cross-sectional study that recruited 300 healthy women (18-35 y) of normal weight (NW: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m) or obese weight (OB: BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Participants completed a computer-based cognition testing battery (IntegNeuro™) evaluating the domains of impulsivity, attention, information processing, memory and executive function. The Omega-3 Index (O3I) was used to determine n-3 PUFA status (percentage of EPA (20:5n-3) plus DHA (22:6n3) in the red cell membrane) and the participants were divided into O3I tertile groups: T1 < 5.47%, T2 = 5.47-6.75%, T3 > 6.75%. Potential confounding factors of BMI, inflammatory status (C-reactive Protein), physical activity (total MET-min/wk), alpha1-acid glycoprotein, serum ferritin and hemoglobin, were assessed. Data reported as z-scores (mean ± SD), analyses via ANOVA and ANCOVA.Two hundred ninety-nine women (26.9 ± 5.4 y) completed the study (O3I data, n = 288). The ANOVA showed no overall group differences but a significant group × cognition domain interaction (p < 0.01). Post hoc tests showed that participants in the low O3I tertile group scored significantly lower on attention than the middle group (p = 0.01; ES = 0.45 [0.15-0.74]), while the difference with the high group was borderline significant (p = 0.052; ES = 0.38 [0.09-0.68]). After confounder adjustments, the low group had lower attention scores than both the middle (p = 0.01) and high (p = 0.048) groups. These findings were supported by univariate analyses which found significant group differences for the attention domain only (p = 0.004).Cognitive function in the attention domain was lower in women with lower O3I, but still within normal range. This reduced but normal level of cognition potentially provides a lower baseline from which cognition would decline with age. Further investigation of individuals with low n-3 PUFA status is warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694512>Changes in the  of Sphingoid Bases in the Brain and Spinal Cord of Transgenic FUS(1-359) Mice, a Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the content of sphingoid bases - sphingosine (SPH), sphinganine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPH-1-P) - and in expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in their  in the brain structures (hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum) and spinal cord of transgenic FUS(1-359) mice. FUS(1-359) mice are characterized by motor impairments and can be used as a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Lipids from the mouse brain structures and spinal cord after 2, 3, and 4 months of disease development were analyzed by chromatography/mass spectrometry, while changes in the expression of the SPHK1, SPHK2, SGPP2, SGPL1, ASAH1, and ASAH2 genes were assayed using RNA sequencing. The levels of SPH and sphinganine (i.e., sphingoid bases with pronounced pro-apoptotic properties) were dramatically increased in the spinal cord at the terminal stage of the disease. The ratio of the anti-apoptotic SPH-1-P to SPH and sphinganine sharply reduced, indicating massive apoptosis of spinal cord cells. Significant changes in the content of SPH and SPH-1-P and in the expression of genes related to their  were found at the terminal ALS stage in the spinal cord. Expression of the SGPL gene (SPH-1-P lyase) was strongly activated, while expression of the SGPP2 (SPH-1-P phosphatase) gene was reduced.

Acetate is a short chain fatty acid derived from AA oxidation, and acetate levels were significantly higher in urine collected overnight with food provided  compared with urine collected after 9 h fasting. Feeding increases gastrointestinal blood flow, and thus, we explored the direct effects of AA (and acetate) in isolated murine superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Over the concentration range of 1-100 mM, AA strongly, and reversibly relaxed agonist-induced contractions of SMA including phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane A analog (U46,619) and high potassium (High K) without toxicity. The sensitivity (EC) but not the efficacy (>90% relaxation of PE-precontraction) of AA-induced relaxations was dependent on blood vessel (SMA was 3× more sensitive than aorta) and contractile agonist (PE EC = 3.3 ± 0.4 mM; U46,619 EC = 14.9 ± 1.5 mM; and High K EC = 17.7 ± 0.5 mM) yet independent of circadian cycle and sex. The most sensitive component of the AA-induced relaxation was inhibited significantly by: (1) a mechanically impaired endothelium; (2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME); and (3) a guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor (ODQ). Both acetate and EtOH stimulated much weaker relaxations in SMA than did AA, yet these relaxations were significantly inhibited by L-NAME as well. Neither EtOH nor acetate relaxed pre-contracted aorta. Although neither cyanamide, a non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme inhibitor, nor Alda-1, a specific activator of ALDH2 activity, had any effect on either sensitivity or efficacy of AA-induced relaxation in SMA, cyanamide significantly blocked both EtOH- and acetate-induced relaxations in SMA implicating a role of ALDH activity in vasorelaxation. These data show that AA relaxes SMA via an endothelium- and NO-dependent mechanism indicating that AA may be one component of the complex post-prandial hyperemia reflex via vasodilatation of mesenteric vasculature.Copyright © 2019 Jin, Lorkiewicz, Malovichko, Bhatnagar, Srivastava and Conklin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697972>Insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study.</a></h1><p>MSDC-0602K is a novel insulin sensitizer designed to preferentially target the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier while minimizing direct binding to the transcriptional factor PPARγ. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSDC-0602K in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis (F1-F3) were randomized to daily oral placebo, or 1 of 3 MSDC-0602K doses in a 52-week double-blind study. The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis, NASH resolution, and fibrosis reduction. Exploratory endpoints included changes in insulin sensitivity, liver injury and liver fibrosis markers.Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94), or 62.5 mg (n = 99), 125 mg (n = 98), or 250 mg (n = 101) of MSDC-0602K. At baseline, glycated hemoglobin was 6.4 ± 1.0%, 61.5% of patients had fibrosis F2/F3 and the average NAS was 5.3. The primary endpoint was reached in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9% and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg dose arms, respectively, with adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.44-1.81), 1.22 (95% CI 0.60-2.48), and 1.64 (95% CI 0.83-3.27). The 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K led to significant reductions in glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, liver enzymes and NAS compared to placebo. The incidence of hypoglycemia and PPARγ-agonist-associated events such as edema and fractures were similar in the placebo and MSDC-0602K groups.MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on primary and secondary liver histology endpoints. However, effects on non-invasive liver cell injury and measures of glucose  support further exploration of MSDC-0602K's safety and potential efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes and liver injury. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ].First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia. MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects. We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on liver histology with the biopsy techniques used. However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without dose-limiting side effects.Copyright © 2019.

Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a lipid signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases, lipid transfer proteins and  enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between  and mitochondrial dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694276>Computed and Subjective Blue Scleral Color Analysis as a Diagnostic Tool for Iron Deficiency: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency. ID diagnosis requires ferritin measurement because clinical findings are poor and nonspecific. We studied the diagnostic value of blue sclera, which was scarcely reported as a specific and sensitive sign of ID. We enrolled 74 patients suspected of having ID. Pictures of their eyes were taken using a smartphone under similar daylight conditions. Three independent physicians graded the scleral color, and a computer analysis yielded the blue percentile of the sclera image. Final analysis included 67 patients (mean age 59.9 ± 20.1 years). Fifty-one had ID. Subjective blue scleral color was associated with ID for physician 1 (64.5% vs. 86.1%,  = 0.03). Sensitivity was 60.8% (CI95: 46.1%; 74.2%), specificity 68.8% (CI95: 41.3%; 89%), and positive predictive value 86.1% (CI95: 70.5%; 95.3%). A marginal difference was observed for other physicians ( = 0.05). Computer analysis showed higher blue in the ID group ( = 0.04). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.7 (0.54; 0.85). Sensitivity was 78.4% (CI95: 63.7%; 88.7%), specificity was 50% (CI95: 24.7%; 75.3%). Assessment of blue sclera was not influenced by iris color, sex, or anemia. We showed that blue sclera has good positive predictive value for ID diagnosis, and computer analysis was correlated to clinical assessment. Improvement of this innovative, non-invasive method could provide an easy handling and inexpensive diagnosis tool for ID.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693096>The Autophagy-Related Protein GABARAP Is Induced during Overwintering in the Bean Bug (Hemiptera: Alydidae).</a></h1><p>In most insects dependent on food resources that deplete seasonally, mechanisms exist to protect against starvation. Insects overcome periods of food depletion using diapause-associated physiological mechanisms, such as increased energy resources in fat bodies and suppression of . Because autophagy supplies energy resources through the degradation of intracellular components, we hypothesized that it might be an additional strategy to combat starvation during overwintering. In this study, we measured the abundance of the proteins involved in the signaling pathway of autophagy during overwintering in adults of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), which must withstand the periodic depletion of its host plants from late fall to early spring. Although the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) markedly increased after the cessation of food supply, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) were not found to be associated with food depletion. Thus, food depletion appears to induce autophagy independent of AMPK and TOR. The GABARAP levels significantly increased universally when the food supply ceased, irrespective of the diapause status of adults and low-temperature conditions. In overwintering diapause adults under seminatural conditions, the GABARAP levels significantly increased during early spring. Thus, autophagy appears to assist the survival of the bean bugs under natural conditions of food deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we studied MTHFR tagging polymorphisms in 584 HCC cases and 923 controls. Polymerase chain reaction was harnessed to detect MTHFR genotype. Overall, our results showed that genotype distribution of MTHFR rs4846048 and rs4845882 polymorphisms was not different between HCC patients and controls. MTHFR rs9651118 and rs1801133 loci were protective factors for HCC (rs9651118: CT vs. TT: adjusted OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90, P=0.008 and TC/CC vs. TT: adjusted OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.53-0.93, P=0.015; rs1801133: GA vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97, P=0.031, AA/GA vs. GG: adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.57-0.99, P=0.045).

FENDRR expression in lung tissues from patients with IPF and mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Iron-responsive element-binding protein 1 (IRP1), a protein partner of FENDDR, was identified by RNA pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation. The interaction region between FENDRR and IRP1 was determined by cross-linking immunoprecipitation. The in vivo role of FENDRR in pulmonary fibrosis was studied using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in mice.The expression of FENDRR was down-regulated in fibrotic human and mouse lungs as well as primary lung fibroblasts isolated from bleomycin-treated mice. TGFβ1-SMAD3 signaling inhibited FENDRR expression in lung fibroblasts. FENDRR was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm of adult lung fibroblasts and bound IRP1, suggesting its role in iron . FENDRR reduced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast activation by reducing iron level and acting as a competing endogenous RNA of the profibrotic miR-214. Adenovirus-mediated FENDRR gene transfer in the mouse lung attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and improved lung function.Our data suggest that FENDRR is an anti-fibrotic lncRNA and a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695785>The use of micelles to deliver potential hedgehog pathway inhibitor for the treatment of liver fibrosis.</a></h1><p> Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays an essential role in liver fibrosis by promoting the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by enhancing their  via yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Despite the presence of several inhibitors, Hh signaling cannot be controlled exclusively due to their poor efficacy and the lack of a suitable delivery system to the injury site. Therefore, it is rationale to develop new potent Hh inhibitors and suitable delivery carriers.  Based on the structure and activity of Hh inhibitor GDC-0449, we replaced its sulfonamide group with two methylpyridine-2yl at amide nitrogen to synthesize MDB5. We compared the Hh pathway inhibition and anti-fibrotic effect of MDB5 with GDC-0449 in vitro. Next, we developed MDB5 loaded micelles using our methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-blockpoly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol (PEG-PCC-g-DC) copolymer and characterized for physicochemical properties. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of MDB5 loaded micelles in common bile duct ligation (CBDL) induced liver fibrosis, mouse model. We also determined the intrahepatic distribution of fluorescently labeled micelles after MDB5 treatment.  Our results show that MDB5 was more potent in inhibiting Hh pathway components and HSC proliferation in vitro. We successfully developed MDB5 loaded micelles with particle size of 40 ± 10 nm and drug loading up to 10% w/w. MDB5 loaded micelles at the dose of 10 mg/kg were well tolerated by mice, without visible sign of toxicity. The serum enzyme activities elevated by CBDL was significantly decreased by MDB5 loaded micelles compared to GDC-0449 loaded micelles. MDB5 loaded micelles further decreased collagen deposition, HSC activation, and Hh activity and its target genes in the liver. MDB5 loaded micelles also prevented liver sinusoidal endothelial capillarization (LSEC) and therefore restored perfusion between blood and liver cells.  Our study provides evidence that MDB5 was more potent in inhibiting Hh pathway in HSC-T6 cells and showed better hepatoprotection in CBDL mice compared to GDC-0449.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693486>GLP-1 signaling is required for improvement of glucose tolerance by osteocalcin.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone that in its uncarboxylated form (GluOC) plays an important role in glucose and energy  by stimulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell proliferation through its putative receptor GPRC6A. We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both lipid accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression. Our results thus indicate that the beneficial  effects of GluOC are dependent on GLP-1 receptor signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695034>EGFL9 promotes breast cancer metastasis by inducing cMET activation and  reprogramming.</a></h1><p>The molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor-like 9 (EGFL9) is significantly upregulated in basal-like breast cancer cells and associated with metastatic progression in breast tumor samples. Functionally, EGFL9 is both necessary and sufficient to enhance cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as distant metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that EGFL9 binds cMET, activating cMET-mediated downstream signaling. EGFL9 and cMET co-localize at both the cell membrane and within the mitochondria. We further identify an interaction between EGFL9 and the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly factor COA3. Consequently, EGFL9 regulates COX activity and modulates cell , promoting a Warburg-like  phenotype. Finally, we show that combined pharmacological inhibition of cMET and glycolysis reverses EGFL9-driven stemness. Our results identify EGFL9 as a therapeutic target for combating metastatic progression in TNBC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693336>Computationally-Guided Discovery and Experimental Validation of Indole-3-Acetic Acid Synthesis .</a></h1><p>Elucidating the interaction  associated with secondary metabolite production in microorganisms is an ongoing challenge made all the more daunting by the rate at which DNA sequencing technology reveals new genes and potential . Developing the culturing methods, expression conditions, and genetic systems needed for validating  in newly discovered microorganisms is often not possible. Therefore, new tools and techniques are needed for defining complex  . Here we describe an in vitro computationally-assisted pathway description approach that employs bioinformatic searches of genome databases, protein structural modeling, and protein-ligand docking simulations to predict the gene products most likely to be involved in a particular secondary metabolite production pathway. This information is then used to direct in vitro reconstructions of the pathway and subsequent confirmation of pathway activity using crude enzyme preparations. As a test system, we elucidated the pathway for biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the plant-associated microbe Pantoea sp. YR343. This organism is capable of metabolizing tryptophan into the plant phytohormone IAA. BLAST analyses identified a likely three-step pathway involving an amino transferase, an indole pyruvate decarboxylase, and a dehydrogenase. However, multiple candidate enzymes were identified at each step, resulting in a large number of potential pathway reconstructions (32 different enzyme combinations). Our approach shows the effectiveness of crude extracts to rapidly elucidate enzymes leading to functional . Results are compared to affinity purified enzymes for select combinations and found to yield similar relative activities. Further, in vitro testing of the pathway reconstructions revealed the "underground" nature of IAA  in Pantoea sp. YR343 and the various mechanisms used to produce IAA.

Previous morpholino knockdown studies in zebrafish suggested cyp11a2 is a functional equivalent of human CYP11A1 and is essential for interrenal steroidogenesis in zebrafish larvae. The role of Cyp11a2 in adult zebrafish, particularly in gonadal steroidogenesis, remains elusive. To explore the role of Cyp11a2 in adults, we developed zebrafish mutant lines by creating deletions in cyp11a2 using the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic engineering approach. Homozygous mutant zebrafish larvae showed an upregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. Furthermore, Cyp11a2-deficient zebrafish demonstrated profound glucocorticoid and androgen deficiencies. Cyp11a2 homozygotes only developed into males with feminized secondary sex characteristics. Adult cyp11a2-/- mutant fish showed a lack of natural breeding behaviors. Histological characterization revealed disorganized testicular structure and significantly decreased numbers of mature spermatozoa. These findings are further supported by the downregulation of the expression of several pro-male genes in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous zebrafish, including sox9a, dmrt1 and amh. Moreover, the spermatogonia markers nanos2 and piwil1 were upregulated, while the spermatocytes marker sycp3 and spermatids marker odf3b were downregulated in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous mutants. Our expression analysis is consistent with our histological studies, suggesting that spermatogonia are the predominant cell types in the testes of cyp11a2 homozygous mutants. Our work thus demonstrates the crucial role of Cyp11a2 in interrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis in zebrafish larvae and adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693691>Association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive function in middle-aged type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h1><p>Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with various complications, including cognitive impairment. Diabetic complication is related with structural and functional changes of brain. Studies investigated that homocysteine as an independent risk factor of several organ complications. This marker might have a role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in T2DM patients. We aimed to know the association between serum homocysteine level and cognitive impairment in middle-aged T2DM populations. The study was a cross-sectional study involving 97 T2DM patients aged <60 years old. Cognitive assessment was based on validated Indonesian version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-INA) test. Besides, serum homocysteine level (Hcy) was measured based on standard laboratory assay. Filling out the questionnaire of MoCA-INA was conducted when patients came to take the blood sample. This study used independent t-test, chi-square and multivariate logistic regression model to analyze the data. There were 47 subjects (48.5%) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Delayed recall was the most impaired domain (94.8%). There was no significant mean difference of serum Hcy level in MCI and non-MCI group (11.99±3.27 μmol/L vs 12.36±4.07 μmol/L respectively, p = 0.62). Final model of logistic regression showed no association between serum Hcy and cognitive function after adjusting confounding variables (OR: 1.778; 95%CI: 0.69-4.54).

LED treatment is a therapeutic tool associated with serum therapy used to minimize the local effects of snakebites, including decrease in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations, myonecrosis, and inflammatory and haemorrhagic responses. In this study, we analysed the photobiomodulation effect of LED on the activation of murine macrophages induced by BthTX-I or BthTX-II isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. Photobiomodulation caused an increase in mitochondrial  and a considerable decrease in cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Moreover, it induced a decrease in reactive oxygen species and nitrogen liberation. However, photobiomodulation caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic capacity and lipid droplet formation. The results of this study corroborated with those of others in an unprecedented way and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of photobiomodulation, besides offering a coadjuvant action treatment for the local effects of snakebites, not achieved with serum therapy alone.Copyright © 2019.

Similar to many other FPR2 agonistic peptides, nanomolar concentrations of both PSMα2 and PSMα3 activate neutrophils to increase the cytosolic concentration of Ca and release NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species. In addition, the PSMα peptides induce FPR2 homologous desensitization, actin polymerization, and neutrophil reactivation through a receptor cross-talk mechanism. However, in contrast to conventional FPR2 agonistic peptides, including the host-derived formyl peptide MCT-ND4, we found that the PSMα peptides lacked the ability to recruit β-arrestin and induce neutrophil chemotaxis, supporting the previous notion that β-arrestin translocation is of importance for cell migration. Despite the lack of β-arrestin recruitment, the PSMα peptides induced an FPR2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and internalization. Furthermore, structure-activity relationship analysis with PSMα2 derivatives revealed critical roles of the first 3 aa linked to N-fMet as well as the C terminus of PSMα2 in promoting FPR2 to recruit β-arrestin. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel neutrophil activation pattern upon FPR2 sensing of PSMα peptides, signified by the ability to induce increased intracellular Ca, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, internalization, and NADPH oxidase activity, yet lack of β-arrestin recruitment and neutrophil chemoattraction. These novel features adopted by the PSMα peptides could be of importance for  virulence and might facilitate identification of new therapeutic strategies for treating  infections.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694288>Intermediate-Salinity Systems at High Altitudes in the Peruvian Andes Unveil a High Diversity and Abundance of Bacteria and Viruses.</a></h1><p>Intermediate-salinity environments are distributed around the world. Here, we present a snapshot characterization of two Peruvian thalassohaline environments at high altitude, Maras and Acos, which provide an excellent opportunity to increase our understanding of these ecosystems. The main goal of this study was to assess the structure and functional diversity of the communities of microorganisms in an intermediate-salinity environment, and we used a metagenomic shotgun approach for this analysis. These Andean hypersaline systems exhibited high bacterial diversity and abundance of the phyla , , , and ; in contrast,  from the phyla , , and  were identified in low abundance. Acos harbored a more diverse prokaryotic community and a higher number of unique species compared with Maras. In addition, we obtained the draft genomes of two bacteria,  and , as well as the viral genomes of  lambda-like phage and -like phage and 27 partial novel viral halophilic genomes. The functional metagenome annotation showed a high abundance of sequences associated with detoxification, DNA repair, cell wall and capsule formation, and nucleotide ; sequences for these functions were overexpressed mainly in bacteria and also in some archaea and viruses. Thus, their  profiles afford a decrease in oxidative stress as well as the assimilation of nitrogen, a critical energy source for survival.

Little is known about related clinical and demographic components contributing to these differences. We examined differences in HbA between adults who have T2DM with and without major depression. T-tests and chi-square analyses measured differences in HbA and clinical/demographic variables. HbA was statistically higher in depressed participants compared to non-depressed participants. The difference was no longer statistically significant after controlling for age. Age and HbA were negatively correlated across the sample and were still correlated in each group independently. The interaction of age and HbA was moderated by depression status. Additionally, mechanisms for diabetes severity differences were assessed using moderation analyses and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique. Seventy-four percent of the mean outcome HbA difference between depressed and non-depressed diabetic participants was explained by age. Furthermore, age was negatively correlated with clinical variables, such as diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol. Comparing age to smoking and nonsmoking participants, smokers were statistically younger. Younger adults with T2DM may require more attention regarding self-management, particularly in the context of depression. Depression should be screened and treated among individuals with diabetes since this exacerbates diabetes severity.This article is protected by copyright.

The use of cytarabine and doxorubicin in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) along with voriconazole can potentially alter the  of the drugs and cause some interactions. In this study, we presented a case of AML who received cytarabine and doxorubicin as a chemotherapy regimen and voriconazole as a prophylactic anti-fungal. In this combination, voriconazole probably inhibits the P-glycoprotein pump, which leads to an increase in the cytarabine concentration.

Recent advances reveal that it is a key transcriptional regulator of genes, broadly involved in xenobiotic and drug  and also cancers of gastrointestinal tract. However, the exact functional roles of HNF4α in prostate cancer progression are still not fully understood. In this study, we determined the functional significance of HNF4α in prostate cancer. Our results showed that HNF4α exhibited a reduced expression pattern in clinical prostate cancer tissues, prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft model of castration-relapse prostate cancer. Stable HNF4α knockdown not only could promote cell proliferation and suppress doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells, but also confer resistance to paclitaxel treatment and enhance colony formation capacity and in vivo tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. On the contrary, ectopic overexpression of HNF4α could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells, induce cell-cycle arrest at G/M phase and trigger the cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells by activation of p21 signal pathway in a p53-independent manner via its direct transactivation of CDKN1A. Together, our results show that HNF4α performs a tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer via a mechanism of p21-driven cellular senescence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696666>Combined effects of growth hormone and testosterone replacement treatment in heart failure.</a></h1><p>Although preliminary studies have demonstrated safety and effectiveness of single replacement therapy for growth hormone deficiency or testosterone deficiency in heart failure (HF), no data are available regarding the combined treatment with both GH and T in this setting. Thus, the aim of the present hypothesis generating pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of multiple hormonal replacement therapies in chronic HF.Five stable HF with reduced ejection fraction patients, with a concomitant diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency and testosterone deficiency, on top of guideline-based HF treatment underwent 1 year of GH replacement therapy by subcutaneous injections of somatotropin at a dose of 0.012 mg/kg every second day. After 12 months, a T replacement treatment was added at a dosage of 1000 mg every 3 months. Each patient underwent a complete M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic examination, and an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at baseline (BL), after 1 year of GH treatment (V1), and after 1 year of combined GH + T treatments (V2). One-year of GH treatment resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (+5.4%, P < 0.01), New York Heart Association functional class (P < 0.05), and peak oxygen consumption (VO peak) (+19.3%, P < 0.01), and in a significant reduction in NT-proBNP levels (-35.1%, P < 0.01). Notably, one additional year of combined GH and T replacement therapy induced a further increase in VO peak (+27.7%, final delta change + 52.44%, P < 0.01), as well as a significant improvement in muscular strength, as assessed by handgrip dynamometry (+17.5%, final delta change + 25.8%, P < 0.01). These beneficial effects were paralleled with an improvement of the overall clinical status (as assessed by New York Heart Association class). Of note, neither adverse effects nor cardiovascular events were reported during the follow-up period.Our preliminary data suggest for the first time that combined replacement therapy with GH and T could be considered safe and therapeutic in HF patients with multiple hormone deficiencies, supporting the hypothesis that multiple hormone deficiencies syndrome can be considered as a novel and promising therapeutic target in HF. Further studies with a more robust design and larger population are needed.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we studied the role of ouabain (specific Na,K-ATPase ligand) and AMP-activated protein kinase (key regulator of muscle ) in the maintenance of muscle electrogenesis; the levels of these endogenous factors are directly related to the motor activity. After 4-day intraperitoneal administration of ouabain (1 µg/kg daily), a hyperpolarization of sarcolemma was registered in isolated rat diaphragm muscles due to an increase in the electrogenic activity of Na,K-ATPase. In acute experiments, addition of nanomolar ouabain concentrations to the bathing solution resulted in the muscle membrane hyperpolarization within 15 min. The effect of ouabain reversed to membrane depolarization with the increase in the external potassium concentration. It is possible that Na,K-ATPase activation by ouabain may be regulated by such factors as specific subcellular location, interaction with molecular partners, and changes in the ionic balance. Preventive administration of the AMP-activated protein kinase activator AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside; 400 mg/kg body weight daily for 7 days) in chronic experiments resulted in the stabilization of the endplate structure and abolishment of depolarization of the rat soleus muscle membrane caused by the motor activity cessation. The obtained data can be useful for creating approaches for correction of muscle dysfunction, especially at the early stages, prior to the development of muscle atrophy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693469>Comparative Whole-Transcriptome Profiling of Liver Tissue from Wistar Rats Fed with Diets Containing Different Amounts of Fat, Fructose, and Cholesterol.</a></h1><p>Differential expression of 30,003 genes was studied in the liver of female Wistar rats fed with isocaloric diets with the excess of fat, fructose, or cholesterol, or their combinations for 62 days using the method of whole-transcriptome profiling on a microchip. Relative mRNA expression levels of the Asah2, Crot, Crtc2, Fmo3, GSTA2, LOC1009122026, LOC102551184, NpY, NqO1, Prom1, Retsat, RGD1305464, Tmem104, and Whsc1 genes were also determined by RT-qPCR. All the tested diets affected differently the key   (KEGGs). Significant changes in the expression of steroid  gene were observed in the liver of animals fed with the tested diets (except the high-fat high fructose diet). Both high-fat and high-fructose diets caused a significant decrease in the expression of squalene synthase (FDFT1 gene) responsible for the initial stage of cholesterol synthesis. On the contrary, in animals fed with the high-cholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol), expression of the FDFT1 gene did not differ from the control group; however, these animals were characterized by changes in the expression of glucose and glycogen synthesis genes, which could lead to the suppression of glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. At the same time, this group demonstrated different liver tissue morphology in comparison with the animals fed with the high-fructose high-fat diet, manifested as the presence of lipid vacuoles of a smaller size in hepatocytes. The high-fructose and high-fructose high-fat diets affected the   associated with intracellular protein catabolism (endocytosis, phagocytosis, proteasomal degradation, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum), tight junctions and intercellular contacts, adhesion molecules, and intracellular RNA transport. Rats fed with the high-fructose high-fat or high-cholesterol diets demonstrated consistent changes in the expression of the Crot, Prom1, and RGD1305464 genes, which reflected a coordinated shift in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692944>Potential for therapeutic use of hydrogen sulfide in oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative diseases.</a></h1><p>Oxidative phosphorylation is a source of energy production by which many cells satisfy their energy requirements. Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial . Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693870>Parental morphine exposure affects repetitive grooming actions and marble burying behavior in the offspring: Potential relevance for obsessive-compulsive like behavior.</a></h1><p>Family, adoption and twin studies have highlighted the significant role of heritable influences on individual differences in opioid addiction. Meanwhile, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder wherein the individual experiences recurring thoughts that cause irrational fears and anxiety. In the present study, adult male and female rats received morphine solution for 21 days and were drug-free for 10 days. Offspring were used in 4 distinct groups; (1) paternal morphine-exposed, (2) maternal morphine-exposed, (3) maternal and paternal morphine-exposed, and (4) drug-naïve subjects. We assessed the grooming behavior and marble burying test as an indicator of obsessive-compulsive behavior. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these changes, the mRNA level of BDNF, the phosphorylation level of CREB and the protein level of D2 dopamine receptor (DR) were evaluated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The grooming behavior in male offspring with one or two morphine-abstinent parent(s) increased compared with the offspring of drug naïve rats. In addition, the offspring of morphine-exposed parents buried more marbles when compared with the offspring of drug-naïve parents. Also, the BDNF mRNA was down-regulated in the NAC. However, the levels of phospho-CREB and D2 DR were elevated. Previous studies indicated that exposure to morphine in adulthood enhances the risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring. OCD is one the comorbid disorders with addiction and increases the risk of substance abuse disorder in patients. In this survey, we found that morphine exposure in parents before gestation can encourage obsessive-compulsive behavior in offspring.Copyright © 2019.

Current evidence demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPKα2 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipid, and amino acid. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic . The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPKα2. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (SHAM) rainbow trouts, and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with GFP alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2 (AMPKα2-DN). The inhibition of AMPKα2 led to a reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides () involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPKα2 resulted in liver in decreased capacity of use and synthesis of glucose, lipid, and amino acid. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support that the autonomic nervous system actions mediates the actions of hypothalamic AMPKα2 on liver . Importantly, this evidence indicates that the well-established role of hypothalamic AMPK on energy balance is a canonical evolutionary preserved mechanism that appeared at least in the fish lineage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698312>Prediction of the Prognosis Based on Chromosomal Instability-Related DNA Methylation Patterns of ELOVL2 and UBAC2 in PTCs.</a></h1><p>Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant tumor of endocrine systems. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is crucial to the clinical prognoses of tumor patients. DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and CIN. Based on PTC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we used multiple regression analyses to identify methylation patterns of CpG sites with the strongest correlation with gene expression. A total of 4,997 genes were obtained through combining the CpG sites, which were represented as featured DNA methylation patterns. In order to identify CIN-related epigenetic markers of PTC survival, we developed a method to characterize CIN based on DNA methylation patterns of genes using the Student's t statistics. We found that 1,239 genes were highly associated with CIN. With the use of the log-rank test, univariate Cox regression analyses, and the Kaplan-Meier method, DNA methylation patterns of UBAC2 and ELOVL2, highly correlated with CIN, provided potential prognostic values for PTC. The higher these two genes, risk scores were correlated with worse PTC patient prognoses. Moreover, the ELOVL2 risk score was significantly different in the four stages of PTC, suggesting that it was related to the progress of PTC. The DNA methylation pattern associated with CIN may therefore be a good predictor of PTC survival.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the current production of IBDV vaccine faces serious batch instability and external contamination. The chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line DF-1 is widely used for the proliferation of avian viruses and vaccine production. Thus, optimizing the production of IBDV by DF-1 cells has an important application value. Combining metabolomics analysis and a Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical strategy, this study successfully optimized the process of IBDV production by DF-1 cells. Differential analysis and time series analysis of metabolite data in both IBDV-infected and uninfected DF-1 cells were performed by multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that the intracellular metabolite intensities of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the nucleoside synthesis pathway, lipid , and glutathione  were upregulated, and the TCA cycle underwent a slight downregulation after IBDV infection of DF-1 cells. Based on the metabolome results and DOE statistical optimization method, the additive components suitable for IBDV proliferation were determined. The IBDV titer increased by 20.7 times upon exogenous addition of cysteine, methionine, lysine and nucleosides in the control medium, which is consistent with the predicted result (20.0 times) by a multivariate quadratic equation. This study provides a strategy for the efficient production of IBDV vaccines and could potentially be utilized to improve the production of other viral vaccines and biologics.Copyright © 2019.

Sigma1 (encoded by the  gene and also known as Sigma-1 receptor, S1R) is a unique pharmacologically regulated integral membrane chaperone or scaffolding protein that allosterically modulates the activity of its associated proteins. Sigma2, recently identified as transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97), is an integral membrane protein implicated in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. A number of publications over the past two decades have suggested a role for both sigma proteins in tumor biology. Although there is currently no clinically used anti-cancer drug that targets Sigma1 or Sigma2/TMEM97, a growing body of evidence supports the potential of small-molecule compounds with affinity for these proteins, putative sigma ligands, as therapeutic agents to treat cancer. In preclinical models, these compounds have been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration; furthermore, they have been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth, to alleviate cancer-associated pain, and to exert immunomodulatory properties. Here, we will address the known knowns and the known unknowns of Sigma1 and Sigma2/TMEM97 ligand actions in the context of cancer. This review will highlight key discoveries and published evidence in support of a role for sigma proteins in cancer and will discuss several fundamental questions regarding the physiological roles of sigma proteins in cancer and sigma ligand mechanism of action.Copyright © 2019 Oyer, Sanders and Kim.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697023>Update on  of Abemaciclib: In Silico, In vitro and In vivo Metabolite Identification and Characterization using High Resolution Mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Abemaciclib is approved by US Food and Drug Administration in 2015 to have an advanced treatment for metastatic breast cancer.

Heterozygous inactivating mutations involving the maternal GNAS exons 1-13 that encodes the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) cause inactivating parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTHrP signalling disorder type 2 (iPPSD2 or PHP type 1A), which is characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and resistance to multiple hormones that act through the Gsα signalling pathway (including PTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). To date, little information is available on craniofacial features in patients with PHP. The small number of patients studied in previous reports as well as the lack of molecular characterization of the patients may have precluded the detection of specific orofacial manifestations in the different PHP subtypes.We conducted a systematic analysis of dental and craniofacial features in 19 patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS inactivating mutations to assess the frequency and specificity of the anomalies.Facial examinations showed reduced vertical, sagittal, and transverse development of the mid-facial structures. Intraoral and radiographic examinations revealed that 89 per cent of the patients had at least one dental anomaly, including tooth submergence leading to severe infraocclusion in 83 per cent of cases. Craniofacial analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs also showed a significant alteration in the development of the cranial base and maxillary and mandibular structures in these patients.Patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS mutations had specific craniofacial alterations and dental abnormalities. These specific defects should be assessed in order to provide appropriate dental and orthodontic care to these patients.

The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT) NAD  in regulating whole-body thermogenesis and energy . Accordingly, we generated and analyzed adipocyte-specific nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase () knockout (ANKO) and brown adipocyte-specific  knockout (BANKO) mice because NAMPT is the rate-limiting NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We found ANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in both BAT and WAT, had impaired gene programs involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial function in BAT and a blunted thermogenic (rectal temperature, BAT temperature, and whole-body oxygen consumption) response to acute cold exposure, prolonged fasting, and administration of β-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and CL-316243). In addition, the absence of NAMPT in WAT markedly reduced adrenergic-mediated lipolytic activity, likely through inactivation of the NAD-SIRT1-caveolin-1 axis, which limits an important fuel source fatty acid for BAT thermogenesis. These  abnormalities were rescued by treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which bypasses the block in NAD synthesis induced by NAMPT deficiency. Although BANKO mice, which lack NAMPT in BAT only, had BAT cellular alterations similar to the ANKO mice, BANKO mice had normal thermogenic and lipolytic responses. We also found  expression in supraclavicular adipose tissue (where human BAT is localized) obtained from human subjects increased during cold exposure, suggesting our finding in rodents could apply to people. These results demonstrate that adipose NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis is essential for regulating adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis, and whole-body energy .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695754>Treatment patterns of drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese hospital database.</a></h1><p>Guidelines for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in Japan provide physicians the discretion to select treatment options based on patient pathophysiology of the disease. There exists a wide variation of preference for initial antidiabetes drugs (AD). The current database analysis aimed to understand the real world treatment patterns in drug-naive patients with T2DM in Japan.We analyzed data of patients (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with T2DM between October 2012 and September 2016 from the Medical Data Vision, a Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of T2DM patients receiving each type of treatment as first-line therapy among the drug-naive cohort.Of the 436,546 drug-naive patients, 224,761 received their first-line T2DM treatment in the outpatient setting. The mean age of the patient population was 65.6 years at index date. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor was the most prescribed (56.8%) outpatient AD monotherapy, followed by metformin (15.4%). DPP-4 inhibitors were prescribed over metformin in patients with renal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 4.20; p < 0.0001), coronary heart disease and stroke (OR: 2.22; p < 0.0001). Male (OR: 1.03; p = 0.0026), presence of diabetic complications [retinopathy (OR: 1.33; p < 0.0001), neuropathy (OR: 1.05; p = 0.0037), nephropathy (OR: 1.08; p < 0.0001)] and a high baseline HbA1c (OR: 1.45; p < 0.0001) received treatment intensification during 180 days.DPP-4 inhibitors were the most prevalent first-line T2DM treatment followed by metformin in Japan. The findings from this retrospective analysis also support the previously published web survey results and can help understand the real world utilization of T2DM treatment.

Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. Body weight, colon length, colon weight, immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal microbiota. Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the body weight and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut microbiota and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut microbiome was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697432>On the structure and function of Escherichia coli YjhC: an oxidoreductase involved in bacterial sialic acid .</a></h1><p>Human pathogenic and commensal bacteria evolved the ability to scavenge host-derived sialic acids and subsequently degrade them as a source of nutrition. Expression of the Escherichia coli yjhBC operon is controlled by the repressor protein nanR, which regulates the core machinery responsible for the import and catabolic processing of sialic acid. The role of the yjhBC encoded proteins is not known-here we demonstrate that the enzyme YjhC is an oxidoreductase involved in bacterial sialic acid degradation. First, we demonstrate in vivo using knockout experiments that YjhC is broadly involved in carbohydrate , including that of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Differential scanning fluorimetry demonstrates that YjhC binds N-acetylneuraminic acid and its lactone variant, along with NAD(H), which is consistent with its role as an oxidoreductase. Next, we solved the crystal structure of YjhC in complex with the NAD(H) cofactor to 1.35 å resolution. The protein fold belongs to the Gfo/Idh/MocA protein family. The dimeric assembly observed in the crystal form is confirmed through solution studies. Ensemble refinement reveals a flexible loop region that may play a key role during catalysis, providing essential contacts to stabilize the substrate-a unique feature to YjhC among closely related structures. Guided by the structure, in silico docking experiments support the binding of sialic acid and several common derivatives in the binding pocket with an overall positive charge distribution. Taken together, our results verify the role of YjhC as a bona fide oxidoreductase/dehydrogenase and provide the first evidence to support its involvement in sialic acid .

There were clearly separated metabolically normal Cluster 1 and severe Cluster 2, as well as intermediate Cluster 3, 4, and 5 that had profiles of fewer attributes with abnormal values. Cluster 3 was characteristic of sole hypertension. Cluster 3 and 4 exhibited contrasting HDL-C and LDL-C levels despite similarly elevated total cholesterol. Cluster 6 with slightly elevated triglyceride was closest to the normal group. Four- and 10-quantile-transformations yielded consistent clustering results. Compared with the original data, the quantile-transformed data produced more regular and spherical clusters and evenly distributed clusters in terms of object numbers.This big data analysis strategy makes use of quantile-transformation of data to overcome the issue of outliers and the irregular distribution and applies to the analysis of other non-communicable diseases.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693244>Effects of Alendronic Acid on Fracture Healing.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696328>Correction to: Extreme Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Recognition.</a></h1><p>The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697793>Aging boosts antiviral CD8+T cell memory through improvedengagement of diversified recall response determinants.</a></h1><p>The determinants of protective CD8+ memory T cell (CD8+TM) immunity remain incompletely defined and may in fact constitute an evolving agency as aging CD8+TM progressively acquire enhanced rather than impaired recall capacities. Here, we show that old as compared to young antiviral CD8+TM more effectively harness disparate molecular processes (cytokine signaling, trafficking, effector functions, and co-stimulation/inhibition) that in concert confer greater secondary reactivity. The relative reliance on these  is contingent on the nature of the secondary challenge (greater for chronic than acute viral infections) and over time, aging CD8+TM re-establish a dependence on the same accessory signals required for effective priming of naïve CD8+T cells in the first place. Thus, our findings reveal a temporal regulation of complementary recall response determinants that is consistent with the recently proposed "rebound model" according to which aging CD8+TM properties are gradually aligned with those of naïve CD8+T cells; our identification of a broadly diversified collection of immunomodulatory targets may further provide a foundation for the potential therapeutic "tuning" of CD8+TM immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697963>HFD refeeding in mice after fasting impairs learning by activating caspase-1 in the brain.</a></h1><p>Diets that include some aspect of fasting have dramatically increased in popularity. In addition, fasting reduces inflammasome activity in the brain while improving learning. Here, we examine the impact of refeeding a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) after fasting.Male wildtype (WT), caspase-1 knockout (KO) and/or IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) KO mice were fasted for 24 h or allowed ad libitum access to food (chow). Immediately after fasting, mice were allowed to refeed for 2 h in the presence of LFD, HFD or chow. Mouse learning was examined using novel object recognition (NOR) and novel location recognition (NLR). Caspase-1 activity was quantified in the brain using histochemistry (HC) and image analysis.Refeeding with a HFD but not a LFD or chow fully impaired both NOR and NLR. Likewise, HFD when compared to LFD refeeding increased caspase-1 activity in the whole amygdala and, particularly, in the posterior basolateral nuclei (BLp) by 2.5-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively. When caspase-1 KO or IL-1R1 KO mice were examined, learning impairment secondary to HFD refeeding did not occur. Equally, administration of n-acetylcysteine to fasted WT mice prevented HFD-dependent learning impairment and caspase-1 activation in the BLp. Finally, the free-fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) antagonist, DC260126, mitigated learning impairment associated with HFD refeeding while blocking caspase-1 activation in the BLp.Consumption of a HFD after fasting impairs learning by a mechanism that is dependent on caspase-1 and the IL-1R1 receptor. These consequences of a HFD refeeding on the BLP of the amygdala appear linked to oxidative stress and FFAR1.Copyright © 2019.

LD mice of both sexes are sterile, but fertility can be restored with leptin injections. Mammary glands from lipodystrophic mice were rudimentary and lacked terminal end buds. Leptin-injected LD mice were able to become pregnant, showed normal pregnancy-associated glandular proliferation despite a smaller glandular area, were able to produce a small amount of milk that had grossly normal content of milk proteins and neutral lipids, but could not sustain pups to weaning. In order to separate the individual requirements for 1) adipokines such as leptin, 2) estradiol, and 3) physical epithelial-adipocyte interactions, we performed a series of experiments with both lipodystrophic mice and ob (obese mice with a mutation in the lep gene encoding the adipokine leptin) mice that received either estradiol treatment or preadipocyte transplant. The resulting fat pad did not rescue the defect in mammary gland development in lipodystrophic mice. The defect also could not be rescued with estradiol pellets. Ob/ob mice, like LD mice, lack leptin and estradiol, but retain adipose tissue. Ob mice have defective mammary gland development. However, in striking contrast to what was observed in lipodystrophic mice, reconstitution of a WT fat pad in ob mice rescued the defect in mammary gland development. Estradiol treatment did not rescue mammary gland development in ob mice. Therefore direct interaction between mammary gland epithelia and adipose is a requirement for full invasion and expansion of the gland, but is not required for glandular proliferation during pregnancy and milk production.Copyright © 2019.

Hallmarks of aggressive tumors such as a decrease in extracellular pH (pH) can potentially be used to identify aggressive phenotypes. In this study, we employ an optimized, high signal-to-noise ratio hyperpolarized (HP) C pH imaging method to discriminate between indolent and aggressive disease in a murine model of prostate cancer. Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice underwent a multiparametric MR imaging exam, including HP [C] bicarbonate MRI for pH, with H apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping and HP [1-C] pyruvate MRI to study lactate . Tumor tissue was excised for histological staining and qRT-PCR to quantify mRNA expression for relevant glycolytic enzymes and transporters. We observed good separation in pH between low- and high-grade tumor regions, with high-grade tumors demonstrating a lower pH. The pH also correlated strongly with monocarboxylate transporter  gene expression across all tumors, suggesting that lactate export via MCT4 is associated with acidification in this model. Our results implicate extracellular acidification as an indicator of indolent-to-aggressive transition in prostate cancer and suggest feasibility of HP pH imaging to detect high-grade, clinically significant disease in men as part of a multiparametric MRI examination.Copyright: © 2019 Korenchan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693425>An up-to-date evaluation of lorcaserin hydrochloride for the treatment of obesity.</a></h1><p>: Obesity is a chronic disease caused by dysfunctional neurohormonal systems that result in excess weight, adiposopathy, and increased risk for many comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

Baseline blood samples were collected >1 hour before race. Serial post-race blood sampling time points included immediately (0hr), 1 hour (1hr), 1 day (d), 3 d, and 5 d after the Ironman race.Serum muscle damage markers, serum myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) revealed significant post-race peak values immediately, 1hr and 1d after the race, respectively.

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut microbiota and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions.

Under this scenario, organisms should maintain or develop strategies to cope with environmental fluctuations, such as the capacity to modify growth trajectories. However, altering growth can have negative consequences for organisms' fitness. Here, we investigated the  alterations induced by compensatory growth during the larval development of the common frog (Rana temporaria), quantifying changes in oxidative stress, corticosterone levels, and telomere length. We induced compensatory growth responses by exposing frog embryos to cold conditions (i.e. a "false spring" scenario), which cause a delay in hatching. Once hatched, we reared larvae at two different photoperiods (24:0, representing the natural photoperiod of larvae, and 18:6) to test also for the interactive effects of light on growth responses. Larvae experiencing delayed-hatching showed fast compensatory responses, and reached larger size at metamorphosis. Larvae shortened their developmental period in response to delayed-hatching. Non-permanent light conditions resulted in relaxed growth compared with larvae reared under permanent light conditions, which grew at their natural photoperiod and closer to their maximal rates. Growth responses altered the redox status and corticosterone levels of larvae. These physiological changes were developmental-stage dependent, and mainly affected by photoperiod conditions. At catch-up, larvae reared at 18:6 light:dark cycles showed higher antioxidant activities and glucocorticoid secretion. On the contrary, larvae reared at 24:0 developed at higher rates without altering their oxidative status, likely an adaptation to grow under very restricting seasonal conditions at early life. At metamorphosis, compensatory responses induced higher cellular antioxidant activities probably caused by enhanced . Telomeres length remained unaltered by experimental treatments but apparently tended to elongate across larval ontogeny, which would be a first evidence of telomere lengthening across metamorphosis. Under the forecasted increase in extreme climatic events, adjusting growth and developmental rates to the dynamics of environmental fluctuations may be essential for survival, but it can carry  costs and affect later performance. Understanding the implications of such costs will be essential to properly estimate the impact of climate change on wild animals.© 2019 The Authors.

H. polymorpha Pex37 is a peroxisomal membrane protein, which belongs to a protein family that includes among others the Neurospora crassa Woronin body protein Wsc, the human peroxisomal membrane protein PXMP2, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial inner membrane protein Sym1 and its mammalian homologue MPV17. We show that deletion of H. polymorpha PEX37 does not appear to have a significant effect on peroxisome biogenesis or proliferation in cells grown at peroxisome inducing growth conditions (methanol). However, the absence of Pex37 results in a reduction in peroxisome numbers and a defect in peroxisome segregation in cells grown at peroxisome repressing conditions (glucose). Conversely, overproduction of Pex37 in glucose-grown cells results in an increase in peroxisome numbers in conjunction with a decrease in their size. The increase in numbers in PEX37 overexpressing cells depends on the dynamin related protein Dnm1. Together our data suggest that Pex37 is involved in peroxisome fission in glucose-grown cells. Introduction of human PXMP2 in H. polymorpha pex37 cells partially restored the peroxisomal phenotype, indicating that PXMP2 represents a functional homologue of Pex37. H. polymorpha pex37 cells did not show aberrant growth on any of the tested carbon and nitrogen sources that are metabolized by peroxisomal enzymes, suggesting that Pex37 may not fulfill an essential function in transport of these substrates or compounds required for their  across the peroxisomal membrane.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696945>Statins for children with familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h1><p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most common inherited  diseases and is an autosomal dominant disorder meaning heterozygotes, or carriers, are affected. Those who are homozygous have severe disease. The average worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is at least 1 in 500, although recent genetic epidemiological data from Denmark and next generation sequencing data suggest the frequency may be closer to 1 in 250. Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in children is based on elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or DNA-based analysis, or both. Coronary atherosclerosis has been detected in men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Since the clinical complications of atherosclerosis occur prematurely, especially in men, lifelong treatment, started in childhood, is needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children with the disease, diet was the cornerstone of treatment but the addition of lipid-lowering medications has resulted in a significant improvement in treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, were found to be effective, but they are poorly tolerated. Since the 1990s studies carried out on children aged 6 to 17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated significant reductions in their serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. While statins seem to be safe and well-tolerated in children, their long-term safety in this age group is not firmly established. This is an update of a previously published version of this Cochane Review.To assess the effectiveness and safety of statins in children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.Relevant studies were identified from the Group's Inborn Errors and  Trials Register and Medline. Date of most recent search: 04 November 2019.Randomized and controlled clinical studies including participants up to 18 years old, comparing a statin to placebo or to diet alone.Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.We found 26 potentially eligible studies, of which we included nine randomized placebo-controlled studies (1177 participants). In general, the intervention and follow-up time was short (median 24 weeks; range from six weeks to two years). Statins reduced the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration at all time points (high-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in liver function (serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, as well as creatinine kinase concentrations) between treated and placebo groups at any time point (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in myopathy (as measured in change in creatinine levels) (low-quality evidence) or clinical adverse events (moderate-quality evidence) with statins compared to placebo. One study on simvastatin showed that this may slightly improve flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (low-quality evidence), and on pravastatin for two years may have induced a regression in carotid intima media thickness (low-quality evidence). No studies reported rhabdomyolysis (degeneration of skeletal muscle tissue) or death due to rhabdomyolysis, quality of life or compliance to study medication.Statin treatment is an effective lipid-lowering therapy in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. Few or no safety issues were identified. Statin treatment seems to be safe in the short term, but long-term safety remains unknown. Children treated with statins should be carefully monitored and followed up by their pediatricians and their care transferred to an adult lipidologist once they reach 18 years of age. Large long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long-term safety issues of statins.Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We randomized 20 gerbils into two groups (ten animals per group): the control group (healthy animals; uninfected) and the infected group (experimentally infected with dose 7.8 x 10 tachyzoites of N. caninum per gerbil). On day six and twelve post-infection (PI), brain and spleen tissues were collected for biochemical and histopathological analyses. No histopathological lesions were observed in the brains of infected animals; however, inflammatory infiltrates were found in the spleen. Significantly greater levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in the brain and spleen of infected gerbils than in the control group at 12 days PI. Cytosolic creatine kinase (CK-CYT), mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK-MIT), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were lower in the brains of infected gerbils than in those of the control group on day 12 PI. There was significantly less CK-CYT activity in the spleens of infected gerbils on day 6 and 12 PI. Finally, there was significantly less sodium-potassium ion pump (Na/K ATPase) activity in the brains and spleens of infected gerbils on day 12 PI. These data suggest that experimental infection with N. caninum interfered with energy  associated with ATP homeostasis in the brain and spleen, directly or indirectly, apparently mediated by ROS overproduction, contributing to inhibition of Na/K ATPase activity.Copyright © 2019.

Two-Years' Experience in Catalonia (Spain).</a></h1><p>Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of T-cell immunodeficiency, can be screened at birth by quantifying T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Early detection of this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally include this testing. The results obtained in the first 2 years of experience are evaluated here. All babies born between January 2017 and December 2018 were screened. TREC quantification in DBS (1.5 mm diameter) was performed with the Enlite Neonatal TREC kit from PerkinElmer (Turku, Finland). In 2018, the retest cutoff in the detection algorithm was updated based on the experience gained in the first year, and changed from 34 to 24 copies/μL. This decreased the retest rate from 3.34 to 1.4% (global retest rate, 2.4%), with a requested second sample rate of 0.23% and a positive detection rate of 0.02%. Lymphocyte phenotype (T, B, NK populations), expression of CD45RA/RO isoforms, percentage and intensity of TCR αβ and TCR γδ, presence of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes, and  lymphocyte proliferation were studied in all patients by flow cytometry. Of 130,903 newborns screened, 30 tested positive, 15 of which were male. During the study period, one patient was diagnosed with SCID: incidence, 1 in 130,903 births in Catalonia. Thirteen patients had clinically significant T-cell lymphopenia (non-SCID) with an incidence of 1 in 10,069 newborns (43% of positive detections). Nine patients were considered false-positive cases because of an initially normal lymphocyte count with normalization of TRECs between 3 and 6 months of life, four infants had transient lymphopenia due to an initially low lymphocyte count with recovery in the following months, and three patients are still under study. The results obtained provide further evidence of the benefits of including this disease in newborn screening programs.

However, there was a striking topological difference between P. aerophilum GalT and the other two enzymes. In the E. coli and human enzymes, the N-terminal chain extends from one subunit into the other and forms part of the substrate-binding pocket in the neighboring subunit. By contrast, the N-terminal chain in P. aerophilum GalT extends to the substrate-binding site in the same subunit. Amino acid sequence alignment showed that a shorter surface loop in the N-terminal region contributes to the unique topology of P. aerophilum GalT. Structural comparison of the substrate-free enzyme with UDP-bound H140F suggests that binding of the glucose moiety of the substrate, but not the UDP moiety, gives rise to a large structural change around the active site. This may in turn provide an appropriate environment for the enzyme reaction. This article is protected by copyright.

Metabolomics studies in humans and diverse mouse populations have revealed associations between diet-derived gut bacterial metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, and intermediates of aromatic amino acid breakdown, with progression of CVD. Functional studies in animals fed diets of defined composition have been instrumental for establishing causal links between these metabolites, the microbes that produce them, dietary substrates and disease. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent progress in our understanding of how gut microbial  of food influences the development of CVD and to outline experimental approaches that can be useful for addressing crucial knowledge gaps in the field. Together, this body of work supports the notion that the gut microbiomes mediate many of the effects of diet.Copyright © 2019.

The human Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (hGAAP, also known as TMBIM4) is a highly conserved Golgi cation channel that modulates intracellular Ca fluxes. Human GAAP is expressed in all human tissues, is essential for cell viability and provides resistance against a range of apoptotic stresses. Furthermore, hGAAP enhances adhesion and cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal adhesions due to activation of store-operated Ca entry. Here, we describe a GA-derived mechanism that controls cell invasion. The overexpression of hGAAP stimulates 3-dimensional proteolytic cell invasion by a mechanism that is dependent on the accumulation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide which might be produced by the hGAAP-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide new insight into the complex mechanisms by which Ca and reactive oxygen species signaling contribute to cell invasion and to the role of the GA in these processes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Participants were randomized between two sequences (placebo followed by MCT or MCT followed by placebo) and took MCT jelly or placebo jelly (canola oil) by mouth three times daily (total daily fat dose: 17.3 g MCT, or 19.7 g canola oil) for 30 days per phase. The primary outcome was cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version (ADAS-Cog-C). The secondary outcome was self-care as measured by the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and changes in plasma metabolites.This study showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in ADAS-Cog-C scores between the MCT (2.62 points below baseline) and placebo interventions (2.57 points above baseline). Data from 46 (86.8%) APOE4 subjects who completed the entire study were analyzed. Changes in ADL scores were not significantly different between the MCT and placebo interventions (p > 0.05). The concentrations of TC, HDL-C, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the MCT group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0 (LysoPC (16:0)), LysoPC (P-18:0), LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)), LysoPC (20:2(11Z,14Z)), and LysoPC (22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)) were significantly increased after MCT intervention, and the concentrations of LysoPC (18:0), palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes appeared after the placebo intervention. Androstenedione concentration increased after placebo intervention. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between changes in LysoPC (P-18:1(9Z)) and ADAS-Cog-C scores after MCT intervention (r = -0.1472, p < 0.05).MCT had positive effects on cognitive ability in mild to moderate AD patients with APOE4.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD where inflammation causes liver damage that can progress to cirrhosis. We have characterized the gut microbiome composition in UK patients with biopsy-proven NASH (n = 65) and compared it to that in healthy controls (n = 76). We report a 7% lower Shannon alpha diversity in NASH patients without cirrhosis (n = 40) compared to controls ( = 2.7x 10) and a 14% drop in NASH patients with cirrhosis (n = 25,  = 5.0x 10). Beta diversity (Unweighted UniFrac distance) was also significantly reduced in both NASH ( = 5.6x 10) and NASH-cirrhosis ( = 8.1x 10) groups. The genus most strongly associated with NASH in this study was  (0.29% abundance in controls, 3.45% in NASH without cirrhosis (False Discovery Rate (FDR)  = .008), and 4.38% in NASH with cirrhosis (FDR  = .02)). This genus, which has been linked previously to obesity and atherosclerosis, was also positively correlated with fasting levels of triglycerides ( = .01) and total cholesterol ( = 1.2x 10) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 2.8x 10) suggesting that some of the  present in this microbial genus may influence lipid  in the host. In patients, we also found decreased abundance of some of the  which are known to produce high levels of short-chain fatty acids which can lower inflammation. This may thus contribute to pathology associated with NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692710>Regulatory Peptide Nesfatin-1 and its Relationship with  Syndrome.</a></h1><p> syndrome is associated with a group of conditions abdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, reduction in low-density lipoprotein, increased blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose. Hence, it poses a risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of  syndrome increases with age. Nesfatin-1, which affects different systems, has recently been discovered as a regulatory peptide molecule. With the discovery of nesfatin-1, it has been reported to inhibit the intake of nutrients and have significant regulatory effects on energy . As nesfatin-1 is present in both central and peripheral tissues, it is thought to have many functions. In addition to its suppressive effect on food intake, nesfatin-1 has also been reported to have an effect on the blood glucose level for regulating cardiac functions and affecting obesity by providing weight loss.

Here, the association between CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR2-5) and prognosis in osteosarcoma was studied.Differences between CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression and overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The associations of CXCR3 expression with clinical features and the prognosis were also analyzed. The signaling  modulated by CXCR3 were investigated. The correlations between CXCR3 and immune infiltrates were investigated.The expression of CXCR2, CXCR4, and CXCR5 was not associated with the prognosis, but CXCR3 low expression was correlated with worse OS and EFS of osteosarcoma, especially for female, patients aged less than 15.1 years, or patients without metastasis. Low CXCR3 expression was related to tumor site and histologic response (P&lt;0.05), but not associated with other clinical characteristics. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that CXCR3 remained independently associated with the prognosis, especially for OS (HR = 3.26, 95% CI = 1.15-9.24, P = 0.026). The cell adhesion, apoptosis, , KRAS, P53, NOTCH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PI3K/Akt/mTOR, VEGF, inflammation, and immune-related  such as IL-6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-α via NF-κB, Toll/NOD-like receptor, and complement were modulated by CXCR3. CXCR3 expression showed an especially positive correlation with immune infiltration of T cells CD8, macrophages M1, plasma cells, and NK cells activated.CXCR3 may be an independent risk factor for the prognosis and was most likely to benefit from immunotherapy in osteosarcoma.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696211>Regulation of human 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase by pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate. Implications for Primary Hyperoxaluria Type-3.</a></h1><p>4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a gatekeeper role in hydroxyproline . Its loss of function in humans causes primary hyperoxaluria type 3, a rare condition characterized by excessive production of oxalate. In this study we investigated the significance of the associated oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity which is also catalyzed by HOGA1. Kinetic studies using the recombinant human enzyme (hHOGA1) and active site mutants showed both these dual activities utilize the same catalytic machinery with micromolar substrate affinities suggesting that both are operative in vivo. Biophysical and structural studies showed that pyruvate was a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant in the micromolar range. By comparison α-ketoglutarate was a weak inhibitor with an inhibition constant in the millimolar range and could only be isolated as an adduct with the active site Lys196 in the presence of sodium borohydride. These studies suggest that pyruvate inhibits HOGA1 activity during gluconeogenesis. We also propose that loss of HOGA1 function could increase oxalate production in primary hyperoxaluria type-3 by decreasing pyruvate availability and  flux through the Krebs cycle.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692249>The Current Status and Future of Andrology: A Consensus Report from the Cairo Workshop Group.</a></h1><p>In attempting to formulate potential WHO guidelines for the diagnosis of male infertility, the Evidence Synthesis Group noted a paucity of high quality data on which to base key recommendations. As a result, a number of authors suggested that key areas of research/evidence gaps should be identified, so that appropriate funding and policy actions could be undertaken to help address key questions.The overall objective of this Consensus workshop was to clarify current knowledge and deficits in clinical laboratory andrology, so that clear paths for future development could be navigated.Following a detailed literature review, each author, prior to the face to face meeting, prepared a summary of their topic and submitted a PowerPoint presentation. The topics covered were (1) Diagnostic testing in male fertility and infertility (2) Male fertility/infertility in the modern world (3) Clinical management of male infertility and (4) The overuse of ICSI. At the meeting in Cairo on 18 February 2019 the evidence was presented and discussed and a series of consensus points agreed.The paper presents a background and summary of the evidence relating to these four topics and addresses key points of significance. Following discussion of the evidence, a total of 36 consensus points were agreed.The Discussion section presents areas where there was further debate and key areas that were highlighted during the day.The consensus points provide clear statements of evidence gaps and/or potential future research areas/topics. Appropriate funding streams addressing these can be prioritized and consequently, in the short and medium term, answers provided.

This essential interaction is globally threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. As such, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning the cnidarian-algal association. Here we investigated phosphorylation-mediated protein signaling as a mechanism of regulation of the cnidarian-algal interaction, and we report on the generation of the first phosphoproteome for the coral model organism Aiptasia. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics in data-independent acquisition allowed consistent quantification of over 3,000 phosphopeptides totaling more than 1,600 phosphoproteins across aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) and symbiotic anemones. Comparison of the symbiotic states showed distinct phosphoproteomic profiles attributable to the differential phosphorylation of 539 proteins that cover a broad range of functions, from receptors to structural and signal transduction proteins. A subsequent pathway enrichment analysis identified the processes of 'protein digestion and absorption,' 'carbohydrate ,' and 'protein folding, sorting, and degradation,' and highlighted differential phosphorylation of the 'phospholipase D signaling pathway' and 'protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.' Targeted phosphorylation of the phospholipase D signaling pathway suggests control of glutamate vesicle trafficking across symbiotic compartments, and phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum machinery suggests recycling of symbiosome-associated proteins. Our study shows for the first time that changes in the phosphorylation status of proteins between aposymbiotic and symbiotic Aiptasia anemones play a role in the regulation of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. This is the first phosphoproteomic study of a cnidarian-algal symbiotic association as well as the first application of quantification by data-independent acquisition in the coral field.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695456>Prevalence and identification of type 1 diabetes in Chinese adults with newly diagnosed diabetes.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) and classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in newly diagnosed adult diabetes in China.This cross-sectional study involved 17,349 newly diagnosed diabetes in adults aged ≥30 years from 46 hospitals within 31 months. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, and medical history were collected by trained researchers. T1DM as a whole was comprised of classic T1DM and LADA. Classic T1DM was identified based on the clinical phenotype of insulin-dependency, and LADA was differentiated from patients with initially an undefined diabetes type with standardized glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody testing at the core laboratory. The age and sex distributions from a large national survey of diabetes in China conducted in 2010 were used to standardize the prevalence of classic T1DM and LADA.Among 17,349 adult patients, the prevalence of T1DM was 5.49% (95% CI: 4.90-6.08%) (5.14% [95% CI: 4.36-5.92%] in males and 6.16% [95% CI: 5.30-7.02%] in females), with 65% of these having LADA. The prevalence of classic T1DM decreased with increasing age (<0.05), while that of LADA was stable (>0.05). The prevalence of T1DM in overweight or obese patients was 3.42% (95% CI: 3.20-3.64%) and 2.42% (95% CI: 1.83-3.01%), respectively, and LADA accounted for 76.5% and 79.2% in these two groups.We draw the conclusion that T1DM, especially LADA, was prevalent in newly diagnosed adult-onset diabetes in China, which highlights the importance of routine islet autoantibodies testing in clinical practice.© 2019 Tang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697692>Transcriptional analysis of amino acid, metal ion, vitamin and carbohydrate uptake in butanol-producing Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-598.</a></h1><p>In-depth knowledge of cell  and nutrient uptake mechanisms can lead to the development of a tool for improving acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation performance and help to overcome bottlenecks in the process, such as the high cost of substrates and low production rates. Over 300 genes potentially encoding transport of amino acids, metal ions, vitamins and carbohydrates were identified in the genome of the butanol-producing strain Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-598, based on similarity searches in protein function databases. Transcriptomic data of the genes were obtained during ABE fermentation by RNA-Seq experiments and covered acidogenesis, solventogenesis and sporulation. The physiological roles of the selected 81 actively expressed transport genes were established on the basis of their expression profiles at particular stages of ABE fermentation. This article describes how genes encoding the uptake of glucose, iron, riboflavin, glutamine, methionine and other nutrients take part in growth, production and stress responses of C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598.

This makes S1R a potential therapeutic target in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Especially, as a missense mutation E102Q in S1R has been reported in few familial ALS cases. However, the pathogenicity of S1RE102Q and the beneficial impact of S1R in the ALS context remain to be demonstrated in vivo. To address this, we generated transgenic Drosophila that express human wild-type S1R or S1RE102Q. Expression of mutant S1R in fly neurons induces abnormal eye morphology and locomotor defects in a dose-dependent manner. This was accompanied by abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced ATP levels and a higher fatigability at the neuromuscular junction during high energy demand. Overexpressing IP3 receptor or glucose transporter mitigates the S1RE102Q-induced eye phenotype, further highlighting the role of calcium and energy  in its toxicity. More importantly, we showed that wild-type S1R rescues locomotor activity and ATP levels of flies expressing the key ALS protein, TDP43. Moreover, overexpressing wild-type S1R enhances resistance of flies to oxidative stress. Therefore, our data provide the first genetic evidence that mutant S1R recapitulates ALS pathology in vivo while increasing S1R confers neuroprotection against TDP43 toxicity.© The Author(s) 2019.

While there have been many studies reporting successful algorithms for predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia, predicting postprandial hypoglycemia still remains a challenge due to extreme glucose fluctuations that occur around mealtimes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of easy-to-use, computationally efficient machine-learning algorithm to predict postprandial hypoglycemia with a unique feature set.We use retrospective CGM datasets of 104 people who had experienced at least one hypoglycemia alert value during a three-day CGM session. The algorithms were developed based on four machine learning models with a unique data-driven feature set: a random forest (RF), a support vector machine using a linear function or a radial basis function, a K-nearest neighbor, and a logistic regression. With 5-fold cross-subject validation, the average performance of each model was calculated to compare and contrast their individual performance. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the F1 score were used as the main criterion for evaluating the performance.In predicting a hypoglycemia alert value with a 30-min prediction horizon, the RF model showed the best performance with the average AUC of 0.966, the average sensitivity of 89.6%, the average specificity of 91.3%, and the average F1 score of 0.543. In addition, the RF showed the better predictive performance for postprandial hypoglycemic events than other models.In conclusion, we showed that machine-learning algorithms have potential in predicting postprandial hypoglycemia, and the RF model could be a better candidate for the further development of postprandial hypoglycemia prediction algorithm to advance the CGM technology and the AP technology further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695251>Molecular and Pathological Events Involved in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes-Associated Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases.

Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic fatty infiltration, now termed "lean-NAFLD". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic fatty acid , thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD.Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set). Liver fat was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD.

In addition to triggering insulin secretion, glucose-induced signal regulates β-cell proliferation and survival. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of glucose on the β-cell functionality still remains unclear. Glucokinase, a hexokinase isozyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, acts as the glucose sensor in the β-cells. To investigate the mechanisms of glucose signaling in the regulation of β-cell functions, we analyzed the role of glucokinase in insulin secretion, β-cell proliferation and β-cell apoptosis, using β-cell-specific glucokinase-haploinsufficient (Gck+/-) mice and allosteric glucokinase activators (GKAs). Glucokinase-mediated glucose  (1) suppresses endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced β-cell apoptosis via inducing insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) expression and expression of ER stress-related molecules, (2) promotes adaptive β-cell proliferation through activation of the Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1)/polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1)/centromere protein-A (CENP-A) pathway, (3) induces islet inflammation by promoting interaction of islet-derived S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) with macrophages, (4) induces the expression of Fibulin-5 (Fbln5), an extracellular matrix protein to regulate β-cell functions, and (5) activates other unknown .

The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and weight gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while body weight at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth, energy  and lipid , which may be associated with body weight in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of body weight traits. We identified QTL for body weight traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating body weight and fat deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693795>A Pharmaceutical Model for the Molecular Evolution of Microbial Natural Products.</a></h1><p>Microbes are talented chemists with the ability to generate tremendously complex and diverse natural products which harbor potent biological activities. Natural products are produced using sets of specialized biosynthetic enzymes encoded by secondary  . Here, we present a two-step evolutionary model to explain the diversification of biosynthetic  that account for the proliferation of these molecules. We argue that the appearance of natural product families has been a slow and infrequent process. The first step led to the original emergence of bioactive molecules and different classes of natural products. However, much of the chemical diversity observed today has resulted from the endless modification of the ancestral biosynthetic . The second step rapidly modulates the pre-existing biological activities to increase their potency and to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We highlight the importance of enzyme promiscuity in this process, as it facilitates both the incorporation of horizontally transferred genes into secondary   and the functional differentiation of proteins to catalyze novel chemistry. We provide examples where single point mutations or recombination events have been sufficient for new enzymatic activities to emerge. A unique feature in the evolution of microbial secondary  is that gene duplication is not essential but offers opportunities to synthesize more complex metabolites. Microbial natural products are highly important for the pharmaceutical industry due to their unique bioactivities. Therefore, understanding the natural mechanisms leading to the formation of diverse   is vital for future attempts to utilize synthetic biology for the generation of novel molecules.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693781>Phosphoinositides in Autophagy: Current Roles and Future Insights.</a></h1><p>Today the importance of autophagy in physiological processes and pathological conditions is undeniable. Initially autophagy merely was described as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to maintain  homeostasis in times of starvation, however in recent years it is now apparent that autophagy is a powerful regulator of many facets of cellular , that its deregulation contributes to various human pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration, and its modulation has considerable potential as a therapeutic approach. Different lipid species, including sphingolipids, sterols, and phospholipids play important roles in the various steps of autophagy. In particular, there is accumulating evidence indicating the minor group of phospholipids called the phosphoinositides as key modulators of autophagy, including the signaling processes underlying autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis and maturation. In this review we discuss the known functions to date of the phosphoinositides in autophagy and attempt to summarize the kinases and phosphatases that regulate them as well as the proteins that bind to them throughout the autophagy program. We will also provide examples of how the control of phosphoinositides and their metabolizing enzymes is relevant to understanding many human diseases.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694039>Glucose and Lipid  Abnormalities among Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease with a prevalence of 1:1,000 births and it is the 4th most common cause of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESDR). Recent reports suggest an association between APDKD and  derangements, particularly impaired glucose .In this cross-sectional study we analyzed data obtained from case records of 189 patients with ADPKD, including kidney transplant recipients, managed in an outpatient department.The mean BMI was 25.4 ± 3.9; 25.25 before and 27.7 after transplan-tation. A fasting glucose level above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) was observed in 60 patients (29%) - 27% without transplantation and 41% kidney transplant recipients. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 17 patients (8.9%), including 3 (2.3%) without a history of transplantation and 14 (24.1%) after kidney transplantation (p < 0.01). We observed dyslipidemia in 30% and hyperuricemia in 53% of patients.Demonstrated  abnormalities should be considered in maintenance of ADPKD patients, including kidney transplant recipients.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

This study had been originally carried out as a project of a research proposed on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, from 1999 to 2004. This nationwide multicenter study on AIs included 3,672 cases with clinically diagnosed AIs, involving 1,874 males and 1,738 females, with mean age 58.1 ± 13.0 years (mean ± SD). In the present study, we focused on the investigation of the real prevalence of various adrenal disorders with AI. The mean nodule size of AI based on computed tomography was 3.0 ± 2.0 cm. Compared to non-functioning adenomas (NFAs), tumor diameters were significantly larger in adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), pheochromocytomas, cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs), myelolipomas, metastatic tumors, cysts, and ganglioneuromas (p < 0.01). Endocrinological evaluations demonstrated that 50.8% of total AIs were non-functioning adenomas, while 10.5%, including 3.6% with subclinical Cushing's syndrome, were reported as CPAs, 8.5% as pheochromocytomas, and 5.1% as aldosterone-producing adenomas. ACCs were accounted for 1.4% (50 cases) among our series of AIs. In conclusion, while almost 50 % of AIs are non-functional adenomas, we must be particularly careful as AIs include pheochromocytomas or adrenal carcinomas, because they may be asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest investigation of AI, thus providing basic information for the establishment of clinical guidelines for the management of AI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696955>The MRL/MpJ mouse strain is not protected from muscle atrophy and weakness after rotator cuff tear.</a></h1><p>Chronic rotator cuff tears are a common source of shoulder pain and disability. Patients with rotator cuff tears often have substantial weakness, fibrosis, and fat accumulation which limit successful surgical repair and postoperative rehabilitation. The Murphy Roths Large (MRL) strain of mice have demonstrated superior healing and protection against pathological changes in several disease and injury conditions. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to the commonly used C57Bl/6 (B6) strain, MRL mice would have less muscle fiber atrophy and fat accumulation, and be protected against the loss in force production that occurs after cuff tear. Adult male B6 and MRL mice were subjected to a rotator cuff tear, and changes in muscle fiber contractility and histology were measured. RNA sequencing, and shotgun metabolomics and lipidomics were also performed. Muscles were harvested one month after tear. B6 and MRL mice had a 40% reduction in relative muscle force production after rotator cuff tear. RNA sequencing identified an increase in fibrosis-associated genes and a reduction in mitochondrial  genes. Markers of glycolytic  increased in B6 mice, while MRL mice appeared to increase amino acid  after tear. There was an accumulation of lipid after injury, although there was a divergent response between B6 and MRL mice in the types of lipid species that accrued. There were strain-specific differences between the transcriptome, metabolome, and lipidome of B6 and MRL mice, but these differences did not protect MRL mice from weakness and pathological changes after rotator cuff tear.

Up to 93% of these patients have some degree of vitamin D insufficiency. Liver plays an important role in the  and pleiotropic functions of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased mortality, bacterial infections, portal hypertension complications, and fibrosis severity. We aimed to determine the impact of vitamin D level in CLD.One hundred fifty individuals consisting of 75 cirrhotic patients (cases) and 75 respective attendants (controls) were enrolled between July 2015 and July 2017. A detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation was done along with estimation of vitamin D level. Unpaired t-test and analysis of variance was used to compare difference in the level of continuous variables between different groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and severity of liver disease.The age of patients ranged from 18 years to 69 years with mean of 48.85 ± 13.6 years in the case group and 46.57 ± 17.24 years in the control group. Out of 75 CLD patients, vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/dl) was found in 31 (41.4%) patients, out of which 14(18.7%) suffered from severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml). On applying analysis of variance test, there was significant difference in vitamin D level and serum albumin and serum bilirubin ( < 0.05). On linear regression, vitamin D level showed significant negative correlation with Child-Pugh score (r = -0.7379,  < 0.0001) and Model For End-Stage Liver Disease score (r = -0.6671,  < 0.0001).Our study concluded that CLD is associated with a significantly low level of vitamin D, which was independent to patient's gender, body mass index, residence, and education level. The findings of our study suggest that awareness of serum vitamin D level in patients with CLD is important. Further studies are required to validate the importance of vitamin D levels and impact of vitamin D supplementation on CLD.© 2019 Indian National Association for Study of the Liver.

To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (adipocyte-specific conditional knockout of H6PDH (H6PDHAcKO) mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction in 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal fat mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) gene expression and reduction in their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of  phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of fat-specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the  phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating obesity and diabetes.© 2019 The Author(s).

The 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (17-OHD) is an uncommon form of CAH caused by variants in the  gene.  We report a novel compound heterozygous  variant and its association with the pathogenesis of 17-OHD.  The patient was assessed for medical history, clinical manifestations, physical examination, laboratory examination, karyotype analysis, and adrenal computed tomography. Mutation screening was conducted using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. The wild-type and mutant  complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) vector. These plasmids were transfected transiently into HEK-293T cells. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis were performed to measure the expression level of P450c17. An enzymatic activity assay was conducted to measure the content of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in medium using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  The proband was characterized by 17-OHD with rhabdomyolysis, hypokalemia, and adrenal insufficiency. Novel compound heterozygous variants of the  gene (c.1304T > C/p.Phe435Ser and c.1228delG/p.Asp410Ilefs*9) were identified. The enzymatic activity assay revealed that this variant resulted in a complete deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. This was consistent with the hormonal characteristics of the proband's blood.  These results suggest that the compound heterozygous variant of c.1304T > C and c.1228delG of the  gene can lead to 17-OHD. Our findings thus provide a novel insight into the clinical evaluations and molecular basis of 17-OHD.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Yuan, Zhang, Jia, Chen, Zhu, Sun, Zhou, Huang, Liang, Yan and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698548>Cholesterol  in the Brain and Its Association with Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the aging population after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Defects in the lysosomal systems and mitochondria have been suspected to cause the pathogenesis of PD. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of PD remains obscure. Abnormal cholesterol  is linked to numerous disorders, including atherosclerosis. The brain contains the highest level of cholesterol in the body and abnormal cholesterol  links also many neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, PD, Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The blood brain barrier effectively prevents uptake of lipoprotein-bound cholesterol from blood circulation. Accordingly, cholesterol level in the brain is independent from that in peripheral tissues. Because cholesterol  in both peripheral tissue and the brain are quite different, cholesterol  associated with neurodegeneration should be examined separately from that in peripheral tissues. Here, we review and compare cholesterol  in the brain and peripheral tissues. Furthermore, the relationship between alterations in cholesterol  and PD pathogenesis is reviewed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693390>Mitochondria: at the crossroads of regulating lung epithelial cell function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</a></h1><p>Disturbances in mitochondrial structure and function in lung epithelial cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such disturbances not only affect cellular energy , but also alter a range of indispensable cellular homeostatic functions in which mitochondria are known to be involved. These range from cellular differentiation, cell death  and cellular remodeling to physical barrier function and innate immunity, all of which are known to be impacted by exposure to cigarette smoke and have been linked to COPD pathogenesis. Next to their well-established role as the first physical frontline against external insults, lung epithelial cells are immunologically active. Malfunctioning epithelial cells with defective mitochondria are unable to maintain homeostasis and respond adequately to further stress or injury, which may ultimately shape the phenotype of lung diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of cigarette smoke on the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in the lung epithelium and highlight the consequences for cell function, innate immune responses, epithelial remodeling and epithelial barrier function in COPD. We also discuss the applicability and potential therapeutic value of recently proposed strategies for the restoration of mitochondrial function in the treatment of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695905>Metabolomics of exercise pulmonary hypertension are intermediate between controls and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.</a></h1><p>Mechanisms underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain elusive. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and exercise PH share similar physiologic consequences; it is debated whether they share biologic mechanisms and if exercise PH represents an early phase of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We conducted an observational study to test if there is a graded  disturbance along the severity of PH, which may indicate shared or disparate pathophysiology. Individuals referred to an academic medical dyspnea center with unexplained exertional intolerance underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We identified controls with no hemodynamic exercise limitation, individuals with exercise PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) < 25 mmHg at rest but ≥ 30 mmHg during exercise without pulmonary venous hypertension) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP > 25 mmHg at rest without pulmonary venous hypertension) ( = 26 in each group). Unbiased metabolomics with chromatography mass spectrometry was performed on pulmonary arterial blood at rest and peak exercise. Random forest analysis and hierarchical clustering were used to quantify metabolite prediction of group membership and rank metabolites which were significantly different between groups. Compared to controls, pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects exhibited perturbations in  involving glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid and complex lipid oxidation, collagen deposition and fibrosis, nucleotide , and others. The  signature of exercise PH was uniquely between that of control and pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects. Accuracy predicting control, exercise PH, and pulmonary arterial hypertension group was 96%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, using paired rest-exercise  changes. Our data suggest the  profile of exercise PH is between that of controls and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698038>Inhaled rapamycin solid lipid nano particles for the treatment of Lymphangioliomyomatosis.</a></h1><p>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of smooth muscle -like cells in the lungs that can spread via the lymphatic system to other parts of the body. The current treatment for LAM, oral rapamycin, is limited by its low oral bioavailability and side effects. This study aims to develop an inhaled formulation of rapamycin solid lipid nanoparticles (Rapa-SLNs) to avoid first-pass , increase in-vivo half-life and facilitate entry into the lymphatic system through the lungs. Rapa-SLNs were manufactured using a hot evaporation technique and freeze-dried overnight with 5% (w/v) mannitol and before being assessed further for particle characteristics and in vitro aerosol performance and release. The formulation's ability to penetrate through bronchial epithelial layer was evaluated using a Calu-3 cell model, while its ability to interfere with the LAM intracellular cascade was evaluated using Mouse Embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient for the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and compared with rapamycin solution. Results showed that the Rapa- SLNs had the appropriate size (237.5 ± 1.8 nm), charge (-11.2), in-vitro aerosol performance (MMAD =5.4 ± 0.4 μm) and sustained release profile suitable for entry into the lymphatic system via the pulmonary route. Additionally, the nanoparticles were transported at a faster rate across the bronchial epithelial layer compared to free rapamycin solution. The formulation also showed similar mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) inhibition properties compared to raw rapamycin, and was able to significantly decrease the amount of proliferation in TSC2 negative MEF cells. This formulation is therefore a promising alternative treatment for LAM patients, as it could potentially reduce problems associated with low bioavailability and side effects of current oral treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Such structures are able to seal but also to allow substances to pass. Within the paracellular pathway, a supramolecular structure, the tight junction transport is largely controlled by the temporospatial regulation of its major protein family called claudins. Besides the fact that the expression of claudins has been identified in different forms of human diseases like cancer, clearly defined mutations in the corresponding claudin genes have been shown to cause distinct human disorders. Such disorders comprise the skin and its adjacent structures, liver, kidney, the inner ear, and the eye. From the phenotype analysis, it has also become clear that different claudins can cause a complex phenotype when expressed in different organs. To gain deeper insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of claudin-associated disorders, several mouse models have been generated. In order to model human disorders in detail, they have been designed either as full knockouts, knock-downs or knock-ins by a variety of techniques. Here, we review human disorders caused by CLDN mutations and their corresponding mouse models that have been generated thus far and assess their usefulness as a model for the corresponding human disorder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694945>Human Cytomegalovirus Alters Host Cell Mitochondrial Function During Acute Infection.</a></h1><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a large DNA herpesvirus that is highly prevalentin the human population. HCMV can result in severe direct and indirect pathologies under immunosuppressed conditions and is the leading cause of birth defects related to infectious disease. Currently, the effect of HCMV infection on host cell  as an increase in glycolysis during infection has been defined. We have observed that oxidative phosphorylation is also increased. We have identified morphological and functional changes to host mitochondria during HCMV infection. The mitochondrial network undergoes fission events after HCMV infection. Interestingly, the network does not undergo fusion. At the same time mitochondrial mass and membrane potential increase. The electron transport chain (ETC) functions at an elevated rate resulting in the release of increased reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, despite the stress applied to the host mitochondria, the network is capable of responding to and meeting the increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands placed on it. When mitochondrial DNA is depleted from the cells, we observed severe impairment of viral replication. Mitochondrial DNA encodes many of the ETC components. These findings suggest that the host cell ETC is essential to HCMV replication. Our studies suggest the host cell mitochondria may be a therapeutic target. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus present in up to 85% of some populations. Like all herpesviruses, HCMV infection is for life. There is no vaccine currently available, neutralizing antibody therapies are ineffective and current antivirals have limited long-term efficacy due to side effects and potential for viral mutation and resistance. The significance of this research is in understanding how HCMV manipulates the host mitochondria to support bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements for replication. Despite a large genome, HCMV relies exclusively on host cells for  functions. By understanding the dependency of HCMV on the mitochondria, we could exploit these requirements and develop novel antivirals.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696405> Imaging in Cardio-oncology.</a></h1><p>Tremendous progress in cancer detection and therapy has improved survival.

We have previously shown that PC is overexpressed in highly invasive cancer cell lines where it supports biosynthesis during rapid cell growth. Here, we show that miR-143-3p suppresses the expression of PC in MDA-MB-231 cells by targeting its conserved binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of human PC mRNA. Incorporation of the PC 3'UTR into a luciferase reporter gene inhibited expression of luciferase by 50% while mutation of the miR-143-3p binding site abrogated this inhibitory effect in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in low aggressive MCF-7 cell line. Transfection of miR-143-3p mimic or overexpression of miR-143-3p using tetracycline-inducible system in MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated expression of both endogenous PC mRNA and protein by 40% and 50% respectively, confirming the regulatory role of miR-143-3p in PC expression.
