Improves Neuropathological Hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease in Female APPswe/PS1dE9 Mice Fed with a High Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment in cognitive performance in aged individuals. Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment that cures the disease due to the lack of knowledge on the actual mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. In the last decades, the amyloidogenic hypothesis has been the most studied theory trying to explain the origin of AD, yet it does not address all the concerns relating to its development. In the present study, a possible new preclinical treatment of AD was evaluated using the ethyl  extract (EAE) of leaves of Ugni molinae Turcz. (synonym Myrtus ugni Molina Family Myrtacea). The effects were assessed on female transgenic mice from a preclinical model of familial AD (APPswe/PS1dE9) combined with a high fat diet. This preclinical model was selected due to the already available experimental and observational data proving the relationship between , gender, metabolic stress, and cognitive dysfunction; related to characteristics of sporadic AD. According to chemical analyses, EAE would contain polyphenols such as tannins, flavonoid derivatives, and phenolic acids, as well as pentacyclic triterpenoids that exhibit neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. In addition, the treatment evidenced its capacity to prevent deterioration of memory capacity and reduction of progression speed of AD neuropathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050748>Human Milk Short-Chain Fatty Acid Composition is Associated with Adiposity Outcomes in Infants.</a></h2><p>Presumed benefits of human milk (HM) in avoiding rapid infancy weight gain and later  could relate to its nutrient composition. However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, , and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM  was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM SCFA function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28243360>Immune Profile of Obese People and In Vitro Effects of Red Grape Polyphenols on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.</a></h2><p>The in vitro ability of polyphenols, extracted from red grape, to modulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses has been evaluated in 20 obese (Ob) people. With regard to cytokine release in response to phorbol myristate  (PMA), levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon- (IFN-), IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 were higher in the Ob than in healthy (H) subjects. , IL-21 concentrations were detected only in H people but they were undetectable in the Ob counterpart. In general terms, levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor- were higher in Ob people when compared to H controls. On the other hand, polyphenols did not modify IFN-, IL-4, and IL-17 levels. However, an increase in IL-2 was observed in H individuals, whereas its levels were decreased in the Ob counterpart. Polyphenols significantly increased IL-10 release from H donors, whereas a trend to increase was observed in Ob people. In addition, polyphenols were able to significantly increase levels of H IL-21, while this was not the case in Ob people. Since IL-21 is an inducer of Th17 cells, it is likely that polyphenols may suppress the sources of this cytokine  production of IL-10. Accordingly, polyphenols decreased IL-1 and IL-6 release in comparison to H controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005919>Inulin fiber dose-dependently modulates energy balance, glucose tolerance, gut microbiota, hormones and diet preference in high-fat-fed male rats.</a></h2><p>Inulin, a popular prebiotic fiber, has been reported to promote satiety and fat loss; however, the dose-response effects of inulin on energy balance and diet preference, and whether the metabolic effects are independent of calorie restriction are not well characterized. Therefore, we compared the effects of diets varying in inulin concentrations on food intake, energy expenditure, body composition, gut microbiota and hormones, and assessed whether inulin-induced hypophagia was due to reduced diet preference. In experiment 1, male rats were randomized to six high-fat diet groups: control (CON, 0% inulin), 2.5% inulin (2.5IN), 10% inulin (10IN), 25% inulin (25IN), 25% cellulose (25CE) or pair-fed to 25IN (25PF) for 21 days. We demonstrate that inulin dose-dependently decreased caloric intake and respiratory quotient; improved glucose tolerance; increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacterium spp.; decreased Clostridium clusters I and IV; increased butyryl-CoA: CoA-transferase in cecum; upregulated peptide YY, cholecystokinin and proglucagon transcripts in the cecum and colon; and increased plasma peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations. Importantly, unlike 25PF, 25IN attenuated the reduction in energy expenditure associated with calorie restriction and decreased adiposity. In experiment 2, following four training periods, diet preferences were determined. Although 10IN and 25IN decreased caloric intake, and 25CE increased caloric intake, during training, all high-fiber diets were less preferred. Taken together, this work demonstrates that inulin dose-dependently decreased caloric intake, modulated gut microbiota and upregulated satiety hormones, with metabolic effects being largely independent of caloric restriction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

BPA is one of the known xenoestrogens, which have weak estrogenic activity and cause , diabetes, breast cancer, and reproductive disorders. Even though the concentration level of metabolomes in hair is usually lower than that in urine and blood, there are several reasons why we chose to use hair samples. First, the sampling procedure of hairs is simple. Second, it is also easy to preserve the sample for long term and track the drug-exposure record of a given sample. Third, deformation and contamination of samples rarely occur. In this study, an improved analytical method to determine the levels of BPA and estrogens in hair samples was developed by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS). Hair samples were extracted by an Oasis HLB extraction cartridge after incubation with 1N HCl and derivatized with dansyl chloride to increase sensitivity. BPA and estrogens (estrone, 17β-estradiol, and estriol) were separated using Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C column (2.0×100mm, 3μm) and a mobile phase consisting of 10mM ammonium  in water and acetonitrile with a gradient program at a flow rate of 0.3mL/min and were monitored with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The linearity of this method was over 0.995. The limits of detection (LOD) at a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3 were 0.25-6.0ng/g. The alteration of estrogens levels induced by BPA may play important role to understanding probable endocrine disruptive exposure, and the described methods could be used to evaluate and monitor exposure of endocrine disruptor.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

(EFAD) on metabolic syndrome that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in  experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell. In  tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce . EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on -induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving metabolic syndrome that is caused by HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591297>Biological Evaluation of Natural and Synthesized Homovanillic Acid Esters as Inhibitors of Intestinal Fatty Acid Uptake in Differentiated Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>With raising prevalence of , the regulation of human body fat is increasingly relevant. The modulation of fatty acid uptake by enterocytes represents a promising target for body weight maintenance. Recent results demonstrated that the trigeminal active compounds capsaicin, nonivamide, and -pellitorine dose-dependently reduce fatty acid uptake in differentiated Caco-2 cells as a model for the intestinal barrier. However, non-pungent alternatives have not been investigated and structural determinants for the modulation of intestinal fatty acid uptake have not been identified so far. Thus, based on the previous results, we synthesized 23 homovanillic acid esters in addition to the naturally occurring capsiate and screened them for their potential to reduce intestinal fatty acid uptake using the fluorescent fatty acid analog Bodipy-C12 in differentiated Caco‑2 cells as an enterocyte model. Whereas pre-incubation with 100 µM capsiate did not change fatty acid uptake by Caco-2 enterocytes, a maximum inhibition of -47% was reached using 100 µM 1‑methylpentyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl). Structural analysis of the 24 structural analogues tested in the present study revealed that a branched fatty acid side chain, independent of the chain length, is one of the most important structural motifs associated with inhibition of fatty acid uptake in Caco-2 enterocytes. The results of the present study may serve as an important basis for designing potent dietary inhibitors of fatty acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925443>Effects of SCFA on the DNA methylation pattern of adiponectin and resistin in high-fat-diet-induced obese male mice.</a></h2><p>Specific adipokines, such as adiponectin and resistin, are secreted from adipose tissue and are associated with the development of . Supplementation of dietary SCFA can prevent and reverse high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced . However, it is not clear whether SCFA ameliorate abnormal expression of adiponectin and resistin in the obese state. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SCFA on adiponectin and resistin's expressions in diet-induced obese mice, as well as the potential mechanisms associated with DNA methylation. C57BL/6J male mice were fed for 16 weeks with five types of HFD (34·9 % fat by wt., 60 % kJ) - a control HFD and four HFD with  (HFD-A), propionate (HFD-P), butyrate (HFD-B) and their admixture (HFD-SCFA). Meanwhile, a low-fat diet (4·3 % fat by wt., 10 % kJ) was used as the control group. The reduced mRNA levels of adiponectin and resistin in the adipose tissue of the HFD-fed mice were significantly reversed by dietary supplementation of , propionate, butyrate or their admixture to the HFD. Moreover, the expressional changes of adiponectin and resistin induced by SCFA were associated with alterations in DNA methylation at their promoters, which was mediated by reducing the expressions of enzyme-catalysed DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1, 3a, 3b) and the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and suppressing the binding of these enzymes to the promoters of adiponectin and resistin. Our results indicate that SCFA may correct aberrant expressions of adiponectin and resistin in  by epigenetic regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27725441>Perturbed Calcineurin-NFAT Signaling Is Associated with the Development of Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic disorder, is caused by trisomy 21. DS is accompanied by heart defects, hearing and vision problems, , leukemia, and other conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In comparison, most cancers are rare in people with DS. Overexpression of dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A and a regulator of calcineurin 1 located on chromosome 21 leads to excessive suppression of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway, resulting in reduced expression of a critical angiogenic factor. However, it is unclear whether the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway is involved in AD pathology in DS patients. Here, we investigated the association between the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway and AD using neuronal cells. Short-term pharmacological stimulation decreased gene expression of tau and neprilysin, and long-term inhibition of the signaling pathway decreased that of amyloid precursor protein. Moreover, a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A, also decreased neprilysin activity, leading to increases in amyloid-β peptide levels. Taken together, our results suggest that a dysregulation in calcineurin-NFAT signaling may contribute to the early onset of AD in people with DS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384448>Phytochemical and Biological Profile of  (L.) DC.: An Inhibitor of Pancreatic Lipase.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic lipase, a key enzyme for lipid absorption, is one of the most important targets for the treatment of , while natural compounds have recently attracted much interest as potential inhibitors of this enzyme. Here, in an attempt to find new effective agents, the methanolic extract from  (L.) DC. and its sub-extracts were investigated for their potential inhibitory activity. The ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase was verified through the in vitro evaluation of the prevention of -nitrophenyl caprylate hydrolysis. The antioxidant activity was also verified by means of DPPH and β-carotene bleaching tests. Compositional profiling revealed that flavonoid glycosides were the main specialized metabolites present in the methanolic extract from the aerial parts of the plant with kaempferol and quercetin representing the two -glycosylated aglycones. Kaempferol-3--β-(2″--glucosyl)-rutinoside and kaempferol-3--arabinosyl-7--rhamnoside were the most abundant flavonols. The crude methanolic extract and the dichloromethane and ethyl  sub-extracts showed a strong lipase inhibitory activity, with IC values of 2.06 ± 0.02, 1.52 ± 0.02 and 1.31 ± 0.02 mg/mL, respectively. The best capacity to scavenge DPPH radical was detected for the ethyl  sub-extract (IC = 171.9 ± 1.0 µg/mL), which was also effective in protecting linoleic acid from peroxidation (IC = 35.69 ± 2.30 µg/mL).

Study procedures took place during clinical research unit admissions, where participants received a standardized meal and each study drug, in random order, during two separate 24-h admissions. Study staff collected 14 blood specimens (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 48h). We evaluated serum concentrations of LNG and UPA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and estimated the PK parameters of both drugs using noncompartmental analysis. The main outcome of this study was a comparison of between-group differences in AUC.Thirty-two women completed the study (16 in each group). Among normal-BMI and obese-BMI participants, the mean BMIs were 22.0 (range 18.8-24.6) and 34.3 (range 30.6-39.9), respectively. After LNG-EC, mean AUC and maximum concentration (C) were 50% lower among obese-BMI women than among normal-BMI women (AUC 100.8 vs. 208.5ng*h/mL, IQR 35.8, IQR 74.2, p≤.01; C 10.8 vs. 18.2ng/mL, p=.01). After UPA-EC, AUC and C were similar between obese-BMI and normal-BMI women (AUC 362.5 vs. 293.5ng*h/mL, IQR 263.2, IQR 112.5, p=.15; C 95.6 vs. 89.3ng/mL, p=.70).After a single dose of EC, obese-BMI women are exposed to lower concentrations of LNG and similar concentrations of UPA, when compared to normal-BMI women.Differences in LNG-EC PK by BMI group may underlie and account for the lower LNG-EC efficacy reported among obese-BMI women, but modest differences in UPA-EC PK by BMI group provide less support for variable efficacy. A pharmacodynamic study may be able to clarify whether these PK differences account for observed differences in LNG-EC and UPA-EC efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Human GUT serves as the host of the majority of different bacterial populations (GUT flora, more than 500 species), which are with us ("from the beginning") in an innate manner known as the commensal (no harm to each other) and symbiotic (mutual benefit) relationship. A homeostatic balance of host-bacteria relationship is very important and vital for a normal health process. However, this beneficial relationship and delicate homeostatic state can be disrupted by the imbalance of microbiome-composition of gut microbiota, expressing a pathogenic state. A strict homeostatic balance of microbiome-composition strongly depends on several factors; 1- lifestyle, 2- geography, 3- ethnicities, 4- "mom" as prime of the type of bacterial colonization in infant and 5- the disease. With such diversity in individuals combined with huge number of different bacterial species and their interactions, it is wise to perform an in-depth systems biology (e.g. genomics, proteomics, glycomics, and etcetera) analysis of personalized microbiome. Only in this way, we are able to generate a map of complete GUT microbiota and, in turn, to determine its interaction with host and intra-interaction with pathogenic bacteria. A specific microbiome analysis provides us the knowledge to decipher the nature of interactions between the GUT microbiota and the host and its response to the invading bacteria in a pathogenic state. The GUT-bacteria composition is independent of geography and ethnicity but lifestyle well affects GUT-bacteria composition and function. Microbiome knowledge obtained by systems biology also helps us to change the behavior of GUT microbiota in response to the pathogenic microbes as protection. Functional microbiome changes in response to environmental factors will be discussed in this review.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We also present an overview of recent studies on that topic.Unicentric retrospective observational study and review of recent literature.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University, University Hospital Brno.The results of recent relevant studies and reviews published in English until December 2017 were used for the review. The publications were searched using the PubMed server. All patients diagnosed in our oncogynecological center between 2010 and 2016 and who were treated hormonally - either in primary therapy or in relapse settings, were included in our study. We were interested in age, BMI, stage of disease, histological type and grade of tumor, occurrence of adverse effects, duration of survival, reasons for choosing hormonal therapy. Medroxyprogesterone- or megestrol- was used in the treatment.Between 2010 and 2016, 415 malignant tumors of the uterus were diagnosed in our oncology center. Recurrence of the disease occurred in 31 patients (8%), on average 16 months after primary treatment. Primary hormonal therapy was used in only 19 patients (5%), mostly because of contraindications of another treatment due to high age, comorbidities or . Median age of patients was 83 years, mean BMI 41, median survival of patients who died was 8 months. Five patients (16%) were treated hormonally for the recurrence. Median survival from diagnosis of recurrence was 20 months. One patient (4%) experienced partial pulmonary embolism.Hormonal therapy plays an irreplaceable role in uterine cancer patients, especially in primary non-operable patients, in treatment of a relapse, or in a fertility-sparing procedure.

Rates of endometrial cancer are rising, in part because of rising  rates. Endometrial hyperplasia is a precancerous condition in women that can lead to endometrial cancer if left untreated. Endometrial hyperplasia occurs more commonly than endometrial cancer. Progesterone tablets currently used to treat women with endometrial hyperplasia are associated with adverse effects in up to 84% of women. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Mirena Coil, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA) may improve compliance, but it is invasive, is not acceptable to all women, and is associated with irregular vaginal bleeding in 82% of cases. Therefore, an alternative treatment for women with endometrial hyperplasia is needed. Metformin, a drug that is often used to treat people with diabetes, has been shown in some human studies to reverse endometrial hyperplasia. However, the effectiveness and safety of metformin for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia remain uncertain.To determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin in treating women with endometrial hyperplasia.We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and two trials registers from inception to 10 January 2017. We searched the bibliographies of all included studies and reviews on this topic. We also handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 2015 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2015.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials comparing metformin (used alone or in combination with other medical therapies) versus placebo or no treatment, any conventional medical treatment, or any other active intervention for women with histologically confirmed endometrial hyperplasia of any type.Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data from included studies, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by deferment to a third review author. When study details were missing, review authors contacted study authors. The primary outcome of this review was regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology (with or without atypia) towards normal histology. Secondary outcome measures included recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia, progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, hysterectomy rate, abnormal uterine bleeding, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects during treatment.We included three RCTs in which a total of 77 women took part. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all outcomes owing to very serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting, attrition, and limitations in study design) and imprecision.We performed a meta-analysis of two trials with 59 participants. When metformin was compared with megestrol  in women with endometrial hyperplasia, we found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 11.57, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), hysterectomy rates (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), and rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 44 , very low-quality evidence). We found no data for recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia or health-related quality of life. Both studies (n = 59) provided data on progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer as well as one (n = 16) reporting some adverse effects in the metformin arm, notably nausea, thrombosis, lactic acidosis, abnormal liver and renal function among others.Another trial including 16 participants compared metformin plus megestrol  versus megestrol  alone in women with endometrial hyperplasia. We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (OR 9.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 86.52, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence), recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia among women who achieve regression (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 8, very low-quality evidence), progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 13, very low-quality evidence), or hysterectomy rates (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.37, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence). Investigators provided no data on abnormal uterine bleeding or health-related quality of life. In terms of adverse effects, three of eight participants (37.5%) in the metformin plus megestrol  study arm reported nausea.At present, evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of metformin alone or in combination with standard therapy - specifically, megestrol  - versus megestrol  alone, for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials yielding long-term outcome data are needed to address this clinical question.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain fatty acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced  and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in  development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/browning markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29999143>[Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome in a infant due to prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.

Bioactivity guided isolation approach was used to identify active constituent for anti-adipogenesis and PL inhibition assay. Inhibition of lipid accumulation and adipogenic transcription factor was measured by oil Red 'O' staining and quantitative real-time PCR method respectively.Ethyl  extract of Oroxylum indicum bark was found to be most active in screening of anti-adipogenesis (59.12±1.66% lipid accumulation as compared to control at 50μg/mL dose) and PL inhibition (89.12±6.87% PL inhibition at 250μg/mL dose) assays. Further, three bioactive flavonoids were isolated and identified as oroxylin A, chrysin and baicalein from O. indicum bark. Oroxylin A, chrysin, and baicalein were inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (75.00±5.76%, 70.21±4.23% and 77.21±5.49% lipid accumulation respectively in comparison to control at 50μM dose) and PL enzyme (69.86±2.96%, 52.08±2.14% and 45.06±2.42% PL inhibition respectively at 250μg/mL dose). In addition, oroxylin A and chrysin also inhibited PPARγ and C/EBPα, major adipogenic transcription factors, in 3T3L-1 preadipocytes during adipogenesis process at 50μM dose.The present study augurs the anti- potential of well practiced Ayurvedic herb O. indicum and its flavonoids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, beyond changes in LDL cholesterol, we lack a complete understanding of the physiologic alterations that occur when improving dietary fat quality.The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of metabolic alterations paralleling improvements in the fat quality of the diet.We recently conducted an 8-wk, double-blind, randomized controlled trial replacing SFAs with PUFAs in healthy subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n = 99). In the present substudy, we performed comprehensive metabolic profiling with multiple platforms (both nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based technology) (n = 99), and analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression (n = 95) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.A large number of lipoprotein subclasses, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, and kynurenine were reduced when SFAs were replaced with PUFAs. In contrast, bile acids, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, , and acetoacetate were increased by the intervention. Some amino acids were also altered by the intervention. The mRNA levels of LXRA and LDLR were increased, in addition to several liver X receptor α target genes and genes involved in inflammation, whereas the mRNA levels of UCP2 and PPARD were decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after replacing SFAs with PUFAs. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the 30 most important variables that contributed to class separation spanned all classes of biomarkers, and was in accordance with the univariate analysis.Applying metabolomics in randomized controlled dietary intervention trials has the potential to extend our knowledge of the biological and molecular effects of dietary fat quality.

Garcinia cambogia (GC) was used as the positive control, and was administered in the same manner as CIEA. Results showed CIEA reduced HFD-induced body weight gain, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and liver weight. In addition, CIEA significantly decreased serum lipid profiles, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) levels. Furthermore, CIEA also reduced leptin levels and increased adiponectin levels in serum, and significantly decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [Formula: see text] (PPAR[Formula: see text]) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EPBs) levels, but increased PPAR[Formula: see text] level and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in eWATs and in the liver tissues of HFD fed obese mice.

We repeated the work in FINRISK 1997 (n = 7330; 133 HFH events during 5-year follow-up). In PROSPER, the circulating concentrations of 13 metabolic measures were found to be significantly different in those who were later hospitalised for heart failure after correction for multiple comparisons. These included creatinine, phenylalanine, glycoprotein acetyls, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and various high-density lipoprotein measures. In Cox models, two metabolites were associated with risk of HFH after adjustment for clinical risk factors and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP): phenylalanine [hazard ratio (HR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.53; P = 0.002] and  (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.98; P = 0.026).

The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing energy intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group. Epididymal adipocyte volume was reduced in GbE-supplemented rats, as were epididymal [1-C]- incorporation into fatty acids, perilipin () and fatty acid synthase () mRNA, and FAS protein levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy in  is associated with insulin resistance, and in the present study we observed a reduction in the adipocyte volume of GbE-supplemented obese rats to dimensions equivalent to adipocytes from non-obese rats. GbE supplementation significantly reduced  accumulation and tended to reduce [H]-oleate incorporation, into epididymal adipose tissue, suggesting a potentially anti-obesogenic effect in longer term therapies. Further studies that investigate the effects of GbE supplementation in other experimental models are required to fully elucidate its suggested beneficial effects on mild chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27923166>A comparative systematic review of Yasmin (drospirenone pill) versus standard treatment options for symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>To systematically review the impact of Yasmin (drospirenone pill) compares with other standard treatments for symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials in women with PCOS treated with drospirenone were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted.Eighteen articles were included. Compared with drospirenone (DRSP) monotherapy, DRSP plus metformin was better in reducing body mass index (BMI), luteinizing hormone (LH) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Compared with metformin, DRSP was better in modulating serum total testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and free androgen index (FAI), while metformin was more effective in reducing BMI, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and Triglyceride (TG). DRSP was superior to cyproterone  (CPA) in reducing TC and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). DRSP shows better effect in modulating LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with desogestrel (DSG).The available data suggested that DRSP was effective in modulating hormones, insulin and lipid metabolism in women with PCOS. Compared with commonly used drugs for symptoms of PCOS as CPA and DSG, DRSP shows identical or better effect in improving symptoms and protect cardiovascular system.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of  is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of .Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of energy metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the energy charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from energy metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation.

We previously reported that in the absence of t10,c12-CLA, mice forced to lose equivalent body weight by food restriction (FR) do not exhibit increases in fat oxidation or energy expenditure but have improved glucose metabolism, consistent with FR as a metabolically healthy weight-loss method.Because diet is a primary determinant of gut bacterial populations, we hypothesized that the disparate metabolic effects accompanying weight loss from t10,c12-CLA or FR could be related to altered intestinal microbiota.Ten-week-old male LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHS; 36% lard fat, 36.2% sucrose + 0.15% cholesterol) for 12 wk (baseline), then switched to the HFHS diet alone (obese control), HFHS + 1% c9,t11-CLA (obese fatty acid control), HFHS + 1% t10,c12-CLA (weight-loss-inducing fatty acid), or HFHS + FR (weight-loss control group with 75-85% ad libitum HFHS food intake) for a further 8 wk. Fecal microbial content, short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, ), tissue CLA concentrations, and intestinal nutrient transporter expression were quantified.Mice fed t10,c12-CLA or assigned to FR lost 14.5% of baseline body weight. t10,c12-CLA-fed mice had elevated concentrations of fecal butyrate (2-fold) and plasma  (1.5-fold) compared with HFHS-fed controls. Fecal α diversity decreased by 7.6-14% in all groups. Butyrivibrio and Roseburia, butyrate-producing microbes, were enriched over time by t10,c12-CLA. By comparing with each control group, we also identified bacterial genera significantly enriched in the t10,c12-CLA recipients, including Lactobacillus, Actinobacteria, and the newly identified Ileibacterium valens of the Allobaculum genus, whereas other taxa were enriched by FR, including Clostridiales and Bacteroides.Modalities resulting in equivalent weight loss but with divergent metabolic effects are associated with compositional differences in the mouse intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857204>Optimization of Phlorotannins Extraction from  and Evaluation of Their Potential to Prevent Metabolic Disorders.</a></h2><p>Phlorotannins are phloroglucinol-based phenolic compounds, occurring particularly in brown macroalgae, that have been recognized for their promising bioactive properties.

The maximum total phlorotannin content, determined using the 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMBA) method, corresponded to 2.92 ± 0.05 mg of phloroglucinol equivalents/g dry seaweed (mg PGE/g DS), and was achieved for extracts carried out with acetone 67% (v/v), a solvent-solid ratio of 70 mL/g and temperature at 25 °C. This crude extract, together with a semi-purified phlorotannin fraction, were further evaluated for their anti-enzymatic capacity against α-glucosidase, α-amylase and pancreatic lipase, both showing promising inhibitory effects, particularly against α-glucosidase for which a greater inhibitory effect was observed compared to the pharmaceutical drug acarbose (IC = 4.5 ± 0.8 and 0.82 ± 0.3 μg/mL, respectively, against 206.6 ± 25.1 μg/mL). Additionally, the ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis carried out on the ethyl  fraction revealed the presence of fucols, fucophlorethols, fuhalols and several other phlorotannin derivatives. Moreover, possible new phlorotannin compounds, including fucofurodiphlorethol, fucofurotriphlorethol and fucofuropentaphlorethol, have been tentatively identified in this extract.

This study investigated the effects of colonic administration of physiologically relevant SCFA mixtures on human substrate and energy metabolism. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, twelve normoglycaemic men (BMI 25-35 kg/m) underwent four investigational days, during which SCFA mixtures (200 mmol/L) high in either  (HA), propionate (HP), butyrate (HB) or placebo (PLA) were rectally administered during fasting and postprandial conditions (oral glucose load). Before and for two hours after colonic infusions, indirect calorimetry was performed and blood samples were collected. All three SCFA mixtures increased fasting fat oxidation (P < 0.01), whilst resting energy expenditure increased after HA and HP compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, all three SCFA mixtures increased fasting and postprandial plasma peptide YY (PYY) concentrations, and attenuated fasting free glycerol concentrations versus PLA (P < 0.05). Colonic infusions of SCFA mixtures, in concentrations and ratios reached after fibre intake, increased fat oxidation, energy expenditure and PYY, and decreased lipolysis in overweight/obese men.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cherry supplementation on the gut bacterial composition, concentrations of caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and biomarkers of gut health using an  model of . Obese diabetic (db/db) mice received a supplemented diet with 10% cherry powder (supplemented mice,  = 12) for 12 weeks; obese ( = 10) and lean ( = 10) mice served as controls and received a standard diet without cherry. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze the gut microbiota; SCFAs and biomarkers of gut health were also measured using standard techniques. According to 16S sequencing, supplemented mice harbored a distinct colonic microbiota characterized by a higher abundance of mucin-degraders (i.e., ) and fiber-degraders (the S24-7 family) as well as lower abundances of  and Enterobacteriaceae. Overall this particular cherry-associated colonic microbiota did not resemble the microbiota in obese or lean controls based on the analysis of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics. qPCR confirmed some of the results observed in sequencing, thus supporting the notion that cherry supplementation can change the colonic microbiota. Moreover, the SCFAs detected in supplemented mice (caproate, methyl butyrate, propionate,  and valerate) exceeded those concentrations detected in obese and lean controls except for butyrate. Despite the changes in microbial composition and SCFAs, most of the assessed biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal health in colon tissues and mucosal cells were similar in all obese mice with and without supplementation. This paper shows that dietary supplementation with cherry powder for 12 weeks affects the microbiota and the concentrations of SCFAs in the lower intestinal tract of obese db/db diabetic mice. These effects occurred in absence of differences in most biomarkers of inflammation and other parameters of gut health. Our study prompts more research into the potential clinical implications of cherry consumption as a dietary supplement in diabetic and obese human patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290249>In vitro and in silico Studies of Mangiferin from Aphloia theiformis on Key Enzymes Linked to Diabetes Type 2 and Associated Complications.</a></h2><p>Mangiferin, was identified in the crude methanol extract, ethyl , and n-butanol fractions of Aphloia theiformis (Vahl.)

Mangiferin was docked to both allosteric and orthosteric sites of α-glucosidase by π-π interactions. However, several hydrogen bonds were observed at the orthosteric position, suggesting a preference for this site. The docking of mangiferin on AChE with the catalytic pocket occupied by paraoxon could be attributed to π-π stacking involving amino acid residues, Trp341 and Trp124.This study provided an insight of the molecular interaction of mangiferin with the studied enzymes and can be considered as a valuable tool for designing new drugs for better management of these diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888539>Glutamate interactions with , insulin resistance, cognition and gut microbiota composition.</a></h2><p>To investigate the interactions among fecal and plasma glutamate levels, insulin resistance cognition and gut microbiota composition in obese and non-obese subjects.Gut microbiota composition (shotgun) and plasma and fecal glutamate, glutamine and  (NMR) were analyzed in a pilot study of obese and non-obese subjects (n = 35).

However, it remained unclear whether this effect was dependent on the disease state or the antecedent cause of hypoglycemia. We aimed to establish whether exposure to fasting-induced hypoglycemia was sufficient to produce alterations in GAM in non-diabetic individuals.GAM was measured via carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy during infusion of [1-C]  before and after a 72-h fast in six metabolically healthy men. All participants were male, aged 18-40 years, with a Body Mass Index of 20.0-27.9 kg/m, who consented to reside at Pennington Biomedical Research Center for 4 days. The main outcome measure was the percent enhancement of cerebral [1-C] bicarbonate (the primary metabolic byproduct of glial oxidation of [1-C] ). Continuous glucose monitoring was used to measure hypoglycemic episodes during the 72-h fast.As expected, 72 h of fasting significantly reduced blood glucose levels and resulted in a high frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Steady-state GAM increased from 53.5 ± 3.7 to 61.9 ± 1.7% following the 72-h fast (p = 0.005). This increase correlated with greater duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the fast (r = 0.967). In addition, subjects with greater GAM at baseline experienced a greater increase in the duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the 72-h fast (r = 0.979).GAM has potential as a biomarker for susceptibility to hypoglycemic episodes.Clinicaltrials.gov ID: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108679>Therapeutic drug monitoring and use of an adjusted body weight strategy for high-dose voriconazole therapy.</a></h2><p>A high-dose 12 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg twice daily) voriconazole regimen was recommended by the CDC to treat patients injected with contaminated methylprednisolone  that caused a multi-state fungal outbreak in 2012-13. Therapeutic drug monitoring results of this unique regimen are unknown, as is the most appropriate dosing weight for obese patients. We evaluated voriconazole trough measurements for this dosing scheme, as well as the use of adjusted body weight dosing for obese patients.Voriconazole trough levels were analysed in obese (BMI ≥35 kg/m 2 ) and non-obese (BMI <35 kg/m 2 ) patients who were given initial therapy with 12 mg/kg/day.Of 138 patients, the first steady-state voriconazole troughs were supratherapeutic (>5 mg/L) in 65 (47%) patients, therapeutic (2-5 mg/L) in 57 (41%) patients and subtherapeutic (<2 mg/L) in 16 (12%) patients. Twenty-three patients had pre-steady-state dose decreases due to supratherapeutic levels, with subsequent first steady-state troughs in the therapeutic ( n  =   17) and subtherapeutic ( n  =   6) categories. Voriconazole doses >11 and >8 mg/kg/day produced mainly first steady-state supratherapeutic troughs in 44 obese and 94 non-obese patients, respectively. An initial 12 mg/kg/day was progressively lowered to a median maintenance dose of 8.5 mg/kg/day in the obese and 8.6 mg/kg/day in the non-obese.A high-dose voriconazole regimen produced initial supratherapeutic troughs that required dose adjustment downward by nearly 30%. Adjusted body weight dosing in obese patients resulted in a similar maintenance dose to total body weight dosing in the non-obese, and appears to be a sensible dosing strategy for these patients.© The Author 2017.

In addition, female sex is associated with a lower risk of cardiac ischemic events and smaller infarct size compared to males. The objective of the present work was to study the metabolic phenotype and mitochondrial function associated to female sex and short-term high-fat diet. H NMR spectra of mice heart extracts were analysed by mRMR variable selection and linear discriminant analysis was used to evaluate metabolic changes. In separate experiments, O consumption and HO production were measured from isolated mitochondria as well as serum oxidation susceptibility. Fingerprinting showed that male hearts contained more myo-inositol, taurine and glutamate than female hearts. HFD reduced the levels of creatine, taurine citrate and . Profiling showed increased alanine and fumarate in HFD suggesting altered glycolitic and Krebs cycle pathways. Female mice contained less glucose than males. Female sex nor HFD altered mitochondria oxygen consumption but both conditions reduced the amount of HO produced in an additive manner. Serum of females had lower oxidation susceptibility than serum from males but there were no differences associated with HFD. In conclusion, female sex and short-term HFD have an effect on the myocardial metabolic pattern and reduce the amount of HO produced by mitochondria in an additive manner suggesting different mechanisms of action. This could explain, at least in part, the protection afforded by female sex and the " paradox".Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

As tons of industrial waste is obtained while processing the daidai juice, additional utilization of this waste has great social value. In our study, we prepared the essential oil from the waste obtained during daidai juice processing and demonstrated that the oil activates human TRPA1 (hTRPA1). This oil contains 10 types of terpenes, all of which activated hTRPA1 with an EC value of 6-167 µM. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show a hTRPA1 activation by five terpenes: linalyl , geranyl , osthole, geranyl propionate, and neryl . Because physiological benefits of TRPA1 agonists, such as enhancement of energy metabolism and promotion of skin barrier recovery, have been reported, the oil could be a promising ingredient for anti- food products and cosmetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202210>Differential Effects on Haemostatic Markers by Metformin and the Contraceptive Pill: A Randomized Comparative Trial in PCOS.</a></h2><p> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 18% of reproductive-aged women with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolic disease, related to metabolic and hormonal features,  and an apparent hypofibrinolytic state, possibly exacerbated by current PCOS treatments.  To investigate and compare haemostatic impacts of common pharmacological treatments and explore relationships with hormonal and metabolic variables in PCOS.  This mechanistic sub-study using biobanked samples from a 6-month randomized comparative trial of pharmacological treatments assessed pro- and anti-thrombotic markers and overall haemostatic activity. Overweight women of mean age 33.9 ± 6.7 years and mean BMI (body mass index) of 36.5 ± 7.0 kg/m with PCOS ( = 60) were randomized to either metformin, higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or low-dose OCP + spironolactone (OCP + S). Primary outcome measures included changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PF1 and 2), plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin generation (TG).  PAI-1 activity fell in all groups, ADMA fell in higher-dose OCP, PF1 and 2 increased with metformin and higher-dose OCP, TG rose and tPA fell in both OCP groups, plasminogen increased in all and TAFI increased after higher-dose OCP.  Endothelial function (primary haemostasis) improved with higher dose with some improvement in low-dose OCP + S and metformin. Aberrant coagulation was noted in both OCP groups, but not with metformin. Fibrinolysis was reduced with higher-dose OCP. Our work suggests an additional dimension of treatment (haemostatic system effects) that favours metformin treatment over the OCP in PCOS.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29032341>Ethyl  fraction of Eclipta alba: a potential phytopharmaceutical targeting adipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Natural products have always fascinated mankind for their miraculous properties.

Silybin (Sil), a naturally occurring hepatoprotective agent, was widely used for treating NAFLD. Whether Sil effects gut microbiota during its actions in treating NAFLD, which is unknown. We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora dysbiosis induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and gut microbiota alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced  and liver steatosis, accordingly gut microbiota composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced , and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of , propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut microbiota composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

Prejunctional α-adrenergic receptors (αARs) provide negative feedback to norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves through inhibition of N-type Ca channels. Increased neuronal norepinephrine release in DOCA-salt and -related hypertension occurs through impaired αAR signaling; however, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Mesenteric arteries are resistance arteries that receive sympathetic innervation from the superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMCG). We tested the hypothesis that macrophages impair αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca channels in SMCG neurons from DOCA-salt and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertensive rats. Whole cell patch-clamp methods were used to record Ca currents from SMCG neurons maintained in primary culture. We found that DOCA-salt, but not HFD-induced, hypertension caused macrophage accumulation in mesenteric arteries, increased SMCG mRNA levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons. αAR dysfunction did not involve changes in αAR expression, desensitization, or downstream signaling factors. Oxidative stress impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons and resulted in receptor internalization in human embryonic kidney-293T cells. Systemic clodronate-induced macrophage depletion preserved αAR function and lowered blood pressure in DOCA-salt rats. HFD caused hypertension without  in Sprague-Dawley rats and hypertension with  in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. HFD-induced hypertension was not associated with inflammation in SMCG and mesenteric arteries or αAR dysfunction in SMCG neurons. These results suggest that macrophage-mediated αAR dysfunction in the mesenteric circulation may only be relevant to mineralocorticoid-salt excess. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we identify a contribution of macrophages to hypertension development through impaired α-adrenergic receptor (αAR)-mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve terminal Ca channels in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Impaired αAR function may involve oxidative stress-induced receptor internalization. αAR dysfunction may be unique to mineralocorticoid-salt excess, as it does not occur in -related hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30130541>The traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.: A review.</a></h2><p>Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (called Baizhu in China) is a medicinal plant that has long been used as a tonic agent in various ethno-medical systems in East Asia, especially in China, for the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction, cancer, osteoporosis, , and fetal irritability.This review aims to provide a systematic summary on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of A. macrocephala to explore the future therapeutic potential and scientific potential of this plant.A literature search was performed on A. macrocephala using scientific databases including Web of Science, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Springer, PubMed, SciFinder, and ScienceDirect. Information was also collected from classic books of Chinese herbal medicine, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations, unpublished materials, and local conference papers on toxicology. Plant taxonomy was confirmed to the database "The Plant List" (www.theplantlist.org).More than 79 chemical compounds have been isolated from A. macrocephala, including sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, polyacetylenes, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, steroids, benzoquinones, and polysaccharides. Crude extracts and pure compounds of A. macrocephala are used to treat gastrointestinal hypofunction, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, splenic asthenia, abnormal fetal movement, Alzheimer disease, and . These extracts have various pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-aging activity, anti-oxidative activity, anti-osteoporotic activity, neuroprotective activity, and immunomodulatory activity, as well as improving gastrointestinal function and gonadal hormone regulation.A. macrocephala is a valuable traditional Chinese medicinal herb with multiple pharmacological activities. Pharmacological investigations support the traditional use of A. macrocephala, and may validate the folk medicinal use of A. macrocephala to treat many chronic diseases. The available literature shows that much of the activity of A. macrocephala can be attributed to sesquiterpenoids, polysaccharides and polyacetylenes. However, there is a need to further understand the molecular mechanisms and the structure-function relationship of these constituents, as well as their potential synergistic and antagonistic effects. Further research on the comprehensive evaluation of medicinal quality, the understanding of multi-target network pharmacology of A. macrocephala, as well as its long-term in vivo toxicity and clinical efficacy is recommended.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Dietary fibers are non-digestible polysaccharides that are composed of complex carbohydrates. Based on their relative solubility in water, dietary fibers can be divided into insoluble and soluble forms. An important property of insoluble fibers is their ability to bind with carcinogens, mutagens, and other toxic chemicals that are formed during digestion of food and eliminate them through the feces. Soluble fibers can often be degraded to short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, propionate, and  by microbial fermentation. This review discusses mechanisms of action of fibers and their beneficial effects on the GI tract as well as on other organs. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate has been most extensively studied and the effects of sodium butyrate on cell culture and animal models are discussed in order to emphasize its potential value in prevention of certain diseases.Copyright © 2018.

We used a 5-year time horizon and 3% discount rate. From a healthcare perspective, we obtained probabilities, utilities and costs inflated to 2018 dollars from the literature. We set the threshold for cost-effectiveness at a standard $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We included the following clinical outcomes: number of protected cycles, unintended pregnancies, abortions, deliveries and costs.We found that UPA was the optimal method of oral EC, as it resulted in 720 fewer unintended pregnancies, 736 fewer abortions and 80 fewer deliveries at a total cost savings of $50,323 and 79 additional adjusted life-years. UPA continued to be the optimal strategy even in the case of  or COCs impacting UPA efficacy, in which a COC interaction would have to change efficacy of UPA by 160% before LNG was the dominant strategy.Our models found that UPA was the dominant choice of oral EC among COC users with a prolonged "missed" pill episode, regardless of body mass index or an adverse interaction of COCs on UPA.Ulipristal  is the dominant choice of oral emergency contraception among combined oral contraceptive users.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hysterectomy or myomectomy is the initial treatment, but fibroids will recur if the patient is still exposed to similar risk factors. Therefore, developing new therapeutic strategies are urgently necessary. In this study, the anti-proliferation effects of each fraction of adlay seeds were evaluated in uterine leiomyomas, and we identified the potential phytochemical compounds. We found that the ethyl  fraction of adlay hull (AHE-ea) appeared to be highly efficient in the anti-proliferation of rat uterine leiomyoma ELT3 cells and primary human uterine leiomyoma (hUL) cells. The proliferation of primary human normal uterine smooth muscle (UtSMC) and normal uterine myometrial (hUM) cells were also suppressed by AHE-ea. Two phytosterols, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, were identified from AHE-ea fraction. Mice treated with AHE-ea and stigmasterol alone demonstrated reduced diethylstilbestrol/medroxyprogesterone 17- (DES/MPA)-induced uterine myometrial hyperplasia, which is the critical step for the development of leiomyoma. Taken together, our results suggest that the AHE-ea fraction could be considered as a natural plant-based medicine in the prevention or treatment of uterine leiomyoma growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189264>Role of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and other inflammatory mediators in the induction of macrophage extracellular trap formation.</a></h2><p>The infiltration of activated leukocytes, including macrophages, at sites of inflammation and the formation and presence of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) are interlinked hallmarks of many debilitating disease processes, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, neurological and renal disease, diabetes and . The production of extracellular traps by activated leukocytes in response to a range of inflammatory stimuli is increasingly recognised as an important process within a range of disease settings. We show that exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to pathophysiological levels of HOCl results in the dose-dependent extrusion of DNA and histones into the cellular supernatant, consistent with extracellular trap formation. Concurrent with, but independent of these findings, macrophage exposure to HOCl also resulted in an immediate and sustained cytosolic accumulation of Ca, culminating in the increased production of cytokines and chemokines. Polarisation of the macrophages prior to HOCl exposure revealed a greater propensity for inflammatory M1 macrophages to produce extracellular traps, whereas alternatively-activated M2 macrophages were less susceptible to HOCl insult. M1 macrophages also produced extracellular traps on exposure to phorbol myristate  (PMA), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα). Taken together, these data indicate a potential role for macrophages in mediating extracellular trap formation, which may be relevant in pathological conditions characterised by chronic inflammation or excessive HOCl formation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, few experimental studies on the effects of flavonoids have been carried out in vivo after external application and using pure compounds. Aiming to fill this gap, in this study we tested the topical anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity of three flavonoids of high purity, naringenin, naringenin chalcone, and quercetin, in mouse models. The topical anti-inflammatory effects were assessed against arachidonic acid- (AA) and tetradecanoylphorbol-13-- (TPA) induced ear edema. The anti-inflammatory effect of naringenin against ear edema was noticeable at a 1% dose in the AA model and at half this dose in the TPA model. Quercetin (1.3%) did not exert any topical anti-inflammatory activity in the AA model, but its inhibitory effect in the TPA model was similar to that of naringenin (2%); in contrast, naringenin chalcone was more active against the AA-induced than TPA-induced inflammation. The flavonoid effect on IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis was also studied in mice, both intravenously and topically. Naringenin, naringenin chalcone, and quercetin all showed strong antiallergic activity after intravenous dosing (0.02%) and when applied topically (2%). The results of this study suggest that the flavonoids naringenin, naringenin chalcone, and quercetin may be useful alternatives for the topical treatment of inflammatory and allergic skin disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511745>Lipin1 is required for skeletal muscle development by regulating MEF2c and MyoD expression.</a></h2><p>Lipin1 is critical for skeletal muscle development. Lipin1 regulates MyoD and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2c) expression via the protein kinase C (PKC)/histone deacetylase 5-mediated pathway. Inhibition of PKCμ activity suppresses myoblast differentiation by inhibiting MyoD and MEF2c expression.Our previous characterization of global lipin1-deficient (fld) mice demonstrated that lipin1 played a novel role in skeletal muscle (SM) regeneration. The present study using cell type-specific Myf5-cre;Lipin1 conditional knockout mice (Lipin1 ) shows that lipin1 is a major determinant of SM development. Lipin1 deficiency induced reduced muscle mass and myopathy. Our results from lipin1-deficient myoblasts suggested that lipin1 regulates myoblast differentiation via the protein kinase Cμ (PKCμ)/histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5)/myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2c):MyoD-mediated pathway. Lipin1 deficiency leads to the suppression of PKC isoform activities, as well as inhibition of the downstream target of PKCμ, class II deacetylase HDAC5 nuclear export, and, consequently, inhibition of MEF2c and MyoD expression in the SM of lipin1 mice. Restoration of diacylglycerol-mediated signalling in lipin1 deficient myoblasts by phorbol 12-myristate 13- transiently activated PKC and HDAC5, and upregulated MEF2c expression.

Monocytes/macrophages are critical in the development of metabolic syndrome, including gout,  and atherosclerosis. However, how high uric acid (HUA) exposure affects monocyte/macrophage function remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of HUA exposure in monocytes/macrophages and its impact on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.We primed THP-1 cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) for differentiation, then exposed cells to HUA and detected the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and analyzed the level of phospho-AMPKα. THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, or HUA before PMA, to assess CD68 expression and phospho-AMPKα level. PMA-primed THP-1 cells were pre-treated with oxLDL before Compound C and HUA treatment. Western blot analysis was used to examine the levels of phospho-AMPKα, CD68, ABCG1, ABCA1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NF-κB (p65). Flow cytometry was used to assess ROS production and CD68 expression in live cells. Oil-red O staining was used to observe oxLDL uptake in cells.HUA treatment increased ROS production in PMA-primed THP-1 cells; NAC blocked HUA-induced oxidative stress. HUA treatment time-dependently increased phospho-AMPKα level in PMA-primed THP-1 cells. The HUA-induced oxidative stress increased phospho-AMPKα levels, which was blocked by NAC. HUA treatment impaired CD68 expression during cell differentiation by activating the AMPK pathway, which was reversed by Compound C treatment. Finally, HUA treatment inhibited oxLDL uptake in the formation of foam cells in THP-1 cells, which was blocked by Compound C treatment. HUA treatment significantly increased the expression of ABCG1 and reversed the oxLDL-reduced ABCG1 expression but did not affect the expression of ABCA1, NF-κB (p65) or COX-2.HUA exposure activated the ROS-AMPK pathway, impaired CD68 expression, and inhibited oxLDL-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Hence, microbiome modulators such as probiotics may be helpful in maintaining or even restoring normal gut microbiome composition to benefit host health. Herein, we developed a human-origin probiotic cocktail with the ability to modulate gut microbiota to increase native SCFA production. Following a robust protocol of isolation, characterization and safety validation of infant gut-origin Lactobacillus and Enterococcus strains with probiotic attributes (tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, absence of potential virulence genes, cell-surface hydrophobicity, and susceptibility to common antibiotics), we select 10 strains (5 from each genera) out of total 321 isolates. A single dose (oral gavage) as well as 5 consecutive doses of this 10-strain probiotic cocktail in mice modulates gut microbiome and increases SCFA production (particularly propionate and butyrate). Inoculation of these probiotics in human feces also increases SCFA production along with microbiome modulation. Results indicate that human-origin probiotic lactobacilli and enterococci could ameliorate gut microbiome dysbiosis and hence may prove to be a potential therapy for diseases involving reduced SCFAs production in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556948>Duodeno-jejunal bypass restores β-cell hypersecretion and islet hypertrophy in western diet obese rats.</a></h2><p>Duodeno-jejunal bypass (DJB) operation improves glucose homeostasis in morbid , independently of weight loss or reductions in adiposity, through mechanisms not yet fully elucidated. Herein, we evaluated the effects of DJB upon glucose homeostasis, endocrine pancreatic morphology, and β-cell responsiveness to potentiating agents of cholinergic and cAMP pathways, in western diet (WD) obese rats, at 2 months after operation.From 8 to 18 weeks of age male Wistar rats fed on a WD. After this period, a sham (WD Sham group) or DJB (WD DJB) operations were performed. At 2 months after operation glucose homeostasis was verified.Body weight was similar between WD DJB and WD Sham rats, but WD DJB rats showed a decrease in Lee index, retroperitoneal and perigonadal fat pads. Also, WD DJB rats displayed reduced fasting glycemia and insulinemia, and increased insulin-induced Akt activation in the gastrocnemius. Islets from WD DJB rats secreted less amounts of insulin, in response to activators of the cholinergic (carbachol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-) and cAMP (forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xantine) pathways. Islets of WD DJB rats had higher sintaxin-1 protein content than WD Sham, but without modification in muscarinic-3 receptor, protein kinase (PK)-Cα, and (PK)-Aα protein amounts. In addition, islets of WD DJB animals showed reduction in islets and β-cell masses.DJB surgery improves fasting glycemia and insulin action in skeletal muscle. Better endocrine pancreatic morphofunction was associated, at least in part, with the regulation of the cholinergic and cAMP pathways, and improvements in syntaxin-1 islet protein content induced by DJB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577306>Acer okamotoanum and isoquercitrin improve cognitive function via attenuation of oxidative stress in high fat diet- and amyloid beta-induced mice.</a></h2><p> induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) are known as a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease. We previously identified isoquercitrin (IQ) as an active compound of Acer okamotoanum. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of the active ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction from A. okamotoanum and IQ on HFD and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with HFD for 10 weeks and then Aβ25-35 was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.). The EtOAc fraction of A. okamotoanum and IQ were administered orally for 4 weeks at 100 and 10 mg kg-1 day-1, respectively. Learning and memory functions were evaluated using behavioral tests including T-maze, object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The HFD and Aβ25-35 injection significantly impaired cognitive and memory function. However, administration of A. okamotoanum and IQ improved spatial cognitive ability and object recognition ability in T-maze and novel object recognition tests. In addition, A. okamotoanum and IQ-administered groups showed enhanced learning and memory function compared with HFD and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment mice in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, administration of A. okamotoanum and IQ attenuated oxidative stress in the brain via inhibition of reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide formation. Therefore, we suggest that A. okamotoanum and IQ improve HFD- and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment by inhibition of oxidative stress, and A. okamotoanum and IQ might be potential candidates for prevention and treatment of - and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27517894>Anti-Diabetic Activity and Metabolic Changes Induced by Andrographis paniculata Plant Extract in Obese Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Andrographis paniculata is an annual herb and widely cultivated in Southeast Asian countries for its medicinal use. In recent investigations, A. paniculata was found to be effective against Type 1 diabetes mellitus (Type 1 DM). Here, we used a non-genetic out-bred Sprague-Dawley rat model to test the antidiabetic activity of A. paniculata against Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM). Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H-NMR) spectroscopy in combination with multivariate data analyses was used to evaluate the A. paniculata and metformin induced metabolic effects on the obese and obese-diabetic (obdb) rat models. Compared to the normal rats, high levels of creatinine, lactate, and allantoin were found in the urine of obese rats, whereas, obese-diabetic rats were marked by high glucose, choline and taurine levels, and low lactate, formate, creatinine, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, dimethylamine, acetoacetate, , allantoin and hippurate levels. Treatment of A. paniculata leaf water extract was found to be quite effective in restoring the disturbed metabolic profile of obdb rats back towards normal conditions. Thisstudy shows the anti-diabetic potential of A. paniculata plant extract and strengthens the idea of using this plant against the diabetes. Further classical genetic methods and state of the art molecular techniques could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and anti-diabetic effects of A. paniculata water extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002323>A Vegetarian Diet Is a Major Determinant of Gut Microbiota Composition in Early Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>The composition of the gut microbiota can be influenced by dietary composition. In pregnancy, the maternal gut microbiome has associations with maternal and infant metabolic status. There is little known regarding the impact of a vegetarian diet in pregnancy on maternal gut microbiota. This study explored the gut microbiota profile in women who were vegetarian or omnivorous in early gestation. Women were selected from participants in the Study of PRobiotics IN Gestational diabetes (SPRING) randomised controlled trial. Nine women identified as vegetarians were matched to omnivorous women in a 1:2 ratio. Microbiota analyses were performed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analysed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Calypso software tools. There was no difference in alpha diversity, but beta diversity was slightly reduced in vegetarians. There were differences seen in the relative abundance of several genera in those on a vegetarian diet, specifically a reduction in , , and increases in the relative abundances of  and . In this sub-analysis of gut microbiota from women in early pregnancy, a vegetarian as compared to omnivorous diet, was associated with a different gut microbiome, with features suggesting alterations in fermentation end products from a mixed acid fermentation towards more /butyrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339080>African walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum) modulates hepatic lipid accumulation in  via reciprocal actions on HMG-CoA reductase and paraoxonase.</a></h2><p> is characterized by increased body fat and involves an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of lipids.To investigate the effect of African walnuts (Tetracarpidium conophorum) on storage lipids and the regulatory enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism in obese rats.The nuts were extracted in ethanol (WE) and further separated to obtain the ethyl- fraction (ET) and the residue (RES). These were administered orally to 3 groups of monosodium glutamate-obese rats (n = 6), respectively, for 6 weeks.

The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power assays were used for the antioxidant analysis. In addition, qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses of the extracts were determined using standard methods.H. gordonii extract demonstrated good inhibition against HIV RT with IC values of 73.55 ± 0.04 and 69.81 ± 9.45 μg/mL for ethanol and ethyl  extracts, respectively. Both extracts also demonstrated inhibitory activity against HIV PR with IC values of 97.29 ± 0.01 and 63.76 ± 9.01 μg/mL for ethanol and ethyl  extracts. In addition, H. gordonii also showed good antioxidant activity with IC values of 124.6 ± 11.3 and 126.2 ± 3.15 μg/mL obtained for ethanol and ethyl  extracts, respectively. The reducing power of H. gordonii extracts increased as the concentration increased which confirmed the presence of antioxidants (reductants) in the extracts. Phytochemical screening of H. gordonii revealed the presence of phenolics, alkaloids, terpenes, steroids, cardiac glycosides and tannins in the ethanolic extract, while the ethyl  extract only showed the presence of phenolics, cardiac glycosides and steroids. The total phenolic content was 420 ± 0.17 and 319.9 ± 0.2 mg GAE/g for the ethanol and ethyl  extracts, respectively. The ethanol extract, which revealed the presence of tannins, had a tannin content of 330 ± 0.2 mg TAE/g extract.This data suggests that H. gordonii has good in vitro inhibition against selected HIV-1 enzymes as well as antioxidant properties, suggesting new potential uses for this commercial plant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511497>Chemical fingerprint and bioactivity evaluation of Globularia orientalis L. and Globularia trichosantha Fisch. & C.

The antioxidant abilities of the investigated extracts were done using different assays including free radical scavenging [1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS)], reducing power (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power), phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating. Inhibitory potential against key enzymes involved in neurodegenerative diseases (cholinesterases; AChE, and BChE), diabetes (α-glucosidase and α-amylase), hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase) and  (pancreatic lipase) were evaluated.Globularia trichosantha and G. orientalis extracts showed remarkable antioxidant properties, with the water extracts being a better source of antioxidant compounds. Both species showed remarkable inhibitory effects against the target enzymes. However, for both species, only the acetyl  and methanolic extracts were potent against cholinesterases and lipase.HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis revealed the presence of 107 compounds from G. trichosantha and G. orientalis, among which, 43 compounds have been preliminarily characterised for the first time from the Globulariaceae family. To date, this study can be considered as the most comprehensive research focused on the characterisation of G. trichosantha and G. orientalis.

It is highly related to oxidative stress, formation of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) and key enzymes, such as carbohydrate digesting enzymes like pancreatic α-amylase and intestinal α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). This study used an in vitro approach to assess the potential of four extracts of  linne on key enzymes relevant to metabolic syndrome. In this research,  was firstly extracted by ethanol. The ethanol extract (SE) was then partitioned sequentially with hexane, ethyl  and methanol, and these extracts were named SE-Hex, SE-EA and SE-MeOH, respectively. The experimental results showed that SE-EA had the highest total phenolic content (TPC, 76.9 ± 1.8 mg/g) and the total flavonoids content (TFC, 5.3 ± 0.3 mg/g). This extract exhibited the most significant antioxidant activities, including DPPH radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 161.8 ± 2.4 μg/mL), ABTS radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 13.9 ± 1.5 μg/mL) and reducing power. For anti-glycation activities, SE-EA showed the best results in the inhibition of AGEs, as well as inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase (IC = 362.3 ± 9.2 μg/mL) and α-amylase (IC = 119.0 ± 17.7 μg/mL). For anti- activities, SE-EA indicated the highest suppression effect on pancreatic lipase (IC = 3.67 ± 0.52 mg/mL). Finally, for anti-hypertension activity, SE-EA also demonstrated the strongest inhibitory activity on ACE (IC = 626.6 ± 15.0 μg/mL). Close relationships were observed among the parameters of TPC, antioxidant activities, inhibitory activities on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase and ACE (R > 0.9). Moderate correlations were found among the parameters of TFC, antioxidant activities, and suppression of dicarbonyl compounds formation (R = 0.5-0.9).

Dietary supplementation of , propionate, butyrate or their admixture was shown to significantly inhibit the body weight gain induced by high-fat diet feeding. Supplementation of SCFAs caused significant changes in the expressions of G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and GPR41 characterized by increases in the adipose tissue and reductions in the colon. Additionally, they influenced the bacterial community structure in feces, with a reduction in the proportion of Firmicutes and an increase in the proportion of Bacteroidetes. The effects of dietary SCFAs on the GPR expression and gut microbiota composition may further result in body weight reduction by enhancing triglyceride hydrolysis and FFA oxidation in the adipose tissue, promoting beige adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, and inhibiting chronic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28726396>Potent Anti-Inflammatory and Antiadipogenic Properties of Bamboo (Sasa coreana Nakai) Leaves Extract and Its Major Constituent Flavonoids.</a></h2><p>The pro-inflammatory response and recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Here, we reported the anti-inflammatory and antiadipogenic effects of the methanol (MeOH) extract and ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction of bamboo leaf and its molecular mechanism in RAW264.7 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively. Functional macrophage migration assays also were performed. Surprisingly, the EtOAc fraction of MeOH extracts from native Korean plant species Sasa coreana Nakai (SCN) has shown potent anti-inflammatory properties; SCN pretreatment inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production (p < 0.01) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Inflammatory genes induced by LPS, including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, were significantly attenuated by SCN (p < 0.01). Pretreatment with SCN antagonized NF-κB nuclear translocation and the simultaneous degradation of inhibitory κB protein. Furthermore, SCN selectively inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK (p < 0.01) and p38 (p < 0.05) but not ERK (p > 0.05). Similar to leaf extracts of other bamboo species, we identified that SCN contained several flavonoids including orientin, isoorientin, and vitexin; these compounds inhibited LPS-induced NO production (p < 0.05) and iNOS expression. In addition, SCN inhibited adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining and the protein expression of mature adipogenic marker genes. Treatment with the major flavonoids of SCN also inhibited adipogenesis. Furthermore, conditioned medium obtained from adipocytes stimulated macrophage chemotaxis, whereas medium from adipocytes treated with SCN significantly inhibited macrophage migration.

Thus, the development of novel drugs is urgently needed to control  related diseases.Here, we investigated the protective role of Lavatera critica (LC), a green vegetable, in male C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks to induce hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage.After oral administration of chloroform (CFLC), ethyl  (EFLC), or methanol (MFLC) fractions of Lavatera critica to the HF group, EALC alone significantly reduced the activities of hepatic markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); moreover, the results showed that 50 mg/kg dose has the maximum activity. Thus, this active dose of EFLC was used for further analysis. Moreover, EFLC reduced the level of hepatic triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA), and prevented further increase in the body weight. Intriguingly, EFLC treatment also reversed the mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidative genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACO), and fatty acid synthesis genes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, EFLC treatment also decreased the production of oxidative stress biomarkers, such as conjugated diene (CD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), and significantly enhanced the level of enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, and vitamin E in the liver.Taken together, we conclude that EFLC has a protective effect against HF diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage through the regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis genes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Using onion-peel-derived extracts and their bioactive compounds, we demonstrate that onion peel, a by-product of onion, can change the characteristics of white adipocytes to those of brown-like adipocytes in the white adipose tissue of mice and 3T3-L1 cells. The expression of the following brown adipose tissue-specific genes was increased in the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissues of 0.5% onion-peel-extract-fed mice: PR domain-containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α, uncoupling protein 1, fibroblast growth factor 21 and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, onion peel extract induced the expression of brown adipose tissue-specific genes and increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α. This effect was supported by decreased lipid levels and multiple small-sized lipid droplets. The ethyl  fraction of the onion peel extract that contained the highest proportion of hydrophobic molecules showed the same browning effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A high-performance liquid chromatography analysis further identified quercetin as a functional compound in the browning effect of onion peel. The quercetin-associated browning effect was mediated in part by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. In summary, our study provides the first demonstration of the browning effects of onion peel and quercetin using both animal and cell models. This result indicates that onion peel has the potential to remodel the characteristics of white adipocytes to those of brown-like adipocytes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite their clinical uses, these drugs have some abuse potential and have been enlisted under the schedule IV (SVR, LVR) and schedule V (BVR) categories of the Controlled Substances Act. A sensitive UPLC-MS-MS assay was developed for simultaneously determining SVR, LCR and BVR in human plasma. The liquid-liquid extraction method, using tert-butyl methyl ether as an extracting solvent, was used for sample preparation. Chromatographic separation was performed by using the Acquity BEH C18 column, using 10 mM ammonium /acetonitrile/formic acid (15/85/0.1%; v/v/v) as the mobile phase. For sample ionization, electrospray ionization was used in the positive-ion mode. The multiple-reaction monitoring mode was used for detecting and quantifying analytes by using separate precursor-to-product ion transitions. The assay was validated following the SWGTOX guidelines, and all validation results were within the acceptable limits. The calibration curves of the analytes in the plasma were found to be linear, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was ≥ 0.992 for all the three analytes. The limit of detection values for SVR, LCR and BVR were 0.08, 0.11 and 0.26 ng/mL, respectively, whereas the limit of quantification values were 0.16, 0.27 and 0.65 ng/mL, respectively.

Studies are conflicting as to whether SCFAs are beneficial or detrimental to cardiometabolic health, and how gut microbiota associated with SCFAs is unclear. In this study of 441 community-dwelling adults, we examined associations of fecal SCFAs, gut microbiota diversity and composition, gut permeability, and cardiometabolic outcomes, including  and hypertension. We assessed fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and SCFA concentrations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fecal SCFA concentrations were inversely associated with microbiota diversity, and 70 unique microbial taxa were differentially associated with at least one SCFA (, butyrate or propionate). Higher SCFA concentrations were associated with a measure of gut permeability, markers of metabolic dysregulation,  and hypertension. Microbial diversity showed association with these outcomes in the opposite direction. Associations were significant after adjusting for measured confounders. In conclusion, higher SCFA excretion was associated with evidence of gut dysbiosis, gut permeability, excess adiposity, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Studies assessing both fecal and circulating SCFAs are needed to test the hypothesis that the association of higher fecal SCFAs with  and cardiometabolic dysregulation is due to less efficient SCFA absorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710445>Association between CD16 monocytes in peripheral blood and clinical features and short-term therapeutic effects of polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the association between CD16 monocytes in peripheral blood and the clinical features and short-term therapeutic effects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).This prospective cross-sectional study included women diagnosed with PCOS at a University Hospital in Shanghai, China, between June 4 and November 28, 2016. Patients received Diane-35, metformin, or both combined for 3 months. We collected anthropometric measures and used flow cytometry to detect CD16 monocytes.The final analysis included 70 patients: 18 in the Diane-35 group, 30 in the metformin group, and 22 in the Diane-35 plus metformin group. The control group comprised 60 women without PCOS. The proportion of CD16 monocytes was significantly higher in patients with PCOS than in those with no PCOS (16.05% vs 10.73%; P=0.001). The proportion differed significantly between patients with and those without hyperandrogenism (13.12% vs 17.30%; P=0.002) and showed moderate accuracy in diagnosing hyperandrogenism before treatment. We noted a decrease in monocytes post-treatment in patients given metformin and Diane-35 plus metformin.The proportion of CD16 monocytes was most significantly associated with hyperandrogenism before treatment.

In lean dogs, higher protein consumption is accompanied with increased production of putrefactive fermentation products, whereas obese dogs have a different gut microbiota compared to lean dogs. Still, the impact of high dietary protein on gut microbiota in obese dogs remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate faecal microbial changes in lean and obese dogs in response to two different levels of dietary protein. Six healthy lean and six obese Beagles were fed a high protein diet (HP) and a low protein diet (LP) for 28 days each in a crossover design. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR were performed on faecal samples for microbial profiling. Plasma acylcarnitine and fermentation metabolites were measured.Dogs fed HP had higher concentrations of protein fermentation metabolites including faecal ammonia, isovalerate, isobutyrate, phenol, indole, serum indoxyl sulphate and plasma 3-OH isovalerylcarnitine compared to dogs fed LP, whereas no changes in faecal concentrations of  and butyrate were observed. The abundances of clostridial clusters IV and XIVa, covering the majority of butyrate-producing bacteria, and of the butyrate kinase gene, one of the terminal genes of the butyrate synthesis pathway were higher in dogs on HP compared to LP. Significant interactions between diet and body condition were found for the abundance of Firmicutes, Lactobacillus and clostridial cluster I. The similarity coefficient of faecal microbiota between the two diets was smaller in obese dogs than in lean dogs.High protein diet increased the abundance and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in Beagles independent of the body condition.

Because of this, there is a high interest in healthy natural products that could prevent the appearance of such diseases. This paper aims to study the content of fatty acids (FAs) and phenolic compounds of brown alga Laminaria ochroleuca (L. ochroleuca) and to determine the nutritional quality of the lipids extracted using pressurized liquids extraction (PLE) technique. PLE was applied to the algae using four solvents of different polarity (hexane, ethyl , ethanol and ethanol:water 1:1). Results showed that the higher yield (52%), is obtained with ethanol: water solvent, however, both ethyl  and ethanol enrich unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) (palmitoleic, linolenic, linoleic, oleic, araquidonic and eicosapenataenoic) in the lipid fraction of L. ochroleuca, providing extracts up to 55% of their total fatty acid content compared to other solvents. The nutritional quality of the lipids in all PLE extracts was assessed by considering the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty acid ratio and two dietary indexes involved in the risks of coronary heart disease, atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI). The lower (best) index values are for ethanol extract, 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.74 (AI) and 1.05 (TI), followed of ethyl , 4.4 (ω-6/ ω-3), 0.87 (AI) and 1.24 (TI).

Adult mice lacking ACSS2 appear phenotypically normal but exhibit reduced tumor burdens in mouse models of liver cancer. The normal physiological functions of this alternate pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis remain unclear, however. Here, we reveal that mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in body weight and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced  model. ACSS2 deficiency reduces dietary lipid absorption by the intestine and also perturbs repartitioning and utilization of triglycerides from adipose tissue to the liver due to lowered expression of lipid transporters and fatty acid oxidation genes. In this manner, ACSS2 promotes the systemic storage or metabolism of fat according to the fed or fasted state through the selective regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Thus, targeting ACSS2 may offer a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710347>Effects of Lipoic Acid on High-Fat Diet-Induced Alteration of Synaptic Plasticity and Brain Glucose Metabolism: A PET/CT and C-NMR Study.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD)-induced  is accompanied by insulin resistance and compromised brain synaptic plasticity through the impairment of insulin-sensitive pathways regulating neuronal survival, learning, and memory. Lipoic acid is known to modulate the redox status of the cell and has insulin mimetic effects. This study was aimed at determining the effects of dietary administration of lipoic acid on a HFD-induced  model in terms of (a) insulin signaling, (b) brain glucose uptake and neuronal- and astrocytic metabolism, and (c) synaptic plasticity. 3-Month old C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups exposed to their respective treatments for 9 weeks: (1) normal diet, (2) normal diet plus lipoic acid, (3) HFD, and (4) HFD plus lipoic acid. HFD resulted in higher body weight, development of insulin resistance, lower brain glucose uptake and glucose transporters, alterations in glycolytic and  metabolism in neurons and astrocytes, and ultimately synaptic plasticity loss evident by a decreased long-term potentiation (LTP). Lipoic acid treatment in mice on HFD prevented several HFD-induced metabolic changes and preserved synaptic plasticity.

The gut microbial composition is affected by diet throughout the human lifespan, and is highly dynamic and efficient in response to dietary alterations in particular to dietary fibre intake. Short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) are the bi-product of fibre fermentation and have both obesogenic and anti-obesogenic properties. The production of specific forms of SCFAs depends on the microbes available in the gut and the type of fibre ingested. The gut microbiome associated with healthy lean individuals has a higher microbial biodiversity and a greater Bacteroidete to Firmicute ratio compared to the obese individuals associated with microbiome. These gut microbial associations are similar to those seen in individuals with high and low dietary fibre intakes, respectively. Metabolites generated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes include the three main SCFA related to , namely butyrate,  and propionate.

Inhibitory activity of ethyl  extracts from seeds, leaves and roots of T. garganica against Candida rugosa lipase was determined. To uncover the active constituents responsible for this anti-lipase activity, further investigations were performed by employing theoretical docking simulations, using AutoDock Vina program to discuss the nature of interactions and the inhibition mechanism by major bioactive compounds synthesized by this plant.Seeds, leaves and roots extracts of T. garganica showed appreciable contents of polyphenols and flavonoids which is most in seeds extract with 2.90±0.02mg GAE/gdw and 1.53±0.05mg QE/gdw, respectively. Hence, their inhibitory activities against Candida rugosa lipase were determined as IC50 of 1.19mg/ml, 1.96mg/ml and 1.87mg/ml, respectively. Docking simulations have shown that nortribolid and tribolid are best inhibitors for both lipases (Candida rugosa and human pancreatic lipases).Testing the anti-lipase activity of the ethyl  extracts of T. garganica revealed a potent lipase inhibition activity, which suggests the use of these molecules as anti- drugs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871060>Glycyrrhetinic Acid Improves Insulin-Response Pathway by Regulating the Balance between the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt Pathways.</a></h2><p>Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), a bioactive component in the human diet, has been reported to improve hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and  in rats with metabolic syndrome. However, GA-specific target proteins and the mechanisms involved in the downstream signaling and cross-talk to improve insulin sensitivity have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the potential targets of GA were identified by chemical proteomics strategies using serial GA probes for target fishing and cell molecular imaging. Intracellular enzyme activity evaluation and insulin resistance models were used for validating the function of the target proteins on the downstream insulin signaling pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GA improved the insulin-responsive pathway and glucose consumption levels via multiple diabetogenic factors that activated the insulin signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. GA improved Glucose transporter 4(GLUT4) expression by targeting the Ras protein to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. GA exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on IRS1ser307 phosphorylation in cells treated with the Protein kinase C (PKC) activator Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA.)

GA also inhibited the PMA-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 proteins (P38), suggesting that IKKα/β, JNK and P38 activation is dependent on PKC activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400947>Impact of rye-based evening meals on cognitive functions, mood and cardiometabolic risk factors: a randomized controlled study in healthy middle-aged subjects.</a></h2><p>Whole grain (WG) intake is associated with reduced risk of , type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, whereas type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term intervention with WG rye on cognitive functions, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers in middle-aged test subjects.Rye-based breads were provided to 38 healthy test subjects (aged 52-70y) during three consecutive days in a crossover study design, using white wheat flour bread (WWB) as a reference. The rye-based bread consisted of a WG rye kernel/flour mixture (1:1 ratio) supplemented with resistant starch type 2 (RS2) (RB + RS2). The last bread portion was ingested at 2100 h, and cognitive function, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers were determined the following morning, 11 - 14 h post intake.In comparison to WWB, the RB + RS2 product increased ratings of mood parameters (valance, P < 0.001; activation P < 0.05). No differences were seen in the cognitive tests depending on intervention (P > 0.05). RB + RS2 increased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05), fasting levels of gut hormones (PYY, P < 0.05; GLP-2, P < 0.01) and fasting concentrations of plasma , butyrate and total SCFA (P < 0.001). In contrast, fasting levels of IL - 1β were decreased (P < 0.05). Insulin sensitivity was positively correlated with working memory test performance (P < 0.05).This study display novel findings regarding effects of WG rye products on mood, and glucose and appetite regulation in middle-aged subjects, indicating anti-diabetic properties of WG rye. The beneficial effects are suggested to be mediated through gut fermentation of dietary fiber in the RB + RS2 product.The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, register number  .

The anti-MS effects exerted by Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis GCL2505 (BlaG), a highly proliferative Bifidobacterium strain in the gut, and B. longum ssp. longum JCM1217 (BloJ) were comparatively examined. BlaG treatment reduced visceral fat accumulation and improved glucose tolerance, whereas BloJ had no effect on these parameters. Gut microbial analysis revealed that BlaG exerted stronger effects on the overall bacterial structure of the gut microbiota than BloJ, including enrichment of the genus Bifidobacterium. The levels of  and glucagon-like peptide-1 were increased by BlaG treatment in both the gut and plasma, but not by BloJ treatment. Correlation analysis suggested that the elevation of gut  levels by BlaG treatment plays a pivotal role in the BlaG-induced anti-MS effects.

Incidence of AEs was descriptively summarized in the whole cohort and by subgroup (pre-  post-docetaxel). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models assessed factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Overall, median PFS and OS were 14.9 and 24.6 months, respectively. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ⩾ 10 ng/ml ( = 0.007), Gleason Score >7 ( = 0.008), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS)1-2 ( = 0.002), duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ⩽ 43.2 months ( = 0.01), and body mass index (BMI) > 25 ( = 0.03) were associated with worse PFS; presence of pain ( = 0.01), ECOG PS1-2 ( = 0.004), duration of ADT ⩽ 43.2 ( = 0.05), and BMI > 25 ( = 0.042) were associated with worse OS. Incidence of CVEs was as follows: hypertension 17.1%, fluid retention 4.8%, cardiac disorders 8.6%. 16.2% of patients developed hypokalemia. Age ⩾ 75 years was associated with higher probability of cardiac disorders ( = 0.001) and fluid retention ( = 0.03). CVEs did not impact on PFS or OS. Hypokalemia was associated with better median OS ( = 0.036). Similar associations were observed after stratification by subgroup.Median PFS and OS estimates and incidence of CVEs and hypokalemia in our series are consistent with those of pivotal trials of AA plus PDN, confirming the efficacy and safety of this regimen also in the real-world setting. Elderly patients have higher odds of developing/worsening CVEs. However, regardless of age, CVEs were not associated with worse outcomes. Treatment-related hypokalemia seemed to be associated with longer OS, albeit this finding needs confirmation within larger, prospective series.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28918936>Intermittent Fasting Promotes White Adipose Browning and Decreases  by Shaping the Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>While activation of beige thermogenesis is a promising approach for treatment of -associated diseases, there are currently no known pharmacological means of inducing beiging in humans. Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly understood. Here, we show that an every-other-day fasting (EODF) regimen selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue and dramatically ameliorates , insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. EODF treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to elevation of the fermentation products  and lactate and to the selective upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells. Microbiota-depleted mice are resistance to EODF-induced beiging, while transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activates beiging and improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings provide a new gut-microbiota-driven mechanism for activating adipose tissue browning and treating metabolic diseases.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796545>Methanogens as emerging pathogens in anaerobic abscesses.</a></h2><p>Methanogens are strictly anaerobic archaea metabolising by-products of bacterial fermentation into methane by using three known metabolic pathways, i.e. the reduction of carbon dioxide, the fermentation of  or the dismutation of methanol or methylamines. Methanogens described in human microbiota include only Euryarchaeota, i.e. Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and ) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer). Their detection in anaerobic pus specimens and oral and digestive tract specimens relies on microscopic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, specific DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene fragments and isolation and culture in the supporting presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Diagnostic identification can be performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and can be further completed by genotyping through multi-spacer sequencing and, ultimately, whole genome sequencing (WGS). Ornidazole derivatives, fusidic acid and rifampicin are the compounds to be included in in vitro susceptibility testing to complete the clinical workflow.

Sweet and fatty acid taste receptors (FFAR) coupled to the gustatory G-protein, gustducin, on enteroendocrine cells play a role in gut hormone release. We studied if supplementation of artificial (sucralose) or prebiotic (oligofructose; OFS) sweeteners target gustducin-mediated signaling pathways to alter gut hormone release and reduce -associated disorders.Wild-type (WT) and α-gustducin knockout (α-gust ) mice were fed a high-fat diet and gavaged once daily (8 wk) with water or equisweet concentrations of sweeteners. OFS but not sucralose decreased body weight gain (-19 ± 3%, p < 0.01), fat pad mass (-55 ± 6%, p < 0.001), and insulin resistance (-39 ± 5%, p < 0.001) independent of α-gustducin. Neither sweetener improved glucose intolerance, while solely OFS improved the disturbed colonic permeability. OFS decreased (-65 ± 8%, p < 0.001) plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but not ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) levels in WT mice. Cecal  and butyrate levels were reduced by OFS in both genotypes suggesting enhanced uptake of SCFAs that may target FFAR2 (upregulated expression) in adipose tissue.OFS, but not sucralose, reduced body weight gain and decreased intestinal permeability, but not glucose intolerance. Effects were not mediated by altered gut hormone levels or gustducin-mediated signaling. Artificial sweeteners do not affect gut hormone levels and are metabolically inert in mice on a high-fat diet. In contrast, prebiotic oligosaccharides (OFS) prevent body weight gain but not glucose intolerance. Alterations in sweet and short-chain fatty acid receptors (FFAR) (studied in WT and α-gust mice) that regulate gut hormone levels are not mandatory for the positive effects of OFS. Enhanced uptake of SCFAs may favor interaction with FFAR2/3 on adipose tissue to induce weight loss.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 68.5% of Americans, including 63.9% of adult women older than 20 years, are overweight (body mass index between 25 kg/m and 29.9 kg/m) or obese (body mass index >30 kg/m). In light of this, it is not surprising that the rates of bariatric surgery have also been increasing. When considering the metabolic changes associated with both bariatric surgery and contraceptive use, in combination with the unique medical considerations of obese women, it is indisputable that clear guidelines are needed when counseling obese patients of reproductive age after bariatric surgery. In this literature review, we focus on depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) and the implications of its use in obese women, preweight and postweight loss following bariatric surgery. Both DMPA use and bariatric surgery are known to cause bone loss, but it is still unclear whether there is an additive effect of the two factors on bone loss and whether either of these factors directly leads to an increased risk of bone fracture. The current consensus guidelines do not impose a restriction on the use of DMPA after bariatric surgery. DMPA use is associated with weight gain, and it is unclear whether weight loss blunting occurs with the use of DMPA after bariatric surgery. Prior studies had demonstrated an association with weight gain in adolescents, and therefore, those prescribing DMPA use after bariatric surgery in adolescents should proceed with caution. Adult women do not have a similar response to the use of DMPA. DMPA use has rarely been associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The -associated increase in VTE should be mitigated by surgically induced weight loss. The concurrent use of DMPA in the post bariatric surgical period should not further increase the risk of VTE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29843993>A case control study on HDL associated PON1 enzyme level in Northern Indian type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the serum paraoxonase 1 activity and determine its association with duration in type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients.A total of 80 cases from type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls were enrolled in the present case control study.

We investigated the effect of factorial randomisation to a 6-month lycopene and green tea dietary advice or supplementation intervention on 159 serum metabolite measures in 128 men with raised PSA levels (but prostate cancer-free), analysed by intention-to-treat. The causal effects of metabolites modified by the intervention on prostate cancer risk were then assessed by Mendelian randomisation, using summary statistics from 44,825 prostate cancer cases and 27,904 controls. The systemic effects of lycopene and green tea supplementation on serum metabolic profile were comparable to the effects of the respective dietary advice interventions (R = 0.65 and 0.76 for lycopene and green tea respectively). Metabolites which were altered in response to lycopene supplementation were  [β (standard deviation difference vs. placebo): 0.69; 95% CI = 0.24, 1.15; p = 0.003], valine (β: -0.62; -1.03, -0.02; p = 0.004), pyruvate (β: -0.56; -0.95, -0.16; p = 0.006) and docosahexaenoic acid (β: -0.50; -085, -0.14; p = 0.006). Valine and diacylglycerol were lower in the lycopene dietary advice group (β: -0.65; -1.04, -0.26; p = 0.001 and β: -0.59; -1.01, -0.18; p = 0.006). A genetically instrumented SD increase in pyruvate increased the odds of prostate cancer by 1.29 (1.03, 1.62; p = 0.027). An intervention to increase lycopene intake altered the serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer. Lycopene lowered levels of pyruvate, which our Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests may be causally related to reduced prostate cancer risk.© 2018 The Authors.

The fraction of inspired O (FO) and partial pressure of inspired O (PO) were 0.209 and 133.1 ± 0.3 mmHg for NBR and 0.141 ± 0.004 and 90.0 ± 0.4 mmHg for both hypoxic variants (HBR and HAmb; ~4,000 m simulated altitude), respectively. A number of parameters linked to intestinal transit spanning Bristol Stool Scale, defecation rates, zonulin, α-antitrypsin, eosinophil derived neurotoxin, bile acids, reducing sugars, short chain fatty acids, total soluble organic carbon, water content, diet composition, and food intake were measured (167 variables). The abundance, structure, and diversity of butyrate producing microbial community were assessed using the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA:  CoA-transferase () and butyrate kinase () genes. Inactivity negatively affected fecal consistency and in combination with hypoxia aggravated the state of gut inflammation ( < 0.05). In contrast, gut permeability, various metabolic markers, the structure, diversity, and abundance of butyrate producing microbial community were not significantly affected. Rearrangements in the butyrate producing microbial community structure were explained by experimental setup (13.4%), experimentally structured metabolites (12.8%), and gut metabolite-immunological markers (11.9%), with 61.9% remaining unexplained. Many of the measured parameters were found to be correlated and were hence omitted from further analyses. The observed progressive increase in two immunological intestinal markers suggested that the transition from healthy physiological state toward the developed symptoms of low magnitude -related syndromes was primarily driven by the onset of inactivity (lack of exercise in NBR) that were exacerbated by systemic hypoxia (HBR) and significantly alleviated by exercise, despite hypoxia (HAmb). Butyrate producing community in colon exhibited apparent resilience toward short-term modifications in host exercise or hypoxia. Progressive constipation (decreased intestinal motility) and increased local inflammation marker suggest that changes in microbial colonization and metabolism were taking place at the location of small intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593890>AMPK activating and anti adipogenic potential of Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower in 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>The flowers of Hibiscus rosa sinensis has array of pharmacological actions.

Effect on adipolysis was determined, adipogenic and its regulatory gene and protein expression were studied and effect of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL on AMPK was confirmed in the presence of dorsomorphin.Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was found to alleviate triglyceride accumulation significantly (p < 0.001) by 1.6 and 2.3 times respectively in pre adipocytes during differentiation. HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also nonsignificantly reduced lipolysis which releases free fatty acids, a major contributing factor for insulin resistance. Activation of AMPK by phosphorylation has led to reduced gene and protein expression of adipogenic factors Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), CCAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), Sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and their targets Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Perilipin and enhanced Adiponectin expression. Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also resulted in inactivation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, which reduced the levels of malonyl-CoA an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Enhanced CPT1 levels causes induction of fatty acid β- oxidation. Effects of HRF were nullified in the presence of AMPK antagonist dorsomorphin.In summary, HRF treatments reduced adipogenesis, enhanced factors regulating fatty acid oxidation and this is mediated by AMPK activation. The results conclusively showed anti- potential of HRF and it might be helpful in treatment of associated complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic signals derived from dietary intake or secreted from adipose tissue, gut, and liver contribute to energy homeostasis. Recent metabolomic studies identified novel metabolites and enlarged our knowledge on classic metabolites. This review summarizes the evidence of their roles as mediators of interorgan crosstalk and regulators of insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism. Circulating lipids such as free fatty acids, , and palmitoleate from adipose tissue and short-chain fatty acids from the gut effectively act on liver and skeletal muscle. Intracellular lipids such as diacylglycerols and sphingolipids can serve as lipotoxins by directly inhibiting insulin action in muscle and liver. In contrast, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids have been recently shown to exert a series of beneficial effects. Also, ketoacids are gaining interest as potent modulators of insulin action and mitochondrial function. Finally, branched-chain amino acids not only predict metabolic diseases, but also inhibit insulin signaling. Here, we focus on the metabolic crosstalk in humans, which regulates insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28649567>Effect of Dark Chocolate Extracts on Phorbol 12-Myristate 13--Induced Oxidative Burst in Leukocytes Isolated by Normo-Weight and Overweight/Obese Subjects.</a></h2><p>Oxidative and inflammatory stress represents a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in overweight and obese subjects. Between the different plant foods, chocolate has been shown to decrease CVD risk due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, as we recently showed in epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, and human trials, dietary antioxidants resulted more effective in subjects characterized by an ongoing oxidative stress, than in healthy people. Aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different concentrations of chocolate phenolic extract (CPE) on  free radical production, stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), in leukocytes extracted from blood of normo-weight and overweight/obese subjects. Neutrophils from overweight/obese group had a significantly higher free radical production compared to the normo-weight group. In neutrophils, the lowest CPE concentration significantly reduced free radical production in overweight/obese group only, and higher CPE concentrations were effective in both groups. In monocytes, the CPE concentration that was significantly effective in reducing free radical production was lower in overweight/obese subjects than in normo-weight subjects. Chocolate polyphenol extracts inhibit oxidative burst in human neutrophils and monocytes with a higher efficiency in subjects characterized by an unphysiological oxidative/inflammatory stress, such as overweight and obese.

We compared the proportion of providers reporting select contraceptive methods as safe for women with specific characteristics or medical conditions before and after the USMEC release and conducted multivariable logistic regression to adjust for provider characteristics.For the following select characteristics for which the USMEC classifies specific contraceptive methods as safe (Category 1 or 2), a significantly (p<.05) higher proportion of providers reported the method safe after versus before the USMEC release: intrauterine devices (IUDs) for adolescents (79.8% versus 60.2%), IUDs for women with HIV (72.4% versus 50.6%), depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) for women with  (89.5% versus 76.1%), and DMPA for women with history of bariatric surgery (87.6% versus 73.9%). These differences remained significant after adjustment for provider characteristics.While we observed many positive changes in health care provider attitudes related to contraception safety after the USMEC release, gaps remain. Continuing education and evidence-based training for providers, and ensuring office and health center protocols address medical eligibility for contraception for the full range of characteristics included in the USMEC might bridge remaining gaps and increase delivery of high-quality contraception care.Gaps between evidence and provider attitudes remain that can inform future efforts to improve contraceptive service delivery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In PCa cell-lines a certain cabazitaxel chemo resistance adipose stromal cells (ASC)-mediated was demonstrated. In metastatic castration-resistant PCa patients with high BMI (>25 kg/m) receiving abiraterone  there were significant worse survival outcomes, while in enzalutamide patients BMI did not affect survival outcome. In radium 223 patients higher BMI significantly correlated with favorable overall survival. : The main focus of this review was to understand the interplay between /BMI and UC/PCa. Several pathogenic cellular pathways exploring the issue are discussed, opening the way to challenging tailored treatments on the basis of BMI. Improving the knowledge of molecular connections between  and UC and PCa could favor the development of new therapies likely reducing chemo- and immunotherapy drug resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355278>A metagenomics approach to the intestinal microbiome structure and function in high fat diet-induced  mice fed with oolong tea polyphenols.</a></h2><p>To investigate the modulatory effect of oolong tea polyphenols (OTP) on intestinal microbiota, OTP was prepared by column chromatography and its influence on the gut flora structure was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing with a human flora-associated high fat diet (HFD) induced  mouse model. We observed a robust increase in bacterial biodiversity and the abundance of genera known to be butyrate- and -producing bacteria. A large increase in Bacteroidetes with a decrease in Firmicutes was observed after the administration of OTP for 4 weeks, and the corresponding decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio reflected the positive modulatory effect of OTP on the intestinal microbiota. In addition, KEGG pathways for the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbon metabolism, and the ribosome were among the most differentially expressed genes after OTP intervention. The current study revealed that OTP rich in tea catechins, especially O-methylated derivatives, may have prebiotic-like activity and can be used as a functional food component with potential therapeutic utility to prevent -related metabolic disorders by manipulating the intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013341>Emerging role of intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in metabolic control.</a></h2><p>The role of the intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in the maintenance of host health and development of metabolic disease has gained significant attention over the past decade.

Schrad is extensively used to treat diabetes, , fever, cancer, amenorrhea, jaundice, leukemia, rheumatism, and respiratory diseases. Chemical studies have indicated the presence of several cucurbitacins, flavones, and other polyphenols in this plant. These phytochemical constituents are responsible for the interesting antioxidant and other biological activities of C. colocynthis.In the present study, for the first time, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with partial least square (PLS) regression analysis was used to quantify the polyphenolic phytochemicals of C. colocynthis.The fruit and aerial parts of the C. colocynthis were extracted individually in methanol followed by fractionation in n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl , n-butanol, and water. Near infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained in absorption mode in the wavelength range 700-2500 nm. The PLS regression model was then built from the obtained spectral data to quantify the total polyphenol contents in the selected plant samples.The PLS regression model obtained had a R value of 99% with a 0.98 correlationship value and a good prediction with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 1.89% and correlation of 0.98. These results were further confirmed through UV-vis spectroscopy and it is found that the ethyl  fraction has the maximum value for polyphenol contents (101.7 mg/100 g; NIR, 100.4 mg/100 g; UV-vis).The polyphenolic phytochemicals of the fruit and aerial parts of C. colocynthis have been quantified successfully by using multivariate analysis in a non-destructive, economical, precise, and highly sensitive method, which uses very simple sample preparation.

Abnormal metabolism and hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in the body induces the development of an overactive and continuous inflammatory response, resulting in  and metabolic syndromes, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki (TC), a perennial creeping herbaceous plant, is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb widely used for the treatment of heat stroke, aching muscles and bones, cold, dysentery, and ambustion.This study evaluated the influence of TC on inflammation responses and lipid metabolism.In this study, ground TC powder was extracted with 95% ethanol. The ethanol was removed by vacuum concentration, and the resulting extract was further extracted with a number of solvents of different polarity to produce four final extracts: an ethanol extract (TCEE), an ethyl  extract (TCEAE), an n-butanol extract (TCBUE), and a water extract (TCWE). The anti-inflammatory efficacy of the extracts and their capability for lipid metabolism regulation was then explored.TCEE, TCEAE, and TCBUE exhibited good anti-inflammatory efficacy; TCEAE also simultaneously regulated lipid metabolism. In RAW264.7 cells, these three extracts suppressed the expression of iNOS and IL-6 via the signaling pathway activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and thereby showed anti-inflammatory efficacy. In 3T3-L1 cells, these three extracts promoted lipid metabolism and reduced lipid accumulation through the activation of PPARα and the increased expression of adiponectin, thus demonstrating regulation of lipid metabolism.These results indicate that TC possesses anti-inflammatory efficacy and can regulate lipid metabolism through the activation of transcription factor PPARs. We speculate that these nutraceutical effects are attributable to betulin, an active ingredient in this herbal medicine.© Author(s) 2017.

Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in  or to greater body mass or body fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and , the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial.To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower body mass index (BMI) or weight.Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies.All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m(2)).Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life-table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone  and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with levonorgestrel and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing levonorgestrel and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the "treatment-compliant" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six-capsule levonorgestrel implant showed differences in pregnancy by weight. One study showed higher weight was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower weight groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more.Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or . These included depot medroxyprogesterone  (subcutaneous), levonorgestrel IUC, the two-rod levonorgestrel implant, and the etonogestrel implant.The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or weight and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than weight alone, can provide information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non-randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988119>Glucocorticoid treatment facilitates development of a metabolic syndrome in ovariectomized Macaca Mulatta fed a high fat diet.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a cluster of key features, which include abdominal , insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of elevated glucocorticoid levels on the development of MetS in middle-aged female rhesus monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) after ovariectomy. Six female ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (9-13years) were randomly assigned to either a control group (normal diet, n=3) or a group in which MetS was facilitated (n=3). The MetS group fed with HFD (15% fat) and received oral prednisone  treatment (50mg/day). After 24months, the GCs treatment was withdrawn with continuation of high-fat feeding for a further 12months. After 24months, the MetS group displayed a significant increase in body weight and abdominal circumference. Additionally, the MetS animals displayed abnormal serum lipids, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Histology of liver biopsies indicated marked accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes of MetS animals. Withdrawal of GCs treatment led to recovery from above-mentioned metabolic disorders. Whereas GCs treatment increased leptin expression, it lowered expression of adiponectin and other factors in adipose tissue. Expression of Hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase-1 and glucose transporter type-4 in the livers of MetS animals were reduced. We conclude that in the context of high fat diet, high levels of exogenous GCs contribute to the development of MetS in non-human primates.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) for Contraceptive Use, 2016 (), which has been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is a published guideline based on the best available evidence and expert opinion to help health care providers better care for women with chronic medical problems who need contraception. The goal of this Practice Bulletin is to explain how to use the USMEC rating system in clinical practice and to specifically discuss the rationale behind the ratings for various medical conditions. Contraception for women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (); the use of emergency contraception in women with medical coexisting medical conditions, including , (); and the effect of depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) on bone health () are addressed in other documents from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349136>Dietary fibers inhibit  in mice, but host responses in the cecum and liver appear unrelated to fiber-specific changes in cecal bacterial taxonomic composition.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibers (DF) can prevent  in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Their mode of action is not fully elucidated, but the gut microbiota have been implicated. This study aimed to identify the effects of seven dietary fibers (barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester) effective in preventing diet-induced  and links to differences in cecal bacteria and host gene expression. Mice (n = 12) were fed either a low-fat diet (LFD), HFD or a HFD supplemented with the DFs, barley beta-glucan, apple pectin, inulin, inulin  ester, inulin propionate ester, inulin butyrate ester or a combination of inulin propionate ester and inulin butyrate ester for 8 weeks. Cecal bacteria were determined by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Host responses, body composition, metabolic markers and gene transcription (cecum and liver) were assessed post intervention. HFD mice showed increased adiposity, while all of the DFs prevented weight gain. DF specific differences in cecal bacteria were observed. Results indicate that diverse DFs prevent weight gain on a HFD, despite giving rise to different cecal bacteria profiles. Conversely, common host responses to dietary fiber observed are predicted to be important in improving barrier function and genome stability in the gut, maintaining energy homeostasis and reducing HFD induced inflammatory responses in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26040664>17β-Trenbolone exposure programs metabolic dysfunction in larval medaka.</a></h2><p>Here, we used physiological and transcriptomic analyses to evaluate the effects of 17β-trenbolone (TB) on metabolism during the early life stage of medaka (Oryzias latipes). In the physiological experiments, sex reversal rates increased continuously in proportion to TB concentrations (2-100 ng/L), and were 100% (all males) in the 200 ng/L treatment group. TB caused a significant increase in the gonadosomatic index of females at concentrations of 60 and 100 ng/L. These females exhibited swollen abdomens and decreased egg production and fertility. Significant increases were observed in the body mass index of these females. TB caused decreased fertility in males at concentrations >20 ng/L, but no other effects were observed. In the transcriptomic (microarray) experiments, larvae were exposed to TB for up to 7 d. Analyses using the KEGG Orthology Database revealed that predominant categories of significantly upregulated genes included "lipid metabolism" and "metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides." Thirteen genes (including those for hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, cytoplasmic synthase, and lanosterol synthase) related to cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway were highlighted in these categories. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses were consistent with the microarray results, in terms of the direction and magnitude of change to gene expression. Among the downregulated genes, angiopoietin-like 4 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1, which are inversely correlated with , were detected in the TB treatments. In conclusion, the results suggest that the exposure of females to TB during the early life stage may cause metabolic dysfunctions, including  and disrupted cholesterol synthesis.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here we investigated phenotypic and transcriptomic differences between the young and aging heart using a mineralocorticoid-excess model of hypertension. Ten-week ("young") and 36-week ("aging") mice underwent a unilateral uninephrectomy with deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA) pellet implantation ( = 6-8/group) and were followed for 6 weeks. Cardiac structure and function, blood pressure (BP) and the cardiac transcriptome were subsequently examined. Young and aging DOCA mice had high BP, increased cardiac mass, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased in aging DOCA-treated mice in contrast to young DOCA mice. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis occurred in response to DOCA, but perivascular fibrosis was greater in aging mice. Transcriptomic analysis showed that young mice had features of higher oxidative stress, likely due to activation of the respiratory electron transport chain. In contrast, aging mice showed up-regulation of collagen formation in association with activation of innate immunity together with markers of inflammation including cytokine and platelet signaling. In comparison to younger mice, aging mice demonstrated different phenotypic and molecular responses to hypertensive stress. These findings have potential implications for the pathogenesis of age-related forms of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28472576>Ulipristal : An update for Australian GPs.</a></h2><p>In Australia, use and understanding of emergency contraception among women remains relatively low.

Here, we found that high-fat diet promoted the lipid accumulation and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in mice, while oral melatonin supplementation alleviated the lipid accumulation and reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis, including the diversity of intestinal microbiota, relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes, and functional profiling of microbial communities, such as energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Interestingly, melatonin failed to alleviate the high-fat-induced lipid accumulation in antibiotic-treated mice; however, microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Notably, short-chain fatty acids were decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice, while melatonin treatment improved the production of acetic acid. Correlation analysis found a marked correlation between production of acetic acid and relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes. Importantly, sodium  treatment also alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin improves lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice, and the potential mechanisms may be associated with reprogramming gut microbiota, especially, Bacteroides and Alistipes-mediated acetic acid production. Future studies are needed for patients with metabolic syndrome to fully understand melatonin's effects on body weight and lipid profiles and the potential mechanism of gut microbiota.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, complete remission (CR) rate after progestin therapy is not enough ranging from 60 to 80 %, with high recurrence rate. Clinical features that predict treatment efficacy and recurrence after progestin therapy have not yet been revealed in detail. The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors in patients with EC who achieved CR after medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) therapy.We retrospectively reviewed 35 EC patients treated with MPA at our institution between 2000 and 2016. Following confirmation of endometrioid adenocarcinoma G1, patients orally took 600 mg MPA daily for 26 weeks. Patients with CR periodically took oral contraceptives. The association of recurrence-free survival (RFS) with several clinical features including age, body mass index (BMI), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) was analyzed.Of 35 patients, 25 (71%) achieved CR, whereas 10 (29%) underwent hysterectomy due to failure of MPA therapy. Eleven (44%) of 25 patients with CR successfully gave birth after MPA therapy, whereas 8 (32%) developed recurrence. On univariate analysis, PCOM was significantly associated with better recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P=0.009), and BMI ≥25 kg/m2 exhibited a nonsignificant trend for longer RFS (P=0.0674). Although multivariate analysis failed to detect any valid hazard ratio (HR), absence of PCOM and non- were both independent risk factors for recurrence (P=0.00293 and P=0.0201, respectively). Notably, none of 10 cases with PCOM experienced recurrence under maintenance with oral contraceptives.PCOM might be a good prognostic factor in those achieving CR after MPA therapy for EC.Creative Commons Attribution License</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467421>Regulation of thermogenic capacity in brown and white adipocytes by the prebiotic high-esterified pectin and its postbiotic .</a></h2><p>High-esterified pectin (HEP) is a prebiotic able to modulate gut microbiota, associated with health-promoting metabolic effects in glucose and lipid metabolism and adipostatic hormone sensitivity.

A wide range of aromatic aldehydes easily undergo condensations with substituted o-phenylendiamine under mild condition to afford the target molecular in excellent yields.Melting points were measured on an Electrothemal X6 microscopy digital melting point apparatus. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AVANCE 400 (400 MHz) instrument with the TMS at d 0.00 ppm as an internal standard. C, H and N analysis were performed by a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. Chemicals used were of commercial grade without further purification. An equimloar (1.0 mmol) mixture of o-phenylenediamine 1, aromatic aldehyde 2, and L-Carnitine (10 mol%) was vigorously stirred at 60°C in EtOH (3 mL) for the specific time indicated by TLC (petroleum: ethyl  ether = 4:1). After completion of the reaction, the mixture was quenched by adding H2O (20 mL), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 10 mL), and the combined extracts were dried by anhydrous MgSO4.

There are some indications that SCFAs inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents, but research on this subject is sparse. However, it has been reported that receptors for SCFAs, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 are expressed not only on gut endocrine cells secreting GLP-1 and PYY, but also on pancreatic islet cells. We hypothesized that SCFAs might influence the endocrine secretion from pancreatic islets similar to their effects on the enteroendocrine cells. We studied this using isolated perfused mouse pancreas which responded adequately to changes in glucose and to infusions of arginine. None of the SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, influenced glucagon secretion, whereas they had weak inhibitory effects on somatostatin and insulin secretion. Infusions of two specific agonists of FFAR2 and FFAR3, CFMB and Compound 4, respectively, did not influence the pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas both induced strong increases in the secretion of somatostatin. In conclusion, the small effects of , propionate and butyrate we observed here may not be physiologically relevant, but the effects of CFMB and Compound 4 on somatostatin secretion suggest that it may be possible to manipulate pancreatic secretion pharmacologically with agonists of the FFAR2 and 3 receptors, a finding which deserves further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359019>Eurotium cristatum, a potential probiotic fungus from Fuzhuan brick tea, alleviated  in mice by modulating gut microbiota.</a></h2><p> is one of the major public health problems worldwide, mainly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles and diet. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may lead to obese humans and animals. Modulating gut bacteria through probiotics or certain dietary supplements could normalize gut microbiota and subsequently alleviate . The daily consumption of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) or its extracts has been observed to alleviate  in humans and experimental animals. In this study, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  in mice, such as body weight gain and fat accumulation, was prevented by the consumption of Eurotium cristatum, the dominant fungus during the manufacturing and storage of FBT. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice was also partially normalized. E. cristatum was able to modulate both gut fungal and bacterial compositions, based on the analysis of the microbiota composition of mice fecal samples (n = 5). E. cristatum increased  and butyrate-producing bacteria in mouse gut. There was five times more butyrate in the fecal samples from mice fed with E. cristatum than that from untreated HFD mice. Our results suggest that E. cristatum may be used as a probiotic fungus to alleviate  and to modulate gut microbiota in humans beneficially.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30042948>Betaine and Choline Improve Lipid Homeostasis in  by Participation in Mitochondrial Oxidative Demethylation.</a></h2><p>We investigated the metabolic effects of betaine (Bet) supplementation on CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase/Pcyt2 heterozygous mice (HET). HET received either no treatment or were allowed access to 1% Bet supplemented water for 8 weeks. As we previously showed with choline (Cho), Bet improved hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis in HET. The protection from  associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and increased lipid breakdown in adipocytes was attributed to increased energy requirements for metabolism and elimination of supplemented Bet and Cho. H-NMR-based profiling revealed metabolic changes caused by Bet and Cho supplementation. Cho increased the citric acid cycle intermediate succinic acid while reducing isoleucine, valine, threonine, and lysine. Bet increased α-ketoglutaric acid and did not stimulate catabolism of amino acids. Increased histidine and alanine are specific biomarkers for Bet treatment. Cho and Bet caused glycerol accumulation and reduced sarcosine, taurine, , and β-hydroxybutyrate levels. These data provide new insights on how Cho and Bet supplementation can aid in treatment of  related disorders due to their positive effects on lipolysis, the citric acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative demethylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531199>The renin-angiotensin system in the arcuate nucleus controls resting metabolic rate.</a></h2><p> represents the primary challenge to improving cardiovascular health, and suppression of resting metabolic rate (RMR) is implicated in the maintenance of . Increasing evidence supports a major role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) within the brain in the control of RMR.The angiotensin II (ANG) Agtr1a receptor colocalizes with the leptin receptor (Lepr) primarily within cells of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus that also express Agouti-related peptide (Agrp).

Agtr1a is localized to a specific subset (SST3) of Agrp neurons within the ARC.The RAS within the ARC is implicated specifically in RMR control, primarily through Agtr1a localized to the SST3 subset of Agrp neurons.

The phytochemical investigation and antioxidant assays were carried out on the extracts using standard procedures. The antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory potentials were evaluated using α-amylase, α-glucosidase and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes respectively. Vero cells were employed to determine the cytotoxicity of the extracts.The ethyl  extract showed higher phenolic contents (8.97 mg/g gallic acid) while methanol displayed higher flavonoid (36.06 mg/g quercetin) and flavonol (153.44 mg/g rutin) contents than other extracts. Hexane extract had the greatest capacity to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (0.19 mg/mL), hydroxyl (25.77 mg/mL) and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (0.07 mg/mL) radicals, while ethyl  extract exhibited stronger inhibition (P < 0.05) against superoxide anion (0.41 mg/mL) and ferric ion-reducing power (2.36 mg/mL) compared to other extracts and standards. Aqueous extract (27.02 mg/mL) exhibited strong metal-chelating activity (P < 0.05) compared to other extracts and gallic acid. The aqueous extract demonstrated the greatest inhibition of α-glucosidase (1.45 mg/mL) and α-amylase (2.43 mg/mL) compared to other extracts and acarbose. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) in half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC) values of all tested extracts and indomethacin in the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity.

At baseline, d-lactate was positively correlated with DNL-area under the curve (AUC) (P = 0.003), liver fat fraction (P = 0.02), TG (P = 0.004), and TG/high-density lipoprotein ratio (P = 0.002). After 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction, serum d-lactate levels reduced by 50% (P < 0.0001), and changes in d-lactate correlated with both changes in DNL-AUC and measures of insulin sensitivity.Baseline correlation of d-lactate with DNL and measures of insulin sensitivity and reduction in d-lactate after 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction suggest that DNL and nonenzymatic glycation are functionally linked via intermediary glycolysis in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and point to fructose as a key dietary substrate that drives both pathways.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266729>Metagenomic Insights into the Degradation of Resistant Starch by Human Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Several studies monitoring alterations in the community structure upon resistant starch (RS) interventions are available, although comprehensive function-based analyses are lacking. Recently, a multiomics approach based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics, and metabolomics on fecal samples from individuals subjected to high and low doses of type 2 RS (RS2; 48 g and 3 g/2,500 kcal, respectively, daily for 2 weeks) in a crossover intervention experiment was performed. In the present study, we did pathway-based metagenomic analyses on samples from a subset of individuals ( = 12) from that study to obtain additional detailed insights into the functional structure at high resolution during RS2 intervention. A mechanistic framework based on obtained results is proposed where primary degradation was governed by , with  as a major taxon involved, providing fermentation substrates and increased  concentrations for the growth of various major butyrate producers exhibiting the enzyme butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA): CoA-transferase. H-scavenging sulfite reducers and acetogens concurrently increased. Individual responses of gut microbiota were noted, where seven of the 12 participants displayed all features of the outlined pattern, whereas four individuals showed mixed behavior and one subject was unresponsive. Intervention order did not affect the outcome, emphasizing a constant substrate supply for maintaining specific functional communities. Manipulation of gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising approach to reduce various noncommunicable diseases, such as  and type 2 diabetes. Specific dietary supplements, including resistant starches (RS), are often a focus, yet comprehensive insights into functional responses of microbiota are largely lacking. Furthermore, unresponsiveness in certain individuals is poorly understood. Our data indicate that distinct parts of microbiota work jointly to degrade RS and successively form health-promoting fermentation end products. It highlights the need to consider both primary degraders and specific more-downstream-acting bacterial groups in order to achieve desired intervention outcomes. The gained insights will assist the design of personalized treatment strategies based on an individual's microbiota.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078593>Preactivation of neutrophils and systemic oxidative stress in dogs with hyperleptinemia.</a></h2><p>High occurrence of  currently constitutes the main nutritional disease of the canine species. There is evidence that leptin increases during  in dogs. Hyperleptinemia is associated with increased neutrophil oxidative metabolism in obese humans and contributes to oxidative stress. However, in obese dogs, the probable relationship between this condition and the activation of the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils has yet to be established. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that neutrophil activation and systemic oxidative stress occur in dogs with hyperleptinemia. A control group of 24 healthy dogs with a body condition score (BCS) of 4-5, an overweight group of 25 dogs with a BCS of 6-7, and 27 obese dogs with a BCS of 8-9, were composed. Two subgroups were formed composed of dogs with and without hyperleptinemia, grouped according to the 95% confidence interval obtained for plasma leptin values of the control group. Changes in  markers (body condition score, adiponectin and plasma leptin) and plasma oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant and oxidant capacities and oxidative stress index) were measured in all the dogs selected. Neutrophil oxidative metabolism was evaluated in flow cytometry by superoxide production with the probe hydroethidine and by hydrogen peroxide production with the probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, with or without phorbol myristate  (PMA) stimulation. Apoptosis and neutrophil viability were quantified in a capillary flow cytometer using Annexin VPE, with or without camptothecin apoptosis inducing effect. Obese dogs presented higher systemic oxidative stress, hyperleptinemia and preactivated neutrophils with accelerated apoptosis. Dogs with hyperleptinemia and obese dogs presented higher neutrophil superoxide production under PMA stimulation and the presence of systemic oxidative stress compared with control. To our knowledge, this is probably the first evidence that preactivation of the oxidative metabolism of circulating neutrophils occurs in dogs with hyperleptinemia, a condition that can induce systemic oxidative stress in the canine species.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH scavenging activity and the ameliorative effects of the extracts on Fe-induced oxidative injury was investigated both in vitro and ex vivo. Alpha glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials of the extracts were examined in vitro, while the effects of the ethanol extract on abdominal glucose intake and muscle glucose uptake were determined in freshly harvested tissues ex vivo. The extracts were subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their possible bioactive components. The ethanol extract showed the most potent FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to other extracts. All extracts increased catalase and SOD activities, and GSH levels in oxidative pancreatic injury. Both ethanol and aqueous extracts exhibited remarkable enzyme inhibitory activities, which was significantly higher than ethyl  extract and acarbose but was not comparable to orlistat. The ethanol extract portrayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on jejunal glucose uptake and enhancement of muscle glucose uptake. 9-(4 methoxyphenyl) xanthene, xanthone and stigmasterol showed strong binding affinities for α-glucosidase and lipase enzymes tested. Data from this study suggest that aerial parts of B. diffusa (particularly the ethanol extract) may not only exhibit antioxidant potentials but may also mediate anti-lipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects via inhibiting fat and carbohydrate digestion as well as abdominal glucose intake and enhancing muscle glucose uptake.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The medications commonly associated with PTCS are amiodarone, antibiotics, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, growth hormone, oral contraceptives, vitamin A analogues, lithium, phenytoin, NSAIDs, leuprolide , and some neuroleptic drugs. In relation to antibiotics, quinolones may cause intracranial hypertension, and most reported cases of quinolone-induced intracranial hypertension were associated with nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or pefloxacin. Literature reports of levofloxacin-induced PTCS are rare. Some authors recently hypothesized that Mycoplasma pneumoniae may trigger PTCS.We report on a 14-year-old overweight White Italian boy who suffered headache, diplopia, and severe bilateral papilloedema after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, exacerbated on levofloxacin intake. A spontaneous improvement in headache and a reduction in diplopia was seen during hospitalisation. Oral acetazolamide therapy led to the regression of papilloedema in about five months. No permanent eye damage has been observed in our patient to date.PTCS pathophysiology may be multifactorial and its specific features and severity may be a consequence of both constitutional and acquired factors interacting synergistically. It may be useful for paediatricians to know that some antibiotics may have the potential to precipitate PTCS in patients who already have an increased CSF pressure due to a transitory imbalanced CSF circulation caused by infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, with headache being the first and most sensitive, but also the least specific, symptom.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622249>Long non-coding RNA HCP5 serves as a ceRNA sponging miR-17-5p and miR-27a/b to regulate the pathogenesis of childhood  via the MAPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Background This study aimed to investigate the completing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involved in childhood . Methods The microarray dataset GSE9624 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (DELs) and messenger RNAs (DEMs) were isolated between the childhood  and non- tissue samples. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of isolated DEMs were performed. DELs and DEMs targeted miRNAs were predicted to construct a ceRNA regulatory network. Finally, critical lncRNAs were validated in another dataset. Results A total of 1257 differentially expressed RNAs were screened, including 28 lncRNAs and 1229 mRNAs. In addition, these RNAs were mainly involved in defense response, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, apoptosis, etc. Three lncRNAs (human leukocyte antigen complex 5 [HCP5], long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 839 [LINC00839] and receptor activity modifying protein 2 [RAMP2-AS1]) and two related miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-27a/b-3p) were identified as key RNAs in childhood . Specifically, lncRNA HCP5 interacted with miR-17-5p and miR-27a/b to regulate nemo-like kinase (NLK) and Ras-related protein 2 (RRAS2) via the MAPK signaling pathway.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs , propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795972>: a diet-derived key metabolite in energy metabolism: good or bad in context of  and glucose homeostasis?</a></h2><p>To highlight recent research findings on effects of the short-chain fatty acid  in the control of body weight, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis.

Despite the absence of combustion products and toxins such as carbon monoxide (CO) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA), carbonyls including short-chain, toxic aldehydes have been detected in e-cigarette-derived aerosols up to levels found in tobacco smoke. Given the health concerns regarding exposures to toxic aldehydes, understanding both aldehyde generation in e-cigarette and e-cigarette exposure is critical. Thus, we measured aldehydes generated in aerosols derived from propylene glycol (PG):vegetable glycerin (VG) mixtures and from commercial e-liquids with flavorants using a state-of-the-art carbonyl trap and mass spectrometry. To track e-cigarette exposure in mice, we measured urinary metabolites of 4 aldehydes using ULPC-MS/MS or GC-MS. Aldehyde levels, regardless of abundance (saturated: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde >> unsaturated: acrolein, crotonaldehyde), were dependent on the PG:VG ratio and the presence of flavorants. The metabolites of 3 aldehydes - formate,  and 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA; acrolein metabolite) -- were increased in urine after e-cigarette aerosol and mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) exposures, but the crotonaldehyde metabolite (3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid, HPMMA) was increased only after MCS exposure. Interestingly, exposure to menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol increased the levels of urinary 3-HPMA and sum of nicotine exposure (nicotine, cotinine, -3'-hydroxycotinine) relative to exposure to a Classic Tobacco-flavored e-cigarette aerosol. Comparing these findings with aerosols of other ENDS and by measuring aldehyde-derived metabolites in human urine following exposure to e-cigarette aerosols will further our understanding of the relationship between ENDS use, aldehyde exposure and health risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27504897>Association of Intestinal Microbiota with Metabolic Markers and Dietary Habits in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota, along with factors such as diet and host genetics, contributes to , metabolic dysfunction and diabetes. Therefore, we examined the relationship between gut microbiota, blood metabolic markers, dietary habits and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Dietary habits, blood and fecal samples from 59 T2DM patients were recruited, and the association of intestinal microbiota with metabolic markers and dietary habits was analyzed.Total energy intake was 1,692 ± 380 kcal/day. Carbohydrate, fat and protein intakes were 57.5 ± 5.2, 23.2 ± 5.3 and 13.2 ± 2.2%, respectively. Dietary habits - high carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake - were associated with increased counts of Clostridium clusters IV and XI and decreased counts of Bifidobacterium spp., order Lactobacillales and Clostridium cluster IV. Protein intake was negatively correlated with fecal  and total SCFAs. Total SCFAs, propionate and  were negatively correlated with blood insulin levels and the homeostasis model of insulin resistance.Diets low in protein and carbohydrates favor a healthy gut microbiome and improve glucose tolerance in T2DM patients, although further elucidation of the role of the gut microbiome could lead to better therapies and prophylaxes.© 2016 S.

This study aims to characterize the compositional and functional effects of several nutritional, neutraceutical, and pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease interventions on the gut microbiome, through metagenomic and metabolomic approaches. Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24 weeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: plant sterol ester (PSE), oat β-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT). The gut microbiome composition was then investigated, in addition to the host fecal and serum metabolome.We observed major shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome of PSE mice, while OBG and BSH mice displayed more modest fluctuations, and STAT showed relatively few alterations. Interestingly, these compositional effects imparted by PSE were coupled with an increase in  and reduction in isovalerate (p < 0.05), while OBG promoted n-butyrate synthesis (p < 0.01). In addition, PSE significantly dampened the microbial production of the proatherogenic precursor compound, trimethylamine (p < 0.05), attenuated cholesterol accumulation, and nearly abolished atherogenesis in the model (p < 0.05). However, PSE supplementation produced the heaviest mice with the greatest degree of adiposity (p < 0.05). Finally, PSE, OBG, and STAT all appeared to have considerable impact on the host serum metabolome, including alterations in several acylcarnitines previously associated with a state of metabolic dysfunction (p < 0.05).We observed functional alterations in microbial and host-derived metabolites, which may have important implications for systemic metabolic health, suggesting that cardiovascular disease interventions may have a significant impact on the microbiome composition and functionality.

Uncertainty of current risk assessment strategies and long latency periods between first carcinogen exposure and diagnosis of tumors have raised interest in predictive biomarkers. Initial DNA adduct formation is a necessary step for genotoxin induced carcinogenesis. However, as DNA adducts not always translate into tumorigenesis, their predictive value is limited. Here we hypothesize that the combined analysis of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts along with time-matched gene expression changes could serve as a superior prediction tool for genotoxic carcinogenesis. Eker rats, heterozygous for the tuberous sclerosis (Tsc2) tumor suppressor gene and thus highly susceptible towards genotoxic renal carcinogens, were continuously treated with the DNA alkylating carcinogen methylazoxymethanol  (MAMAc). Two weeks of MAMAc treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase of O-methylguanine and N7-methylguanine adducts in the kidney cortex, which was however not reflected by significant expression changes of cyto-protective genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Instead, we found a transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the tumor-related MAPK, FoxO and TGF-beta pathways. Continuous MAMAc treatment for up to 6 months resulted in a mild but significant increase of cancerous lesions. In summary, the combined analysis of DNA adducts and early gene expression changes could serve as a suitable predictive tool for genotoxicant-induced carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368189>Limited synergy of  and hypertension, prevalent risk factors in onset and progression of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h2><p> and hypertension are prevalent comorbidities in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

DS-induced hypertension did not affect cardiac output and minimally elevated E/e' ratio. Diastolic derangements in placebo-treated obese rats developed in absence of inflammation and fibrosis, yet in presence of oxidative stress and hypertrophic remodelling. In contrast, hypertension triggered apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis, with limited synergy of the comorbidities observed for inflammation and fibrosis.

The use of statins, potent inhibitors of hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl (HMG) Co-A reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, has significantly reduced the rates of cardiovascular and general mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. How statins lower plasma cholesterol levels presents a mechanistic conundrum since persistent exposure to these drugs  or  is known to induce overexpression of the HMG Co-A reductase gene and protein. In an attempt to solve this mechanistic puzzle, Schonewille et al, studied detailed metabolic parameters of cholesterol synthesis, inter-organ flux and excretion in mice treated with 3 common statins, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin, each with its unique pharmacokinetics. From the measurements of the rates of heavy water (DO) and [C]- incorporation into lipids, the authors calculated the rates of whole body and organ-specific cholesterol synthesis in control and statin-treated mice. These analyses revealed dramatic enhancement in the rates of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis in statin-treated mice that concomitantly elicited lower levels of cholesterol in their plasma. The authors have provided strong evidence to indicate that statin treatment in mice led to induction of compensatory metabolic pathways that apparently mitigated an excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body. It was noted however that changes in cholesterol metabolism induced by 3 statins were not identical. While sustained delivery of all 3 statins led to enhanced rates of biliary excretion of cholesterol and its fecal elimination, only atorvastatin treated mice elicited enhanced trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. Thus, blockade of HMGCR by statins in mice was associated with profound metabolic adaptations that reset their cholesterol homeostasis. The findings of Schonewille et al, deserve to be corroborated and extended in patients in order to more effectively utilize these important cholesterol-lowering drugs in the clinic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28442115>Lipase inhibitory activity of Lagenaria siceraria fruit as a strategy to treat .</a></h2><p>To explore pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity under different extraction conditions in order to track the most potent extract.The methanolic extract and its fractions in solvents of increasing polarity, ether, chloroform, ethyl , n-butanol and water, were made through cold maceration.

The IC (μg/mL) values of methanolic, ethanolic, chloroform, ethyl , acetone, ethyl  (after washing with water) and aqueous decoction were 293.40, 266.47, 157.59, 182.12, 352.34, 257.00, and 190.00, respectively. The activity of chloroform, ethyl  and aqueous extracts were close to that of the drug orlistat (IC 146 μg/mL). Out of the fractions of the methanolic extract, the chloroform fraction was most active (IC 189.6 μg/mL). The order of inhibitory activity of the fractions was as follows: chloroform＞ether＞n-butanolic＞aqueous＞ethyl . The GC/MS analysis of the most active chloroform faction showed the presence of hexadecanoic acid, methyl hexadecanoate, isopropyl palmitate, methyl 9,12-octadecadienate, and methyl 9,12,15-octadecatrienoate.The study suggests that Lagenaria siceraria has potential to inhibit pancreatic lipase activity, suppressing lipid digestion and thereby diminishing entry of lipids into the body. Regular intake of aqueous decoction of the fruit may therefore be recommended for control of .

It has been suggested that weight loss may affect SCFA metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of , propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the absorption of dietary triglyceride in the intestine, and thus exerts an anti- effect. This study aimed to investigate the bioactive constituents of the fruits of M. charantia (MCF) extract and fractions against pancreatic PL followed by study of their inhibition kinetics. The PL inhibitory assay was performed spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance of the products at 405 nm, using p-nitrophenylcaprylate as substrate. The results indicated that the ethyl  fraction of MCF (EFMC) offered significant, dose-dependent inhibition against PL, compared with the positive control, Orlistat. The enzyme kinetics study revealed the inhibition to be a mixed type in nature. Additionally, the total phenol and flavonoid content of the fractions was estimated. A positive correlation between phenolic content of EFMC and its PL inhibitory activity was established statistically, which implied that higher inhibition potential was contributed by the phenolic compounds. The identification of the bioactive constituents was further confirmed by LC-QTOF-MS study. This finding suggested that phenolic compounds of MCF can serve as functional food components to address -related disorders linked with PL.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214040>Reinforcement of intestinal epithelial barrier by arabinoxylans in overweight and obese subjects: A randomized controlled trial: Arabinoxylans in gut barrier.</a></h2><p> and metabolic diseases are associated with alterations in microbial composition and impaired gut barrier. Previous in vitro and animal studies have shown that arabinoxylans (AX) have the potential to modulate gut microbiota and gut barrier and therefore could have a protective role. Primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of AX on intestinal permeability. Secondary aims included the effect of AX on gene transcription and protein expression of tight junctions (TJ), intestinal microbiota composition and activity, immune response and metabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 47 overweight subjects were randomly assigned to groups receiving 7.5 g/d AX (n = 16), 15 g/d AX (n = 17) or 15 g/d placebo (n = 14) for 6 wks. Intestinal permeability was investigated using a multi-sugar test. Sigmoid colon tissue was obtained from a subgroup (n = 26) for analyzing gene transcription and mucosal expression of TJ proteins. Fecal samples were collected to assess microbial composition and activity. Furthermore, the production of cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. Blood was also sampled for measuring metabolic markers.No significant changes in gastrointestinal permeability and TJ protein expression were observed after 6 wks AX supplementation compared to placebo. However, gene transcription of occludin was upregulated in the 7.5 g AX group, and transcription of claudin-3 and claudin-4 were upregulated in the 15 g AX group compared to placebo. Furthermore, fecal microbiota diversity was decreased after 6 wks 15 g AX treatment, but no change in relative abundance of dominant phyla was observed. AX intake significantly decreased fecal pH and increased fecal concentrations of total SCFAs, , propionate and butyrate, compared to placebo. Additionally, a decreased TNFα production by stimulated PBMCs was observed after 15 g AX treatment. No changes in metabolic markers were detected.Regular consumption of AX resulted in a more beneficial fermentation profile in overweight and obese individuals. Further studies are required to assess whether such fermentation profile will translate into improved gut barrier function and immune health.

Plasma  is measured through  H NMR and insulin sensitivity using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Subjects with insulin resistance show an increase in the relative abundance (RA) of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria while RA of Firmicutes is decreased. In all subjects, Firmicutes RA is negatively correlated with HbA and fasting triglycerides, whereas Proteobacteria RA was negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Firmicutes RA is positively associated with markers of brown adipocytes (PRDM16, UCP1, and DIO2) in SAT, but not in VAT. Multivariate regression analysis indicates that Firmicutes RA contributes significantly to SAT PRDM16, UCP1, and DIO2 mRNA variance after controlling for age, BMI, HbA , or insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, Firmicutes RA, specifically those bacteria belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family, is positively associated with plasma  levels, which are also linked to SAT PRDM16 mRNA and insulin sensitivity.Gut microbiota composition is linked to adipose tissue browning and insulin action in morbidly obese subjects, possibly through circulating .© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Oxalis cordata and Xylopia aromatica are two underutilized species whose leaves and fruits, respectively, have been used as food in the 19th century. In this study, we used chemical and in vitro assays to evaluate the potential of these species as functional foods. The inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase and DPP-IV were evaluated using the crude extracts and fractions ethyl , butanol and water of these two species. For polyphenols determination, samples were prepared with different solvents and these were analysed by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Finally, fatty acids profile was determinated by gas chromatography. The crude extract (IC=0.84mg/ml), ethyl  extract (IC=0.88mg/ml) an aqueous fraction (IC=0.63mg/ml) of C. cordata were inhibitory on pancreatic lipase but inactive against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Extracts from X. aromatica were inactive against the lipase pancreatic enzyme, but a butanolic fraction inhibited DPP-IV (IC=0.71±0.05mg/ml). The phenolic acids orientin/isorientin, chlorogenic acid (0.32g/100g) and the flavonoid derivatives rutin (0.27g/100g), quercetin and luteolin were observed in all products. Additionally, fatty acid quantification showed that oleic (7.5g/100g) and linoleic acid (6.5g/100g) were predominant in X. aromatica fruit.

The RAS is also synthesized locally in a number of tissues including the brain, where it can act in a paracrine fashion to regulate blood pressure, thirst, fluid balance, and resting energy expenditure/resting metabolic rate (RMR). Recent studies demonstrate that ANG AT receptors () specifically in agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) coordinate autonomic and energy expenditure responses to various stimuli including deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA)-salt, high-fat feeding, and leptin. It remains unclear, however, how these disparate stimuli converge upon and activate this specific population of AT receptors in AgRP neurons. We hypothesize that these stimuli may act to stimulate local expression of the angiotensinogen (AGT) precursor for ANG, or the expression of AT receptors, and thereby local activity of the RAS within the (ARC). Here we review mechanisms that may control AGT and AT expression within the central nervous system, with a particular focus on mechanisms activated by steroids, dietary fat, and leptin.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172796>Effect of orlistat or metformin in overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients with insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of orlistat or metformin combined with Diane-35 on anthropometric, hormonal and metabolic parameters in overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance (fasting insulin > 10 mIU/L).

The novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor CG200745 was originally developed to treat various cancers. Previous studies showed that CG200745 attenuated hypertension through inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone -induced hypertensive rat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of CG200745 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertension. Nine-week old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 17 weeks. Each group of mice was treated with vehicle or CG200745 by intraperitoneal injection for 9 days. HFD group showed higher body weight, blood pressure (BP), HDAC activities, angiotensinogen and renin expressions in kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression in the lung, serum angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in mesenteric artery compared with ND group.

Although dietary interventions with probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics can be effective means to regulate  and associated comorbidities, the underlying shifts in gut microbial communities, especially at the functional level, have not been characterized in great details. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of synbiotics on the regulation of gut microbiota and the alleviation of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders in mice.Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10% (normal diet, ND) or 60% (high-fat diet, HFD) of total calories from fat (lard). Dietary interventions in the HFD-fed mice included (i) probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei DSM 46331), (ii) prebiotic (oat β-glucan), and (iii) synbiotic (a mixture of i and ii) treatments for 12 weeks. Besides detailed characterization of host metabolic parameters, a multi-omics approach was used to systematically profile the microbial signatures at both the phylogenetic and functional levels using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics and targeted metabolomics analysis.The synbiotic intervention significantly reduced body weight gain and alleviated features of metabolic complications. At the phylogenetic level, the synbiotic treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced changes in microbial populations, both in terms of richness and the relative abundance of specific taxa. Potentially important species such as Faecalibaculum rodentium and Alistipes putredinis that might mediate the beneficial effects of the synbiotic were identified. At the functional level, short-chain fatty acid and bile acid profiles revealed that all dietary interventions significantly restored cecal levels of , propionate, and butyrate, while the synbiotic treatment reduced the bile acid pools most efficiently. Metaproteomics revealed that the effects of the synbiotic intervention might be mediated through metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms.Our results suggested that dietary intervention using the novel synbiotic can alleviate HFD-induced weight gain and restore gut microbial ecosystem homeostasis phylogenetically and functionally.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the molecular mechanism underlying the antiobesity effect of consuming blackberry anthocyanins (BLA) and blueberry anthocyanins (BBA) was investigated in high-fat-diet- (HFD-) fed C57BL/6 mice. Sixty mice were administered a low-fat diet (LFD), a HFD, or a HFD plus orlistat, and BLA or BBA in their daily food for 12 weeks. As a result, the consumption of BLA and BBA inhibited body weight gain by 40.5% and 55.4%, respectively, in HFD-fed mice. The BLA and BBA treatments markedly reduced serum and hepatic lipid levels and significantly increased hepatic superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. In addition, the treatments effectively increased fecal  and butyrate levels and significantly attenuated expression of tumor necrosis factor TNF-, interleukin-6, and nuclear factor-kappaB genes. Moreover, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectroscopy results suggested that BLA and BBA significantly affected the hepatic lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and the insulin-signaling pathway.

Fermentation end products, in particular the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) , are believed to be involved in these processes. We investigated the long-term effects of supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), an acetogenic fiber, on the composition of the human gut microbiota and human metabolism.We performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention study of 44 overweight or obese (body mass index, 28-40 kg/m) prediabetic men and women (ages, 45-70 y) from October 2014 through October 2015 in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The participants were assigned randomly to groups who ingested 15 g GOS or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin) daily with their regular meals for 12 weeks. Before and after this period, we collected data on peripheral and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition, plasma and fecal SCFA, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation, body composition, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. The primary outcome was the effect of GOS on peripheral insulin sensitivity, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method.Supplementation of diets with GOS, but not placebo, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium species in feces by 5-fold (P = .009; q = 0.144). Microbial richness or diversity in fecal samples were not affected. We did not observe any differences in fecal or fasting plasma SCFA concentrations or in systemic concentrations of gut-derived hormones, incretins, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, or other markers of inflammation. In addition, no significant alterations in peripheral and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, body composition, and energy and substrate metabolism were found.Twelve-week supplementation of GOS selectively increased fecal Bifidobacterium species abundance, but this did not produce significant changes in insulin sensitivity or related substrate and energy metabolism in overweight or obese prediabetic men and women.

Alterations in the adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may contribute to the adipose tissue remodeling associated with metabolic syndrome and impact the regional distribution of adipose tissue by generating inherently dysfunctional adipocytes. Here we examine the expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes and their relationship with the lipogenic, antioxidant and oxidative potential of adipocytes generated from visceral ASCs (adipo-visASCs) and subcutaneous ASCs (adipo-subASCs) from subjects with different metabolic profiles.Paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed to isolate the respective ASCs from normal-weight (Nw) subjects and obese patients with metabolic syndrome (METS) and without METS (NonMETS). qPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of the genes studied in both adipo-ASCs from the patient groups and those generated after silencing by small interfering RNA of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes. The accumulation of lipids was quantified by absorbance.No significant differences in cell yield or CD34CD31CD45 ASC percentage were observed between the different patient groups. Unlike adipo-visASCs, adipo-subASCs from METS patients showed a decrease in expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes as well as proteins linked to lipogenesis, antioxidant defense and fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional silencing of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes in adipo-subASCs reduced lipid accumulation and affected transcription levels of lipogenic and antioxidant defense proteins.Adipo-subASCs may be more susceptible than adipo-visASCs to deterioration of the lipogenic, oxidative and antioxidant potential associated with metabolic syndrome.

There is little knowledge about the effect of insulin on the decidualization process and previous findings are contradictory. We investigated the effect of insulin on the regulation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), one of the most important transcription factors during decidualization. Endometrial stromal cells were isolated from six healthy, regularly menstruating women and decidualized in vitro. Gene expression levels of six putative FOXO1 target genes (including insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL)) were measured with Real-Time PCR following FOXO1 inhibition or insulin treatment. PI3K inhibition was used to identify the possible mechanism behind regulation. Subcellular localization of FOXO1 was analyzed with immunofluorescence. All the genes (IGFBP1, CTGF, INSR, DCN, LEFTY2), except prolactin, were evaluated as FOXO1 target genes in decidualizing stromal cells. Insulin caused a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the verified FOXO1 target genes. It was also demonstrated that insulin regulated FOXO1 target genes by transcriptional inactivation and nuclear export of FOXO1 via PI3K pathway. However, insulin did not inhibit the morphological transformation of endometrial stromal cells via transcriptional inactivation of FOXO1. This study provides new insights on the action of insulin on the endometrium via regulation of FOXO1. It is suggested that hyperinsulinemia results in dysregulation of a high number of FOXO1 controlled genes that may contribute to endometrial dysfunction and reproductive failure. Our findings may illuminate possible reasons for unexplained infertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917128>Application of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry for identification, confirmation and quantitation of illegal adulterated weight-loss drugs in plant dietary supplements.</a></h2><p>In this paper, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap quadrupole Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap HRMS) method was developed and validated for identification, confirmation and quantitation of illegal adulterated weight-loss drugs in plant dietary supplements. 13 wt-loss drugs were well separated by the gradient elution of 10mmol/L ammonium  - 0.05% formic acid HO and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min within 12min. The MS analysis was operated under the positive ion and in full MS/dd-MS (data-dependent MS) mode. The full MS scan with resolution at 60 000 FWHM and narrow mass windows at 5ppm acquired data for identification and quantitation, and dd-MS scan with resolution at 15 000 FWHM obtained product ions for confirmation. The method validation showed good linearity with coefficients of determination (r) higher than 0.9951 for all analytes. Meantime, all the LOD and LLOQ values were in the respective range of 0.3-2 and 1-9ng/g. The accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision were in the ranges of -1.7 to 3.4%, 1.7-5.0% and 1.9-4.4%, respectively. The mean recoveries ranged from 85.4 to 107.1%, while the absolute and relative matrix effect were in the corresponding range of 98.2-108.6% and 2.6-8.7%. Among 120 batches of weight loss plant dietary supplements, sibutramine and fluoxertine or both were positive in 29 samples. In general, LTQ-Orbitrap HRMS technology was a powerful tool for the analysis of illegal ingredients in dietary supplements.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bacteria colonizing the mucus layer have evolved to use mucin as a carbon and energy source. One of the members of the mucosa-associated microbiota is , which is capable of producing an extensive repertoire of mucin-degrading enzymes. To further study the substrate utilization abilities of , we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities. The model-supported predictions were validated by  experiments, which showed  to be able to utilize the mucin-derived monosaccharides fucose, galactose, and -acetylglucosamine. Growth was also observed on -acetylgalactosamine, even though the metabolic model did not predict this. The uptake of these sugars, as well as the nonmucin sugar glucose, was enhanced in the presence of mucin, indicating that additional mucin-derived components are needed for optimal growth. An analysis of whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing the gene expression of  grown on mucin with that of the same bacterium grown on glucose confirmed the activity of the genes involved in mucin degradation and revealed most of these to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. The transcriptional response was confirmed by a proteome analysis, altogether revealing a hierarchy in the use of sugars and reflecting the adaptation of  to the mucosal environment. In conclusion, these findings provide molecular insights into the lifestyle of  and further confirm its role as a mucin specialist in the gut. is among the most abundant mucosal bacteria in humans and in a wide range of other animals. Recently,  has attracted considerable attention because of its capacity to protect against diet-induced  in mouse models. However, the physiology of  has not been studied in detail. Hence, we constructed a genome-scale model and describe its validation by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches on bacterial cells grown on mucus and glucose, a nonmucus sugar.

CAN manifests in a spectrum of things, ranging from resting tachycardia and fixed heart rate (HR) to development of "silent" myocardial infarction. Clinical correlates or risk markers for CAN are age, DM duration, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (DLP), development of other microvascular complications. Established risk factors for CAN are poor glycemic control in type 1 DM and a combination of hypertension, DLP, , and unsatisfactory glycemic control in type 2 DM. Symptomatic manifestations of CAN include sinus tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension (OH), abnormal blood pressure (BP) regulation, dizziness, presyncope and syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and infarction. Methods of CAN assessment in clinical practice include assessment of symptoms and signs,  based on HR and BP, short-term electrocardiography (ECG), QT interval prolongation, HR variability (24 h, classic 24 h Holter ECG), ambulatory BP monitoring, HR turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, catecholamine assessment and cardiovascular sympathetic tests, heart sympathetic imaging. Although it is common complication, the significance of CAN has not been fully appreciated and there are no unified treatment algorithms for today. Treatment is based on early diagnosis, life style changes, optimization of glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors. Pathogenetic treatment of CAN includes: Balanced diet and physical activity; optimization of glycemic control; treatment of DLP; antioxidants, first of all α-lipoic acid (ALA), aldose reductase inhibitors, acetyl-L-carnitine; vitamins, first of all fat-soluble vitamin B1; correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction; prevention and treatment of thrombosis; in severe cases-treatment of OH. The promising methods include prescription of prostacyclin analogues, thromboxane A2 blockers and drugs that contribute into strengthening and/or normalization of Na, K-ATPase (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), ALA, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), and the simultaneous prescription of ALA, ω-3 PUFAs and DGLA, but the future investigations are needed. Development of OH is associated with severe or advanced CAN and prescription of nonpharmacological and pharmacological, in the foreground midodrine and fludrocortisone , treatment methods are necessary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158587>Analysis of the gut microbiome and plasma short-chain fatty acid profiles in a spontaneous mouse model of metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Male Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetes (TSOD) mice spontaneously develop  and -related metabolic syndrome. Gut dysbiosis, an imbalance of gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, but its mechanisms are unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main fermentation products of gut microbiota and a link between the gut microbiota and the host's physiology. Here, we investigated a correlation among gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice. We detected enriched levels of Gram-positive bacteria and corresponding decreases in Gram-negative bacteria in 24-wk-old metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice compared with age-matched controls. The abundance of Bacteroidetes species decreased, the abundance of Firmicutes species increased, and nine genera of bacteria were altered in 24-wk-old TSOD mice. The total plasma SCFA level was significantly lower in the TSOD mice than in controls. The major plasma SCFA--decreased in TSOD mice, whereas propionate and butyrate increased. TSOD mice had no minor SCFAs (valerate and hexanoate) but normal mice did. We thus concluded that gut dysbiosis and consequent disruptions in plasma SCFA profiles occurred in metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice. We also propose that the TSOD mouse is a useful model to study gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180212>Kodo millet whole grain and bran supplementation prevents high-fat diet induced derangements in a lipid profile, inflammatory status and gut bacteria in mice.</a></h2><p>The protective role of kodo millet whole grain and bran supplementation in diet induced  has not been investigated. Here we have studied the role of kodo millet supplementation in age matched Swiss albino mice that were randomly divided into groups and fed their respective diets for 16 weeks. A high fat diet increased weight gain, reduced glucose tolerance, increased serum lipids, altered hepatic and adipocyte gene expression and caused dysbiosis in the intestinal beneficial bacteria. Kodo millet supplementation did not affect weight gain but it improved glucose tolerance and prevented an increase in the serum cholesterol and lipid parameters (P ≤ 0.05), modulated adipogenesis related gene expression, decreased serum IL-6 and LPS levels (P ≤ 0.05), promoted selected beneficial gut bacterial abundances (Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacteria, Akkermansia and Roseburia spp.) and improved the total short chain fatty acid production (P ≤ 0.05) and  levels (P ≤ 0.05) in cecal contents.

This study examines the anti-adipogenic and pro-apoptotic effect of red pepper seed water extract (RPS) prepared at 4℃ (RPS4) in 3T3-L1 cells.Effect of RPS4 or its fractions on lipid accumulation was determined in 3T3-L1 cells using oil red O (ORO) staining. The expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adipogenic associated proteins [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α (C/EBP α), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)] were measured in 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4. Apoptosis and the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 family proteins [B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 like protein 4 (Bax), Bal-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak)] were measured in mature 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4.Treatment of RPS4 (0-75 µg/mL) or its fractions (0-50 µg/mL) for 24 h did not have an apparent cytotoxicity on pre and mature 3T3-L1 cells. RPS4 significantly suppressed differentiation and cellular lipid accumulation by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and reducing the expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBP α, SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC. In addition, all fractions except ethyl  fraction significantly suppressed cellular lipid accumulation. RPS4 induced the apoptosis of mature adipocytes by hypophosphorylating Akt, increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak, Bax, and Bad, and reducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and p-Bad.These finding suggest that RPS4 can reduce the numbers as well as the size of adipocytes and might useful for preventing and treating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443284>Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acid Variations by Breastfeeding Status in Infants at 4 Months: Differences in Relative versus Absolute Concentrations.</a></h2><p>Our gut microbiota provide a number of important functions, one of which is the metabolism of dietary fiber and other macronutrients that are undigested by the host. The main products of this fermentation process are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other intermediate metabolites including lactate and succinate. Production of these metabolites is dependent on diet and gut microbiota composition. There is increasing evidence for the role of SCFAs in host physiology and metabolic processes as well as chronic inflammatory conditions such as allergic disease and . We aimed to investigate differences in fecal SCFAs and intermediate metabolites in 163 infants at 3-5 months of age according to breastfeeding status. Compared to no exposure to human milk at time of fecal sample collection, exclusive breastfeeding was associated with lower absolute concentrations of total SCFAs, , butyrate, propionate, valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate, yet higher concentrations of lactate. Further, the relative proportion of  was higher with exclusive breastfeeding. Compared to non-breastfed infants, those exclusively breastfed were four times more likely (aOR 4.50, 95% CI 1.58-12.82) to have a higher proportion of  relative to other SCFAs in their gut. This association was independent of birth mode, intrapartum antibiotics, infant sex, age, recruitment site, and maternal BMI or socioeconomic status.

The serum activity and concentration of PON1 depends on several genetic polymorphisms as well as environmental factors.Investigated population consisted of 71 patients aged 43⁻76 years with confirmed coronary heart disease (CHD). Established risk factors of CHD such as hypertension, elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), diabetes mellitus, , smoking and premature CHD in family history were assessed. PON1 genotype for ⁻108C/T promotor region was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR⁻RFLP) method. Paraoxonase activity towards paraoxon and arylesterase activity towards phenyl  were measured spectrophotometrically.Significant correlations between diabetes mellitus and paraoxonase activity ( ⁻0.264,  0.026) and between the premature coronary heart disease in family history and PON1 activity ( ⁻0.293,  0.013) were found. In multivariate analysis, PON1 paraoxonase activity was independently of confounding factors associated with diabetes (OR = 0.985;  0.024) and premature CHD in family history (OR = 0.983;  0.027). PON1 activity towards aryl  positively correlated with HDL-C level ( 0.255,  0.032). In patients treated with statins, PON1 paraoxonase activity was significantly ( 0.033) higher than in patients without treatment.In diabetic patients with CHD, paraoxonase activity is lower than in normoglycemic patients despite similar lipid profiles. Diabetes and positive family history in patients with overt CHD are associated with the serum PON1 activity, which might be an additional factor helpful in evaluating cardiovascular risk in this group of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29379255>Current trends in small molecule discovery targeting key cellular signaling events towards the combined management of diabetes and .</a></h2><p>Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, also known as Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder leading to abnormalities in the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The major contributors in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) include resistance to insulin action, β cell dysfunction, an abnormality in glucose metabolism and storage, visceral  and to some extent inflammation and oxidative stress. Insulin resistance, along with a defect in insulin secretion by the pancreatic β cells is instrumental towards progression to hyperglycemia. Increased incidence of  is also a major contributing factor in the escalating rates of type 2 diabetes. Drug discovery efforts are therefore crucially dependent on identifying individual molecular targets and validating their relevance to human disease. The current review discusses bioactive compounds from medicinal plants offering enhanced therapeutic potential for the combined patho-physiology of diabetes and . We have demonstrated that 3β-taraxerol a pentacyclic triterpenoid (14-taraxeren-3-ol) isolated from the ethyl  extract of Mangifera indica, chlorogenic acid isolated from the methanol extract of Cichorium intybus, methyl tetracosanoate from the methanol extract of Costus pictus and vitalboside A derived from methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini exhibited significant effects on insulin stimulated glucose uptake causing insulin sensitizing effects on 3T3L1 adipocytes (an in vitro model mimicking adipocytes). Whereas, (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol isolated from Adathoda vasica and Aloe emodin isolated from Cassia fistula showed significant insulin mimetic effects favoring glucose uptake in L6 myotubes (an in vitro model mimicking skeletal muscle cells). These extracts and molecules showed glucose uptake through activation of PI3K, an important insulin signaling intermediate. Interestingly, cinnamic acid isolated from the hydro-alcohol extract of Cinnamomum cassia was found to activate glucose transport in L6 myotubes through the involvement of GLUT4 via the PI3K-independent pathway. However, the activation of glucose storage was effective in the presence of 3β-taraxerol and aloe emodin though inhibition of GSK3β activity. Therefore, the mechanism of improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism exhibited by the small molecules isolated from our lab is discussed. However,  is a major risk factor for type-2 diabetes leading to destruction of insulin receptors causing insulin resistance. Identification of compounds with dual activity (anti-diabetic and antiadipogenic activity) is of current interest. The protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an important negative regulator of the insulin and leptin-signaling pathway is of significance in target definition and discovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796038>Clomiphene citrate is associated with favorable cycle characteristics but impaired outcomes of obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of clomiphene citrate (CC) on the cycle characteristics and outcomes of obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF).This is a retrospective cohort study, and it was conducted at the tertiary-care academic medical center.This study included 174 obese PCOS patients undergoing IVF.In the study group (n = 90), CC and human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) were administered simultaneously beginning on cycle day 3, while in control group (n = 84) HMG was used only. Both of the 2 groups used medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) for preventing premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges. Ovulation was cotriggered by a GnRH agonist and hCG when dominant follicles matured.The primary outcome measure was the number of oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes included the number of top-quality embryos, maturation rate, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, incidence of premature LH surge, and OHSS.The study group received obviously lower total HMG dose [1650 (975-4800) vs 2025 (1350-3300) IU, P = 2.038E-4] but similar HMG duration. While the antral follicle count (AFC) is higher in study group, the number of oocytes retrieved and top-quality embryos are remarkably less [5 (0-30) vs 13 (0-42), P = 6.333E-5; 2 (0-14) vs 3.5 (0-15), P = .003; respectively].

The study included 453 patients with relapsing-remitting pediatric MS and body mass index (BMI) measurement taken within 6 months of diagnosis. Onset of the disease occurred between April 28, 1990, and June 26, 2016, and the mean disease duration was 38.4 months. Data were collected from July 14, 2016, to December 18, 2017.Data on BMIs were stratified by sex and age using German BMI references and compared with the BMI data of 14 747 controls from a nationwide child health survey for odds ratio (OR) estimates. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging findings, intervals between first and second MS attacks, annualized relapse rates before and during treatment with interferon beta-1a or -1b and glatiramer , frequency of second-line treatment, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were compared between nonoverweight (BMI≤90th percentile), overweight (BMI>90th-97th percentile), and obese (BMI>97th percentile) patients.In total, 453 patients with pediatric MS were included, of whom 306 (67.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 13.7 (2.7) years. At diagnosis, 126 patients (27.8%) were overweight or obese, with  associated with statistically significant twofold odds of MS in both sexes (girls OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.5-3.1; P < .001 vs boys OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.3-3.5; P = .003). Obese patients, compared with nonoverweight patients, had statistically significantly more relapses on first-line treatment with interferon beta and glatiramer  (ARR, 1.29 vs 0.72; P < .001) and a higher rate of second-line treatment (21 [56.8%] of 37 vs 48 [38.7%] of 124; P = .06).

(Asteraceae) has been valued for treating a variety of ailments such as gastro-intestinal, liver and pulmonary diseases, and has gained awareness for its beneficial effect on postprandial hyperglycemia. However, to best of our knowledge, no detailed study of the antidiabetic curative effects of this plant has been conducted yet.To determine the hypoglycemic and antidiabetic effect of dietary supplementation with Anvillea radiata extracts on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced  and insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice in relation with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pancreatic beta-cells and skeletal muscle protection, and digestive enzyme inhibiting properties.Six extracts (water soluble and organic) from aerial parts of the plant were analyzed phytochemically (total phenolic and flavonoid content) and screened for in vitro superoxide (by chemiluminescence) and hydroxyl radical (by electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping) scavenging, antioxidant (DPPH, TRAP and ORAC assays), xanthine oxidase, metal chelating, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory property, and protective effects on copper-induced lipoprotein oxidation. Then selected hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts were assessed for toxicity in normal human lung fibroblasts and A549 cancer cells using FMCA and MTT assays. Two water-soluble extracts having the best overall properties were assessed for their (i) protective effect at 1-15µg/mL on metabolic activity of rat insulinoma-derived INS-1 cells exposed to hyperglycemic medium, and (ii) acute hypoglycemic effect on 16-weeks HFD-induced diabetic mice. Then diabetic mice were administered HFD supplemented by extracts (up to 150mg/kg/day) for 12 additional weeks using standard diet as control and the antidiabetic drug, metformin (150mg/kg), as positive control. Then the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of extracts were determined.Of the highly efficient polyphenolics-enriched hydroalcoholic and ethyl  extracts, the lyophilized aqueous (AQL) and butanol extracts were not toxic in cells (≤ 400µg/mL) or when given orally in normal mice (≤ 2000mg/kg), exerted a dose-dependent hypoglycemic action in diabetic mice, which was maximal at the dose of 150mg/kg. Upon administering this dose for 12 weeks, both extracts significantly ameliorated body weight control capacity, recovery of plasma glucose and insulin level, reduced oxidative stress in blood, myocardial and skeletal muscles, and improved hyperlipidemic and inflammatory status. Moreover, diabetes-related complications were optimally ameliorated by oral therapy based on halved doses (75mg/kg) of a mixture of AQL and metformin.Current investigation supports the traditional medicinal usage of Anvillea radiata and suggests that both readily accessible and low-cost bio-extracts have the potency to develop an antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic and protective agent against beta-cells and muscle dysfunction at doses compatible with the common practices of indigenous people for the management of metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, this study evaluated the digestibility and metabolic effects of transitioning blue-fronted amazons from a high fat diet (sunflower seeds) to processed diets with three degrees of starch gelatinization (SG). The same feed formulation was processed to obtain pelletized feed (PEL) at 27.1% SG; low-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 81.6% SG; and high-cooked extruded feed (EXT ) at 98.5% SG. Thirty adult parrots were fed sunflower seeds for 90 days, then were distributed in a completely randomized design with 10 repetitions per treatment, and fed one of the three prepared diets for 160 days. Feed palatability, apparent digestibility, excreta concentrations of volatile fatty acids, lactate and ammonia, initial and final radiographic examinations, blood cell counts and glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and uric acid levels were evaluated. The data were analysed by an analysis of variance and compared by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). Sunflower seed was more digestible than processed feeds (p < 0.05). Diet processing interfered with fat and starch digestibility (p < 0.001), being higher in the PEL than in the EXT and EXT respectively. Transitioning from sunflower seeds to balanced diets reduced serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and AST (p < 0.05) and increased red blood cell, haemoglobin, lymphocyte, monocyte and leucocyte counts (p < 0.01). Radiographs indicated a decreased hourglass (p = 0.015) and a reduced heart-liver ratio after ingesting the processed feeds (p < 0.05). Feed processing did not affect blood cell counts, serum biochemistry or radiographic examinations. In conclusion, parrots preferred the extruded diet and did not require an extensive SG to properly digest the feed. Consuming the processed diets improved the birds' metabolism and health.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778046>Desalted Salicornia europaea extract attenuated vascular neointima formation by inhibiting the MAPK pathway-mediated migration and proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Salicornia europaea L. (SE) has been used as folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases such as , diabetes, and cancer. However, its effects on atherosclerotic events in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remain unknown. The present study explored the effects of the ethyl  fraction of desalted SE hot water extract (SEWEAF) on atherosclerotic responses (especially migration and proliferation) in VSMCs and vascular neointima formation. Treatment with the SEWEAF significantly suppressed the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced VSMC migration and proliferation as well the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as the p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Moreover, oral administration of the SEWEAF resulted in the attenuation of neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Additionally, HPLC analysis showed that the major components in the two subfractions of the SEWEAF were five phenolic acids and four flavonols. In the SEWEAF components, for which atherosclerosis-linked responses in VSMCs have not been known, p-coumaric acid, quercetin-3-β-d-glucoside, and isorhamnetin-3-β-d-glucoside inhibited both PDGF-BB-induced migration and proliferation and isorhamnetin attenuated only PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC proliferation. These results suggest that the SEWEAF may suppress PDGF-BB-induced VSMC migration by downregulating the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, thus leading to the reduction of neointimal hyperplasia during vascular remodeling. Therefore, the desalted SE extract, SEWEAF may be a potential ingredient for dietary supplements or nutraceuticals to ameliorate and/or prevent vascular remodeling-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is well-known for its thermogenic and cell metabolism modulating effects. Based on methylxanthines' chemical structure, 8-(3-phenylpropyl)-1,3,7-triethylxanthine (PTX) is a novel adenosine antagonist with higher receptor affinity than caffeine. Therefore, we hypothesized that PTX metabolic effects could be stronger than those of caffeine. For that purpose, murine 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in the presence of increasing doses of PTX or caffeine (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μM) for 24 h. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Cell metabolites released to the culture medium were identified and quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR). Cellular oxidative profile was also evaluated. Our results showed that PTX displayed no signs of cytotoxicity at all studied concentrations. When compared with caffeine, PTX increased glucose, pyruvate, and glutamine consumption, as well as lactate, alanine, and  production. Additionally, PTX decreased protein oxidation, thus protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage.

Regional fat distribution and functioning may contribute to -related metabolic disorders and adverse health outcomes. Specific fat depots are suggested to possess unique biological properties, but specific metabolic profiles of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain unknown. We aimed to characterize VAT and SAT glucose metabolism, and their correlation with body mass index (BMI). AT samples from patients (n = 12; F:M, 9:3) with a mean age of 46 years (26-83 years) and an average BMI of 29.6 kg/m (18-37 kg/m) were used. VAT and SAT explants were obtained during elective laparoscopy, either cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis or gastric bypass for severe . Explants were placed in insulin-free cell culture media and their metabolic profile was established by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. AT explants display a glucose and pyruvate consumption and  production that is region-dependent according to the patients BMI. In VAT, glucose consumption was positively correlated with BMI, while alanine and lactate production were negatively correlated with BMI, whereas in SAT the patients BMI did not affect AT secretome suggesting that increased BMI promotes a metabolic reprogramming of VAT towards de novo lipogenesis. This region-dependent metabolic reprogramming of AT associated with BMI was autonomous of insulin. This data, although preliminary, suggests that there is a BMI-related remodeling of glucose metabolism in VAT. Targeting this BMI-induced metabolic shift may represent a potential target to counteract unwanted consequences derived from visceral adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27937042>Prevention of hypertension-induced vascular dementia by Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products.</a></h2><p>Numerous etiological studies have established positive clinical association between hypertension and vascular dementia (VaD). Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products have been shown to decrease vascular risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and .This study investigated the effect of ethanol extract of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei NTU 101-fermented products (NTU101F) in hypertension-induced VaD in rats.Hypertension was promoted by subcutaneous injection of deoxycorticosterone  (DOCA, 25 mg/kg body weight/day, twice a week) and substitution of drinking water with 1.0% NaCl and 0.2% KCl. The NTU101F groups (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0) administered NTU101F at the concentrations 11, 22, and 110 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, starting from day 51 day of DOCA-salt treatment. Morris water maze (MWM) was used for testing learning and memory. Different biochemical estimations were used to assess oxidative stress and inflammatory response in hippocampus.Oral administration of NTU101F in DOCA-salt hypertension-induced VaD rats resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure by 18.3-23.2% (p < 0.001), which was regulated by increasing eNOS density (about 3-fold) in the aorta, promoting NO production, and decreasing of matrix metallopeptidase 9 activity (about 2-fold) in the hippocampus, in addition to improve the kidney function and structure, decrease escape latency and increase the times spent in the target quadrant by 23.5-27.8% (p < 0.05).Overall, our findings suggest that NTU101F could exert neuroprotection in the brain and attenuate hypertension-induced VaD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376571>Suboptimal community growth mediated through metabolite crossfeeding promotes species diversity in the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota represent a highly complex ecosystem comprised of approximately 1000 species that forms a mutualistic relationship with the human host. A critical attribute of the microbiota is high species diversity, which provides system robustness through overlapping and redundant metabolic capabilities. The gradual loss of bacterial diversity has been associated with a broad array of gut pathologies and diseases including malnutrition, , diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. We formulated an in silico community model of the gut microbiota by combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of 28 representative species to explore the relationship between species diversity and community growth. While the individual species offered a broad range of metabolic capabilities, communities optimized for maximal growth on simulated Western and high-fiber diets had low diversities and imbalances in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis characterized by  overproduction. Community flux variability analysis performed with the 28-species model and a reduced 20-species model suggested that enhanced species diversity and more balanced SCFA production were achievable at suboptimal growth rates. We developed a simple method for constraining species abundances to sample the growth-diversity tradeoff and used the 20-species model to show that tradeoff curves for Western and high-fiber diets resembled Pareto-optimal surfaces. Compared to maximal growth solutions, suboptimal growth solutions were characterized by higher species diversity, more balanced SCFA synthesis and lower exchange rates of crossfed metabolites between more species. We hypothesized that modulation of crossfeeding relationships through host-microbiota interactions could be an important means for maintaining species diversity and suggest that community metabolic modeling approaches that allow multiobjective optimization of growth and diversity are needed for more realistic simulation of complex communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679477>Beneficial effects of murtilla extract and madecassic acid on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in a model of diet-induced .</a></h2><p>Infusions of murtilla leaves exhibit antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Several compounds that are structurally similar to madecassic acid (MA), a component of murtilla leaf extract (ethyl  extract, EAE), have been shown to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1P). The aim of this study was to evaluate if EAE and two compounds identified in EAE (MA and myricetin [MYR]) could have a beneficial effect on systemic and vascular insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in a model of diet-induced . Experiments were performed in 5-week-old male C57BL6J mice fed with a standard (LF) or a very high-fat diet (HF) for 4 weeks and treated with EAE, MA, MYR, or the vehicle as control (C). EAE significantly inhibited PTP1B. EAE and MA, but not MYR, significantly improved systemic insulin sensitivity in HF mice and vascular relaxation to Ach in aorta segments, due to a significant increase of eNOS phosphorylation and enhanced nitric oxide availability. EAE, MA, and MYR also accounted for increased relaxant responses to insulin in HF mice, thus evidencing that the treatments significantly improved aortic insulin sensitivity.

Oral glucose tolerance tests are usually carried out with 50-75 g of glucose. The aim of this study was to examine whether minimal glucose loads of 10 g and 25 g induce a reliable secretion of satiation peptides without dumping symptoms after LRYGB. In addition, lean and obese controls were examined.The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low oral glucose loads on incretin release and gastric emptying.All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon (RP) at the St. Claraspital Basel in Switzerland. Oral glucose challenges were carried out at the University Hospital of Basel (Phase 1 Research Unit).Eight patients 10±.4 weeks after LRYGB (PostOP; body mass index [BMI]: 38.6 kg/m±1.7) as well as 12 lean controls (LC; BMI: 21.8 kg/m±.6) and 12 obese controls (OC; BMI 38.7 kg/m±1.3) received 10 g and 25 g of oral glucose. We examined clinical signs of dumping syndrome; plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and peptide tyrosine tyrosine concentrations; and gastric emptying with a  C-sodium  breath test.No signs of dumping were seen in PostOP. Compared with OC, LC showed lower fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide, and lower homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and AUC-180 for insulin and C-peptide. In PostOP, fasting insulin, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin was lower and no difference was found in fasting C-peptide or AUC-180 for C-peptide compared to OC. There was no significant difference in fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HOMA and AUC-180 for insulin in PostOP compared to LC, but AUC-180 for C-peptide was higher in PostOP. AUC-60 for gut hormones was similar in OC and LC and higher in PostOP compared to OC or LC. gastric emptying was slower in LC and OC compared with PostOP.After LRYGB, 25 g oral glucose is well tolerated and leads to reliable secretion of gut hormones. Fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide are normalized, while glucagon-like peptide 1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and peptide tyrosine tyrosine are overcorrected.

There has been an exponential surge in the use of animal models that can mimic different phenotypes of the human intestinal ecosystem. However, data on host species-specific signatures of gut microbiome and its metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., , propionate, and butyrate) and lactate in these models and their similarities/differences from humans remain limited, due to high variability in protocols and analyses. Here, we analyze the fecal microbiota composition and the fecal levels of SCFAs and lactate in three of the most-widely used animal models, i.e., mice, rats, and non-human primates (NHPs) and compare them with human subjects, using data generated on a single platform with same protocols. The data show several species-specific similarities and differences in the gut microbiota and fecal organic acids between these species groups. Based on β-diversity, the gut microbiota in humans seems to be closer to NHPs than to mice and rats; however, among rodents, mice microbiota appears to be closer to humans than rats. The phylum-level analyses demonstrate higher  ratio in humans and NHPs vs. mice and rats. Human microbiota is dominated by  followed by  and . Mouse gut is predominated by members of the family  followed by those from the order , whereas rats and NHPs have higher abundance of  compared with mice and humans. Also, fecal levels of lactate are higher in mice and rats vs. NHPs and humans, while  is highest in human feces. These data of host species-specific gut microbiota signatures in some of the most widely used animal models in context to the human microbiota might reflect disparities in host factors, e.g., diets, genetic origin, gender and age, and hence call for prospective studies investigating the features of gut microbiome in such animal models by controlling for these host elements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618997> Antioxidant, Hypoglycemic Activity, and Identification of Bioactive Compounds in Phenol-Rich Extract from the Marine Red Algae  (Gmelin) Silva.</a></h2><p> and diabetes are major metabolic disorders which are prevalent worldwide. Algae has played an important role in managing these disorders. In this study, , a marine red algae, was investigated for antioxidant and hypoglycemic potential using in vitro models. De-polysaccharide methanol extract of  was sequentially partitioned with hexane, chloroform, ethyl , and antioxidants, and hypoglycemic potentials were evaluated using multiple methods. High antioxidant potential was observed in the ethyl  fraction in terms of ferric reducing antioxidant power, iron chelating, and DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities, while the crude methanol extract exhibited potent oxygen radical-absorbance capacity. Potent α-amylase inhibitory activity was observed in the ethyl  fraction, while the ethyl  fraction was effective against α-glucosidase inhibition. Glucose diffusion was inhibited by the ethyl  fraction at 180 min, and the highest antiglycation activity was observed in both chloroform and ethyl  fractions. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the ethyl  fraction revealed the presence of several potent anti-diabetic compounds. In conclusion, G. edulis exhibited promising antidiabetic potential via multiple mechanisms. The ethyl  fraction exhibited the strongest hypoglycemic and antiglycation potential among the four fractions, and hence the isolation of active compounds is required to develop leads for new drugs to treat diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602978>Effect of Diane-35, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformin in Chinese polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of Diane-35, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformin, on androgen and body fat percentage parameters in Chinese overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin resistance.A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to receive Diane-35 alone (D group), Diane-35 plus orlistat (DO group), Diane-35 plus metformin (DM group), or Diane-35 plus orlistat plus metformin (DOM group). Serum TT, DHEA-S, androstenedione, SHBG, FT, FAI, body fat, and body fat percentage were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment.Significant changes in serum TT, SHBG, and FAI were observed in all treatment groups compared with baseline. DHEA-S and androstenedione significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups after treatment. FT only significantly decreased in the DOM group. Body fat and body fat percentage significantly decreased in the DO and DOM groups. Compared with the D group, DHEA-S significantly decreased in the DO, DM, and DOM groups (F = 4.081, p = 0.008); SHBG significantly increased in the DOM group (F = 3.019, p = 0.031); and FAI significantly decreased in the DO group (χ = 12.578, p = 0.006). There were significant differences between groups in body fat percentage (χ = 23.590, p < 0.001). Side-effects were less with orlistat than metformin.Diane-35 in combination with orlistat or metformin is more effective in reducing androgen than Diane-35 alone.

Dietary fibers, i.e. prebiotics, are fermented by human gut microbiota into the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) , propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U-C-inulin (INU) or B) 24 g maltodextrin placebo (PLA), with a wash-out period of at least five days. Fat oxidation was measured via an open-circuit ventilated hood and blood samples were collected up to 7 h after ingestion. Plasma, breath, and fecal samples were collected, and appetite and satiety scores were assessed.Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P < 0.05). Plasma free fatty acids were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma  concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma C-SCFA enrichments (P < 0.05 from t = 120 onwards) and breath CO enrichments after INU intake. There were no effects on plasma triglycerides, free glycerol, satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and appetite and satiety scores.Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men.

All the extracts were tested for antilipase activity using porcine pancreatic lipase. Because H-Ei showed the highest inhibition, it was further subjected to chemical profiling using high-performance liquid chromatography. Subsequently, oral toxicity analysis of H-Ei was performed [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines using fixed dose procedure (No. 420)]; efficacy analysis was performed using high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic female Sprague-Dawley rats.According to the toxicity and efficacy analyses, H-Ei did not demonstrate any noticeable biochemical toxicity or physiologic abnormalities and did not cause any tissue damage as per histologic analysis. Furthermore, H-Ei significantly reduced body weight and improved serum profile and did not show hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity based on the serum profile. Moreover, H-Ei alleviated HFD-induced hepatosteatosis and ameliorated induced adiposity in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.Our results demonstrate that H-Ei effectively improved hyperlipidemia. Further studies to explore its possibility as an alternative pharmacologic agent to treat  are warranted.Hexane extract of  (H-Ei) showed strong potential in the inhibition of porcine pancreatic lipase (27.01 ± 5.68%).The acute oral toxicity of  hexane extract on animal model falls into Globally Harmonized System Category 5 (low hazard), since mortality, clinical toxicity symptoms, gross pathologic, or histopathologic damage was not observed.The hexane extract of  had significantly reduced the body weight and improved serum lipid profile, with reduction in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and elevation in high-density lipoprotein when comparing against the high-fat diet control group.Microscopic evaluation on histologic slides of liver and adipose tissues suggested that  hexane extract had greatly improved liver steatosis and adipose tissue hypertrophy in high-fat diet control group.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the protective effects of  leaf extract on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  and . In this study, the effects of  leaf extract on inhibiting the free fatty acid (FFA)-induced accumulation of fat in HepG2 cells and on improving fatty liver syndrome in mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD were investigated. For the  assay, HepG2 cells were treated with FFAs (oleate/palmitate = 2:1) with or without treatment with  leaf ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction to observe lipid accumulation using Nile red and oil red O stains. For the  assay, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three groups ( = 5), including the normal diet group, the HFD group and the HFD+EtOAc group. After 11 weeks, body weight, serum biochemical indices and the mRNA expressions of the liver tissue, as well as the outward appearance, weight and histopathological analysis of liver and adipose tissues were evaluated. Among the fractions derived from  leaf, the EtOAc fraction exhibited a strong fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Following reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), four specific phytochemicals, including (2, 3)-astilbin (AS), hyposide (HY), guaijaverin (GU) and quercitrin (QU), were isolated and identified from the EtOAc fraction of  leaf extract. Among them, AS and HY showed excellent fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Thus, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf and its derived phytochemicals have great potential in preventing FFA-induced fat accumulation. In addition, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf significantly improved fatty liver syndrome and reduced total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in HFD-induced NAFLD mice at a dosage of 200 mg/kg BW.

In this study, 340 monomeric compounds were identified from TT extracts obtained with ethyl  combined with 50% methanol. In vitro, IC of TT was 912.01 mg/L, and the appropriate concentration of TT against oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) was 4 mg/L. TT significantly increased the viability (63.2%) and migration (2.33-fold increase) of HRGECs. ORG model rats were induced by a chronic high-fat diet (45%) for 20 weeks and were then treated with TT extract (2.8 g/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, the kidneys were removed and their differentially expressed protein profile was identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-TOF MS. Molecular categorization and functional analysis of bioinformatic annotation suggested that excessive energy metabolism, decreased response to stress and low immunity were the potential etiologies of ORG. After TT administration for 8 weeks, body weight, blood pressure, serum cystatin C and cholesterol were decreased. Additionally, TT significantly enhanced the resistance of rats to ORG, decreased energy consumption and the hemorrhagic tendency, and improved the response to acute phase reactants and immunity.

The maximum achieved serum concentration of levonorgestrel (LNG) is lower in obese women than women of normal BMI, and doubling the dose of LNG (3 mg) increases its concentration maximum, approximating the level in normal BMI women receiving one dose of LNG. Repeated use of both LNG and ulipristal  (UPA) is well tolerated. Hormonal contraception can be immediately started following LNG use, but should be delayed for 5 days after UPA use to avoid dampening the efficacy of UPA.

Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular,  beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and  production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA  and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral  administration (vinegar intake), colonic  infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat  and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate 's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564549>PRDM16 Maintains Homeostasis of the Intestinal Epithelium by Controlling Region-Specific Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic pathways dynamically regulate tissue development and maintenance. However, the mechanisms that govern the metabolic adaptation of stem or progenitor cells to their local niche are poorly understood. Here, we define the transcription factor PRDM16 as a region-specific regulator of intestinal metabolism and epithelial renewal. PRDM16 is selectively expressed in the upper intestine, with enrichment in crypt-resident progenitor cells. Acute Prdm16 deletion in mice triggered progenitor apoptosis, leading to diminished epithelial differentiation and severe intestinal atrophy. Genomic and metabolic analyses showed that PRDM16 transcriptionally controls fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in crypts. Expression of this PRDM16-driven FAO program was highest in the upper small intestine and declined distally. Accordingly, deletion of Prdm16 or inhibition of FAO selectively impaired the development and maintenance of upper intestinal enteroids, and these effects were rescued by  treatment. Collectively, these data reveal that regionally specified metabolic programs regulate intestinal maintenance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed the changes in the intestinal microbiota of obese patients after bariatric surgery with the aim of disclosing the rearrangement of the biofilm configuration. Although the bariatric surgery drives major rearrangements of the gut microbiota, obese patients maintain the  enterotype before and after surgery, as shown by normal weight patients, with an increase of  and . The  enterotype guarantees the strong ability to form a biofilm which allows a more efficient digestion of polysaccharides than planktonic communities and leads to the production of  which is a key player to inhibit enteropathogens. Additionally, the laparoscopic gastric bypass induces an increase of , a facultative anaerobic bacterium involved in intestinal and inflammatory disorders. Bariatric surgery influences the microbial composition of gut biofilm. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of this variation on recovery after surgery and on weight loss.</p></html>
