The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of an -derived compound (S1) and a combination of n-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA, S2) to modulate both body weight and the GM in HFD-induced obese mice. A total of eighty mice were fed either a control diet or a HFD, non-supplemented or supplemented with S1 or S2. At week 19, faeces were collected in order to analyse the GM. Group-specific primers for accurate quantification of several major bacterial groups from faecal samples were assayed using quantitative PCR. The HFD induced an increase in body weight, which was reduced by supplementation with S1. Furthermore, S1 supplementation markedly increased total bacterial density and restored the proportions of bacteria that were increased (i.e. clostridial cluster XIVa and Enterobacteriales) or decreased (i.e. Bifidobacterium spp.) during HFD feeding. S2 supplementation significantly increased the quantities of Firmicutes (especially the Lactobacillus group). Correlation analysis revealed that body weight correlated positively with the phylum Firmicutes and clostridial cluster XIVa, and negatively with the phylum Bacteroidetes. In conclusion, the consumption of a HFD induced changes in the faecal , which were associated with the appearance of an obese phenotype. Supplementation of the HFD with S1 counteracted HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, together with an improvement in body weight. These data support a role for certain fatty acids as interesting nutrients related to obesity prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483636>Gut  and Metabolome Response of  Seed Oil on Metabolism Disorder Induced by Excess Alcohol Consumption.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the modulatory effects of  seed oil (DISO), which was rich in palmitoleic  (55.25%), palmitic  (12.25%), and  (28.74%), on alcohol-induced metabolism disorder in mice. Fifty mice were orally administered with 38% alcohol (0.4 mL/day) and without or with DISO (3, 6, and 12 g/kg) for consecutive 12 weeks. DISO inhibited the alcohol-induced weight loss and liver function abnormality ( < 0.01) and shifted the profiles of cecal microbiome: elevating the abundance of , __004 ( < 0.05) and decreasing abundance of  ( < 0.05). This treatment also regulated metabolome response of amino  and lipid metabolism in cecal content: upregulating 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic  ( < 0.05), 6-hydroxynicotinic , 5-methoxytryptamine, nicotinamide, and nicotinic  ( < 0.1) and downregulating androsterone, tryptophan, and indole-3-acetamide ( < 0.05). DISO protected against alcoholic liver injury and gut  dysbiosis by enriching the relative abundance of , which was positively associated with the improvement of intestinal permeability and tryptophan metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut Barrier Function, Attenuating Inflammation and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h1><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut  and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , , linoleic , squalene, and arachidonic , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut  and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240835>Correlation of diet,  and metabolite networks in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p> dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been widely reported. The gut  connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut  composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut  were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and ) and medium-chain fatty acids (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites. Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in patients with IBD and associated with multi-nutrients, and 21 metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and taurolithocholic .This study provides an interaction network to identify key micronutrients,  components and metabolites that contribute to IBD.Â© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p></html>
