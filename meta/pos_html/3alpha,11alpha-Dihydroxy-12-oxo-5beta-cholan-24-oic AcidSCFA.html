<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29024862>4-phenylbutyrate and valproate treatment attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis and stabilizes existing plaques.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling through glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β is involved in the activation of pro-atherosclerotic processes. In this study, we examined the effects of small molecules that interfere with ER stress-GSK3α/β signaling on the progression and regression of atherosclerosis in a mouse model.To examine atherosclerotic progression, low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Ldlr) mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD) and treated with the chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA, 3.8  g/L drinking water), or the GSK3α/β inhibitor, valproate (VPA, 625 mg VPA/kg diet), for 10 weeks. To examine potential effects on atherosclerotic regression, 4 week old Ldlr mice were placed on a HFD for 16 weeks. Subsets of mice were harvested at this time or switched to a chow (low fat) diet, or a chow diet with 4PBA or VPA treatment for 4 weeks.In the progression model, the 4PBA- and VPA-treated mice had significantly reduced lesion and necrotic core size. Treatments had no effect on metabolic parameters, including plasma and hepatic lipid levels, or plaque composition. In the regression model, mice with 4PBA or VPA treatment showed no alterations in lesion size, but the lesions had significantly smaller necrotic cores, increased vascular smooth muscle cell content, and increased collagen content. These features are consistent with more stable plaques.The pharmacological attenuation of ER stress or inhibition of GSK3α/β impedes the development of atherosclerosis in Ldlr mice and appears to promote the stabilization of existing lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Mood stabilizers lithium and valproic , used for treating bipolar disorder, cause cellular inositol depletion, which has been proposed as a therapeutic mechanism of action of both drugs. Despite the importance of inositol, the requirement for inositol synthesis in neuronal cells is not well understood. Here, we examined inositol effects on proliferation of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. The essential role of inositol synthesis in proliferation is underscored by the findings that exogenous inositol was dispensable for proliferation, and inhibition of inositol synthesis decreased proliferation. Interestingly, the inhibition of inositol synthesis by knocking down INO1, which encodes inositol-3-phosphate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis, led to the inactivation of GSK-3α by increasing the inhibitory phosphorylation of this kinase. Similarly, the mood stabilizer valproic  effected transient decreases in intracellular inositol, leading to inactivation of GSK-3α. As GSK-3 inhibition has been proposed as a likely therapeutic mechanism of action, the finding that inhibition of inositol synthesis results in the inactivation of GSK-3α suggests a unifying hypothesis for mechanism of mood-stabilizing drugs. Inositol is an essential metabolite that serves as a precursor for inositol lipids and inositol phosphates. We report that inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of inositol synthesis leads to the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3α by increasing inhibitory phosphorylation of this kinase. These findings have implications for the therapeutic mechanisms of mood stabilizers and suggest that inositol synthesis and GSK 3α activity are intrinsically related.© 2014 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189891>Stress-induced changes of neurosteroid profiles in rat brain and plasma under immobilized condition.</a></h1><p>In this study, various neurosteroids in brain and plasma were simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and their profile changes in a stress-induced rats were investigated. The investigated neurosteroids are as follows: progesterone (P4), 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP), 5β-dihydroprogesterone, estrone, androstenedione (AE), cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone (CORT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone (3α,5β-THP), allopregnanolone (ALLO), 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), 11-deoxycortisol, pregnenolone (PREG), and 5α/5β-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (5α/5β-THDOC). Brain and plasma samples were processed using solid-phase extraction with methanol and acetic  (99:1), and derivatized with a hydroxylamine reagent. Separation was achieved within 13min at a flow rate of 0.4mL/min with a C18 column (3.0×50mm, 2.7μm). The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Using this method, the neurosteroid level variation was quantitated and investigated in the brain and plasma upon immobilization stress in rats. As a result, AE, CORT, DOC, P4, 5α-DHP, 5α/5β-THDOC, DHEA, 3α,5β-THP, ALLO, and PREG levels were significantly altered in both the brain and plasma samples when stress was induced. These findings demonstrated that stress leads to the alteration of the GABAergic neurosteroid profile. The present results will be helpful for furthering an understanding of the role of neurosteroids in stressed conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Valproic  (VPA) is a widely prescribed drug for seizures and bipolar disorder in clinic. Previously, a number of researches have been shown that VPA has differential effects on growth, proliferation and differentiation in many types of cells. However, whether VPA can induce NSCs from embryonic cerebral cortex differentiate into neurons and its possible molecular mechanism is also not clear. Wnt signaling is implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation during CNS development in animal model, but its action at the cellular level has been poorly understood. In this experiment, we examined neuronal differentiation of NSCs induced by VPA culture media using vitro immunochemistry assay. The neuronal differentiation of NSCs was examined after treated with 0.75 mM VPA for three, seven and ten days. RT-PCR assay was employed to examine the level of Wnt-3α and β-catenin. The results indicated that there were more β-tublin III positive cells in NSCs treated with VPA medium compared to the control group. The expression of Wnt-3α and β-catenin in NSCs treated with VPA medium was significantly greater compared to that of control media. In conclusion, these findings indicated that VPA could induce neuronal differentiation of NSCs by activating Wnt signal pathway.</p></html>
