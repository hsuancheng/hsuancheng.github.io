Hence, there is a need to strictly examine the biosafety as well as health benefits of  in vivo model system.In this study, two lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures Lactobacillus fermentum NCMR 2826 and FIX proven for their in vitro probiotic properties were investigated for their in vivo safety in Wistar rats. Acute toxicity study (14 days) with high dose of biomass (10  CFU/mL), followed by sub-chronic test for 13 weeks with oral feeding of the probiotic cultures in three different doses viz; 10, 10 and 10  CFU/mL on daily basis revealed the safety of the L. fermentum cultures. The probiotic feeding had no toxic effects on the survival, body weight, food consumption, with either of the dosage used throughout the treatment period. No statistically significant changes in relative organ weight, serum biochemical and hematological indices were found among the control and the probiotic fed animals. In addition to the safety attributes, the two L. fermentum cultures fed rats showed reduced serum cholesterol levels, macrovesicular steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning compared to control animals. Further, quantification of intestinal microbiota using real-time PCR analysis from animal feces indicated a significant increase and stability of Lactobacillus and bifidobacterial counts but a decrease of E. coli numbers.This study of safety and beneficial features highlight the use of the two native L. fermentum isolates as potential probiotic food supplements.

Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

In microorganisms, EVs carry several types of molecules: proteins, glycoproteins, mRNAs, and small RNA species, as mammalian EVs do, but also carbohydrates. Studying EVs opens a whole new world of possibilities to better understand the interplay between host and bacteria crosstalks, although there are still many questions to be answered in the field, especially when it comes to microbiota-derived EVs. In this review, we propose to summarize and analyze the current literature about bacterial EVs and possible clinical applications, through answering three main questions: (i) What are bacterial EVs ; (ii) What are EVs impacts on skin inflammatory diseases physiopathology ; (iii) What are the possible and expected clinical applications of EVs to treat inflammatory skin diseases.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In a systematic review of meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we considered nutritional interventions aimed at reducing the rates of infections, NEC, or mortality in very preterm infants. The overall effects of particular interventions were presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. In RCTs, pasteurized human donor milk, as opposed to formula, reduced NEC but not infections or mortality. No differences emerged between infants receiving human or bovine milk-based fortifiers. Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections, NEC, or mortality. Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality. Enteral L-glutamine (six RCTs) lowered infection rates, and enteral L-arginine (three RCTs) reduced NEC. A meta-analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain (but not single-strain)  to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality. Thus, selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined  (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602730>Antimicrobial activity of SYNBIO probiotic formulation in pathogens isolated from chronic ulcerative lesions: in vitro studies.</a></h2><p> have the ability to enhance the immune system, produce anti-inflammatory action and promote wound healing process. The first aim of the study was to isolate pathogenic micro-organisms from sites of chronic ulcerative lesion. The second aim was to evaluate probiotic efficacy of SYNBIO (1:1 combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus IMC 501 and Lactobacillus paracasei IMC 502 ) in counteracting wound infections.Several bacterial pathogens were isolated from chronic ulcerative lesions and identified by morphological, biochemical and molecular techniques. SYNBIO probiotic formulation was investigated for its antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration, co-aggregation and adherence capacity against the isolated pathogens. Moreover, SYNBIO was also tested in combination with some medical devices, using an in vitro model, in order to simulate a real ulcerative wound infection. Probiotic formulation demonstrated an inhibitory action against all the tested pathogens and their mixture (MIX), with an increased ability of co-aggregation during time. In addition, the adhesion percentage of probiotic micro-organisms to human keratinocyte (HaCaT cells) and human fibroblasts (NHF), calculated by an in vitro model, was 19% and 17% respectively, highlighting the possibility to create a protective environment preventing pathogens' biofilm formation in order to contrast infections.SYNBIO  showed a very good antimicrobial capacity and adhesion percentage to HaCaT cells and fibroblasts, giving the opportunity to be successfully used as complement to conventional therapies in the treatment of chronic ulcerative lesions.A new therapeutic approach with  (supplemented in topical applications, excluding side effects) able to eliminate pathogenic micro-organisms and improve healing of chronic ulcerative lesions.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.

Over the last years, several studies have been conducted toward the assessment of the host-gut microbiota interaction, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of several diseases. A defect on the microbiota-host crosstalk and the concomitant dysregulation of immune responses combined with genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). To this end, novel therapeutic options based on the gut microbiota modulation have been an area of extensive research interest. In this review we present the recent findings on the association of dysbiosis with IBD pathogenesis, we focus on the role of gut microbiota on the treatment of IBD and discuss the novel and currently available therapeutic strategies in manipulating the composition and function of gut microbiota in IBD patients. Applicable and emerging microbiota treatment modalities, such as the use of antibiotics, prebiotics, , postbiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) constitute promising therapeutic options. However, the therapeutic potential of the aforementioned approaches is a topic of investigation and further studies are needed to elucidate their position in the present treatment algorithms of IBD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Gliclazide is a drug characterized by large inter-individual differences in therapeutic response; however, the causes of these differences are not fully explained and may be the outcome of microbial biotransformation. Recently, great attention has been paid to studies on bile acid (BA) interactions with gut microflora and the role of BAs in the modification of drug transport through biological membranes.  Considering the assumption of gliclazide-probiotic-BAs interactions, the aim of the study was to investigate the transport and biotransformation of gliclazide in probiotic bacteria, as well as the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on gliclazide transport into bacterial cells.   were incubated with gliclazide with or without DCA for 24 h at 37°C. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were determined at seven time points by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gliclazide biotransformation by the enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria was examined using appropriate software packages.  During the 24 h incubation with probiotic bacteria, significantly lower extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were observed at all time points compared to controls, while in the group with DCA, the decrease in concentration was noticed only at 24 h. The total concentration of gliclazide throughout the whole period was significantly lower compared to control. Proposed pathways of gliclazide biotransformation by probiotic bacteria involve reactions of hydrolysis and hydroxylation.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there are interactions of gliclazide--DCA, at both the level of active and passive transport into the cells, and at the level of drug biotransformation by enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria. The effect of these interactions on the final therapeutic response of gliclazide should be further studied and confirmed in  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Ðanić, Stanimirov, Pavlović, Vukmirović, Lazić, Al-Salami and Mikov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587409>Transplant associated infections-The role of the gastrointestinal microbiota and potential therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>Infectious complications are common following kidney transplantation and rank in the top five causes of death in patients with allograft function.

The results showed that sanguinarine had a lethal effect on muscle larvae, adults and new-borne larvae in vitro. The damage to adults treated with sanguinarine was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Sanguinarine could significantly reduce the burden of worms in mice during the pre-adult, migrating larva and encysted larva stages. The ratio of intestinal villus to crypt (V/C) in mice treated with sanguinarine was significantly higher than that in non-treated control mice. Compared with the non-treated control group, the sanguinarine-treated group exhibited a significantly increased number of small intestine goblet cells. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the serum of mice treated with sanguinarine was significantly higher than that of the control group mice in the pre-adult and encysted larva stages.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two  can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613203> strains of dairy-product origin adhere to mucin and survive digestive juices.</a></h2><p> There is an ever present need to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial strains with potential probiotic health benefits for humans.  of dairy origin was focused because of its propensity to adhere to the intestinal glycoprotein, mucin.

Supplementation of certain microbial strains has been demonstrated to alleviate depressive behaviors and neurological abnormalities. This study took the approach to screen for an anti-depressive Bifidobacterium longum strain from fourteen candidates and systematically verified its effect in a chronic stress-induced depression mice model. B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 could significantly enhance the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) in vitro in RIN14B cells through up-regulation of the Tph1 gene expression. Administration of CCFM687 in mice significantly improved the scores in behavioral tests and increased the level of 5-HTP and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC was also increased, possibly through the 5-HT1A-CREB-BDNF pathway. In addition, CCFM687 alleviated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and accordingly reversed the peripheral inflammation status. Moreover, the stress-induced structural and functional dysbiosis of the gut microbiome was improved by CCFM687, through increased alpha diversity and abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, in conjunction with inhibition of pathogenic gene expression. In summary, these results indicate that supplementation of B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 may prevent the onset of depression from chronic stress, and RIN14B could serve as an efficient cell model for rapid screening of anti-depressive .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623075>Gut Microbiome Modulation Based on Probiotic Application for Anti-Obesity: A Review on Efficacy and Validation.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of obesity has become an important problem worldwide as obesity has several health risks. Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut microbiota on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty acids, and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between microbiota and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut microbiota interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with .

Four diets were prepared including control diet and three diets supplemented with LF (10 CFU/g), FA (100 mg kg) or LF + FA (10 CFU/g + 100 mg kg). After 8 weeks, fish fed LF or/and FA had significantly higher final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate when compared to control group (P < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio of fish fed LF or/and FA were noticeably lower than control (P < 0.05). No alterations were observed in case of haematological parameters except red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (HCT) which were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in fish fed FA or those fed both LF and FA. Also, the WBCs of fish treated with LF or/and FA were noticeably higher than control (P < 0.05). Feeding on LF and FA notably increased the serum total protein and albumin levels (P < 0.05). The serum respiratory burst and lysozyme activity were also enhanced (P < 0.05) in fish fed both LF or/and FA. In addition, evaluation of the serum antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in fish fed FA or both LF and FA as compared to the control. Fish fed LF and FA supplemented diet had highest survival rate after experimental challenge with pathogenic A. hydrophila. The obtained results revealed that LF and/or FA can be used as beneficial feed additive to improve the immune responses and disease resistance in early stages of common carp culture.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For many years, the lung was considered a sterile environment, and only recently, with the use of more sophisticated techniques, has it been demonstrated that colonization by a complex population of microorganisms in lower airways also occurs in healthy subjects; a predominance of some species of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla and with a peculiar composition in some disease conditions, such as asthma, have been noted. Lung microbiota derives mainly from the higher airways microbiota. Although we have some information about the role of gut microbiota in modulation of immune system, less it is known about the connection between lung microbiota and local and systemic immunity. There is a correlation between altered microbiota composition and some diseases or chronic states; however, despite this correlation, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether the lung microbiota dysbiosis could be a consequence or a cause of these diseases. We are far from a scientific approach to the therapeutic use of  in airway diseases, but we are only at the starting point of a knowledge process in this fascinating field that could reveal important surprises, and randomized prospective studies in future could reveal more about the clinical possibilities for controlling lung microbiota.

The uses and benefits of Lactobacilli as , particularly the regulation of immune system, are dependent on the strain used and a comprehensive understanding of their effects on the host. Several factors have been identified in Lactobacilli that influence the immune response, such as exopolysaccharides and proteins. The current study was designed to investigate the serum immunoreactivity of healthy women against common vaginal Lactobacilli immunoreactive proteins. Three common vaginal Lactobacillus strains (L. crispatus L1, L. gasseri L9, and L. fermentum L2) were compared for immune response. The ELISA results showed that the levels of total immunoglobulin (Ig-total) antibody for L. crispatus L1, L. fermentum L2, and L. gasseri L9 were 47%, 45% and 29%, respectively. Regarding the lower prevalence of L. fermentum L2 in comparison with the other two strains, the approximately equal levels of Ig-total compared to L. crispatus L1 and more than L. gasseri L9 indicate that L. fermentum L2 has the greater antigenicity ability. Accordingly, the immunoreactive proteins of L. fermentum L2 were identified using MALDI-TOF-MS detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. These proteins included 30s ribosomal protein S4 and 50s ribosomal protein L5. Antigenic epitopes on the 3D structure of these proteins was also predicted using bioinformatics analysis. The presence of antibody in serum of healthy pre-menopausal women indicates that Lactobacilli (normal flora) proteins can stimulate host immune response. Purification and further studies of the proteins may allow their potential use as an adjuvant to improve the efficacy of vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613980>[The Role of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder].</a></h2><p>Human microbiota are colonies of microorganisms located in different parts of the human body with diverse functions. Healthy gut microbiota comprises differing ratios of microoganisms wholly contributing to metabolic and other molecular reactions in a healthy, functioning body. After the demonstration of the bidirectional interaction between the central nervous system and gut microbiota through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous mechanisms, investigations have been started on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in psychiatric disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder of early childhood, is one of these disorders. Most of such studies were cross-sectional and mainly investigated the bacterial species. Changes in gut microbiota composition and the leaky gut syndrome are some of the hypotheses proposed to explain the core symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of ASD. , prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet have been proposed as treatment options. However, the role of microbiota in diagnosis, followup, and treatment is not yet clear. The bidirectional interaction between central nervous system and intestinal microbiota makes it difficult to establish the cause-effect relationship. The current data on microbiota may be useful to plan patient-specific treatment in autistic children with GI symptoms. This article aims to review the results of the studies on microbiota in animal models and children and discuss the emerging clinical relationship of ASD and gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590358>The Gut Microbiota in Celiac Disease and .</a></h2><p>Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy, and unique in that the specific trigger is known: gluten.

Importation of MRE by travellers and subsequent spread to family members, communities, and healthcare facilities poses real risks that have not yet been adequately assessed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify the risk factors and interventions for reducing the risk of MRE acquisition among international travellers. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for analytical epidemiological studies containing data post-2000 that assessed the risk factors to acquire and/or interventions to reduce the risk of MRE acquisition in travellers. Two researchers independently screened all the studies and extracted the information, and disagreements were resolved through consensus. The proportions of MRE acquisition by the region of destination and the odds ratio (OR) for the different risk factors and/or interventions were pooled using the inverse variance heterogeneity model. Twenty studies (5253 travellers from high-income countries) were included in the meta-analysis. South Asia (58.7%, 95%CI,44.5-72.5%) and Northern Africa (43.9%, 95%CI,37.6-50.3%) were the travel destinations with the highest proportion of MRE acquisition. Inflammatory bowel disease (OR 2.1; 95%CI:1.2-3.8), use of antibiotics (OR 2.4; 95%CI:1.9-3.0), traveller's diarrhoea (OR 1.7; 95%CI:1.3-2.3), and contact with the healthcare system overseas (OR 1.5; 95%CI:1.1-2.2) were associated with MRE colonisation. Vegetarians (OR 1.4; 95%CI:1.0-2.0) and backpackers (OR 1.5; 95%CI:1.2-1.8) were also at increased odds of MRE colonisation. Few studies (n = 6) investigated preventive measures and found that consuming only bottled water/beverages, meticulous hand hygiene, and  had no protective effect on MRE colonisation. International travel is an important driver for MRE spread worldwide. Future research needs to identify effective interventions to reduce the risk of MRE acquisition as well as design strategies to reduce local transmission on return.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of probiotic supplement on one or more of the following in GDM were included: pregnancy outcome (the primary outcome), glycemic control, blood lipid profile, and inflammation and oxidative stress.

Though the components of  varied, Lactobacillus was included in all trials and Bifidobacterium in all except one. The duration of intervention ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. Almost all trials (10/11) had a low risk of bias. Probiotic supplementation reduced the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia by 74% and improved four biomarkers for glycemic control (fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index), two biomarkers for lipid profile (triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol), and four biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress (total glutathione, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and total antioxidant capacity). But significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on the four biomarkers related to glycemic control and on triglycerides, which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses according to the mean age of participants and intervention type (i.e.,  or synbiotics). The effects on the risk of preterm delivery, macrosomia and a newborns' hypoglycemia, gestational age, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol were not statistically significant.Probiotic supplementation seemed to be able to reduce the risk of a newborn's hyperbilirubinemia and improve glycemic control, blood lipid profiles and inflammation and oxidative stress in pregnant women with GDM.

To better understand how sick an athlete will become when they have an infection, a paradigm recently adopted from ecological immunology is presented that includes the concepts of immune resistance (the ability to destroy microbes) and immune tolerance (the ability to dampen defence yet control infection at a non-damaging level). This affords a new theoretical perspective on how nutrition may influence athlete immune health; paving the way for focused research efforts on tolerogenic nutritional supplements to reduce the infection burden in athletes. Looking through this new lens clarifies why nutritional supplements targeted at improving immune resistance in athletes show limited benefits: evidence supporting the old paradigm of immune suppression in athletes is lacking. Indeed, there is limited evidence that the dietary practices of athletes suppress immunity, e.g. low-energy availability and train- or sleep-low carbohydrate. It goes without saying, irrespective of the dietary preference (omnivorous, vegetarian), that athletes are recommended to follow a balanced diet to avoid a frank deficiency of a nutrient required for proper immune function. The new theoretical perspective provided sharpens the focus on tolerogenic nutritional supplements shown to reduce the infection burden in athletes, e.g. , vitamin C and vitamin D. Further research should demonstrate the benefits of candidate tolerogenic supplements to reduce infection in athletes; without blunting training adaptations and without side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606483>Environmental factors associated with allergy in urban and rural children from the South AFrican Food Allergy (SAFFA) cohort.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of allergic diseases differs in urban and rural populations.To assess associations between environmental and dietary factors with allergic diseases in urban and rural South African children.Toddlers aged 12-36 months were assessed for food- and aero-allergen sensitisation, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and challenge-proven food allergy. Information was collected on family history of allergic diseases, household size, socioeconomic status, delivery mode, antibiotic and probiotic use, exposure to fermented and unpasteurised milk, antihelminth treatment, sunlight exposure, pet and farm animal exposure, cigarette smoke and household cooking and heating fuels. Antenatal exposures to pets, livestock and cigarette smoke was assessed. A subsection completed questions on consumption of fruit/vegetables, fast foods, soft drinks/fruit juices and fried/microwaved meat.Risk and protective factors differed between urban and rural settings. Exposure to farm animals in infants and their mothers during pregnancy was protective against allergic outcomes in the rural population. Consumption of unpasteurised milk is uncommon in this group of rural children and is unlikely to be an important factor in rural protection. In urban children birth by caesarean section is associated with food allergy and consumption of fermented milk products is associated with reduced asthma and atopic dermatitis. In both cohorts antenatal maternal smoking and environmental smoking exposure were predominantly associated with asthma and consumption of fast foods and fried meat were associated with allergy.In this rural environment exposure to livestock is the strongest protective factor. In urban communities, where animal contact is rare, risk factors include caesarian section and protective factors include consumption of fermented milk products. Modifiable risk factors urgently require interventions to prevent increasing allergies in countries undergoing rapid urbanization.Copyright © 2019.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety associated with probiotic treatment for BV.We searched multiple databases covering up to 1 March 2018. Studies published as blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing treatment using probiotic versus active or placebo control in BV patients were included, with at least one-month follow-up. Random effects model and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were applied.Ten studies ( = 2321) were included. Compared with placebo, the -only therapy resulted in a beneficial outcome both in clinical cure rate at the 30th day (risk ratio, RR = 2.57; 95% confidential interval, 95% CI: 1.96 to 3.37), and Nugent score (mean difference, MD = -2.71; 95% CI: 3.41 to -2.00). This effect decreased but remained significant after eight weeks. -post-antibiotics therapy had a decreased effect only for a short term and possibly among studies with a mostly black study population. No extra adverse events were observed. The TSA suggested a larger sample size for effective evaluation of the  as a supplementary remedy.Probiotic regimes are safe and may exhibit a short-term and long-term beneficial effect for BV treatment.

Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD are sudden worsening of symptoms, the nature of which is associated with bacterial or viral infections. However, one-third of exacerbations remain of undetermined origin. Although it is largely discussed and controversial, current guidelines recommend treatment of exacerbations with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids; this is despite being associated with limited benefits in term of reducing mortality, side effects and without paying attention to the heterogeneity of these exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests that the lung microbiota plays an important role in COPD and numerous studies have reported differences in the microbiota between healthy and disease states, as well as between exacerbations and stable COPD, leading to the hypothesis that frequent acute exacerbation is more likely to experience significant changes in lung microbiota composition. These findings will need further examination to explain the causes of lung dysbiosis, namely microbial composition, the host response, including the recruitment of eosinophils, lifestyle, diet, cigarette smoking and the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids. It is now important to assess: 1) Whether alterations in the lung microbiota contribute to disease pathogenesis, especially in exacerbations of unknown origin; 2) The role of eosinophils; and 3) Whether the microbiota of the lung can be manipulated therapeutically to improve COPD exacerbation event and disease progression. In summary, we hypothesize that the alterations of the lung microbiota may explain the undetermined origins of exacerbations and that there is an urgent need to facilitate the design of intervention studies that aim at conserving the lung microbial flora.Copyright 2019, Toraldo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645008>Pretreatment of Pennisetum sinese silages with ferulic acid esterase-producing lactic acid bacteria and cellulase at two dry matter contents: Fermentation characteristics, carbohydrates composition and enzymatic saccharification.</a></h2><p>The impact of Lactobacillus plantarum A1 producing ferulic acid esterase and Acremonium cellulase on Pennisetum sinese silages was investigated at two dry matter contents by studying the ensiling characteristics, lignocellulosic degradation and enzymatic saccharification properties.

The diversity of human gut microbiota has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut microbiota changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut microbiota along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing  to maintain the gut microbiota to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654515>Human microbiome and allergic diseases in children: pathogenetic role and therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>The recent and extensive study of the microbiome has provided an enormous amount of data concerning the type and possible functions of microorganisms present in the gut, airways, genital tract, and skin. These data showed interpersonal differences in the composition of the microbiome and these differences suggest a link between the microbiome, the immune modulation, and the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. This research is particularly relevant in paediatrics, since allergic diseases are constantly increasing and there is evidence in the paediatric age that shows that the composition of the microbiome in the foetal and neonatal period plays a key role in the development of the immune system: vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, childhood spent in rural environments and/or in contact with animals result in a greater biodiversity of the microbiome with the presence of protective species that reduce the activation of Th2 lymphocytes, involved in allergic reactions. Further studies are necessary to better understand the microbiota role in the pathogenesis of atopy in order to understand if specific  and prebiotics, administered orally or topically, can affect the microbiota composition and modulate immune system functions, producing a therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic diseases. This narrative review analysed the available literature regarding the correlation between the microbiome and the development of allergic diseases and with special focus on paediatric studies. The skin, gut or lung dysbiosis can be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of allergies and the remodulation of the microbiome becomes an important therapeutic challenge.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615039>Effect of  on Oral Candidiasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Oral candidiasis (OC) is an increasing health problem due to the introduction of new drugs, population aging, and increasing prevalence of chronic illness.

Probiotic strains used are Bifidobacterium BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Lactobacillus delbrueckii LBY-27, Lactobacillus paracasei LC-01, and Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31. Thirty rats randomly assigned to five groups were used in the experiment. Groups A to C received 1 × 10 CFU, 5 × 10 CFU, and 10 × 10 CFU of the multi-strain  daily and respectively from day 0 post-supplementation (PS) to termination. Group D and E were the infected and uninfected controls respectively. On day seven PS, groups A to D were challenged intraperitoneally with approximately 1 × 10 trypanosomes. Parasitemia, nitric oxide level, hematobiochemical parameters, and antibody titer to heterologous antigen stimulation were monitored post-infection. By days 7 and 16 PS, -treated groups had significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean creatinine concentration than the controls; however, on day 7 PS, there were no significant variations in the leukocyte counts (LC), total erythrocyte counts (TEC), and the packed cell volume (PCV) in all experimental groups. Following infection, by day 16 PS, the pre-patent period, parasitemia levels, and antibody titer were similar in all infected groups. Furthermore, the -treated groups and the infected control had significantly lower PCV, TEC, and LC values when compared to the uninfected control, and  treated groups (A and C) had only marginally lower nitric oxide levels than the infected control.

This study assessed the effects of different concentrations of quercetin (QUE) and resveratrol (RES) on the ability of six potentially probiotic  strains to tolerate different pH values and bile salt concentrations, to autoaggregate, coaggregate with and antagonize pathogens and survive the exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. QUE and RES presented low inhibitory effects on all tested  strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 512 to >1024 μg/mL. In most cases, QUE and RES at all tested concentrations (i.e., MIC, 1/2 MIC, and 1/4 MIC) did not affect the tolerance of the  strains to acidic pH and bile salts. QUE increased cell surface hydrophobicity of most of the tested  strains and increases or decreases in cell surface hydrophobicity varied in the presence of different RES concentrations among some strains. QUE and RES increased the ability of tested  strains to autoaggregate and coaggregate with pathogens. QUE and RES did not negatively affect the antagonistic activity of the tested  strains against pathogens and did not decrease their survival rates when exposed to  gastrointestinal conditions. In a few cases, the ability of some tested  strains to antagonize pathogens, as well as to survive specific steps of the  digestion was increased by QUE and RES. QUE exerted overall better protective effects on the measured  properties of tested  strains than RES, and  and  strains presented better responses when treated with QUE or RES. These results showed that probiotic  strains could present low susceptibility to QUE and RES.

A total of 375 one-day-old Japanese quail were randomly allocated into five treatment groups with five replicates of 15 birds each for a 42 d feeding experiment. The dietary treatments were a basal diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with PRO (0.15 g/kg feed), MOS (2 g/kg feed), AEO (0.25 g/kg feed) or DEO (0.25 g/kg feed).3. AEO, MOS, and PRO supplementation increased weight gain, while diets supplemented with AEO decreased FI, and improved feed conversion ratio from d 1 to 21 (P<0.05). The relative weight of the gizzard was higher in birds supplemented with AEO compared to control group, while the birds fed MOS diet had the longest intestine (P<.05). Ceca length was greater in control, MOS and PRO groups (P<.05). Both essential oils decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration of breast meat and percentage of cooking loss in quail (P<.05).

GG, which is a representative commercial probiotic, was used as a comparative sample. Regarding probiotic properties,  KCCM 12203P was resistant to 0.3% pepsin with a pH of 2.5 for 3 h and 0.3% oxgall solution for 24 h, having approximately a 99% survival rate. It also showed strong adhesion activity (6.84%) onto HT-29 cells and did not produce β-glucuronidase but produced high quantities of leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase, and -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. For antioxidant activity, it appeared that viable cells had higher radical scavenging activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, while in the 2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assay, heat-killed cells had higher antioxidant activity. Additionally,  KCCM 12203P showed higher lipid oxidation inhibition ability than  GG; however, there was no significant difference ( < 0.05) between heat-killed cells and control cells.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of , prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586210>Therapeutic Delivery of Ang(1-7) Via Genetically Modified Probiotic: A Dosing Study.</a></h2><p>In recent years a number of beneficial health effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that extend beyond lowering blood pressure, primarily mediated via the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (1-7) or Ang(1-7)/MAS receptor axis.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: 5.77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: 5.77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: 5.58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving B. breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014).

KB290 forms unique rugose colonies inside an agar medium; this characteristic is useful for detecting and enumerating KB290 in the gut or feces. However, the genetic elements associated with this morphology remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the relation between the plasmid eps genes and rugose colony morphology in KB290. The plasmid-cured mutants formed smooth colonies, and the rugose colony morphology was restored after complementation with the eps genes. The eps genes were successfully cloned and expressed in other L. brevis and L. plantarum strains. In these transformant strains, the presence of the EPS, consisting of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine, correlated with rugose colonies, indicating that EPS is responsible for rugose colony formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying the genetic factors influencing rugose colonies in Lactobacillus strains. This rugose colony formation may serve as a useful selective marker for KB290 in routine laboratory and research settings and can be used to detect the spontaneous loss of plasmids in this strain.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650413>In Vitro Evaluation of Probiotic Potential of Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria Strains.</a></h2><p>Research of human microbiome demonstrates that in order to develop next generation of probiotic agents, it is necessary to choose bacterial strains featured by special properties, such as the ability of the cells to attach to intestinal walls, resistance to bile and acids, bacteriocin synthesis, antioxidative and antipathogenic activity, and survivability in intestines.

Such strains serve as the basis for developing  with a curative potential for the central nervous system - psychobioitcs. However, the question of how to find such strains and which criteria to use for their selection remains unanswered. Some compounds produced by bacteria, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, are potential mediators between bacterial cells and the host. Previously, we established that some species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are capable of producing GABA. We presumed that GABA-producing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains are great candidates to use as psychobiotics. Therefore, we selected the strains Lactobacillus plantarum 90sk and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 150 as efficient GABA producers. The goal of this work was to assess the probiotic properties of the selected strains as well as their antidepressive effects in mice. We established that the ingestion of the probiotic composition based on the selected strains by BALB/c mice for 2 weeks reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming test; the effect was similar to that of fluoxetine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641523>Effects of metformin, acarbose, and sitagliptin monotherapy on gut microbiota in Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota was closely related to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Oral antidiabetic medications including metformin, acarbose and sitagliptin lowered blood glucose levels via acting on the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the study was to observe the comparisons among those medications on gut microbiota composition.Zucker diabetic fatty rats (n=32) were randomly divided into four groups, and had respectively gastric administration of normal saline (control), metformin (215.15 mg/kg/day), acarbose (32.27 mg/kg/day), or sitagliptin (10.76 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood glucose levels were measured during an intragastric starch tolerance test after the treatments. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to access the microbiota in the fecal samples.Metformin, acarbose, and sitagliptin monotherapy effectively decreased fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels (p<0.001). Acarbose group displayed specific cluster and enterotype mainly composed by  while  was the dominant bacterium in the enterotype of the other three groups. The relative abundance of genera  and  was dramatically higher in acarbose group. Metformin and sitagliptin increased the relative abundance of genus Lactobacillus. Metagenomic prediction showed that the functional profiles of carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in acarbose group.Metformin, acarbose and sitagliptin exerted different effects on the composition of gut microbiota and selectively increased the beneficial bacteria.

Inulin is one of the most common prebiotics that exhibit twisted hydrocolloidal properties in dairy products. The present study was designed to develop a synbiotic yogurt by incorporation of  and inulin at 1%, 1.5%, and 2% (w/v), comparing with the probiotic and control plain yogurts. Microrheological, microstructural, microbiological, sensory properties, and volatile compounds of the yogurt samples were evaluated. Microrheological analysis showed that addition of inulin to yogurt slightly reduced the values of G' and G″, while solid-liquid balance (SLB) values confirmed more solid properties of the synbiotic yogurt (0.582~0.595) than the plain yogurt (0.503~0.518). A total of 18 volatile compounds were identified in the synbiotic yogurt, while only five and six compounds were identified in plain and probiotic yogurts, respectively. Physiochemical parameters such as pH, acidity, and protein content were in the normal range (as with the control), while fat content in the synbiotic yogurt decreased significantly. Addition of 1% inulin not only reduced syneresis but also maintained viability of  after 28 days of storage. Microstructural and microrheological studies confirmed the dense, compressed, homogeneous structure of the synbiotic yogurt. Thus, addition of inulin improved the textural and sensory properties of the synbiotic yogurt, as well as survival of  with viable count above 6.0 log CFU/g in yogurt, as generally required for . Therefore, novel synbiotic yogurt with desirable quality was developed as an effective carrier for delivery of the probiotic yeast exerting its beneficial health effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630331>Oral Vaccination with Hepatitis E Virus Capsid Protein and Immunobiotic Bacterium-Like Particles Induce Intestinal and Systemic Immunity in Mice.</a></h2><p>The hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 (GT3) is an emergent pathogen in industrialized countries. It is transmitted zoonotically and may lead to chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals. We evaluated if the major antigen of HEV, the capsid protein, can be used in combination with immunobiotic bacterium-like particles (IBLP) for oral vaccination in a mouse model. We have cloned and expressed the RGS-His-tagged HEV GT3 capsid protein (ORF2) in E. coli and purified it by NiNTA. IBLP were obtained from two immunobiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains acid- and heat-treated. ORF2 and the IBLP were orally administered to Balb/c mice. After three oral immunizations (14-day intervals), blood, intestinal fluid, Peyer´s patches, and spleen samples were drawn. IgA- and IgG-specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Mononuclear cell populations from Peyer's patches and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the cytokine profiles were determined by ELISA to study cellular immunity. Orally administered recombinant ORF2 and IBLP from two L. rhamnosus strains (CRL1505 and IBL027) induced both antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. IBLP027 was more effective in inducing specific secretory IgA in the gut. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-4 were produced by Peyer's plaques lymphocytes stimulated with ORF2 ex vivo suggesting a mixed Th1/Th2-type adaptive immune response in immunized mice. Oral vaccines are not invasive, do not need to be administered by specialized personal, and elicit both systemic and local immune responses at the port of entry.

Cell viability was assessed using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2-tetrazolium, inner salt) assays, whereas apoptosis was monitored through RT-qPCR analysis of Bax, Bak, Noxa, and Bid mRNA expressions in addition to flow cytometry analysis of  cell-free supernatant (LCFS) treatment. Our results showed that the anti-cancer effect of LCFS on cell viability was pronouncedly enhanced in 3D-cultured HCT-116 cells, which was linked to the increased level of cleaved caspase 3. Additionally, upregulation of apoptotic marker gene mRNA transcription was dramatically increased in 3D cultured cells compared to 2D systems. In conclusion, this study suggests that LCFS enhances the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in HCT-116 cells and the potential anti-cancer effects of Lactobacilli mixtures in 3D culture systems.

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile acids, SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut microbiota and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of , bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells 786-0 and OS-RC-2 were resistant to TRAIL. The present study examines the potential of combining polyphenolic compound resveratrol (RES) with TRAIL. We found that RES can sensitize RCC cells to TRAIL-induced death. Electron microscopy analyses showed that RES plus TRAIL can induce both autophagy and apoptosis in RCC cells. It was proved that the apoptosis is caspase-dependent and the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was involved in this process. Besides, we also found that XIAP expression was significantly inhibited after RES plus TRAIL treatment in RCC cells. Furthermore, a fiber-modified replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5/35-TRAIL was generated to test the synergistic effect of RES and TRAIL in vivo. Our data demonstrated that RES plus Ad5/35-TRAIL significantly inhibited RCC xenograft growth in nude mice.

Several interventions are available for the management of patients with IBS, but no universal management algorithm currently exists. The aim of this article is to review interventions that may be considered in the management of patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). Nonpharmacological interventions include dietary and lifestyle modification, which are generally used as first-line therapy.  have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with IBS, but studies are inconsistent in strains examined, dosing, and treatment duration. Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy) also may improve IBS symptoms. Pharmacological interventions for the management of IBS-D include the US Food and Drug Administration-approved agents eluxadoline, rifaximin, and alosetron, as well as loperamide, smooth muscle antispasmodics, bile acid sequestrants, and antidepressants (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Eluxadoline and rifaximin have been shown to improve abdominal pain and stool consistency in patients with IBS-D. In addition, data indicate that alosetron improves IBS symptoms; however, it is approved only for women with severe IBS-D. Of the three approved agents, rifaximin has the most favorable safety profile. The risk-benefit ratio is an important consideration with every medication, but is especially important in the treatment of functional GI disorders such as IBS-D. Thus, the most troublesome symptoms, quality of life, symptom intensity, and individual patient preferences should be considered when formulating a management plan for patients with IBS-D.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615957>Antibiotics and Host-Tailored  Similarly Modulate Effects on the Developing Avian Microbiome, Mycobiome, and Host Gene Expression.</a></h2><p>The microbiome is important to all animals, including poultry, playing a critical role in health and performance. Low-dose antibiotics have historically been used to modulate food production animals and their microbiome. Identifying alternatives to antibiotics conferring similar modulatory properties has been elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine if a host-tailored probiotic could recapitulate effects of a low-dose antibiotic on host response and the developing microbiome. Over 13 days of life, turkey poults were supplemented continuously with a low-dose antibiotic or oral supplementation of a prebiotic with or without two different  (8 cage units,  = 80 per group). Gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal communities of poults were characterized by 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Localized and systemic host gene expression was assessed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), kinase activity was assessed by avian-specific kinome peptide arrays, and performance parameters were assessed. We found that development of the early-life microbiome of turkey poults was tightly ordered in a tissue- and time-specific manner. Low-dose antibiotic and turkey-tailored probiotic supplementation, but not nontailored probiotic supplementation, elicited similar shifts in overall microbiome composition during development compared to controls. Treatment-induced bacterial changes were accompanied by parallel shifts in the fungal community and host gene expression and enhanced performance metrics. These results were validated in pen trials that identified further additive effects of the turkey-tailored probiotic combined with different prebiotics. Alternative approaches to low-dose antibiotic use in poultry are feasible and can be optimized utilizing the indigenous poultry microbiome. Similar approaches may also be beneficial for humans. Alternative approaches are greatly needed to reduce the need for antibiotic use in food animal production. This study utilized a pipeline for the development of a host-tailored probiotic to enhance performance in commercial turkeys and modulate their microbiota, similar to the effects of low-dose antibiotic administration. We determined that a host-tailored probiotic, developed in the context of the commercial turkey gut microbiome, was more effective at modulating these parameters than a nontailored probiotic cocktail. Furthermore, the host-tailored probiotic mimicked many of the effects of a low-dose antibiotic growth promoter. Surprisingly, the effects of the antibiotic growth promoter and host-tailored probiotic were observed across kingdoms, illustrating the coordinated interkingdom effects of these approaches. This work suggests that tailored approaches to probiotic development hold promise for modulating the avian host and its microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Ward et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623229> Prevents Sensitization to Oral Antigen and Subsequent Increases in Intestinal Tight Junction Permeability in Juvenile-Young Adult Rats.</a></h2><p>Increased intestinal permeability is thought to underlie the pathogenesis of food allergy.

Forty rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. The sham (control and prevention) group received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the Alzheimer group received ICV injection of Aβ(1-42), and the probiotic+Alzheimer group received 500 mg  daily (15×10 colony-forming unit) by gavage for 4 weeks before and 2 weeks after injection of Aβ(1-42). The Morris water maze test was performed for evaluation of spatial learning and memory. LTP and PPF ratios were measured to evaluate longterm synaptic plasticity and pre-synaptic mechanisms, respectively. The results showed that probiotic supplementation significantly improved learning, but not memory impairment, and increased PPF ratios compared to those in the Alzheimer group. Both Aβ(1-42) injection and probiotic supplementation alone did not significantly effect plasma level of NO. Probiotic supplementation of rats in the probiotic (6 weeks)+Alzheimer group decreased serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol significantly compared to the Alzheimer group. The results of this study suggest that probiotic supplementation may positively impact learning capacity and LTP in rats with AD, most likely via the release of neurotransmitters via presynaptic mechanisms or via a protective effect on serum lipid profiles.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623188>Adjuvant Strategies for Lactic Acid Bacterial Mucosal Vaccines.</a></h2><p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive, acid-tolerant bacteria that have long been used in food fermentation and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). LAB are a part of a normal microbiome and act as , improving the gastrointestinal microbiome and health when consumed. An increasing body of research has shown the importance of the microbiome on both mucosal immune heath and immune response to pathogens and oral vaccines. Currently, there are few approved mucosal vaccines, and most are attenuated viruses or bacteria, which necessitates cold chain, carries the risk of reversion to virulence, and can have limited efficacy in individuals with poor mucosal health. On account of these limitations, new types of mucosal vaccine vectors are necessary. There has been increasing interest and success in developing recombinant LAB as next generation mucosal vaccine vectors due to their natural acid and bile resistance, stability at room temperature, endogenous activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and the development of molecular techniques that allow for manipulation of their genomes. To enhance the immunogenicity of these LAB vaccines, numerous adjuvant strategies have been successfully employed. Here, we review these adjuvant strategies and their mechanisms of action which include: Toll-like receptor ligands, secretion of bacterial toxins, secretion of cytokines, direct delivery to antigen presenting cells, and enterocyte targeting.

Herein, we aim to explore their potential in modulating systemic autoimmune disorders. The bovine type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) and CII antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mice model was used in this study. Heat-killed Lactobacillus reuteri (h-L. reuteri) was administered before or after the induction of CIA. The results indicated that the severity of CIA was alleviated and the prevalence of CIA was decreased in the mice pre-treated with h-L. reuteri. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found that decreased serum CII-specific IgG antibody IL-6 and CXCL1 but the increased level of IL-10 was found in h-L. reuteri-treated cohort. Moreover, h-L. reuteri treatment decreased the severity and incidence of arthritis in the CAIA model which is associated with a early decrease of IL-6. Systematic supplement of exogenous IL-6 reversed h-L. reuteri-induced CIA suppression. For regulatory immune responses, the frequency of Tregs and CD4+IL-10+ cells was increased in the draining lymph of joint of h-L. reuteri-treated mice after second immunization. Parallelly, we found that if CIA was induced, CD103+ dendritic cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and α4β7+ Tregs in the spleen were increased in h-L. reuteri-treated mice, suggesting h-L. reuteri might affect the peripheral migration of Tregs to modulating CIA. Finally, the mice with progressive CIA were treated with h-L. reuteri after the second immunization. No alleviation of CIA severity, as well as an increase of splenic α4β7+ Tregs, was observed in these mice. This study indicates that pre-administration of h-L. reuteri can alleviate the CIA in mice and may serve as a promising strategy for autoimmune disease prevention.Copyright © 2019.

Two independent researchers screened the data extracted from the relevant studies. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated using the random or fixed effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Q-test.Overall, 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 840 subjects with T2DM were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that  intake resulted in significant improvement in serum levels of FBS [SMD: -0.35, 95% CI: (-0.59, -0.12)], total antioxidant status (TAS) [SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.11, 0.55)], total glutathione (GSH) [SMD: 0.41, 95% CI: (0.26, 0.56)] and malondialdehyde (MDA) [SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: (-0.83, -0.26)]. No significant improvement was found in HbA1C [SMD: -0.06, 95% CI:(-0.82, 0.69)], and nitric oxide (NO) [SMD:-0.24, 95% CI:(-1.10, 0.62)] levels.It seems that gut microbiota can exert beneficial effects in diabetic patients via altering oxidative stress' biomarkers. The beneficial effect of gut microbiota however was modest on FBS and non-significant on HbA1C. These results need to be confirmed by conducting more reliable RCTs.CRD42019134905.

Functional yoghurt fortified with DPP in three forms was prepared and their physicochemical, microstructure, texture and sensory characteristics were assessed. The micro morphology was explored via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed for functional groups detection. Phenolic compounds were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) while fatty acids were identified via Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC). Cytotoxicity of DPP nanocapsules was evaluated against RPE1 cell line (BJ1). The Egyptian date palm pollen grains evaluation revealed its rich content of protein and carbohydrate (36.28 and 17.14 g/ 100g), high content of Fe, Zn and Mg (226.5, 124.4 and 318 mg/100g), unsaturated fatty acids ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9 (8.76, 20.26 and 7.11 g/100g, which was increased by ethanol extraction) and phenolic compounds especially catechin (191.73 μg/mL) which was pronounced in DPP antioxidant potentials (IC50 35.54 mg/g). The FTIR analyses indicated the presence of soluble amides (proteins) and polysaccharides (fibers) functional groups in DPP. Fortification with nanoencapsulated DPP proved to be safe and the recommended form due to the announced positive characteristics. Yoghurt fortification with DPP forms enhanced viscosity, syneresis and Water Holding Capacity (WHC), which can be considered a symbiotic functional product as it contained both  (106 CFU/g) and prebiotics represented in DPP forms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659751>Nutraceuticals as Modulators of Gut Microbiota: Role in Therapy.</a></h2><p>As our knowledge of the various roles of the gut microbiota in the maintenance of homeostasis grows and as we learn how a disrupted microbiota may contribute to disease, therapeutic strategies that target our microbial fellow-travelers become ever more attractive. Most appealing are those interventions that seek to modify or supplement our diet through the addition of nutraceuticals. We now know that our diet, whether in the short- or long-term, is a major modifier of microbiota composition and function. Of the various nutraceuticals, two categories; prebiotics and  have received the greatest attention in basic research and product development. While our understanding of the impacts of prebiotics and  on the indigenous microbiota and host biology have been described in great detail in vitro and inanimal models, the clinical literature leaves much to be desired.

IL-17 family has been cloned in human and mouse, as well IL-17A, IL-17 F in swine. So far, current knowledge on the cloning and biological functions of porcine IL-17B (poIL-17B) and porcine IL-17E (poIL-17E) is limited. In this study, poIL-17B and poIL-17E, mainly expressed in intestine, were cloned and characterized. Expression of poIL-17B and poIL-17E was upregulated after pathogenic microorganism infection. Moreover, the significant enhanced expression of antibacterial peptides PR-39 and pBD-1 was observed when poIL-17B and poIL-17E were over-expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2. This demonstrated that poIL-17B and poIL-17E might have anti-infective capability. Pathogens infection data showed that pathogens could up-regulate poIL-17B/E expression levels. After stimulating the cells with the pathogen, continued with , the expression of poIL-17B/E was down-regulated. Meanwhile, the induced expression of poIL-17E was greater than that of poIL-17B. Invasion data indicated that poIL-17B and poIL-17E both could inhibit effectively pathogenic microorganism, while inhibitory capability of poIL-17B was stronger than that of poIL-17E. Therefore, poIL-17B and poIL-17E both could be important members against intestinal infection in the porcine IL-17 family. This study provided a theoretical basis for the prevention of intestinal diseases in pigs and thus achieved healthy farming.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite decades of work developing and testing prevention strategies, ICU-acquired pneumonia remains stubbornly pervasive. Pneumonia prevention studies are difficult to interpret because all are at risk of bias due to the subjectivity and poor specificity of pneumonia definitions. Interventions associated with improvements in objective outcomes in addition to pneumonia, such as length of stay or mortality, should therefore be prioritized. Avoiding intubation, minimizing sedation, implementing early extubation strategies, and mobilizing patients do appear to improve some of these objective outcomes. Many of our other assumptions about how best to prevent ICU-acquired pneumonia, however, have recently been challenged. Elevating the head of the bed is supported by very little randomized trial data. Early reports suggested that subglottic secretion drainage may decrease time to extubation and ICU length of stay, but more recent analyses refute these findings. Novel endotracheal tube cuff designs do not clearly lower pneumonia rates. A large randomized trial of selective digestive decontamination in ICUs with high baseline rates of antimicrobial resistance did not identify any benefit. Oral care with chlorhexidine may increase mortality risk and stress ulcer prophylaxis may facilitate pneumonia. Early data on  suggest a possible effect but there is no clear signal yet that they shorten duration of mechanical ventilation or lower mortality. Ventilator bundles on balance do appear to be beneficial but it is not clear which components are most important nor how best to implement them. This article will review recent studies that have challenged, refined, or complicated our understanding of how best to prevent ICU-acquired pneumonia.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690037>Digital Immune Gene Expression Profiling Discriminates Allergic Rhinitis Responders from Non-Responders to Probiotic Supplementation.</a></h2><p>Probiotic supplementation for eight weeks with a multi-strain probiotic by individuals with allergic rhinitis (AR) reduced overall symptom severity, the frequency of medication use and improved quality of life. The purported mechanism of action is modulation of the immune system. This analysis examined changes in systemic and mucosal immune gene expression in a subgroup of individuals, classified as either responders or non-responders based on improvement of AR symptoms in response to the probiotic supplement. Based on established criteria of a beneficial change in the mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (mRQLQ), individuals with AR were classified as either responders or non-responders. Systemic and mucosal immune gene expression was assessed using nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) kit on blood samples and a nasal lysate. There were 414 immune genes in the blood and 312 immune genes in the mucosal samples expressed above the background threshold. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of immune genes separated responders from non-responders in blood and mucosal samples at baseline and after supplementation, with key T-cell immune genes differentially expressed between the groups. Striking differences in biological processes and pathways were evident in nasal mucosa but not blood in responders compared to non-responders. These findings support the use of network approaches to understand probiotic-induced changes to the immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610179>Probiotic bacteria and yeasts adsorb aflatoxin M in milk and degrade it to less toxic AFM-metabolites.</a></h2><p>The presence of contaminants such as aflatoxins (AFs) in dairy products constitutes a serious risk to the health of consumers, especially children who are most sensitive to the adverse effects of AFs. The presence of Aflatoxin M (AFM) in milk is a public health problem since dairy products are massively consumed worldwide. The aim of the present work was to select microorganisms capable of reducing AFM entry into the food chain through adsorption/degradation strategies. Moreover, the toxicity of AFM degradation products was evaluated. All tested strains had the capacity to adsorb 19%-61% AFM in milk. These strains also had the ability to degrade AFM into metabolites less toxic than the original toxin. Moreover, this is the first study to report harmless and probiotic Pediococcus pentosaceus and Kluveromyces marxianus have the ability to adsorb and degrade AFM to less toxic metabolites in milk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It affects the production quality, damages the liver, and increases mortality in broilers. The present study is focused to explore appropriate utilization of Selenium (Se) as a feed additive in broiler chickens against high temperature.Day-old male broiler chickens (Ross 308) ( = 200) were grouped according to the supplements used in their basal diets such as: corn-soybean basal diet as control (Con), a basal diet containing sodium selenite, basal diet with , and a basal diet containing selenium-enriched  (SP). At the end of the experimental period of 42 days, the liver was isolated and was used to determine the antioxidant capacity through a spectrophotometer. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines production in the liver was measured through a real-time polymerase chain reaction.Hepatic analyses revealed the decreased level of malondialdehyde, whereas glutathione, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase levels were increased in the SP group. Furthermore, supplementation of SP significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), GPx4, IL6, and IL10 and down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.It is thus concluded that SP as a potential nutritive supplement may facilitate hepatic protection by suppressing hepatic oxidation, inflammation, and necrosis during the high ambient temperature of summer.Copyright: © Journal of Advanced Veterinary and Animal Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591781>Letter: ?

The approximate content of tannin in the RM diet was 1.31%, which was close to that of T1, while the tannin content of FM was close to that of T0. The weight gain rate of grass carp of the RM group was significantly lower than that of the FM group, while the feeding conversion ratio and the feeding rate were significantly higher in the T1 group than in T0. The muscle lipid content was significantly lower in RM than in FM, while T1 was lower than T0. Intestinal activities of trypsin and α-amylase were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups compared with the other treatments. The hepatic activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in T1 and RM groups compared with the other treatments, while hepatic glycogen, and malonaldehyde were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups. In serum, the total protein and globulin contents were significantly higher in T1 and RM groups, while albumin was significantly lower in the RM group compared to the FM group. High-throughput sequencing showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla among groups. The intestinal microbial diversity was higher in T1 and RM. Redundancy analysis showed that tannin, rapeseed meal, and intestinal trypsin activity were positively or negatively correlated with the relative abundance of several different intestinal microbiota at phylum and/or genus levels. The results indicated that 1.25% tannin could not be the main reason for the poor growth of grass carp of the RM group; however, the protein metabolism was disturbed, the absorption of carbohydrate was improved, and the accumulation of lipid had decreased.

Both probiotic provision and donor milk availability varied between 0%-100% among networks whereas feeding initiation and advancement rates were similar in most networks. The 9792 infants included in the cohort study to link survey results and cohort outcomes, revealed similar baseline characteristics but considerable differences in factors associated with NEC between networks. 397 (4.1%) neonates underwent NEC surgery, ranging from 2.4%-8.4% between networks. Standardised ratios for surgical NEC were lower for Australia/New Zealand, higher for Spain, and comparable for the remaining six networks.The variation in implementation of NEC prevention practices and in factors associated with NEC in literature could not be associated with the variation in surgical NEC incidence. This corroborates the current lack of consensus surrounding the use of preventive strategies for NEC and emphasises the need for research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This mini-review will focus on the unexpected findings linking the microbiome to myelination. We first address the temporal correlation between the acquisition of a gut microbiota in the developing organism and developmental myelination. We then review the factors impacting the composition of the child's gut microbiota, ranging from maternal stress to modality of delivery and from breastfeeding and diet composition to antibiotic treatment early in life. We discuss the topic of gut-brain communication with an emphasis on myelination, and propose the concept that gut microbes produce metabolites which may constitute a "metabolic" niche. Distinct bacterial communities may create very different "niches", some permissive and others inhibitory for myelin generation or maintenance. We speculate that this concept of "gut dysbiosis" may also in part explain the reduced myelin content detected in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conclude by envisioning intervention with  and prebiotics to favor the formation of a microbial metabolic "niche" favoring myelin production to promote brain health.Copyright © 2019.

The genus and species microbial composition of these samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and groEL gene amplicons, and the volatile profile of the samples was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated variation in abundance of microbiota at the genus level among the fermented yak milk samples, with Lactobacillus as the most abundant genus in the majority of samples, ranging from 41.6 to 98.26%. The volatile profile of the samples varied among those collected from different villages. Correlations between bacterial composition and volatile compounds of the samples were also observed. Lactobacillus displayed a significant correlation with volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and ethyl acetate, whereas the samples with relatively high abundance of Streptococcus and Lactococcus displayed relatively low contents of volatile compounds.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD).  may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients,  remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of .© Copyright by the Author(s).

The aggregation of transgenic granulocyte neutrophils in zebrafish from a normal environment and from a sterile environment was calculated, and the anti-inflammatory activity of SEP was evaluated. To evaluate the anti-ulcerative colitis activity of SEP, DSS-induced colitis mice were given SEP, salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP), or SASP + SEP. Then, the concentrations of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α in the serum were detected, the HE-stained colon tissue was examined by microscopy the species composition and abundance distribution of the intestinal flora was analyzed. The results showed that 500 μg/mL SEP treatment significantly alleviated neutrophil granulocyte aggregation in the zebrafish inflammation model; Diarrhea, hematochezia and body weight loss were alleviated to a certain extent in mice gavaged with SEP and SASP, and the combination of SASP with SEP was the most effective in mice. The damage to villi in the intestine was completely repaired, and the levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α, which are associated with inflammation, were all reduced. In addition, the proportion of intestinal  or harmless bacteria increased, while that of pathogenic bacteria decreased, and the effect of the combined treatment was the most pronounced. These results show that SEP could relieve inflammation, cure ulcerative colitis, regulate intestinal flora and enhance the therapeutic effect of the clinical drug SASP. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of SEP as an anti-inflammatory adjuvant therapy and intestinal flora regulator.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667699>The lung microbiome: clinical and therapeutic implications.</a></h2><p>The human respiratory tract, usually considered sterile, is currently being investigated for human-associated microbial communities. According to Dickson's conceptual model, the lung microbiota (LMt) is a dynamic ecosystem, whose composition, in healthy lungs, is likely to reflect microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. However, which microbial genera constitutes a "healthy microbiome" per se remains hotly debated. It is now widely accepted that a bi-directional gut-lung axis connects the intestinal with the pulmonary microbiota and that the diet could have a role in modulating both microbiotas as in health as in pathological status. The LMt is altered in numerous respiratory disorders such as obstructive airway diseases, interstitial lung diseases, infections, and lung cancer. Some authors hypothesize that the use of specific bacterial strains, termed "," with positive effects on the host immunity and/or against pathogens, could have beneficial effects in the treatment of intestinal disorders and pulmonary diseases. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the literature available on the LMt to delineate and discuss the potential relationship between composition alterations of LMt and lung diseases.

Relative to this importance, a lot of research has been devoted to the study of yeasts involved in making these important products. The role of yeasts in other fermentations in association with other microorganisms - mainly lactic acid bacteria - has been relatively less studied, and often it is not clear if yeasts occurring in such fermentations are contaminants with no role in the fermentation, spoilage microorganisms or whether they actually serve a technological or functional purpose. Some knowledge is available for yeasts used as starter cultures in fermented raw sausages or in the production of acid curd cheeses.

The idea that the host's diet possesses characteristics that could potentially alter microbiota composition is a novel notion. We hypothesize that a high fat diet leads to the alteration of the gastrointestinal microbiota composition and that metabolic transformation of the compound trimethylamine into trimethylamine-N-oxide promotes vasculopathy such as atherosclerosis and affects cardiovascular functionality.

Old age alters our metabolic and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, (2) acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary diseases, (4) diabetes, and (5) stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut microbiome where no change was observed, we found that the saliva microbiome had higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of the HA group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in abundance in the HA cohort. Streptococcus was the only genus observed to be significantly decreased in abundance in both the gut and oral microbiomes of the HA cohort compared with the NHA cohort.

Age-related cognitive impairment is associated with selective neuronal loss, oxidative changes that lead to microglia activation and neuroinflammation. In addition, it is associated to alteration reduction in trophic factors affecting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In recent years, attention has been paid to the relationship between gut microbiota and brain. In aging, there is an alteration in microbiota, gut microbiota diversity is perturbed with an increase in pathogenic bacteria at the expense of beneficial ones. Dysbiosis may lead to chronic inflammation, and a decrease in bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids which have been related to an upregulation of neurotrophic factors. Supplementation with prebiotics and  can modulate gut microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; thus, they may be considered as a possible treatment for age-related cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence has shown a significant connection between gut microbiota and brain function, as butyrate production by microorganisms is believed to activate the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To investigate whether modification of intestinal microbiota could impact cognitive decline in the aging brain, Romo-Araiza . conducted a study to test how probiotic and prebiotic supplementation impacted spatial and associative memory in middle-aged rats. Their results showed that rats supplemented with the symbiotic (both probiotic and prebiotic) treatment performed significantly better than other groups in the spatial memory test, though not in that of associative memory. Their data also reported that this improvement correlated with increased levels of BDNF, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and better electrophysiological outcomes in the hippocampi of the symbiotic group.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation reduces fructose-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 and underlying mechanisms in the protective effects of LGG.FGF21 knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice were fed 30% fructose for 12 weeks. LGG was administered to the mice in the last 4 weeks during fructose feeding. FGF21-adiponectin (ADPN)-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation were investigated.FGF21 expression was robustly increased after 5-weeks of feeding and significantly decreased after 12-weeks of feeding in fructose-induced NAFLD mice. LGG administration reversed the depressed FGF21 expression, increased adipose production of ADPN, and reduced hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in the WT mice but not in the KO mice. Hepatic nuclear carbohydrate responsive-element binding protein (ChREBP) was increased by fructose and reduced by LGG, resulting in a reduction in the expression of lipogenic genes. The methylated form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) C, which dephosphorylates and activates ChREBP, was upregulated by fructose and normalized by LGG. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1, which methylates PP2AC, was also increased by fructose and decreased by LGG. However, those beneficial effects of LGG were blunted in the KO mice. Hepatic dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits PP2A, was markedly increased by LGG in the WT mice but attenuated in the KO mice. LGG decreased adipose hypertrophy and increased serum levels of ADPN, which regulates sphingosine metabolism. This beneficial effect was decreased in the KO mice.LGG administration increases hepatic FGF21 expression and serum ADPN concentration, resulting in a reduced ChREBP activation through dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated PP2A deactivation, and subsequently reversed fructose-induced NAFLD. Thus, our data suggest that FGF21 is required for the beneficial effects of LGG in reversal of fructose-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Probiotic mixture 1 (PM-1) is a mixture of two  ( and  and probiotic mixture 2 (PM-2) is a mixture of four  (, , , and . PM-1 and PM-2 decreased histopathological scores in the duodenum and jejunum after mucositis. PM-2 attenuated 5-FU-induced weight loss. On the other hand, PM-1 did not exert a significant effect on weight loss. Both  mixture increased the villus/crypt ratio in all intestinal segments, increased GSH levels in the duodenum and jejunum, and reduced the MDA, MPO, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. PM-2 attenuated the delay in gastric emptying. PM-1 and PM-2 prevented epithelial injury in intestinal mucositis by 5-FU, demonstrating the potential use of these  as therapeutic agents against intestinal mucositis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679264>Mechanisms of Probiotic Action in the Honeybee.</a></h2><p>As the beekeeping industry develops, increases in honey yield is dependent on colony health. The honeybee gut bacteria originate from their natural habitat and food, nectar, pollen, and water intake. Extensive studies have been carried out to determine specific suitable probiotic bacteria for honeybees. The main goal of this research is to control diseases, not increase honey production; however, a healthier colony will certainly produce more honey. It has been shown that lactic acid bacteria isolated from honeybees has beneficial effects on bee health and reduces the prevalence of pathogens. Adding a mixture of Lactobacillus to the feed of larvae leads to a reduction in infection.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average weight of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest body moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of  isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial  with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

Acidophilus milk is a regular milk enriched with , one of the beneficial bacterial species found in the colon, that renders the product to exhibit an immunostimulant, anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, or chemopreventive effect especially against colon cancer; in addition, for lactose intolerance treatment. However, most of bacterial species are very demanding and require specific nutritional and environmental conditions to survive.  suggested levels in fermented milk range from 10-10 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). The supplementation or fortification of acidophilus milk with different additives can improve not only the  viability, nutritional value, and sensory properties but also its health benefits; this presents a strategy to improve its overall quality that has yet to be fully exploited by the dairy industry. Nowadays, several acidophilus milk products are flavored or sweetened with no detailed report on accompanied physical or chemical changes, which would ultimately affect consumer's preference and consumption. The main goal of this review is to present an up to date overview of the different fortified acidophilus milk products in context of different probiotic species, additives, and flavor-promoting compounds generated during the fermentation process. Analysis of extrinsic factors (sensory profile) and intrinsic factors (physicochemical characteristics and flavors) can predict the consumers' impression for new products and contribute to establishing a reference standard for the dairy industry towards the development of novel functional foods. Moreover, introduction to advanced analytical technologies exemplified in metabolomics technology is presented to determine acidophilus milk metabolites profile and distinguish different potential markers to be applied in the future in industrial section to improve the safety, quality, and authenticity of other fermented dairy products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623341>Development of a Mucoadhesive  Gelling Formulation for the Delivery of  into Vaginal Cavity.</a></h2><p>Local administration of vaginal , especially lactobacilli, has been recently proposed as an effective prevention strategy against candidosis recurrences, which affect 40-50% of women. In this context, the aim of the present work was the development of a mucoadhesive  gelling formulation for the vaginal administration of . Mixtures of poloxamer 407 (P407) and methylcellulose (MC), two thermosensitive polymers, were prepared and subjected to rheological analyses for the assessment of their sol/gel transition temperature. The association of P407 (15% /) with MC (1.5% /) produced an increase in gelation extent at 37 °C even after dilution in simulated vaginal fluid (SVF). The presence of 0.5% / pectin (PEC) produced a reduction of vehicle pH and viscosity at 25 °C that is the vehicle resistance to flow during administration. The presence of a low concentration of xyloglucan (XYL) (0.25% /) increases the mucoadhesive properties and the capability to gelify at 37 °C of the formulation after dilution with SVF. A three-component (P407/MC/PEC; 3cM) and a four-component (P407/MC/PEC/XYL; 4cM) mixture were selected as promising candidates for the delivery of  to the vaginal cavity.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and  and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682996>Evaluation of the safety and protection efficacy of an attenuated genotype vii newcastle disease virus strain as a candidate vaccine.</a></h2><p>Newcastle disease (ND) is a serious avian infectious disease, causing severe economic loss worldwide. Its prevention depends on comprehensive vaccination scheme against Newcastle disease virus (NDV). However, current vaccine strains are of different genotypes with prevalent circulating strains (genotype VII), with significant genetic distance. Our team previously generated a genotype matched attenuated NDV strain (rmNA-1). In this study, its safety and immunization efficacy were evaluated. Its lentogenic characteristic was stable for 25 generations in embryonated chicken eggs and for six generations in SPF chickens. Overdosed administration did not cause any clinical signs or pathogenic changes in chickens. As to its immunization effect, rmNA-1 stimulated a comparable serum NDV specific antibody level to a LaSota (genotype II) strain based commercial vaccine, and provided full protection against virulent genotype VII strain challenge, with significantly reduced virus shedding period.Copyright © 2019.

A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted on female university students in a single study center.  Two phases of interventions were carried out, the pilot and main study. All participants were female students of Federal University of Mato Grosso, Brazil.  Female students whose ages ranged from 20 to 40 years and self-reported to be suffering from IC based on a questionnaire containing Rome III criteria were included.  Interventions occurred during a period of 30 days in the pilot phase ( = 32) and 15 days in the main study phase ( = 63). The subjects were numbered and randomly divided into experimental probiotic and placebo control groups. Therefore, neither the participants nor the researchers were aware of the allocations of the treatment groups.  The sociodemographic, Rome III, Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QoL) and International Physical Activity questionnaires, and anthropometric measures were utilized. The relative risk (RR) treatment effect, absolute risk reduction (ARR), RR reduction, number needed to treat (NNT), and odds ratio were calculated.  Improvement in the QoL (ARR = 14% and  < 0.01) and satisfaction (ARR = 44% and  < 0.01) according to the PAC-QoL questionnaire was observed in the experimental group compared with the control group. For probiotic supplementation, an NNT = 7 was obtained. This implies that for every seven constipated women treated, a worsening in the QoL is prevented in one. An NNT = 1 was obtained concerning satisfaction in the same group of women with respect to the treatment. No clinically significant observations related to the safety of the product were reported. The authors did not detect the effect of exercise intensity on the QoL of participants.

We investigated the effect of LL-37 on gene regulation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), stimulated with or without Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived LPS, a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR). LL-37 was non-toxic to HGFs up to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. P. gingivalis LPS upregulated the expression of IL8, CXCL10, and CCL2, whereas LL-37 reduced this upregulation. In absence of LPS, LL-37 itself upregulated the expression of IL8 and CCL2. LL-37 increased the expression of P2X7, which was constitutively expressed in HGFs. The P2X7 antagonist A-438079 suppressed the cytotoxicity and upregulatory effect of LL-37 on chemokine response, but not its downregulatory effect on P. gingivalis LPS-induced chemokine response. Whether LL-37 alters the expression of 29 genes that encode TLR-associated proteins, including TLRs, co-receptors, signaling molecules, and negative regulators, in HGFs, under stimulation with LPS, was examined. Among TLRs, P. gingivalis LPS upregulated the level of TLR4, whereas LL-37 reduced it. In co-receptors, LL-37 downregulated the level of CD14. Among signaling molecules, LL-37 augmented the LPS-upregulated expression of IRAK1. Similar effects were observed in the specific negative regulators TNFAIP3, RNF216, TOLLIP, and SIGIRR. Our results suggest that LL-37 exerts cytotoxicity and upregulation of chemokine response via the P2X7 receptor, while it induces downregulation of P. gingivalis LPS-induced chemokine response through alteration in the expression of 7 specific TLR-associated genes: downregulation of TLR4 and CD14 and upregulation of IRAK1, TNFAIP3, RNF216, TOLLIP, and SIGIRR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671639>The Effect of Maternal Postpartum Practices on Infant Gut Microbiota: A Chinese Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>(1) Background: The human gut microbiota at early life is shaped by numerous factors, especially factors from mothers, which have huge influence on infants' gut microbiotas.

Nevertheless, probiotic bacteria undergo a lot of mechanical stress during tableting which causes damage to their cell wall and membrane and other bio-active components. This can lead to an inactivation of the probiotic bacteria and therefore in a failure of the probiotic therapy. To obtain a tablet with a sufficient amount of viable cells, research on the influence of formulation and process parameters on bacterial survival is essential. This study aimed to decipher tableting properties of the probiotic powder blends that have a major impact on survival rates. The powder blends consisted of the prototype probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a filler-binder and a suitable amount of lubricant. They were manufactured by direct compression at different compression pressures and tableting speeds. The tableting properties were analysed in detail by a 3-D modelling technique, which characterized normalized time, pressure and displacement simultaneously. The results of the 3-D modelling demonstrated the significant effect of the pressure plasticity (e) and the angle of rotation (ω) on the viability of L. rhamnosus GG during direct compression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and  also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There are no large-scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. Objective We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age. Setting A one-day point prevalence study was performed as part of the European Study of Neonatal Exposure to Excipients from January to June 2012. Method All neonatal prescriptions and demographic data were registered in a web-based database. The impact of gestational age and region on prescription rate were analysed with logistic regression. Main outcome measure The number and variety of drugs prescribed to hospitalized neonates in different gestational age groups and geographic regions. Results In total, 21 European countries with 89 neonatal units participated. Altogether 2173 prescriptions given to 726 neonates were registered. The 10 drugs with the highest prescription rate were multivitamins, vitamin D, caffeine, gentamicin, amino acids for parenteral nutrition, phytomenadione, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, fat emulsion for parenteral nutrition and . The six most commonly prescribed ATC groups (alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system) covered 98% of prescriptions. Gestational age significantly affected the use of all commonly used drug groups. Geographic region influenced the use of alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous and respiratory system drugs. Conclusion While gestational age-dependent differences in neonatal drug use were expected, regional variations (except for systemic anti-infectives) indicate a need for cooperation in developing harmonized evidence-based guidelines and suggest priorities for collaborative work.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645830>: A Friend or Foe in ICU (A Case Report with Solution).</a></h2><p> or , also known as baker's yeast or brewer's yeast, is normally a nonpathogenic microbe.

However, there have not been but a few studies on the clinical benefits of oral probiotic therapy.  Dental records of 60 patients that were enrolled in an Institutional Review Board approved study were reviewed as to current caries activity status with measurement of the Decayed Missing Filled Teeth index and by Caries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) determination. The current oral health status was compared to the prior-to-study enrollment status and then analyzed in respect to published national norms. The data (without any identifiers) had a statistical analysis by a blinded biostatistician. The data was subjected to statistical analysis (Statsgraphic) before and after the probiotic therapy.  Of the 53 subjects available for follow up, only 4 had remained caries active with a grand total of 27 carious lesions being detected and subsequently restored in this group. Of the original total of 60 patients with 292 initial carious lesions, after probiotic therapy and dental restoration, 78 total restorations were placed in the subject group over the following three years. Approximately half of these restorations were required in teeth that had initially presented with smaller lesions and had been placed in a "watch" category. Two of the patients that developed further carious lesions had been randomly assigned to the probiotic PerioBalance, while the other two caries active patients were assigned EvoraKids probiotic. Of the original group of caries active patients, 24 did not present with any further carious involvement. Another 25 could be categorized as caries static, as the restorations required were substantially less than before probiotic therapy had been begun. The F-ratio, which in this case equals 51.3313, is a ratio of the between-group estimate to the within-group estimate. Since the P-value of the F-test is less than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the 4 variables at the 95.0% confidence level.

When used as a feed additive, they have the potential to minimize or abolish the use of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated the effect of the probiotic strain  TL on the growth performance and cecum microflora composition in Cobb 500 broiler chickens. In total, 180 broilers were randomly divided into three groups-each group comprised 4 pens, and each pen contained 15 chickens. The three groups were fed either a control diet, or a diet supplemented with either the antibiotic chlortetracycline or  TL. Broilers were weighed, and cecum contents were collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The broilers in both the antibiotic and probiotic groups exhibited significant weight gain compared with controls, exhibiting increases of 16.02% and 13.40%, respectively, after 35 days ( < 0.01). Similarly, the feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1-35 days) of broilers in the chlortetracycline and  TL groups was lower than that of the controls. HiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA of the cecal microbiota was performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The / ratio was higher in the chlortetracycline and  TL groups than in the control group on days 14, 21, and 35, and especially on day 21. The prevalence of genera , , , and  () was higher in the antibiotic and probiotic groups, while that of ,  (), and  was higher in the control group. In this study, the changes in the microbiota of the probiotic group were similar to those in the antibiotic group.

This progress has also emphasized the need for precision therapeutics, as it has underscored the dilemmas, such as dysbiosis and increasing antibiotic resistance, associated with current, broad-spectrum treatment modalities. Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease worldwide, accompanied by a tremendous financial and social burden, despite widespread and efficacious fluoride and hygienic regimens. Over the past several decades, various precision approaches to combat dental caries, including vaccines, , and antimicrobial compounds, have been pursued. Despite the distinct overall conceptual strengths of each approach, for various reasons, there are currently no approved precision antibiotic therapeutics to prevent dental caries. Specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) are synthetic molecules that combine the antibiotic moiety of a traditional antimicrobial peptide with a targeting domain to provide specificity against a particular organism. Conjoining the killing domain from the antimicrobial, novispirin G10, and a targeting domain derived from the  pheromone, CSP, the STAMP C16G2 was designed to provide targeted killing of , widely considered the keystone species in dental caries pathogenesis. C16G2 was able to selectively eliminate  from complex ecosystems while leaving closely related, yet health-associated, oral species unharmed. This remodeling of the dental plaque community is expected to have significant advantages compared to conventional broad-spectrum mouthwashes, as the intact, surviving community is apt to prevent reinfection by pathogens. Following successful phase I clinical trials that evaluated the safety and basic microbiology of C16G2 treatments, the phase II trials of several C16G2 formulations are currently in progress. C16G2 represents an exciting advance in precision therapeutics, and the STAMP platform provides vast opportunities for both the development of additional therapeutics and the overall study of microbial ecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682995>Inhibitory effects of Lactobacilli cocktail on HT-29 colon carcinoma cells growth and modulation of the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.</a></h2><p> could be considered as attractive candidates for preventing tumor growth through maintaining homeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of a cocktail of five Lactobacillus species on human colorectal carcinoma cell line HT-29. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of Lactobacilli cocktail were evaluated using MTT and flow cytometry tests, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the expression of several genes in the Notch (notch, hes1, msi1, and numb) and Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1 and CCND1) pathways, following the treatment of HT-29 cells with Lactobacilli cocktail. The treatment by Lactobacilli cocktail induced a significant anti-proliferative effect and late stage apoptosis among the cancer cells (p < 0.05). Compared to the untreated cells, Lactobacilli cocktail induced the down-regulation of notch, hes1, and msi1 genes and up-regulation of numb gene in the Notch pathway as well as the down-regulation of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lactobacilli cocktail was shown to have beneficial anti-tumor effects on HT-29 cells by modulating the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways; therefore, the use of Lactobacilli  as nutritional supplements may prevent the incidence of colon cancer.Copyright © 2019.

To explore the biological function of the porcine STC-1 gene, the effects of changes in stanniocalcin expression on cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function were studied. A vector overexpressing the STC-1 gene and an siRNA silencer of the STC-1 gene were transfected into porcine kidney epithelial PK15 cells. After the STC-1 gene expression level was induced to change, STC-1 protein- and mitochondrial function-related proteins such as PMP70, OPA, DRP, Mfn and STC-1-related acetylated protein were detected by Western blotting. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ATP were detected using flow cytometry methods. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the changes in mitochondrial structure and morphology. The results showed that overexpression of the STC-1 gene could significantly upregulate the levels of PMP70, OPA, DRP and Mfn. STC-1 gene expression, which could decrease the apoptosis rate and reactive oxygen species production to significantly increase the cell membrane potential and reduce the formation of intracellular ATP, which also affected the morphology and number of mitochondria. The results were reversed when the STC-1 gene expression was silenced. The results suggested that the porcine STC-1 gene is closely related to cell growth metabolism and mitochondrial function, which influence the mitochondrial function-related proteins. The present study is useful for further understanding STC-1 gene function and provides a theoretical basis for improving the production characteristics of domestic pigs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, fish health and antiviral response were also investigated. A 12-week feeding trial was conducted in a flow-through rearing system involving 6 weeks in freshwater and 6 weeks in seawater. Fish received a control and probiotic diet. The composition of the salmon gut bacterial communities was determined by high-throughput sequencing of digesta and mucosa samples from both the freshwater and seawater stage. The main phyla detected during both freshwater and seawater stages were , , , and . Significant differences were observed between the intestinal microbiota in the digesta and the mucosa. Both probiotic supplementation and the seawater transfer (SWT) had a substantial impact on the microbial communities, with most pronounced changes detected in the mucosal communities after SWT. This last finding together with a significantly higher antiviral response ( and  gene expression) in the distal intestine of fish fed the probiotic diet suggest a causal link between the microbiota modulation and activation of antiviral response. Feeding  during the freshwater stage did not significantly increase survival after infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) challenge after SWT, although higher survival was observed in one out of two replicate challenge tanks. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that both dietary probiotic supplementation and transfer from freshwater to seawater have an important role in modulating the bacterial communities in the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon. Furthermore, supplementation of the diet with  MA18/5M can modulate antiviral response.Copyright © 2019 Jaramillo-Torres, Rawling, Rodiles, Mikalsen, Johansen, Tinsley, Forberg, Aasum, Castex and Merrifield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632412>Bifidobacterial Dialogue With Its Human Host and Consequent Modulation of the Immune System.</a></h2><p>Since bifidobacteria are among the pioneering colonizers of the human infant gut, their interaction with their host is believed to start soon following birth. Several members of the  genus are purported to exert various health-promoting effects at local and systemic levels, e.g., limiting pathogen colonization/invasion, influencing gut homeostasis, and influencing the immune system through changes in innate and/or adaptive immune responses. This has promoted extensive research efforts to shed light on the precise mechanisms by which bifidobacteria are able to stimulate and interact with the host immune system. These studies uncovered a variety of secreted or surface-associated molecules that act as essential mediators for the establishment of a bifidobacteria-host immune system dialogue, and that allow interactions with mucosa-associated immune cells. Additionally, the by-products generated from bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism act as vectors that directly and indirectly trigger the host immune response, the latter by stimulating growth of other commensal microorganisms such as propionate- or butyrate-producing bacteria. This review is aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the wide variety of strategies employed by bifidobacteria to engage with the host immune system.Copyright © 2019 Alessandri, Ossiprandi, MacSharry, van Sinderen and Ventura.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648369>Review article: fungal alterations in inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Emerging data suggest that alterations in gut fungi may be associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In healthy individuals, gut commensal fungi act synergistically with other members of the microbiota to maintain homeostasis but their role in IBD is less clear.To review the role of gut fungi and their trans-kingdom interactions with bacteria in IBD METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Ovid and Pubmed to select relevant animal and human studies that have reported fungi and IBD.There is an increased total fungal load particularly of Candida and Malassezia species in the faeces and mucosa of Crohn's disease patients, and a lower fungal diversity in the faeces of ulcerative colitis patients. Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein (CARD)-9 polymorphism in Crohn's disease patients favours Malassezia colonisation that worsens gut inflammation. Diet high in carbohydrates increased the total abundance of Candida species, whereas protein-rich diet had the opposite effect. Anti-fungal therapies are mostly used to treat Candida albicans or Histoplasma capsulatum infections in IBD, whereas pilot studies of supplementing fungal  Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 strain showed therapeutic effects in IBD.Gut fungi are altered in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Modulation of the fungal microbiota can be considered as a therapeutic approach for IBD.

Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut microbiota and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients.

In order to contribute to the development of natural next-generation probiotic strains, the safety assessment was carried out with in vitro investigations of its morphology, potential virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance, and an in vivo acute toxicity study based on both healthy and immunosuppressed mice by cyclophosphamide injection. Consequently, the potential virulence genes in the genome of B. fragilis HCK-B3 have yet been identified as toxicity-associated. The absence of plasmids prevents the possibility of transferring antibiotic resistance features to other intestinal commensals.

The silencing of the pi class of GST (GSTP) that displayed the most characteristic expression profile in 13 kinds of cancer cell lines has shown significant impairment in the growth of cancer cells due to oxidative stress caused by excess ROS accumulation. Comparative proteomics between normal cells and GSTP-silenced pancreatic cancer cell PANC-1 suggested that GSTP-silencing facilitated the mitochondrial dysfunction.

Most diarrheal pathogens have developed resistance against the major classes of antibiotics commonly used for assuaging diarrheal symptoms. Antimicrobial resistance develops when pathogens acquire antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) through genetic recombination from commensals and pathogens. These are the constituents of the complex microbiota in all ecological niches. The recombination events may occur in the environment or in the gut. Containment of AMR can be achieved through a complete understanding of the complex and diverse structure and function of the microbiota. Its taxonomic entities serve as focal points for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. Molecular methods complemented with culture-based diagnostics have been historically implemented to document these natural events. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular epidemiology. It has revolutionized the method of addressing relevant problems like diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Metagenomics is one such next-generation technique that has proved to be a monumental advancement in the area of molecular taxonomy. Current understanding of structure, function and dysbiosis of microbiota associated with antimicrobial resistance was realized due to its conception.

Gut microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, including obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  refer to live microorganisms that confer health benefits on the host after administration in adequate amounts. Research on novel  related therapies has evoked much attention. In our previous study, both Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and LGG cell-free supernatant (LGGs) were found to protect against alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis; however, the effects of LGG and LGGs on cardiac tissues of obese mice exposed to IH have not been determined. Here we exposed high-fat high-fructose diet (HFHFD)-induced obese mice to IH, to establish a model of obesity with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Mice were divided into four groups: (1) HFHFD for 15 weeks; (2) HFHFD for 15 weeks with IH in the last 12 weeks (HFHFD/IH); (3) and (4) HFHFD/IH plus oral administration of either LGG (10 CFU bacteria/day) or LGGs (dose equivalent to 10 CFU bacteria/day) over the 15 weeks, respectively. Compared to HFHFD mice, HFHFD/IH-mice showed heart dysfunction with significant cardiac remodeling and inflammation; all these pathological and functional alterations were prevented by treatment with both LGG and LGGs (no significant difference between LGG and LGGs in this respect). The cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs against IH/HFHFD was associated with up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant pathways. Our findings suggest a cardioprotective effect of LGG and LGGs in obese mice with OSA.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637019>Demystifying the manipulation of host immunity, metabolism, and extraintestinal tumors by the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>The trillions of microorganisms in the gut microbiome have attracted much attention recently owing to their sophisticated and widespread impacts on numerous aspects of host pathophysiology. Remarkable progress in large-scale sequencing and mass spectrometry has increased our understanding of the influence of the microbiome and/or its metabolites on the onset and progression of extraintestinal cancers and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Given the plasticity in microbial composition and function, microbial-based therapeutic interventions, including dietary modulation, prebiotics, and , as well as fecal microbial transplantation, potentially permit the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy to improve clinical outcomes. Herein, we summarize the latest evidence on the involvement of the gut microbiome in host immunity and metabolism, the effects of the microbiome on extraintestinal cancers and the immune response, and strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, and we discuss ongoing studies and future areas of research that deserve focused research efforts.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688358> and human lactational mastitis: a scoping review protocol.</a></h2><p>The objective of this scoping review is to identify and examine the evidence on probiotic consumption and its effect on human lactational mastitis.Lactational mastitis is a painful, inflammatory condition of the breast tissue commonly occurring among breastfeeding women.

Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with 5 effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization. The regulation mechanism of serotonin by Bifidobacterium animalis F1-7 was revealed by RT-PCR and the results show that this most effective strain promotes intestinal peristalsis in zebrafish via the modulation of serotonin release and key genes for serotonin synthesis in zebrafish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639419>Letter to the editor on 'Primary prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection with combination '.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664483>Relationship between gut microbiota, , and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is constantly increasing, and it has become a major concern, with several implications for public health, economy, and social well-being.

In recent years, many changes in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microflora have been reported in colorectal cancer, suggesting the involvement of the intestinal microflora in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Along with these reports, research on lactic acid bacteria that have a beneficial effect on the human body for the purpose of improving the intestinal environment and treating intestinal diseases has advanced. Among these studies, biogenics (defined as a component derived from lactic acid bacteria that acts directly on diseases regardless of the state of intestinal microflora) is a recent concept derived from the work on . Based on this concept, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of various components derived from lactic acid bacteria in the treatment to diseases from and apply them in prevention and treatment. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of an extract obtained from  strain 06CC2 on colorectal cancer cells. In in vitro experiments, the extract derived from  06CC2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of Caco2 colorectal cancer cells in comparison to control and non-cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that endoplasmic reticulum stress and the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling system are involved in the induction of apoptosis.

There are no basic criteria regarding differentiation of early-onset sepsis (EOS) versus late-onset sepsis (LOS). Stratification used in studies on neonatal sepsis also rarely includes the general condition of the newborn according to unambiguous assessment at birth, which hampers the establishment of a clear, uniform epidemiological description of neonatal sepsis. We aim to review the published data about the epidemiology and microbiology of sepsis in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Data was also collected on sepsis prevention programs that can be implemented in neonatal units. The outcomes of interest were incidence or incidence density of EOS and LOS, microbiology of EOS and LOS, and data on the methodology of the research, in particular the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of newborns from the study. Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used. For the preselection step, inclusion criteria included: "bloodstream infection" or "neonatal sepsis" (MesH), "very low birth weight", and "country" full-text studies, human, and English language. Exclusion criteria included: studies published in languages other than English and studies available only as an abstracts. For proper selection, inclusion criteria included: information about epidemiology or microbiology bloodstream infection (BSI), study population and case definitions, exclusion criteria, narrative reviews, commentaries, case studies, pilot studies, study protocols, pediatric studies, and only clinical data (without microbiology or epidemiology) or studies with only one etiological factor analysis. The data review indicated the lack of an unequivocal, unified definition and no unambiguous basic criteria with regard to differentiation of EOS versus LOS. Among infants <1500 g, studies reported an EOS rate from 7% to 2%. For studies using other definitions (mostly all inborn babies), the rate of EOS ranged from 1% to 3%. The LOS incidences were much more varied among countries; the highest rates were in the multicenter studies focused on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The main pathogens in EOS are GBS and Gram-negative bacteria in LOS. Our review data shows that LOS microbiology is very diverse and that Gram-positive cocci, especially staphylococci, predominate versus Gram-negative rods. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform, international prevention programs results in high newborn morbidity and insufficient postnatal prevention of late-onset infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647500>Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis.</a></h2><p>Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated.To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors.This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1 445 850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

This review covers the current concepts of the etiology of Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis by focusing on an unbalanced interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal barrier. Understanding these issues is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies aiming at the disease cause.: Gut microbiota alterations and a dysfunctional intestinal mucosa are associated with IBD. Here we focus on specific defense structures of the mucosal barrier, namely antimicrobial peptides and the mucus layer, which keep the gut microbiota at a distance under healthy conditions and are defective in IBD.: The microbiology of both forms of IBD is different but characterized by a reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Abundance of certain bacterial species is altered, and the compositional changes are related to disease activity. In IBD the mucus layer above the epithelium is contaminated by bacteria and the immune reaction is dominated by the antibacterial response. Human genetics suggest that many of the basic deficiencies in the mucosal response, due to Paneth cell, defensin and mucus defects, are primary. Nutrition may also be important but so far there is no therapy targeting the mucosal barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677414>Lactobacillus casei DBN023 protects against jejunal mucosal injury in chicks infected with Salmonella pullorum CMCC-533.</a></h2><p>Pullorum disease is one of the most serious poultry diseases. Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly applied in actual production, but the emergence of drug-resistant strains and drug residues threatens the health of animals and humans. The use of  has become a potential solution for the aforementioned problem. In this study, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus casei DBN023 (CGMCC-16146) on the intestinal tissue structure and immune functions of the jejunal epithelium in chicks infected with Salmonella pullorum CMCC-533 using histomorphological and immunological methods. A total of 450 newborn chicks were randomly divided into the control group and experimental groups. We used hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to observe the structure of the jejunal mucosa and analyze changes in cytokine and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels. The results showed that prophylactic feeding of L. casei DBN023 to chicks significantly increased their jejunum villar height, villar height-to-crypt-depth (V/C) ratio, and muscle thickness; reduced intestinal-crypt depth; and increased the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) level compared with S. pullorum infection. L. casei DBN023 enhances intestinal mucosal immunity, regulates cytokine balance, enhances intestinal immune function, and effectively reduces intestinal inflammation. Thus, it protects intestinal tissues and reduces S. pullorum CMCC-533 damage to the intestinal tract.Copyright © 2019.

We found that rats administered  SC06 showed more significant intestinal tissue repair and antioxidant properties than those administered SC08, which suggests a strain-specific effect of . Moreover, SC06 alleviated apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3. Further investigations revealed that SC06 triggered autophagy, indicated by the upregulation of LC3 and Beclin1 and the degradation of p62 in rat jejunum and IEC-6 cells. Preincubation with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly aggravated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptotic cell formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), not AKT (alpha serine/threonine kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), was involved in SC06-induced autophagy. Taken together,  SC06 can alleviate oxidative stress-induced disorders and apoptosis via p38-mediated autophagy. The above findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of  as functional food and provide a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of oxidative damages.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Wang, Xu, Tang, Li, Gong, Wang and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681193>The Effect of  on Gut Microbiota, Immune Response and Intestinal Barrier Function During the Development of Necrotic Enteritis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) causes huge economic losses to the poultry industry.  are used as potential alternatives to antibiotics to prevent NE. It is known that  can act as a probiotic that can prevent infection. However, whether or not it exerts a beneficial effect on NE in chickens remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal microbiota during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa barrier-related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal microbiota in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602305>Effects of dietary mixture of protease and  on growth performance, blood constituents, and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary mixture of protease and  on growth performance, blood constituents, and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs.

In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of . Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of  on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity, inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to  supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664902>Analysis of the fecal microbiota of fast- and slow-growing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Diverse microbial communities colonizing the intestine of fish contribute to their growth, digestion, nutrition, and immune function. We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of  that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611620>Isolation, characterization and identification of antigenotoxic and anticancerous indigenous  and their prophylactic potential in experimental colon carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer, the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, is a lifestyle disease where diet and gut microbiome contribute intricately in its initiation and progression. Prophylactic bio-interventions mainly  offer an alternate approach towards reducing or delaying its progression. Therefore, the present study was designed wherein a robust protocol for the isolation, characterization, and identification of indigenous  having antigenotoxic and anticancerous activity was followed along with their prophylactic potential assessment in early experimental colorectal carcinogenesis. Among forty-six isolated lactic acid bacterial strains, only three were selected on the basis of antigenotoxicity against N,N-Dimethyl dihydrazine dihydrochloride and 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide and probiotic attributes. All three selected probiotic strains exhibited anticancerous potential as is evident by the reduced Aberrant Crypt Foci, reduced fecal pH, enhanced fecal lactic acid bacteria and altered fecal enzymes (β-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, β-glucosidase) that modulated gut microbiota and microenvironment resulting into restored histoarchitecture of the colon. The results are a clear indicator of the prophylactic potential of selected indigenous  which may be used as an alternative prophylactic biological therapy against colon carcinogenesis particularly in highly susceptible individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671881>Shift of Aromatic Profile in Probiotic Hemp Drink Formulations: A Metabolomic Approach.</a></h2><p>Vegetal drinks as a substitute for milk consumption are raising striking interest in the food industry. Soy and rice drinks are the most successful milk substitutes but are low in protein and fiber contents, are rich in sugars, and their cultivation systems are unsustainable; thus, alternative vegetal sources to resolve these limits must be found. A winning candidate could be hemp seed, which is a powerhouse of nutrients, is sugarless, rich in fiber and proteins, and little land and nutrients demanding. The aim is to develop novel drinks obtained from hemp seeds mixed or not with soy and rice and fermented with  (,  and ). The drinks were characterized for their microbial growth, by means of culture-dependent and -independent techniques, and for their volatilome, by means of solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis. The results showed that hemp seed drinks have a specific aroma and its compounds are dependent on the type of formulation and to the probiotic used. For example, in hemp seed drinks, 2-heptanol, 2-methyl, 2,4-decadienal, 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy, 2,3-butanedione, and propanoic acid were fine descriptors of  fermentations Multivariate analysis of volatile metabolites and their correlation to some physiological parameters and nutritional values offered a novel approach to assess the quality of functional hemp drinks which could result in a decisional tool for industrial applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602728>A polyphasic approach to characterize Weissella cibaria and Weissella confusa strains.</a></h2><p>To study Weissella cibaria and Weissella confusa strains, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) members naturally present in food products, but not yet included in Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) list of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).We carried out a comparative genome analysis of 23 sequenced W. cibaria and 7 W. confusa genomes, in parallel with a physiological and functional characterization of several strains previously isolated from sourdough-like maize bran fermentation. The genome analysis revealed the absence of dedicated pathogenicity factors. Some putative virulence genes found in Weissella genomes were also present in other LAB strains, considered safe by EFSA and commonly used as . The physiological tests carried out on our strains corroborated the genomic results. Moreover, the following functional traits of interest to application in the food sector were identified: the majority of tested strains displayed high acidification rate, high reducing ability, production of exopolysaccharides (EPS), arabinoxylan degradation ability, growth in the presence of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), bile and gastric juice tolerance, and antifungal activity.These results provide evidence for the possible use of selected strains of W. cibaria and W. confusa in the food sector.This polyphasic study adds to the body of knowledge on the functional and applicable characteristics of these controversial species of LAB. This knowledge contributes to design new selected cultures included in the QPS list required for food applications.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655880>Amelioration of TMAO through  and its potential role in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide. It is associated with hyperlipidemia and inflammation, and become chronic by triggering metabolites in different metabolic pathways. Disturbance in the human gut microbiota is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut microbiota into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases. The present review focus on advances in TMAO preventing strategies through , including, modulation of gut microbiome, metabolomics profile, miRNA, or probiotic antagonistic abilities.
