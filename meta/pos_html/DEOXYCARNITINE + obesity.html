<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27112275>The impact of altered carnitine availability on acylcarnitine metabolism, energy expenditure and glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Acylcarnitines are fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates, which have been implicated in diet-induced insulin resistance. Elevated acylcarnitine levels are found in obese, insulin resistant humans and rodents, and coincide with lower free carnitine. We hypothesized that increasing free carnitine levels by administration of the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) could facilitate FAO, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.C57BL/6N mice were fed with a high fat or chow diet with or without γBB supplementation (n=10 per group). After 8weeks of diet, indirect calorimetry, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were performed. AC profiles and carnitine biosynthesis intermediates were analyzed in plasma and tissues by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography tandem MS.γBB supplementation did not facilitate FAO, was unable to curb bodyweight and did not prevent impaired glucose homeostasis in the HFD fed mice in spite of marked alterations in the acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver. Remarkably, γBB did not affect the acylcarnitine profile in other tissues, most notably muscle. Administration of a bolus acetylcarnitine also caused significant changes in plasma and liver, but not in muscle acylcarnitine profiles, again without effect on glucose tolerance.Altogether, increasing carnitine availability affects acylcarnitine profiles in plasma and liver but does not modulate glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. This may be due to the lack of an effect on muscle acylcarnitine profiles, as muscle tissue is an important contributor to whole body insulin sensitivity. These results warrant caution on making associations between plasma acylcarnitine levels and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the microbiota-dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in . Given the proposed contribution of microbiota alterations in  and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of , lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its microbiota-dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not microbiota dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk. Prospective studies of gut microbiota composition and related metabolites in relation to long-term cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993177>Diets high in resistant starch increase plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, a gut microbiome metabolite associated with CVD risk.</a></h2><p>Production of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a biomarker of CVD risk, is dependent on intestinal microbiota, but little is known of dietary conditions promoting changes in gut microbial communities. Resistant starches (RS) alter the human microbiota. We sought to determine whether diets varying in RS and carbohydrate (CHO) content affect plasma TMAO levels. We also assessed postprandial glucose and insulin responses and plasma lipid changes to diets high and low in RS. In a cross-over trial, fifty-two men and women consumed a 2-week baseline diet (41 percentage of energy (%E) CHO, 40 % fat, 19 % protein), followed by 2-week high- and low-RS diets separated by 2-week washouts. RS diets were assigned at random within the context of higher (51-53 %E) v. lower CHO (39-40 %E) intake. Measurements were obtained in the fasting state and, for glucose and insulin, during a meal test matching the composition of the assigned diet. With lower CHO intake, plasma TMAO, carnitine, betaine and γ-butyrobetaine concentrations were higher after the high- v. low-RS diet (P<0·01 each). These metabolites were not differentially affected by high v. low RS when CHO intake was high. Although the high-RS meal reduced postprandial insulin and glucose responses when CHO intake was low (P<0·01 each), RS did not affect fasting lipids, lipoproteins, glucose or insulin irrespective of dietary CHO content. In conclusion, a lower-CHO diet high in RS was associated with higher plasma TMAO levels. These findings, together with the absence of change in fasting lipids, suggest that short-term high-RS diets do not improve markers of cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925775>Inulin Supplementation Does Not Reduce Plasma Trimethylamine -Oxide Concentrations in Individuals at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Prebiotic supplementation has been purported to reduce TMAO production, but whether prebiotics reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO levels is unclear. Sedentary, overweight/obese adults at risk for T2DM ( = 18) were randomized to consume a standardized diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat) with 10 g/day of either an inulin supplement or maltodextrin placebo for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained in the fasting state and hourly during a 4-h high-fat challenge meal (820 kcal; 25% carbohydrate, 63% fat; 317.4 mg choline, 62.5 mg betaine, 8.1 mg l-carnitine) before and after the diet. Plasma TMAO and trimethylamine (TMA) moieties (choline, l-carnitine, betaine, and &gamma;-butyrobetaine) were measured using isocratic ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). There were no differences in fasting or postprandial TMAO or TMA moieties between the inulin and placebo groups at baseline (all  > 0.05). There were no significant changes in fasting or postprandial plasma TMAO or TMA moiety concentrations following inulin or placebo. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation for 6 weeks did not reduce fasting or postprandial TMAO in individuals at risk for T2DM. Future studies are needed to identify efficacious interventions that reduce plasma TMAO concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325058>Serum Carnitine Metabolites and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Patients With Suspected Stable Angina Pectoris.</a></h2><p>Carnitine and its metabolites are centrally involved in fatty acid metabolism. Although elevated circulating concentrations have been observed in  and insulin resistance, prospective studies examining whether these metabolites are associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are sparse.We performed a comprehensive evaluation of metabolites along the carnitine pathway relative to incident T2D.A total of 2519 patients (73.1% men) with coronary artery disease, but without T2D, were followed for median 7.7 years until the end of 2009, during which 173 (6.9%) new cases of T2D were identified. Serum levels of free carnitine, its precursors trimethyllysine (TML) and γ-butyrobetaine, and the esters acetyl-, propionyl-, (iso)valeryl-, octanoyl-, and palmitoylcarnitine were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Risk associations were explored by logistic regression and reported per (log-transformed) standard deviation increment.Median age at inclusion was 62 years and median body mass index (BMI) 26.0 kg/m2. In models adjusted for age, sex, fasting status, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glycated hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and study center, serum levels of TML and palmitoylcarnitine associated positively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.22 (1.04 to 1.43) and 1.24 (1.04 to 1.49), respectively], whereas γ-butyrobetaine associated negatively [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.81 (0.66 to 0.98)] with T2D risk.Serum levels of TML, γ-butyrobetaine, and the long-chained palmitoylcarnitine predict long-term risk of T2D independently of traditional risk factors, possibly reflecting dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism in patients susceptible to T2D development.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730694>Acylcarnitines as markers of exercise-associated fuel partitioning, xenometabolism, and potential signals to muscle afferent neurons.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Does improved metabolic health and insulin sensitivity following a weight-loss and fitness intervention in sedentary, obese women alter exercise-associated fuel metabolism and incomplete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), as tracked by blood acylcarnitine patterns? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite improved fitness and blood sugar control, indices of incomplete mitochondrial FAO increased in a similar manner in response to a fixed load acute exercise bout; this indicates that intramitochondrial muscle FAO is inherently inefficient and is tethered directly to ATP turnover. With insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes mellitus, mismatches between mitochondrial fatty acid fuel delivery and oxidative phosphorylation/tricarboxylic acid cycle activity may contribute to inordinate accumulation of short- or medium-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid derivatives [markers of incomplete long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO)]. We reasoned that incomplete FAO in muscle would be ameliorated concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity and fitness following a ∼14 week training and weight-loss intervention in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women. Contrary to this hypothesis, overnight-fasted and exercise-induced plasma C4-C14 acylcarnitines did not differ between pre- and postintervention phases. These metabolites all increased robustly with exercise (∼45% of pre-intervention peak oxygen consumption) and decreased during a 20 min cool-down. This supports the idea that, regardless of insulin sensitivity and fitness, intramitochondrial muscle β-oxidation and attendant incomplete FAO are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate. Acute exercise also led to branched-chain amino acid acylcarnitine derivative patterns suggestive of rapid and transient diminution of branched-chain amino acid flux through the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. We confirmed our prior novel observation that a weight-loss/fitness intervention alters plasma xenometabolites [i.e. cis-3,4-methylene-heptanoylcarnitine and γ-butyrobetaine (a co-metabolite possibly derived in part from gut bacteria)], suggesting that host metabolic health regulated gut microbe metabolism. Finally, we considered whether acylcarnitine metabolites signal to muscle-innervating afferents; palmitoylcarnitine at concentrations as low as 1-10 μm activated a subset (∼2.5-5%) of these neurons ex vivo. This supports the hypothesis that in addition to tracking exercise-associated shifts in fuel metabolism, muscle acylcarnitines act as signals of exertion to short-loop somatosensory-motor circuits or to the brain.© 2016 The Authors.

However, existing methods of assessing dietary intake in nutritional epidemiology rely on food frequency questionnaires or dietary records that are prone to bias and selective reporting. Herein, metabolic phenotyping was performed on 42 healthy participants from the Diet and Gene Intervention (DIGEST) pilot study, a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial that provided complete diets to all participants. Matching single-spot urine and fasting plasma specimens were collected at baseline, and then following two weeks of either a Prudent or Western diet with a weight-maintaining menu plan designed by a dietician. Targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary analytical platforms, where 80 plasma metabolites and 84 creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites were reliably measured (CV < 30%) in the majority of participants (>75%) after implementing a rigorous data workflow for metabolite authentication with stringent quality control. We classified a panel of metabolites with distinctive trajectories following two weeks of food provisions when using complementary univariate and multivariate statistical models. Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high-resolution MS/MS, as well as co-elution after spiking with authentic standards if available. Overall, 3-methylhistidine and proline betaine concentrations increased in both plasma and urine samples after participants were assigned a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in the Western diet group. Similarly, creatinine-normalized urinary imidazole propionate, hydroxypipecolic acid, dihydroxybenzoic acid, and enterolactone glucuronide, as well as plasma ketoleucine and ketovaline increased with a Prudent diet ( < 0.05) after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. In contrast, plasma myristic acid, linoelaidic acid, linoleic acid, α-linoleic acid, pentadecanoic acid, alanine, proline, carnitine, and , as well as urinary acesulfame K increased among participants following a Western diet. Most metabolites were also correlated ( > ± 0.30,  < 0.05) to changes in the average intake of specific nutrients from self-reported diet records reflecting good adherence to assigned food provisions. Our study revealed robust biomarkers sensitive to short-term changes in habitual diet, which is needed for accurate monitoring of healthy eating patterns in free-living populations, and evidence-based public health policies for chronic disease prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288431>Metabolic Perturbations from Step Reduction in Older Persons at Risk for Sarcopenia: Plasma Biomarkers of Abrupt Changes in Physical Activity.</a></h2><p>Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function, which may be accelerated during periods of physical inactivity. Declines in skeletal muscle and functionality not only impacts mobility but also increases chronic disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to measure adaptive metabolic responses to acute changes in habitual activity in a cohort of overweight, pre-diabetic older adults (age = 69 ± 4 years; BMI = 27 ± 4 kg/m,  = 17) when using non-targeted metabolite profiling by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Participants completed two weeks of step reduction (<1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.30), as well as methionine and  ( < 0.05; effect size ≈ 0.20) as compared to baseline. Similarly, decreases in uremic toxins in plasma that promote muscle inflammation, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, as well as oxoproline, a precursor used for intramuscular glutathione recycling, were also associated with physical inactivity ( < 0.05; effect size > 0.20). Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period. These plasma biomarkers may enable early detection of inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation in older persons at risk for sarcopenia not readily measured by current imaging techniques or muscle function tests, which is required for the design of therapeutic interventions to counter these deleterious changes in support of healthy ageing.</p></html>
