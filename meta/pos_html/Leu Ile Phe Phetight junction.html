The results showed that QIGLF could be absorbed intact through Caco-2 cell monolayers with a P value of (9.11 ± 0.19) × 10 cm/s (transport kinetic parameters: K, 32.37 ± 12.59 mM; V, 1.23 ± 0.49 μM/min cm). The transport was not significantly decreased by sodium azide and Gly-Pro, an ATP synthesis inhibitor and a peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) substrate, respectively, suggesting that transport of QIGLF was not energy-dependent and carrier-mediated. In addition, wortmannin, a transcytosis inhibitor, had little effect on the transport, suggesting that endocytosis was not involved in the transport of QIGLF. However, the transport of QIGLF was increased significantly in the presence of cytochalasin D, a   disruptor, suggesting that paracellular transport via  junctions was the major transport mechanism for intact QIGLF across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Moreover, QIGLF was added to Caco-2 cells followed by addition of HO, and exhibited significant cytoprotective effect in Caco-2 cells against oxidative stress induced by HO.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478310>Claudin-3 and claudin-5 protein folding and assembly into the   are controlled by non-conserved residues in the transmembrane 3 (TM3) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) segments.</a></h1><p>The mechanism of   (TJ) assembly and the structure of claudins (Cldn) that form the TJ strands are unclear. This limits the molecular understanding of paracellular barriers and strategies for drug delivery across tissue barriers. Cldn3 and Cldn5 are both common in the blood-brain barrier but form TJ strands with different ultrastructures. To identify the molecular determinants of folding and assembly of these classic claudins, Cldn3/Cldn5 chimeric mutants were generated and analyzed by cellular reconstitution of TJ strands, live cell confocal imaging, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. A comprehensive screening was performed on the basis of the rescue of mutants deficient for strand formation. Cldn3/Cldn5 residues in transmembrane segment 3, TM3 (Ala-127/Cys-128, Ser-136/Cys-137, Ser-138/-139), and the transition of TM3 to extracellular loop 2, ECL2 (Thr-141/-142) and ECL2 (Asn-148/Asp-149, -150/Thr-151, Arg-157/Tyr-158), were identified to be involved in claudin folding and/or assembly. Blue native PAGE and FRET assays revealed 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-resistant cis-dimerization for Cldn5 but not for Cldn3. This homophilic interaction was found to be stabilized by residues in TM3. The resulting subtype-specific cis-dimer is suggested to be a subunit of polymeric TJ strands and contributes to the specific ultrastructure of the TJ detected by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In particular, the Cldn5-like exoplasmic face-associated and particle-type strands were found to be related to cis-dimerization. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms of paracellular barrier formation by demonstrating that defined non-conserved residues in TM3 and ECL2 of classic claudins contribute to the formation of TJ strands with differing ultrastructures.</p></html>
