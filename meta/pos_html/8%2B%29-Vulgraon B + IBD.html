Herein lies the importance of nanotechnology having a wide range of applications in the field of nano-medicine, particularly in drug delivery systems. The exclusive properties particularly small size and high surface area (which can be modified as required), exhibited by these nanoparticlesrender these structures more suitable for the purpose of drug delivery. Various nanostructures, like liposomes, dendrimers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. have been designed for the said purpose. These nanostructures have several advantages over traditional administration of medicine. Apart from overcoming the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics limitations of many potential therapeutic molecules, they may also be useful for advanced drug delivery purposes like targeted drug delivery, controlled release, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In this review, we attempt to describe an up-to-date knowledge on various strategically devised nanostructures to overcome the problems related to oral drug administration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905222>Long-term evolution of direct healthcare costs for inflammatory bowel diseases: a population-based study (2006-2015).</a></h2><p> We explored the long-term evolution of direct healthcare costs for inflammatory bowel diseases () using a population-level database in a country with an escalating burden of .  We searched the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Claims, which covers more than 97% of the South Korean population. An  diagnosis was defined as the combination of a billing code for Crohn's disease (CD: K50.xx) or ulcerative colitis (UC: K51.xx) and at least one claim for -specific drugs. Between 2006 and 2015, a total of 59,447 patients (CD: 17,677; UC: 41,770) were included.  The total and mean cost per capita increased significantly over time. In the last year of the study (2015), the cost for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy accounted for 68.8% (CD) and 48.8% (UC) of the total cost. Age at diagnosis (<20 years vs. ≥30 years) and anti-TNF use were independent predictors of increased total  cost. Anti-TNF therapy was the strongest predictor of high-cost outliers (designated as the top 20 percentile of the total costs) for  (OR: 160.4; 95% CI: 89.0-289.2). The mean cost among patients with newly diagnosed CD increased significantly over the 8-year follow-up period ( = .03), while costs associated with UC remained stable. Only medication costs increased significantly during the follow-up period for CD.  Over the past 10 years, the increased usage of anti-TNF agents has been the key driver of -related healthcare costs. Long-term cost-cutting strategies for patients with CD are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732524>Promoter orientation of the immunomodulatory  capsular polysaccharide A (PSA) is off in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease ().</a></h2><p> is a member of the normal microbiota of the lower gastrointestinal tract, but some strains produce the putative tumourigenic  toxin (BFT). In addition,  can produce multiple capsular polysaccharides that comprise a microcapsule layer, including an immunomodulatory, zwitterionic, polysaccharide A (PSA) capable of stimulating anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. It is known that the PSA promoter can undergo inversion, thereby regulating the expression of PSA. A PCR digestion technique was used to investigate  capsular PSA promoter orientation using human samples for the first time. It was found that approximately half of the  population in a healthy patient population had PSA orientated in the 'ON' position. However, individuals with inflammatory bowel disease () had a significantly lower percentage of the  population with PSA orientated 'ON' in comparison with the other patient cohorts studied. Similarly, the putative tumourigenic positive  populations were significantly associated with a lower proportion of the PSA promoter orientated 'ON'. These results suggest that the proportion of the  population with the PSA promoter 'ON' may be an indicator of gastrointestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h2><p> (inflammatory bowel disease) is a chronic, non-specific, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that mainly consists of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced  model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease colitis severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice. These results suggest that IL-10 production by ManLAM-treated  cells contributes to keeping the balance between CD4 T cell subsets and protect mice from DSS-induced .© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30817579>Therapeutic strategies of thromboembolic events in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases: Two case reports.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammatory condition and immunological abnormalities, which probably develop into venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). VTE in  patients mostly occurs at deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The complications are extremely important in clinical practice considering the high mortality rate. Hence, an early diagnosis of  and the control of complications play an important role in therapy of thromboembolic events (TEEs).Case 1 was a 31-year-old man with chronic UC who presented with signs of thromboembolism. Case 2 was a 43-year-old woman with CD complicated by fistulas.Computed tomography (CT) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the patient (case 1) suggested a thrombus in cerebral vein. The patient (case 2) developed acute ischemia of her right arm;  ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the distal of the right subclavian artery accompanied by stenosis.To lower blood viscosity and overcome the risk of deep thrombosis, the patient (case 1) was treated with a combination of low-molecular-weight heparin and dextran as anticoagulation.

IBDV outbreaks occasionally occur due to the presence of very virulent, reassortment or variant strains. Vaccine immunization has played crucial roles in  control for decades. However, survival pressure of IBDV from the vaccine immunization also increases the reassortments of circulating viruses. In this study, an IBDV strain was isolated from several broiler farms in Henan Province, central part of China, and named IBDV HN strain. Based on the results of RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenic analyses of VP1 and VP2 genes, the IBDV HN strain is a novel reassortment strain in the Henan region. Segment A of this strain appears to originate from the very virulent IBDV strain, while segment  comes from the other field reassortment strains. This may be the result of natural reassortant of virus circulating in the field. About 60% (6/10) of experimentally infected specific pathogen-free chickens died after 3 to 5 d post-infection with typical symptom and pathological lesions. The IBDV HN strain was prone to horizontal transmission, which poses a serious threat to the chicken industry.

Its exact pathogenesis has not been elucidated. Curcumin, as an herbal drug, has been used in the treatment of  due to its immunoregulation. Autophagy has been reported to play an important role in the mechanism of . In the present study, we focused on the autophagic regulation role of curcumin in the murine model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.We investigated the effects of curcumin on the progress of DSS-induced acute colitis in mice by evaluating the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological score. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein expression of autophagy-related key genes from colon tissues comprising autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC-3II), beclin-1, and  cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-10, and IL-17A, was examined. Autophagosome was also examined under transmission electron microscopy.Both DAI and histopathological score increased in mice with DSS-induced colitis and obviously decreased after curcumin intervention. The expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, ATG5, LC-3II, and beclin-1 were significantly higher in mice with colitis than in normal ones, whereas those of IL-10 and bcl-2 decreased accordingly. However, curcumin intervention adjusted the expression level of those factors toward normal level. The number of autophagosome in the colon epithelia increased after DSS stimulation and decreased after curcumin administration.Curcumin could prevent the development of DSS-induced colitis through the inhibition of excessive autophagy and regulation of following cytokine networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669641>Crohn's Disease Patients in Remission Display an Enhanced Intestinal IgM⁺  Cell Count in Concert with a Strong Activation of the Intestinal Complement System.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is an umbrella term that comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both entities are characterized by a disturbed mucosal immune response and an imbalance of intestinal microbiota composition. The complement system (C) plays a critical role in the detection, and clearance of bacteria and dysregulation of single complement components has been linked to . Here, we asked if the C contributes to distinct subtypes of inflammation observed in CD and UC. We performed systematical expression analyses of the intestinal C in  patients and controls. Immunohistochemistry or immunoblot experiments were performed to verify qPCR data. Activity of the three activation pathways of C was studied in sera samples. In CD patients a strong upregulation of the C was observed enabling the definition of unique expression patterns being associated either with remission or active disease. These data were reflected by an enhanced C activation in sera and fecal samples. An excessive mucosal presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and CR2/CD21 positive  cells in concert with decreased fecal IgA level was identified in CD patients in remission. These findings point to an exacerbated induction of the intestinal C that may potentially be involved in the etiology of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606251>Host immunoglobulin G selectively identifies pathobionts in pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () are a group of complex and multifactorial disorders with unknown etiology. Chronic intestinal inflammation develops against resident intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible hosts. We hypothesized that host intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) G can be used to identify bacteria involved in  pathogenesis.IgG-bound and -unbound microorganisms were collected from 32 pediatric terminal ileum aspirate washes during colonoscopy [non- (n = 10), Crohn disease (n = 15), and ulcerative colitis (n = 7)], and composition was assessed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. In vitro analysis of invasive capacity was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and gentamicin invasion assay; immune activation was measured by qPCR. Despite considerable inter-individual variations, IgG binding favored specific and unique mucosa-associated species in pediatric  patients. Burkholderia cepacia, Flavonifractor plautii, and Rumminococcus sp. demonstrated increased IgG binding, while Pseudomonas ST29 demonstrated reduced IgG binding, in . In vitro validation confirmed that . cepacia, F. plautii, and Rumminococcus display invasive potential while Pseudomonas protogens did not.Using IgG as a marker of pathobionts in larger patient cohorts to identify microbes and elucidate their role in  pathogenesis will potentially underpin new strategies to facilitate development of novel, targeted diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches.

Herein, we compared simultaneously analyzed blood transcriptomes from patients with PBC, PSC, and . Microarray-based measurements were conducted using RNA isolated from whole blood samples from 90, 45, 95 and 93 patients with PBC, PSC, CD, and UC, respectively, and 47 healthy controls. Expression levels of selected transcripts were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcribed PCR using an independent cohort of 292, 71 and 727 patients with PBC, PSC, and , respectively. Of 4026, 2650 and 4967 probe sets differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.05) in samples from patients with PBC, PSC, and , respectively, compared with healthy controls, 1946 were common to all three comparisons. Functional analyses indicated that most terms enriched for genes differentially expressed in PBC, PSC, and  patients compared with healthy controls were related to mitochondrial function, the vesicle endomembrane system, and GTPase-mediated processes. This study indicates that microarray-based profiling of blood gene expression supports research into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease, rather than being useful for selection of diagnostic biomarkers for use in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791845>Vitamin A and inflammatory bowel diseases: from cellular studies and animal models to human disease.</a></h2><p>Vitamin A (VA) and metabolites such as Retinoic Acid (RA) and all-trans-RA (at-RA) are crucial in the modulation of the immune system and may be determinative in the balance of the immune responses.

We have previously found that anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies act through Fcγ-receptor (FcγR) signalling to promote repolarisation of proinflammatory intestinal macrophages to a CD206+ regulatory phenotype. The role of IL-10 in anti-TNF-induced macrophage repolarisation has not been examined.We used human peripheral blood monocytes and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages to study IL-10 production and CD206+ regulatory macrophage differentiation. To determine whether the efficacy of anti-TNF was dependent on IL-10 signalling in vivo and in which cell type, we used the CD4+CD45Rb T-cell transfer model in combination with several genetic mouse models.Anti-TNF therapy increased macrophage IL-10 production in an FcγR-dependent manner, which caused differentiation of macrophages to a more regulatory CD206+ phenotype in vitro. Pharmacological blockade of IL-10 signalling prevented the induction of these CD206+ regulatory macrophages and diminished the therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in the CD4+CD45Rb T-cell transfer model of . Using cell type-specific IL-10 receptor mutant mice, we found that IL-10 signalling in macrophages but not T cells was critical for the induction of CD206+ regulatory macrophages and therapeutic response to anti-TNF.The therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNF in resolving intestinal inflammation is critically dependent on IL-10 signalling in macrophages.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Our aim, therefore, was to determine clinical and genetic variables that contribute to lower bone mineral density (BMD) in  patients.A cross-sectional study of  patients treated in a tertiary referral center was performed. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected, and genetic testing for the common mutations in Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein (NOD)2 was performed. We examined correlations between the different variables and BMD in the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine.Eighty-nine patients (49% males, 67 Crohn's disease [CD]) participated in the study. 42Forty-two (63%) of the CD and 13 (59%) of the ulcerative colitis patients met the criteria for osteoporosis/osteopenia. Factors associated with lower Z scores were low body mass index (BMI; r = -0.307, p = 0.005), use of glucocorticoids (likelihood ratio [LR] 5.1, p = 0.028), and a trend for male gender (LR = 3.4, p = 0.079). Among CD patients, low bone density showed borderline significance for association with gastrointestinal surgery (LR = 4.1, p = 0.07) and smoking (LR = 3.58, p = 0.06). Low levels of 25OHD were not associated with low BMD, nor were mutations in NOD2. No increased rate of fractures was seen among patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis.In addition to the generally accepted risk factors for osteoporosis (glucocorticoids, low BMI, smoking), male  patients had a trend toward lower BMD.

Such physical interaction allows mutual downregulation of the expression levels of both proteins, so that the absence of one of them causes upregulation of the other. This cross-regulation provides a molecular basis for a striking genetic interaction in mice where elimination of both molecules in the intestinal epithelium generates an aggressive inflammatory phenotype.  studies reveal unexpected features of the functional interplay between ATG16L1 and TNFAIP3. ATG16L1 requires TNFAIP3 to sustain the canonical autophagic flux measured by SQSTM1/p62 degradation. The WDD mediates lysosomal degradation of TNFAIP3 promoted by ATG16L1, and also regulates the NFKB/NF-κ response. Therefore, our data reveal new roles of the WDD and TNFAIP3 in the regulation of autophagy, protein stability and inflammatory signaling. More generally, we identify the interaction between ATG16L1 and TNFAIP3 as a signaling hub that integrates different pathways with important implications for intestinal homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294367>Nutrition Center of Excellence (COE) in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Model and Rationale for Development.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study was to develop a multi-disciplinary consensus of nutrition care priorities for implementation in an  nutrition center of excellence (COE).The role for nutrition care in inflammatory bowel disease is broad and encompasses multiple domains. Gaps exist in the published literature around best nutrition care practices in inflammatory bowel disease and highlight the need for an evidence based approach acceptable to patients, and generalizable to a wide inflammatory bowel disease population.Twelve health leaders in inflammatory bowel disease care attended a 1-day retreat. Two focus groups were completed using traditional focus group methodology for the first half of the retreat and a World Café method for the second half. Data analysis included review of analytic memos and conceptual analysis completed at the time of discussion, theme identification and team consensus for conceptual development.Three primary themes were identified as the main pillars of a COE in an  nutrition center of excellence. These include: a) excellence in clinical care, ) novel discovery and research, and c) knowledge translation to patients and practitioners. The key initial steps identified in this study included standardizing malnutrition screening and support while creating an environment where nutrition therapy is included as a standard of care, developing and examining the effectiveness of novel diet therapies, and translating knowledge to build capacity among care providers and patients.Using a 1-day retreat to identify a future direction for a center focused on nutrition excellence and align our coalition towards common goals was a successful strategy to develop consensus and identify nutrition care priorities for action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614035>The influence of self-criticism on depression symptoms among ambulatory patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Considering that self-criticism is an important process in the development and maintenance of depression, and taking into account the stigma associated with inflammatory bowel disease (), the present study aimed to analyse whether self-criticism exacerbates the relationships of depression symptoms with  symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame. The sample included 53 ambulatory  patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with  symptoms ( = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame ( = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = 2.40; P = .016). For the same level of  symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when  symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical  patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them. It may be beneficial to refer high self-critical patients to psychological care.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935522>Green tea: A possibility in the therapeutic approach of inflammatory bowel diseases?: Green tea and inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>this review aimed to investigate the effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) in Ulcerative colitis and Crohn´s Disease.The databases used were MEDLINE-and EMBASE (October 2009 to September 2018).

However, the underlying mechanism by which RHK exerts its anti-inflammatory activity has not yet demonstrated. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of RHK using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated J774A.1 macrophage cells and in-vivo inflammatory models. Results demonstrated that RHK treatment could significantly decrease the LPS-induced production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukins (ILs) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in J774A.1 cells. Molecular studies revealed that RHK inhibited the activation of upstream mediator nuclear factor-κ by suppressing the phosphorylation of Iκα and p65. In in-vivo experiments showed prominent anti-inflammatory activity of RHK. Thus, RHK could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The  etiology has not been clearly defined, and it is considered as a multifactorial disease. Due to side effects of some conventional therapies, the consumption of complementary and alternative medicines, and in particular, the herbal therapy, more than before is increasing.

We investigated the phenotypes of circulating lymphocytes in the two types of  in treatment-naive pediatric patients by analysis of blood samples by flow cytometry. Multivariate analysis was used to compare the phenotypes of the blood lymphocytes of children with ulcerative colitis (n = 17) or Crohn's disease (n = 8) and non- control children with gastrointestinal symptoms, but no signs of gut inflammation (n = 23). The two  subcategories could be distinguished based on the results from the flow cytometry panel. Ulcerative colitis was characterized by activated T cells, primarily in the CD8 population, as judged by increased expression of human leukocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) and the β1-integrins [very late antigen (VLA)] and a reduced proportion of naive (CD62L ) T cells, compared with the non- controls. This T cell activation correlated positively with fecal and blood biomarkers of inflammation. In contrast, the patients with Crohn's disease were characterized by a reduced proportion of  cells of the memory CD27 phenotype compared to the non- controls. Both the patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease showed increased percentages of CD23  cells, which we demonstrate here as being naive  cells.

The study was aimed at unraveling Nampt's clinical and diagnostic relevance. The serum concentration (Luminex-xMAP® technology) was measured in 113 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 127 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 60 non- controls: 40 healthy individuals and 20 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The leukocyte (44 CD/37 UC/19 IBS) and bowel expression (186 samples) was also evaluated (RT-qPCR). All were referred to  phenotype, activity, treatment, and inflammatory/nutritional/angiogenic/hypoxia indices. Serum-Nampt and leukocyte- were positively correlated and were more elevated in active- than in IBS, with leukocyte- being a fair differential marker. Serum-Nampt in UC positively correlated with its clinical and endoscopic activity as well as with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum-Nampt ≤1.54 ng/mL was a good indicator of mucosal healing. The expression of  was up-regulated both in inflamed and quiescent colon and reflected, similarly to leukocyte- the clinical activity of . Bowel- was independently associated with  and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α  expression in inflamed bowel but with  expression in quiescent bowel.

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the inflammatory response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in inflammatory bowel disease (), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune diseases marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis . Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis  have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis . However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

However, the impact of tofacitinib on cellular response of monocytes, which are key players in inflammatory responses, has not been investigated so far. We aimed to analyze JAK/STAT-inhibition by tofacitinib in monocytes of  patients and healthy controls.Primary monocytes of  patients with active disease and healthy controls (n = 18) were analyzed for cytokine expression and phenotype after granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interferon (IFN)γ-stimulation and tofacitinib pretreatment (1-1000 nM) and capacity to induce Foxp3+-regulatory T cells (Tregs) in cocultures. In total, 20 UC patients and 21 CD patients were included. Additionally, dose-dependent inhibition of JAK/STAT-phosphorylation was analyzed in controls.Pro-inflammatory costimulation with GM-CSF/IFNγ resulted in significant tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6 increase, whereas IL-10 expression decreased in monocytes. Tofacitinib modulated the responses of activated monocytes toward a regulatory phenotype through reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion and enhanced Treg induction in cocultures. However, in monocytes from active  patients, higher tofacitinib dosages were needed for blockade of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tofacitinib induced stronger regulatory phenotypes in monocytes of UC patients, including more effective inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways and better restoration of anti-inflammatory mechanisms as compared with CD-derived monocytes.Tofacitinib dose-dependently reprograms monocytes toward a more regulatory cell type. This beneficial effect possibly results from selective JAK/STAT-blockade by adequate tofacitinib dosage with inhibition of pro-inflammatory responses and permission of a balance-shift toward regulatory pathways.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Mannich curcuminoids, C142 or C150 synthetized in our laboratory, have been tested for anti-inflammatory activity in a rat model of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) induced colitis. Treatment with C142 or C150 reduced leukocyte infiltration to the submucosa and muscular propria of the inflamed gut. C142 or C150 rescued the loss of body weight and C150 decreased the weight of standard colon preparations proportional with 20% less tissue oedema. Both C142 and C150 curcumin analogues caused 25% decrease in the severity of colonic inflammation and haemorrhagic lesion size. Colonic MPO (myeloperoxidase) enzyme activity as an indicator of intense neutrophil infiltration was 50% decreased either by C142 or C150 Mannich curcuminoids. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-treatment with Mannich curcuminoids inhibited NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa ) activity on a concentration-dependent manner in an NF-κ-driven luciferase expressing reporter cell line.

In particular, monoclonal antibodies against the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF) such as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are now in the clinics both in induction and maintenance therapy, and several efforts are currently ongoing to optimize the use of these drugs in children. : This review focuses on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of anti-TNF levels and antidrug antibodies (ADAs), in  children. A revision of the analytical assays used for assessing anti-TNF plasma levels is also provided. : Although there is a consensus across studies that higher anti-TNF trough levels are associated with a better clinical outcome, and that early anti-TNF serum measurements could be predictive of long-term response, it is still not clear what the best predictive time of sampling is and what the ideal target drug plasma concentration to achieve. Indeed, there are a number of published studies, particularly in pediatric cohorts, limited by the population size analyzed and more prospective large studies are needed to examine the value of these predictive markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297055>Targeting the Eph/Ephrin System as Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in .</a></h2><p>Besides their long-known critical role in embryonic growth and in cancer development and progression, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma type  (EphB) receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin- ligands are involved in the modulation of immune responses and in remodeling and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin- system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin- antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin- forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin- system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560862>A modified cholera toxin  subunit containing an ER retention motif enhances colon epithelial repair  an unfolded protein response.</a></h2><p>Cholera toxin  subunit (CTB) exhibits broad-spectrum biologic activity upon mucosal administration. Here, we found that a recombinant CTB containing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif (CTB-KDEL) induces colon epithelial wound healing in colitis  the activation of an unfolded protein response (UPR) in colon epithelial cells. In a Caco2 cell wound healing model, CTB-KDEL, but not CTB or CTB-KDE, facilitated cell migration  interaction with the KDEL receptor, localization in the ER, UPR activation, and subsequent TGF-β signaling. Inhibition of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1/X-box binding protein 1 arm of UPR abolished the cell migration effect of CTB-KDEL, indicating that the pathway is indispensable for the activity. CTB-KDEL's capacity to induce UPR and epithelial restitution or wound healing was corroborated in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced acute colitis mouse model. Furthermore, CTB-KDEL induced a UPR, up-regulated wound healing pathways, and maintained viable crypts in colon explants from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (). In summary, CTB-KDEL exhibits unique wound healing effects in the colon that are mediated by its localization to the ER and subsequent activation of UPR in epithelial cells.

Mice were separated into four groups: (a) water only (control), () DSS followed by water (DSS), (c) water followed by MC-LR (MC-LR), and (d) DSS followed by MC-LR (DSS + MC-LR).

This review will discuss severity of the disease in terms of challenges to immunity during the progression of acute illness. We will identify the common signals in the communication between microbiota and inflammatory cells, as well as the sequestration of the regulatory network by Clostridium difficile, which leads to tissue damage and prevents its elimination from intestinal lumen.Copyright © 2018 IMSS.

It is increasingly recognized that many patients have continued disease activity without symptoms. Subclinical inflammation increases the risk of disease flares and long-term complications. A consensus is therefore emerging on the need to treat beyond symptoms and to define clear treatment targets for  patients receiving biologic medicines. : We review validated tools used in  for monitoring clinical and endoscopic response to therapy. We discuss the value of using non-invasive tests in assessing disease activity. We summarise the latest guidelines in  treatment and review recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring. We examine the role of monitoring for and prevention of avoidable complications of treatment. : The goals of treatment in  are to achieve both clinical remission and mucosal healing. Whether we adopt a top-down or more conventional treatment strategy there is now an imperative to monitor patients using a combination of endoscopic and biochemical markers to assess the degree of continuing inflammation and establish early disease control. TDM has facilitated huge improvement in the ability to personalize delivery of biologics. This has allowed for early detection and prevention of loss of response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987344>Exopolysaccharide-Producing  Strains with Similar Adhesion Property Induce Differential Regulation of Inflammatory Immune Response in Treg/Th17 Axis of DSS-Colitis Mice.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bifidobacteria benefit human health by promoting and modulating the gut flora, and boosting therapeutic efficiency for chronic metabolic diseases and cancer. Recently,  strains with high adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells were associated with induction of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells in humans and rodents. Here, two  strains with similar adhesive ability but different aggregation properties were investigated for specific immunoregulatory effects, including the underlying cellular pathway, on macrophage and T-regulatory (Treg)/Th17 axis activation in vitro and in the colon of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis mice in vivo. In-vitro, the auto-aggregative .  strain IF1-11 induced significantly higher IL-6 and lower IL-10 secretion from immune cells, and it induced abundant Th17 cells. The non-aggregating strain IF1-03 induced significantly higher IL-10, less IL-6 and a high proportion of Treg/Th17 cells compared to total T cells. In vivo, orally administered IF1-03 protected DSS-colitis mice via activation of dendritic cells or macrophages and skewing of Treg/Th17 cells, consistent with Treg cell induction in vitro. IF1-03 exopolysaccharides showed a functional recognition pattern similar to IF1-03 for IL-10 cytokine secretion and Treg cell-differentiation induction, both dependent on the toll-like receptor 2-ERK/p38 MAPK-signaling cascade for macrophage activation. We suggest that .  exopolysaccharide-associated enterocyte adhesion/aggregation phenotypes determine strain-specific adaptive immune responses in the gut via the macrophage-regulated Treg/Th17 axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461996>Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased Disease Activity in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D has an inhibitory role in the inflammatory signaling pathways and supports the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Due to its immunomodulatory effect, vitamin D plays a role in chronic inflammatory bowel disease () and a deficiency is associated with an increased risk for a flare. We aimed to investigate to what extent the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) level correlates with disease activity and whether a cut-off value can be defined that discriminates between active disease and remission.Patients with , treated at the University Hospital Frankfurt were analyzed retrospectively. The 25(OH)D3 levels were correlated with clinical activity indices and laboratory chemical activity parameters. A deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D3 levels <30 ng/mL.A total of 470 (257 female) patients with  were included, 272 (57.9%) with Crohn's disease (CD), 198 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). The median age of the patients was 41 (18-84). In 283 patients (60.2%), a vitamin D deficiency was detected. 245 (53.6%) patients received oral vitamin D supplementation, and supplemented patients had significantly higher vitamin D levels (p < 0.0001). Remission, vitamin D substitution, and male gender were independently associated with the 25(OH)D3 serum concentration in our cohort in regression analysis. A 25(OH)D3 serum concentration of 27.5 ng/mL was the optimal cut-off value.Vitamin D deficiency is common in  patients and appears to be associated with increased disease activity. In our study, vitamin D levels were inversely associated with disease activity. Thus, close monitoring should be established, and optimized supplementation should take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075241>Stevioside, a diterpenoid glycoside, shows anti-inflammatory property against Dextran Sulphate Sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is an umbrella-term used to describe a set of chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the gastro-intestinal tract. Since most of the inflammatory medications in current use have several undesirable side-effects, stevioside, a naturally occurring, high-intensity sweetener was assessed in our study for its anti-inflammatory properties by in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Stevioside was observed to significantly inhibit the levels of LPS induced elevation of cytokines, TNF-α (P < 0.05) and IL-6 (P < 0.001) as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (P < 0.01) and nitrites (P < 0.001) in RAW264.7 cells. Stevioside has also been evaluated for its anti-inflammatory effect by using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice. Stevioside significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI) score, ameliorated the inflammatory symptoms induced by DSS in mice and exhibited intact colon histo-architecture. Stevioside treatment significantly inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, and the protein expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators, COX-2 (P < 0.01) and iNOS (P < 0.01) and restored the levels of endogenous anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase (P < 0.01), catalase (P < 0.001), glutathione s-transferase (P < 0.001) and reduced glutathione (P < 0.001) level in colon tissues. It was also observed that stevioside significantly suppressed NF-κ (p65) activation by abrogating Iκ phosphorylation and attenuated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and JNK proteins in colon tissues. The findings of the present study suggest that stevioside exhibits anti-inflammatory property by inhibiting NF-κ (p65) and MAPK pathways and can be employed as an adjunct in nutraceuticals to treat .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

These agents are linked to adverse events ranging from mild nuisance symptoms to potentially life-threatening complications including infections and malignancies. Areas covered: This review provides an updated discussion on adverse events associated with immunomodulator, anti-TNF-α, anti-integrin, and anti-IL 12/IL-23 antibody therapies. In addition, we review the risk profile of the currently widely available infliximab biosimilar medication.

Differentially expressed serum microRNAs were further investigated in an independent training cohort (n = 341). Correlations between relative microRNA levels and disease activity were evaluated. A disease control group was included to investigate the specificity of microRNA. Logistical regression was used to construct a microRNA classifier to identify endoscopic activity. Its predictive value was explored in the validation cohort (n = 66) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Serum microRNA146b-5p (miR-146b-5p) expression was 2.87- and 2.72-fold higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively, than in healthy controls. Serum miR-146b-5p was significantly correlated with disease activity and was more specific than C-reactive protein (CRP). A classifier was built for Crohn's disease, ie P [Endoscopically active] =  , with a greater AUC of 0.869 [0.764-0.940] than that for CRP (0.680 [0.554-0.790]) (P = 0.0043).MiR-146b-5p may better reflect mucosal inflammation in  than CRP. The Crohn's disease classifier developed in this study may be valuable for identifying endoscopic activity in patients with Crohn's disease.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116018>Infectious bursal disease virus suppresses H9N2 avian influenza viral shedding in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>1. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes immunosuppression in chickens, increasing their susceptibility to other infectious diseases and resulting in vaccination failure. Here, we investigated the immune-depressing effect of IBDV on H9N2 avian influenza viral infection in the broiler chickens. 2. For this purpose, chickens were divided into four groups. In group A, chickens were inoculated with IBDV at 21 days of age and H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) 5 days later. Groups  and C only received AIV at 26 days of age and IBDV at 21 days, respectively. The control group (D) were inoculated with normal saline at the same times. Tissue samples from different organs were collected on the days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after H9N2 infection. 3. Macroscopic observation showed  lesions in groups A and C, including swollen bursa with the presence of gelatinous exudates, haemorrhages in the thigh muscle, edema, and nephritis. 4. Reverse Transcription-PCR was used to study H9N2 AIV dissemination, and qRT-PCR to determine viral genome copy number in different organs. A considerable titre of AIV was found in the trachea, lungs, cecal tonsils, spleens, and feces of infected chickens. The genome copy number of the virus in the trachea and lungs of group A was significantly higher than that in group  on the first day after inoculation. But in the other days post inoculation, RT-PCR did not detect the AIV genome in group A. Although there might have been some immunosuppression in group A, IBDV could interfere with AIV replication in the chickens of this group. 5. In conclusion, we propose that pre-exposure to IBDV at 3 weeks of age reduces the replication and shedding of H9N2 in broiler chicken.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177627>Angiotensin II inhibits P-glycoprotein in intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>P-glycoprotein (Pgp/MDR1) plays a major role in intestinal homeostasis. Decrease in Pgp function and expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of . However, inhibitory mechanisms involved in the decrease of Pgp in inflammation are not fully understood. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a peptide hormone predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the crypt-villus junction of the intestine, has been shown to exert pro-inflammatory effects in the gut. It is increased in  patients and animals with experimental colitis. Whether Ang II directly influences Pgp is not known.Pgp activity was measured as verapamil-sensitive  H-digoxin flux. Pgp surface expression and exocytosis were measured by cell surface biotinylation studies. Signalling pathways were elucidated by Western blot analysis and pharmacological approaches.Ang II (10 nM) significantly inhibited Pgp activity at 60 minutes. Ang II-mediated effects on Pgp function were receptor-mediated as the Ang II receptor 1 (ATR1) antagonist, losartan, blocked Pgp inhibition. Ang II effects on Pgp activity appeared to be mediated via PI3 kinase, p38 MAPK and Akt signalling. Ang II-mediated inhibition of Pgp activity was associated with a decrease in the surface membrane expression of Pgp protein via decreased exocytosis and was found to be dependent on the Akt pathway. Short-term treatment of Ang II (2 mg/kg .wt., 2 hours) to mice also decreased the membrane expression of Pgp protein levels in ileum and colon.Our findings provide novel insights into the role of Ang II and ATR1 in decreasing Pgp expression in intestinal inflammation.Published 2019.

It acts to rapidly deplete the  lymphocyte population through multiple mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of the immune system. Rituximab has been associated with numerous adverse gastrointestinal effects including diarrhea and bowel perforation, and recent reports have associated rituximab with the development of de novo inflammatory bowel disease (). To our knowledge, there have been no reports of microscopic colitis (MC) associated with rituximab therapy. We aimed to identify patients with rituximab-associated colitis, and to better characterize the clinical features and disease course of these patients.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Recently, we have identified an excellent new fecal biomarker,  cell activating factor (BAFF), as being as effective as fecal calprotectin for diagnosing intestinal inflammation. In this study, a total of 230 patients with abdominal discomfort were prospectively enrolled and fecal samples were collected within 24 h before the endoscopic examinations. We show that fecal BAFF levels were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis (median = 1549 pg/g, P < 0·0001), Crohn's disease (median = 735 pg/g, P < 0·0001), gastric cancer (median = 267 pg/g, P < 0·0001) and colorectal cancer (median = 533 pg/g, P < 0·0001) than those in healthy groups (median = 61 pg/g), while the values of which in patients with gastric polyps, colorectal polyps, esophagitis/gastritis/duodenitis and peptic ulcer were in the range of healthy individuals (P > 0·05). An optimal cut-off value at 219·5 pg/g of fecal BAFF produced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of 85, 91, 84 and 92%, respectively, for  or carcinoma. Our results therefore indicate a potential role for fecal BAFF as a sensitive screening parameter for  and gastrointestinal carcinoma, as well a useful tool to select patients with abdominal discomfort for further endoscopic examinations.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979002>Synbiotic Supplementation Containing Whole Plant Sugar Cane Fibre and Probiotic Spores Potentiates Protective Synergistic Effects in Mouse Model of .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () are a chronic inflammatory disorders with increasing global incidence. Synbiotic, which is a two-point approach carrying probiotic and prebiotic components in mitigating inflammation in , is thought to be a pragmatic approach owing to the synergistic outcomes. In this study, the impacts of dietary supplementation with probiotic  MTCC5856 spores () and prebiotic whole plant sugar cane fibre (PSCF) was assessed using a murine model of . Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet supplemented with either , PSCF or its synbiotic combination. After seven days of supplementation, colitis was induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days during the continuation of the supplemented diets. Synbiotic supplementation ameliorated disease activity index and histological score (-72%, 7.38, respectively), more effectively than either  (-47%, 10.1) and PSCF (-53%, 13.0) alone. Synbiotic supplementation also significantly ( < 0.0001) prevented the expression of tight junction proteins and modulated the altered serum IL-1β (-40%), IL-10 (+26%), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (-39%) levels. Synbiotic supplementations also raised the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) profile more extensively compared to the unsupplemented DSS-control. The synbiotic health outcome effect of the probiotic and prebiotic combinations may be associated with a synergistic direct immune-regulating efficacy of the components, their ability to protect epithelial integrity, stimulation of probiotic spores by the prebiotic fibre, and/or with stimulation of greater levels of fermentation of fibres releasing SCFAs that mediate the reduction in colonic inflammation. Our model findings suggest synbiotic supplementation should be tested in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983435>A 30-year follow-up study of patients with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome shows an association to inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is often classified under the term orofacial granulomatosis (OFG).

To evaluate the long-term outcomes of MRS patients, with specific interest in bowel-related symptoms.  This follow-up study consisted of adult patients with MRS - including the monosymptomatic form, cheilitis granulomatosa (CG) - who had participated in our earlier MRS study (diagnosed after 1995 in Helsinki University Hospital). A phone interview was conducted with 27 patients (77.1% of the patients from the earlier study) and included questions about orofacial symptoms, facial palsy, intestinal symptoms, concomitant illnesses, medications, possible food avoidances and family history. Stool samples were collected to measure faecal calprotectin, a surrogate marker for intestinal inflammation.  The median follow-up time from symptom onset was 30 years. Three (11.1%) patients had developed inflammatory bowel disease (); one CG patient developed CD, and two MRS patients with facial palsy developed ulcerative colitis. In addition, several other patients reported intestinal symptoms, but the examination of faecal calprotectin did not indicate intestinal inflammation.

Bacterial meningitis is polyethiologic, which makes the task of determining the pathogen the main in the organization of epidemiological surveillance, treatment regimens, planning of preventive and anti-epidemic measures. The quality of laboratory diagnostics has a key influence on this. The true incidence of meningitis of different etiology can be altered at low-efficiency laboratory diagnostics. This work was carried out to assess the effectiveness of existing laboratory methods for the detection of PBM pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis; as a part of the programme on sentinel surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases () carried out by the WHO regional office for Europe in a number of countries in Europe (Ukraine, Belarus), Transcaucasia (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia), Asia (Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) in the period 2010-2017. 2893 samples of clinical material (CSF and blood) obtained from patients with the meningeal syndrome were studied by four diagnostic methods: cultural method, latex-agglutination test, immunochromatographic test (BinaxNOW), PCR (conventional and real-time), used to identify the following pathogens: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae. When identifying the causative agents of BM, PCR more effective than culture method is 5 times in detecting N. meningitidis; 3 times in the detection of S. pneumoniae; 4 times the detection of H. influenzae .

Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic immunologically mediated disease that imposes a significant associated health burden, including the increased risk for colonic dysplasia and CRC. Carcinogenesis has been attributed to chronic inflammation and associated with oxidative stress, genomic instability, and immune effectors as well as the cytokine dysregulation and activation of the nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ) signaling pathway. Current anti-inflammation therapies used for  treatment have shown limited effects on CRC chemoprevention, and their long-term toxicity has limited their clinical application. However, natural food-based prevention approaches may offer significant cancer prevention effects with very low toxicity profiles.

Canine  activity index (CIBDAI) and histopathological WSAVA-grading differed significantly (p<0.001) between groups. CIBDAI improved significantly after appropriate therapy (p < 0.0001). Intestinal biopsies of all CO showed polyclonal patterns for - and T-cell primers. All samples from CCE patients showed polyclonal patterns for the -cell primers. Targeting TCRG, 4 patients showed a monoclonal or oligoclonal pattern of the lymphocytic infiltrates in the duodenum and/or colon. Clinical improvement was observed in all dogs. Although a small cell lymphoma cannot be excluded in view of the short follow up duration, a false positive result, in the sense of a canonical rearrangement or unspecific amplification due to a antigenic stimulation in a non-neoplastic inflammatory process is possible.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Probiotics are able to reduce inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, entire signaling pathways and the interaction between different probiotics have not been well-documented. This study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of single and combined probiotics. HT-29 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, treated with ,  subsp.  or their combination and analyzed for inflammation-related molecules. Both  and  subsp.  reduced interleukin (IL)-8 secretion and the expressions of phosphorylated p65 nuclear factor-kappa  (-p65 NF-κ), phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (-p38 MAPK), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), while they increased toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression.  did not decrease intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) but enhanced the inhibitory efficacy of  subsp. .

Cross-sectional and case-control studies were included. We restricted our search to studies published in English. We used the PRISMA checklist and flow diagram. Duplicate articles were manually deleted in End Note. To identify further relevant studies, we checked the reference lists of the selected articles.We identified 149 papers, of which 19 were retrieved for full text review. Eleven studies were subsequently excluded because fatigue was not evaluated as an outcome measure. Eight papers focused on the desired topic and were discussed in the final analysis. A lack of uniformity of outcome measures made the pooling of data impossible. In all but one study, questionnaires were used to evaluate fatigue. In the remaining study, an accelerometer was used to measure daily activities, sleeping time and their relationships with fatigue in a more quantifiable manner. Adolescents with  are significantly more fatigued than healthy controls. In addition to active disease, increased anxiety or depression and disturbed family relationships were frequently reported predictors of fatigue. Quantitative measurement of physical activity in patients with Crohn's disease showed a reduction in the number of steps per day, and patients with ulcerative colitis had a shorter duration of physical activity during the day.Fatigue in pediatric  is related to a combination of biological, functional and behavioral factors, which should all be taken into account when managing fatigue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347993>Unexplained fever in a young man with Crohn's disease: a case report and review of literature.</a></h2><p>A 23-year-old man with a known history of Crohn's disease (CD), who underwent an ileocaecal resection for localized disease activity three months ago, suffered from persistent fever with chills since 10 days.

We investigated which markers are most relevant to assess intestinal permeability in UC patients and whether probiotics had an effect on these markers.In this twelve-week placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study, twenty-five subjects with UC in remission received either placebo or a multispecies probiotics. Samples of blood, urine, and faeces were taken at baseline, week 6, and week 12 to assess intestinal permeability and inflammation. Diaries and Bristol stool scale were kept to record stool frequency and consistency. Quality of life was scored from 32-224 with the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (-Q).This group of UC patients, in clinical remission, did not show increased intestinal permeability at baseline of this study. During the study, no significant group or time effects were found for intestinal permeability measured by the 5-sugar absorption test, serum zonulin, and faecal zonulin. Likewise, the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, and the cytokines IFN, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 were not significantly affected. Stool frequency and consistency were not significantly affected either. The -Q score, 194 for the probiotics group and 195 for the placebo group, remained unaffected. Correlations were tested between all outcomes; urinary sucrose excretion was significantly correlated with serum zonulin ( = 0.62) and faecal calprotectin ( = 0.55). Faecal zonulin was not significantly correlated with any of the other markers.Serum zonulin may be a more relevant biomarker of intestinal permeability than faecal zonulin, due to its correlation with other biomarkers of intestinal permeability. UC patients in remission did not show an effect of the probiotic treatment or a change in gut permeability. This should not discourage further studies because effects might be present during active disease or shortly after a flare up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497527>Infectious bursal disease virus in chickens: prevalence, impact, and management strategies.</a></h2><p>Infectious bursal disease (), also known as Gumboro disease, is a highly contagious, immunosuppressive disease of young chickens. Although first observed about 60 years ago, to date, the disease is responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide.  virus (IBDV), a double-stranded RNA virus, exists as two serotypes with only serotype 1 causing the disease in young chickens. The virus infects the bursa of Fabricius of particularly the actively dividing and differentiating lymphocytes of the -cells lineage of immature chickens, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and immunosuppression. Immunosuppression enhances the susceptibility of chickens to other infections and interferes with vaccination against other diseases. Immunization is the most important measure to control ; however, rampant usage of live vaccines has resulted in the evolution of new strains. Although the immunosuppression caused by IBDV is more directed toward the  lymphocytes, the protective immunity in birds depends on inducement of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The interference with the inactivated vaccine induced maternally derived antibodies in young chicks has become a hurdle in controlling the disease, thus necessitating the development of newer vaccines with improved efficacy.

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating .-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

This study was aimed to investigate the protective role of  in a colorectal cancer (CRC) model induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in germ-free (GF) mice.  Total 22 GF mice were divided into two groups: GF and BF group. Half of the GF mice were colonized with  for 28 days before CRC induction by AOM/DSS.   colonization increased animal survival (100%). Cecum weight and cecum/body weight ratio significantly decreased in BF/AOM/DSS group. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in tumor number and tumor incidence in the BF/AOM/DSS group as compared to the GF/AOM/DSS group. The adenocarcinoma/adenoma incidence and histologic score were also decreased in the BF/AOM/DSS group. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining found decreased numbers of cell proliferation (PCNA) and inflammatory cell (granulocytes) infiltration in the colon mucosa of the BF group. The β-catenin staining in the BF/AOM/DSS group had fewer and weaker positive signal expressions. Taking together, the  colonization significantly ameliorated AOM/DSS-induced CRC by suppressing the activity of cell proliferation-related molecules and reducing the number of inflammatory cells.

To study the mechanism mediated by TREM-1 on macrophages, we generated an independent TREM-1 deficient mouse.Acute colitis was induced in C57BL/6 and TREM-1-deficient mice by the administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Colonic lamina propria immune cell composition and cytokines were analyzed. An innate lymphoid cell (ILC) co-culture experiment with macrophages was used to analyze IL-22 levels. Exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages were supplied to TREM-1-deficient mice for examining their effects on intestinal barrier integrity.In inflamed colons, TREM-1 loss compromised the activation of ILC3 and their production of IL-22, which is required for intestinal barrier integrity. ILC3-mediated IL-22 production depends on IL-1β secreted by M1-polarized macrophages, and we found that TREM-1 deficiency results in a decreased number of IL-1β producing-M1 macrophages in colons exposed to DSS. Accordingly, DSS-mediated damage was ameliorated by supplying exogenous IL-22 and TREM-1-expressing macrophages to TREM-1-deficient mice.TREM-1 plays a crucial role in regulating IL-22 production by ILC3 through modulating M1-macrophage polarization during DSS-induced acute colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188020>Progressing from Recurring Tissue Injury to Genomic Instability: A New Mechanism of Neutrophil Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Aberrant neutrophil (PMN) infiltration of the intestinal mucosa is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While the genotoxic function of PMNs and its implications in carcinogenesis have been primarily associated with oxidative stress, recent work by Butin-Israeli and colleagues has defined a novel mechanism where PMN-derived microparticles through the delivery and activity of specific miRNAs promoted formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and in parallel, suppressed DSB repair through the downregulation of lamin B1 and Rad51. Respective downregulation of these two proteins compromised the nuclear envelope and high-fidelity repair by homologous recombination, increasing DSB accumulation and aneuploidy.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco-2 cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco-2 cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable. Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 upregulated NF-κ and pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and downregulated ZO-1, occludin and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10.Hsa-miR-375 is involved in the pathogenesis of  by upregulating TLR4 and inducing NF-κ activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621465>Selective Tyk2 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents: a patent review (2015-2018).</a></h2><p>Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) is a non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase, an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the TYK2 gene. Tyk2, together with three other family subtypes, namely, Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3, belong to the JAK family. Before 2014, far more publications and patents appeared in public domain attributing to the development of selective Jak2 and Jak3 inhibitors than those for selective Tyk2 and Jak1 inhibitors.This review sought to give an overview of patents related to small molecule selective Tyk2 inhibitors published from 2015 to 2018. The article also covers clinical activities of small molecule selective Tyk2 inhibitors in recent years.As a key component of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Tyk2 regulates INFα, IL12, and IL23. Selective inhibition of Tyk2 can provide pharmacological benefits in the treatment of many diseases such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cancer, and diabetes. The selectivity against other Jak family subtypes (such as Jak2) is crucial in order to minimize the potential side effects and to maximize the desired pharmacological effects.

The most implicated gene is HLA-DRB1, with HLA-DRB1*03:01 the most associated risk allele in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Elucidating precise disease associations is challenging due to high linkage disequilibrium between HLA genotypes. The mechanisms by which risk alleles cause disease are multifactorial, with the best evidence indicating structural and electrostatic alteration impacting antigen binding and downstream signalling. Adverse medication events have been associated with HLA genotypes including with thiopurines (pancreatitis) and anti-TNF agents (antibody formation).The HLA complex is associated with multiple risk/protective alleles for .

This study sought to investigate the effect of corticosteroid use on hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among Taiwanese patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or inflammatory bowel disease ().  This was a retrospective cohort study using adults in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database receiving a new diagnosis of AS ( = 40,747) or  ( = 4290) between January 2002 and June 2013. Our main outcome measure was odds of preventable hospitalization for eight ambulatory care-sensitive conditions defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  In the first quarter (three months) following diagnosis, corticosteroid usage was common among patients with AS and  (18.5% and 30%, respectively).

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy, safety, and tolerability of an intensive monitoring strategy designed to predict the future course of Crohn's disease in patients with quiescent disease.In a prospective observational cohort study, we recruited patients older than 18 years with quiescent (for 3-24 months) Crohn's disease involving the small bowel with confirmed small bowel patency from three tertiary medical centres in Israel. Enrolled patients underwent baseline magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and patency capsule, clinical or biomarker assessment every 3 months, and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years or until a clinical flare (the primary outcome, defined as an increase in the Crohn's disease activity index score by 70 points or more) or disease worsening necessitating treatment intensification. We assessed the ability of the different Crohn's disease monitoring methods used to predict the occurrence of a flare during the 24-month follow-up period.Of 90 screened patients, 29 were excluded (17 because of non-patent small bowel). Of the 61 patients enrolled between July 3, 2013, and Feb 1, 2015, 17 (28%) had a flare during the 24-month follow-up. No clinicodemographic parameter predicted future flare. A baseline VCE Lewis score of 350 or more identified patients with future flare (area under the curve [AUC] 0·79, 95% CI 0·66-0·88; p<0·0001; hazard ratio 10·7, 3·8-30·3). C-reactive protein at baseline had an AUC of 0·73 (0·6-0·84; p=0·0013) for predicting flare. The AUC of baseline faecal calprotectin for the prediction of flare occurring within 2 years was 0·62 (0·49-0·74; p=0·17), but progressively improved for shorter timespans and reached an AUC of 0·81 (0·76-0·85) for the prediction of flare occurring within 3 months. Of four MRE-based indices, only MRE global score correlated with 2-year flare risk (AUC 0·71, 0·58-0·82; p=0·024). During follow-up, a Lewis score increase of 383 points or more from baseline predicted imminent disease exacerbation within 6 months (AUC 0·79, 0·65-0·89; p=0·011). The safety and tolerability of the 231 VCEs ingested was excellent, with none being retained.In patients with quiescent Crohn's disease involving the small bowel, faecal calprotectin predicts short-term flare risk, whereas VCE predicts both short-term and long-term risk of disease exacerbation. If corroborated by additional studies, protocols incorporating VCE could expand the scope of available methods for monitoring disease activity and predicting outcomes in small bowel Crohn's disease.The Leona M & Harry  Helmsley Charitable Trust.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual-patient-level data (IPD) will be extracted from the identified trials through data-sharing platforms for pharmaceutical companies' sponsored trials and by contacting principal investigators of independent investigator-initiated trials. We will analyse induction of remission in patients with early-disease (<18 months since disease onset) versus patients with longer disease duration, using a generalised linear mixed effect model and by a two-stage approach using coefficient for the treatment-by-subgroup interaction within each trial.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease ().Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In , CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in , dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in , with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health.

KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring tight junction (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κ, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced inflammatory responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κ, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203722>Dynamic immunoglobulin responses to gut bacteria during inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Aberrant immune responses against gut microbiota are thought to be key drivers of inflammatory bowel disease () pathogenesis. However, the extent and targets of immunoglobulin (Ig) A versus IgG responses to gut bacteria in  and its association with  severity is not well understood. Here, we address this by analyzing fecal samples from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Non- patients by flow cytometry for the frequency of bacteria that were endogenously bound with IgA and/or IgG. Assessment of  patients from two geographically distinct cohorts revealed increased percentages of IgA- and IgG-bound fecal bacteria compared to non- controls. Notably, the two major subsets of  showed distinct patterns of Ig-bound bacteria, with CD activity associated with increases in both IgA and IgG-bound bacteria, whereas UC activity correlated only with increases in IgG-bound bacteria. Analysis of the flow sorted Ig-bound bacterial repertoire by 16S rDNA sequencing revealed taxa that were Ig-bound specifically in . Notably, this included bacteria that are also thought to reside in the oral pharynx, including , and  species. These data show that the pattern of IgA and IgG binding to fecal bacteria is distinct in UC and CD. In addition, the frequency of Ig-bound fecal bacteria may have potential as a non-invasive biomarker for disease activity.

Despite consistent evidence of  lineage cells in the mucosa in , little is known of  cell recruitment to the gut in . Here we analyzed  cells in blood of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with a range of disease activities. We analyzed the frequencies of known  cell subsets in blood and observed a consistent reduction in the proportion of CD27IgD  cells expressing all Ig isotypes in the blood in  (independent of severity of disease and treatment) compared to healthy controls. Successful treatment of patients with biologic therapies did not change the profile of  cell subsets in blood. By mass cytometry we demonstrated that CD27IgD  cells were proportionately enriched in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in . Since production of TNFα is a feature of  relevant to therapies, we sought to determine whether  cells in GALT or the CD27IgD subset in particular could contribute to pathology by secretion of TNFα or IL-10. We found that donor matched GALT and blood  cells are capable of producing TNFα as well as IL-10, but we saw no evidence that CD27IgD  cells from blood expressed more TNFα compared to other subsets. The reduced proportion of CD27IgD  cells in blood and the increased proportion in the gut implies that CD27IgD  cells are recruited from the blood to the gut in .

CRYAB expression was assessed in cultured HT29 and Caco-2 cells and inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and colitis models in mice. Lentivirus-overexpressing and CRSIPR/Cas9 systems were used in different cells to upregulate and silence CRYAB expression, respectively. Cell permeable recombined fusion protein TAT-CRYAB was injected intraperitoneally into dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice to assess its anti-inflammatory effects. CRYAB was found to be significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa from  patients and DSS-induced colitis in mice, and negatively correlated with the levels of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively. Enforced expression of CRYAB suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) via inhibiting the IKK complex formation, whereas lack of CRYAB expression markedly enhanced proinflammatory responses. Consistently, administration of TAT-CRYAB fusion protein significantly alleviated DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in mice and protected intestinal barrier integrity.

We evaluated the association between SpA duration and upper gastrointestinal ulcers, hepatitis  (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and diverticulitis using data from a large international cross-sectional study. Binary regression models were created, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics, steroids,  history and country. Subgroup analysis was performed by disease phenotype. The data of 3923 participants were analysed. The prevalence of gastrointestinal conditions were 10.7% upper gastrointestinal ulcers; 4.7% viral hepatitis and 1.5% diverticulitis. While SpA duration was not associated with upper gastrointestinal ulcers, HBV or HCV, longer SpA duration was significantly associated with diverticulitis (odds ratios (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03⁻1.34), reflecting an 18% increase for every five years of SpA duration. Other significant associations with diverticulitis were age and high alcohol intake but not medication history. In subgroup analyses, the association was strongest with those with axial SpA. The reasons for this association of increased diverticulitis with disease duration in SpA, especially those with axial disease, are unclear but may reflect shared underlying gut inflammation.

Conventional ligand-binding ATI-assays detect only free-form of ATI, potentially increasing the proportion of patients with undetectable ATI, but with adequate trough infliximab (TRI) level who experience loss of response (LOR) to infliximab. We investigated this assertion using a novel ATI-Cim assay.An ATI-Cim assay was developed by utilizing a C1q-immobilized plate, detecting free-form and ATI-infliximab complexes. Plasma ATI in 137 consecutive  patients, 56 with sustained clinical response (SCR), 76 with LOR and 5 with infusion reactions was measured.ATI levels reached a plateau following addition of up to 25 μg/mL infliximab to different concentrations of free-form ATI. ATI concentration did not significantly change during infliximab infusion (P = 0.4316). ATI concentration > 0.153 μg/mL was associated with LOR (odds ratio 3.0: 95%, confidence interval 1.5 to 6.1, P = 0.0029). The number of patients with undetectable ATI was higher in SCR than in LOR, 53.6% vs 22.4% (P = 0.0004). Patients with SCR and LOR were divided into 4 subgroups by combined cut-off ATI and TRI values.

Rare risk variants are also important contributors to schizophrenia etiology but, with the exception of large copy number variants, are difficult to detect with GWAS. Exome and genome sequencing, which have accelerated the study of rare variants, are expensive so alternative methods are needed to aid detection of rare variants. Here we re-analyze an Irish schizophrenia GWAS dataset (n = 3,473) by performing identity-by-descent () mapping followed by exome sequencing of individuals identified as sharing risk haplotypes to search for rare risk variants in coding regions. We identified 45 rare haplotypes (>1 cM) that were significantly more common in cases than controls. By exome sequencing 105 haplotype carriers, we investigated these haplotypes for functional coding variants that could be tested for association in independent GWAS samples. We identified one rare missense variant in PCNT but did not find statistical support for an association with schizophrenia in a replication analysis. However,  mapping can prioritize both individual samples and genomic regions for follow-up analysis but genome rather than exome sequencing may be more effective at detecting risk variants on rare haplotypes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30916990>Tethering soluble meprin α in an enzyme complex to the cell surface affects -associated genes.</a></h2><p>Biologic activity of proteases is mainly characterized by the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. The human metalloproteases meprin α and meprin β share 41% sequence identity and exhibit a similar cleavage specificity with a preference for negatively charged amino acids. However, shedding of meprin α by furin on the secretory pathway makes it a secreted enzyme in comparison with the membrane-bound meprin β. In this study, we identified human meprin α and meprin β as forming covalently linked membrane-tethered heterodimers in the early endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing furin-mediated secretion of meprin α. Within this newly formed enzyme complex, meprin α was able to be activated on the cell surface and detected by cleavage of a novel specific fluorogenic peptide substrate. However, the known meprin β substrates amyloid precursor protein and CD99 were not shed by membrane-tethered meprin α. On the other hand, being linked to meprin α, activation of or substrate cleavage by meprin β on the cell surface was not altered. Interestingly, proteolytic activity of both proteases was increased in the heteromeric complex, indicating an increased proteolytic potential at the plasma membrane. Because meprins are susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (), and to investigate the physiologic impact of the enzyme complex, we performed transcriptome analyses of intestinal mucosa from meprin-knockout mice. Comparison of the transcriptional gene analysis data with gene analyses of  patients revealed that different gene subsets were dysregulated if meprin α was expressed alone or in the enzyme complex, demonstrating the physiologic and pathophysiological relevance of the meprin heterodimer formation.-Peters, F., Scharfenberg, F., Colmorgen, C., Armbrust, F., Wichert, R., Arnold, P., Potempa, ., Potempa, J., Pietrzik, C.

A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons).

Recently, our group has demonstrated increased UTR expression in both human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines and adenomatous polyps, as well as in colon carcinoma samples if compared to healthy colon samples of the same patients. We also showed that an UTR agonist induced an increase in colon adenocarcinoma cell growth in vitro, whereas the UTR block with a specific antagonist caused an inhibition of their growth and an inhibition of about 50% of both motility and cell invasion. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease () associated with an increased baseline risk for colon cancer compared with the general population, and this risk is mostly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This risk increases along with the duration of the disease, as demonstrated by many studies. There are no UTR expression data related to UC, and we therefore evaluated UTR expression in ill colon biopsies and in healthy colon ones of patients with UC and colon biopsies of healthy patients.We enrolled, prior to informed consent, 11 patients (5 males and 6 females, age range 29-75 years, median age 52 years) with first UC diagnosis compared to 11 healthy controls (6 males and 5 females, age range 30-78 years, median age 55 years). We have therefore sampled inflammatory and healthy tissue in UC patients. We have also taken colic tissue samples in healthy subjects.

On day 10 post-infection (p.i.), histological parameters of the large intestine were assessed. Barrier integrity was evaluated by pathogen translocation to secondary organs and in vivo permeability test. Fecal  load peaked at 10 CFU/g at day 10 p.i., with clearance at day 24 p.i., regardless of probiotic treatment. BB75 administration resulted in 10⁷ cells/g of feces with no effect of timing of administration. BB75 treatment did not attenuate -induced crypt hyperplasia nor inflammation.  and BB75 can co-exist in the gut with no mutual displacement. However, BB75 cannot counteract  pathology. Our findings provide insight for the understanding of probiotics behavior and their clinical relevance in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791773>Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease - epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily of, but not restricted to the gut. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are frequently observed and involve the joints, eyes, hepatobiliary tract, and skin. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss classical EIM focusing on epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis, highlighting recent advances in the understanding of EIM. We further discuss treatment-induced immunological phenomena, which are increasingly recognized and might challenge -treating physicians in the era of biological treatment. Expert opinion: EIM considerably contributes to morbidity and mortality. Genetic studies have revealed a common genetic background between EIM and  and among specific EIM. Identified protein interactions have been shown to cluster in shared biological pathways. However - despite these recent advances - pathogenesis of EIM is at best partially understood. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed such as upregulation of tumor necrosis factor, aberrant lymphocyte homing, and cross-reactive antigen presentation. It still remains unclear whether EIM is a direct result of the inflammatory process in the gut or rather a consequence of a shared genetic background leading to dysfunctional immune responses to environmental stimuli. Exploration and understanding of EIM genetics and pathophysiology will pave the road for better and more efficacious treatment options in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31217423>Mass cytometry reveals systemic and local immune signatures that distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Each disease is characterized by a diverse set of potential manifestations, which determine patients' disease phenotype. Current understanding of phenotype determinants is limited, despite increasing prevalence and healthcare costs. Diagnosis and monitoring of disease requires invasive procedures, such as endoscopy and tissue biopsy. Here we report signatures of heterogeneity between disease diagnoses and phenotypes. Using mass cytometry, we analyze leukocyte subsets, characterize their function(s), and examine gut-homing molecule expression in blood and intestinal tissue from healthy and/or  subjects. Some signatures persist in  despite remission, and many signatures are highly represented by leukocytes that express gut trafficking molecules. Moreover, distinct systemic and local immune signatures suggest patterns of cell localization in disease.

Intestinal permeability maintains the circulation of minerals and nutrients from digested foods. Life and all the metabolic processes depend either directly or indirectly on proper functioning of GI tract. Compromised intestinal permeability and related disorders are common among all the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), which is a collective term of inflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Many synthetic drugs are currently in use to treat  such as 5-aminosalicylic acid corticosteroids. However, they all have some drawbacks as long-term use result in many complications. These problems encourage us to look out for alternative medicine. Numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the plant-derived secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, glucosinolates, alkaloids, terpenoids, oligosaccharides, and quinones could reduce permeability, ameliorate-related dysfunctions with promising results. In addition, many of them could modulate enzymatic activity, suppress the inflammatory transcriptional factors, ease oxidative stress, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. In this review, we summarized the phytochemicals, which were proven potent in treating increased intestinal permeability and related complication along with their mechanism of action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848228>Mesalazine activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase: Implication in the anti-inflammatory activity of this anti-colitic drug.</a></h2><p>Mesalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is an anti-inflammatory drug that is most widely used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (). Despite extensive clinical use, the exact pharmacological mechanism underlying the anti-colitic effects of 5-ASA has not yet been elucidated. A potential molecular mechanism underlying 5-ASA-mediated anti-colitic activity was investigated.An anti-inflammatory pharmacology of 5-ASA was scrutinized in human colon carcinoma cells and murine macrophages and in a TNBS-induced rat colitis model.5-ASA induced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase in cells. 5-ASA activation of AMPK occurred regardless of the presence of the pro-inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide. 5-ASA inhibits TNF-α-dependent nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) activation, which was dampened by AMPK inhibition. Oral gavage of sulfasalazine (a colon-specific prodrug of 5-ASA) or rectal administration of 5-ASA ameliorated 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced rat colitis and activated AMPK in the inflamed colonic tissues while markedly diminishing the levels of NF-κ-regulated pro-inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-3, elevated by induction of inflammation. Rectal co-administration of 5-ASA and an AMPK inhibitor undermined 5-ASA-mediated activation of AMPK and its anti-colitic effects.These findings suggest that activation of AMPK is involved in 5-ASA-mediated anti-colitic effects at least partly via interference with pro-inflammatory NF-κ signaling.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813588>Comparative Evaluation of HVT- Vector, Immune Complex, and Live  Vaccines against vvIBDV in Commercial Broiler Chickens with High Maternally Derived Antibodies.</a></h2><p>Infectious bursal disease () causes increased mortality and severe immunosuppression in commercial chickens.

Here we show that deletion of the GTPase RRAS2 results in exacerbated negative selection and above-normal expression of positive selection markers. Furthermore,  mice are resistant to autoimmunity both in a model of inflammatory bowel disease () and in a model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that MOG-specific T cells in  mice have reduced affinity for MOG/I-A tetramers, suggesting that enhanced negative selection leads to selection of TCRs with lower affinity for the self-MOG peptide. An analysis of the TCR repertoire shows alterations that mostly affect the TCRα variable (TRAV) locus with specific VJ combinations and CDR3α sequences that are absent in  mice, suggesting their involvement in autoimmunity.© 2019 Martínez-Riaño et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337064>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Types Differ in Markers of Inflammation, Gut Barrier and in Specific Anti-Bacterial Response.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel disease () associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC-), share three major pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease ()-gut dysbiosis, gut barrier failure and immune system dysregulation.

PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder for which there is no established medical therapy. Preclinical data suggest curcumin may have a beneficial effect in PSC.  Subjects with PSC and a serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) received curcumin 750 mg orally twice daily for 12 weeks in an open-label pilot study. The primary composite endpoint was proportion of subjects who had a reduction of SAP to less than 1.5 times ULN or a 40% reduction in SAP between baseline and week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, Mayo PSC risk score and self-reported health questionnaires.  Two-hundred and fifty-eight patients with PSC were screened and 15 subjects were enrolled and all completed 12 weeks of therapy. The most common reason for subject exclusion was SAP less than 1.5 times the ULN ( = 98). Curcumin did not result in a significant median (interquartile range) change in SAP times the ULN [3.43 (2.10-4.32) to 2.46 (1.89-4.41),  = .36], and only 20% (3/15) subjects achieved the primary endpoint. Similarly, there was no significant change in the secondary endpoints. There were no serious adverse events reported.  While curcumin was well tolerated, it was not associated with significant improvements in cholestasis or symptoms. Moreover, this study also illustrates that a low SAP is common among those with PSC.

CAC is a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), the third leading cause of cancer death.  (ZJ) fruit contains bioactive components such as polysaccharides, triterpenoid acid, and flavonoids, and it has shown anti-inflammatory property. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of dietary ZJ on colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. Mice ( = 42, two sets) were injected with azoxymethane (AOM) followed by three cycles of 2% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water to induce CAC. Simultaneously, those mice were fed with ZJ diet for 70 days (5% or 10% w/w). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by LSD Bonferroni test. Dietary ZJ decreased fecal blood, diarrhea, disease activity index (DAI), spleen weight ( < 0.001), and the number of tumors ( < 0.001). In addition, dietary ZJ increased colon length ( < 0.001) and suppressed the activation of NF-к/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that dietary ZJ attenuates inflammation by interfering NF-κ/IL-6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibits AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063937>Regulation of CD11b by HIF-1α and the STAT3 signaling pathway contributes to the immunosuppressive function of  cells in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> cells have been reported to have a suppressive function in autoimmune diseases, which appears to require an increase of CD11b expression on  cells. However, little is known how CD11b is induced in  cells to play the function. In this study, we found that the high expression of CD11b in  cells occurred not only in the mucosal immune organs, but also in systemically immune organs such as the spleen during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Since the inflammatory lesions in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease () were revealed to be significantly hypoxic or even anoxic, the  cells from colitic mice Peyer's patches (PP) were investigated to express higher levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) than naïve  cells from wildtype (WT) mice. HIF-1α siRNA transfection or HIF-1α protein inhibition led to decreased CD11b expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in vitro.  cells with HIF-1α specific knockdown were then adoptively transferred to Rag-1 mice. The result displayed that CD11b expression was decreased in  cells and an exacerbated colitis occurred. The bio-informatics promoter analysis and ChIP assay showed that HIF-1α was the critical transcription factor for CD11b and cooperatively formed a complex with the p-STAT3 homodimers to bind onto hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) regions, which was guaranteed by MEK/ERK pathway activation and IL-10 secretion. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the key function of the hypoxia-associated transcription factor HIF-1α together with p-STAT3 in driving CD11b transcription in  cells and controlling  cell's protective activity in experimental inflammatory bowel disease ().Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The population structure of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a broad-leaved evergreen psammophyte in eastern Central Asia, was previously thought to follow an isolation by distance pattern. However, recent studies have emphasized the effects of environmental factors on its growth and distribution, suggesting an important influence of local adaptation on the genetic structure of the species. Using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, we verified the previously inferred low intra-population variation and high inter-population differentiation. However, in contrast to previous studies, the results of partial Mantel tests and a maximum likelihood population effects mixed model (MLPE) suggested that local climate differences, rather than geographic distances or resistance distances, are the main factor affecting population differentiation. Further analysis with removal of multicollinear climatic variables and univariate MLPE found that summer and winter precipitation were crucial for shaping the current population genetic structure. Since local precipitation is related to the regeneration, colonization, and overwintering survival of A. mongolicus, its influence on demographic change may explain its effect on the population genetic structure. In addition, precipitation is related to terrain despite westward decreases, which explains the independence of genetic difference and geographic distance. The identified role of IBE suggests that collecting germplasm resources from genetically differentiated populations could be a more effective strategy to preserve the overall genetic diversity of the species than the establishment of corridors to enhance gene flow among populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447849>Design and Development of a Novel Peptide for Treating Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Intestinal inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (), are associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the intestines. Furthermore, intestinal inflammation increases the risk of enteric cancer, which is a common malignancy globally. Native anti-inflammatory peptides are a class of anti-inflammatory agents that could be used in the treatment of several intestinal inflammation conditions. However, potential cytotoxicity, and poor anti-inflammatory activity have prevented their development as anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, in this study, we designed and developed a novel hybrid peptide for the treatment of intestinal inflammation. Eight hybrid peptides were designed by combining the active centers of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37 (13-36), YW12D, innate defense regulator 1, and cathelicidin 2 (1-13) with thymopentin or the active center of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) (17-24). The hybrid peptide, LL-37-Tα1 (LTA), had improved anti-inflammatory activity with minimal cytotoxicity. LTA was screened by molecule docking and  experiments. Likewise, its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms were also evaluated using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal inflammation murine model. The results showed that LTA prevented LPS-induced impairment in the jejunum epithelium tissues and infiltration of leukocytes, which are both histological markers of inflammation. Additionally, LTA decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. LTA increased the expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin, and reduced permeability and apoptosis in the jejunum of LPS-treated mice. Additionally, its anti-inflammatory effect is associated with neutralizing LPS, binding to the Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (TLR4/MD-2) complex, and modulating the nuclear factor-kappa  signal transduction pathway. The findings of this study suggest that LTA may be an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460574>IMMUNIZATION STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.</a></h2><p>Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease () includes a variety of immunosuppressants and biological agents, which increase the risk of infections due to altered cellular and humoral immunity.

However, the safety of oral iron supplementation remains controversial because of its association with exacerbated disease activity in a subset of  patients. Because iron modulates bacterial growth and function, one possible mechanism by which iron may exacerbate inflammation in susceptible hosts is by modulating the intestinal microbiota. We, therefore, investigated the impact of dietary iron on the intestinal microbiota, utilizing the conventionalization of germ-free mice as a model of a microbial community in compositional flux to recapitulate the instability of the -associated intestinal microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that altering intestinal iron availability during community assembly modulated the microbiota in non-inflamed wild type (WT) and colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient () mice. Depletion of luminal iron availability promoted luminal compositional changes associated with dysbiotic states irrespective of host genotype, including an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae such as . Mechanistic  growth competitions confirmed that high-affinity iron acquisition systems in  enhance its abundance over other bacteria in iron-restricted conditions, thereby enabling pathobiont iron scavenging during dietary iron restriction.

The tailored regulatory approval route for biosimilar development ensures that approved biosimilars show similarity to their originators in terms of efficacy and safety, and avoids unnecessary repetition of clinical trials carried out with the originator product. However, some patients may still have concerns about using biosimilars and it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals (HCPs) to alleviate these concerns. Areas covered: This review highlights clinical and real-world evidence supporting efficacy and safety of biosimilars in patients with . Moreover, based on international surveys, potential patient concerns are highlighted, along with possible actions HCPs can take to address these concerns. Expert commentary: The rising use of biosimilars in  is expected to have a positive impact on the availability of biologics and healthcare costs. Several biosimilars have been approved for use and more are likely to come to the market in the future; however, transitioning patients to biosimilars could pose an unexpected challenge without the help and support of HCPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476299>Histopathology Scoring Systems of Stenosis Associated With Small Bowel Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Stenosis is a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD) that has no effective medical therapy. Development of anti-fibrotic agents will require testing in randomized controlled trials. Computed tomography enterography- and magnetic resonance enterography-based technologies might be used to measure outcomes in these trials. These approaches have been validated in studies of patients with symptomatic strictures who underwent imaging evaluations, followed by resection with histopathologic grading of the intestinal tissue for inflammation and/or fibrosis (the reference standard). Imaging findings have correlated with findings from quantitative or semi-quantitative histologic evaluation of the degree of fibromuscular stenosis and/or inflammation on the resection specimen. However, it is not clear whether histologic findings are an accurate reference standard. We performed a systematic review of all published histologic scoring systems used to assess stenosing CD.We performed a comprehensive search of the Embase and Medline of studies through March 13, 2019 that used a histologic scoring system to characterize small bowel CD and assessed inflammatory and fibrotic alterations within the same adult subject. All scores fitting the criteria were included in our analysis, independently of the presence of stricturing disease, as long as inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated separately but in the same scoring system.We observed substantial heterogeneity among scoring systems, which were not derived using modern principles for evaluative index development. None had undergone formal validity or reliability testing. None of the existing indices had been constructed according to accepted methods for development of evaluative indices. Basic knowledge regarding their operating properties were lacking. Specific indices to evaluate the important pathological component of myofibroblast hypertrophy or hyperplasia have not been proposed.In a systematic review of publications, we found a lack of validated histopathologic scoring systems for assessment of fibromuscular stenosis. Data that describe the operating properties of existing cross-sectional imaging techniques for stenosing CD should be questioned. Development and validation of a histopathology index is an important research priority.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These unbalanced reactions also involve humoral responses, with antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, here we aimed to quantify IgA and IgG specific to S. cerevisiae (ASCA) in quiescent CD and UC, to correlate the production of these antibodies with patient's inflammatory response and disease clinical presentation. Twenty-nine subjects (16 CD and 13 UC) and 45 healthy controls were enrolled in this study and had plasma samples tested for ASCA and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α), besides clinical evaluation.  patients had increase IgA and IgG ASCA, especially those with colonic (L2) and fistulizing (B3) CD. Similarly, patients who dropped out the treatment had augmented ASCA, while IgG was reduced in those receiving sulfasalazine treatment. Furthermore, the quiescent CD patients had elevated IL-6 on plasma, especially in the absence of treatment, together with increased counter regulatory response of IL-10. There was a positive correlation between IgA and IgG on CD but not UC, as well as between IgA and TNF in total  patients. In addition, the levels of IgG x TNF, IgA x IL-10 and IgG x IL-10 were also correlated in CD, indicating that ASCA production may be influenced by the inflammatory response. Finally, we concluded that ASCA could be pointed as relevant biomarker of CD presentation and residual inflammation, even in clinical remission patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136648>Phenotypic variation in paediatric  by age: a multi-centre prospective inception cohort study of the Canadian Children  Network.</a></h2><p>Aims: Incidence of paediatric  in Canada is among the highest worldwide and age of onset may be decreasing. In a multi-centre nation-wide inception cohort study, we examined variation in phenotype of  throughout the paediatric age spectrum.Children ≥2y and <17y (A1 age at diagnosis) with new onset  were systematically evaluated at sites of the Canadian Children  Network. Prospectively recorded phenotypic data were compared between age groups.Among 1092 children (70% Caucasian; 64% CD, 36% UC/-U; median age 13y (IQR 11-15y)), 210 (19%) were diagnosed prior to age 10y (Paris A1a) and 43 (4%) prior to age 6y (VEO-). CD was less common in younger children (42%, 56%, 66%, respectively, of VEO-, A1a; A1b). Colon-only  (UC/IBDU or CD-colon) was present in 81% of VEO- and 65% of A1a; ileal disease increased progressively, reaching plateau at age 10y. CD location was ileocolonic (L3) in 53% overall. Ileitis (L1) increased with age (6% of VEO-; 13% of A1a; 21% of A1b), as did stricturing/penetrating CD (4% of A1a; 11% of A1b). At all ages UC was extensive (E3/E4) in >85% and disease activity moderate to severe according to PGA and wPCDAI/PUCAI in >70%. Heights were modestly reduced in CD (mean height z score -0.30±1.23), but normal in UC/-U.Paris classification of age at diagnosis is supported by age-related increases in ileal disease until age 10 years. Other phenotypic features including severity are similar across all ages. Linear growth is less impaired in CD than in historical cohorts, reflecting earlier diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Paeoniflorin (PF), a bioactive compound from Paeonia lactiflora Pallas plants, exerts a potential effect of anti-inflammatory reported in various researches. However, the effect of PF on intestinal barrier function and its related mechanisms has not been identified. Here, we investigate the PF potential anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human Caco-2 cell monolayers and explore its underlying key molecular mechanism. In this context, PF significantly increased TEER value, decreased intestinal epithelium FITC-dextran flux permeability, and restored the expressions of occludin, ZO-1, and claudin5 in LPS-induced Caco-2 cell. In vitro, treatment of PF significantly inhibited LPS-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). In addition, we found that PF suppressed nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways in ILPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Our findings indicate that PF has an inhibitory effect on endothelial injury.

We have recently shown that the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall orchestrate the formation of the TLOs associated with atherosclerosis in response to the local release of TNF-α. Observational studies have recently documented the presence of structures resembling TLOs the creeping fat that develops in the mesentery of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory condition combining a complex and as yet not elucidated infectious and autoimmune responses. We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the TLO structures in order to decipher the mechanism leading to their formation in the mesentery of CD patients, and assessed the effect of infectious and/or inflammatory inducers on the potential TLO-organizer functions of adipocytes. Quantitative analysis showed that both T and  memory cells, as well as plasma cells, are enriched in the CD-affected mesentery, as compared with tissue from control subjects. Immunohistochemistry revealed that these cells are concentrated within the creeping fat of CD patients, in the vicinity of transmural lesions; that T and  cells are compartmentalized in clearly distinct areas; that they are supplied by post-capillary high endothelial venules and drained by lymphatic vessels indicating that these nodules are fully mature TLOs. Organ culture showed that mesenteric tissue samples from CD patients contained greater amounts of adipocyte-derived chemokines and the use of the conditioned medium from these cultures in functional assays was able to actively recruit T and  lymphocytes. Finally, the production of chemokines involved in TLO formation by 3T3-L1 adipocytes was directly elicited by a combination of TNF-α and LPS in vitro. We therefore propose a mechanism in which mesenteric adipocyte, through their production of key chemokines in response to inflammatory/bacterial stimuli, may orchestrate the formation of functional TLOs developing in CD-affected mesentery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fecal samples were collected from SOCS1Tg mice and SOCS1Tg (control) mice at 1 and 6 months of age, and the fecal bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform.Gut microbial diversity was significantly reduced and the intestinal bacterial community composition changed in SOCS1Tg mice in comparison with the control mice. Interestingly, the population of  species, which is known to be elevated in ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer patients, was significantly increased in SOCS1Tg mice regardless of age.Taken together, these results suggest that the proinflammatory genetic background owing to SOCS1 deficiency causes dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which in turn generates a procolitogenic environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746631>Receipt of Preventive Care Services Among US Adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, 2015-2016.</a></h2><p>Previous reports suggest that adults with inflammatory bowel disease () receive suboptimal preventive care.The population-based study compared the receipt of these services by US adults with and without .Adults aged ≥ 18 years with  (1.2%) and without  were identified from the 2015 and 2016 National Health Interview Survey (n = 66,610).

It is the purpose of this review to consider various risks with biologic therapies in inflammatory bowel disease and discuss mitigating strategies.Two recently approved monoclonal antibodies (vedolizumab and ustekinumab) and a Janus kinase inhibitor small molecule (tofacitnib) have introduced a number of novel safety and risk considerations. We review the clinical trial and real-world safety data to date on these agents as well as review new data and considerations with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. New vaccines for varicella zoster virus, hepatitis  virus, and high-dose influenza have been studied, and we discuss the clinical importance of these findings. Lastly, we make management recommendations in the event of particular side effects or complications.

A significant number of described VEO--causing monogenic disorders can be attributed to defects in immune-related genes. The diagnosis of the underlying primary immunodeficiency (PID) often has critical implications for the treatment of patients with -like phenotypes.To identify the molecular etiology in 5 patients from 3 unrelated kindred with -like symptoms, we conducted whole exome sequencing. Immune workup confirmed an underlying PID.Whole exome sequencing revealed 3 novel CARMIL2 loss-of-function mutations in our patients. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed reduction of regulatory and effector memory T cells and impaired  cell class switching. The T cell proliferation and activation assays confirmed defective responses to CD28 costimulation, consistent with CARMIL2 deficiency.Our study highlights that human CARMIL2 deficiency can manifest with -like symptoms.

Here, the aim was to investigate the effects of , a gut microbiota, on OSM and on intestinal barrier in colitis.  In the murine model of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, we tested disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histological score and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1), OSM, TNF-α and TLR5. In addition, a cellular model was used to examine the role of  during secretion of OSM by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR5 knockout (TLR5 KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of OSM on expressions of TJ proteins by Caco-2 cells.   in DSS-induced colitis decreased DAI score ( < .001), colon length shortening (6.46 ± 0.36 cm  5.65 ± 0.47 cm,  = .022), histological score (2.667 ± 1.15  5.33 ± 1.14,  = .018) and increased expression of TJ proteins ( < .05). In addition,  reduced expression of OSM ( < .05) and TNF-α ( < .05), while increasing expression of TLR5 ( < .05). Furthermore,  reduced secretion of OSM ( < .05) by LPS-induced BMDMs isolated from WT and TLR5 KO mice. Moreover, OSM downregulated expression of TJ proteins ( < .05) by Caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.  These results indicate that  attenuates inflammation in  by decreasing secretion of OSM and by promoting intestinal barrier function.

To determine whether premedication with corticosteroids decreases the incidence of infusion reactions.We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the Soroka Medical Center that includes records from 92 patients treated with Infliximab: Group A includes 70 inflammatory joint disease patients who were not treated with hydrocortisone premedication and, group  includes 22 inflammatory bowel disease patients who were treated with hydrocortisone premedication. Incidence and severity of infusion reaction were assessed.The incidence of infusion reactions in the group which did not receive premedication was 26.1% (18/69), while in the group receiving premedication the incidence was 13.6% (3/22). Results are not statistically significant but reflect a trend.

With multiple biologic classes available, we make recommendations for positioning of these agents in clinical practice.While tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists remain the biologic of choice for majority of patients with moderate-to-severe , IL-12/23, and IL-23 antagonists should be considered for first- or second-line therapy because of their efficacy in biologic-naïve and experienced patients. Additionally, IL-12/23 and IL-23 antagonists may be preferred over anti-TNF therapy in older patients who are at increased risk for infections and malignancy.

We aimed to determine in human  transcriptomes the link between a transcriptional signature unique to intestinal cells (ICs) with reduced mitochondrial ATP production (Mito-0) and bacteria triggered signaling using a bioinformatics approach. We generated an IC Mito-0 panel comprised of 199 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts mediated by reduced mitochondrial ATP function (DEGseq, log fold-change > |2|, p < .001). Transcripts from this panel were involved in diverse biological functions including regulation of mitochondrial energy (lower ATP), extracellular matrix, cell-cell contact, cytoskeleton, growth, metabolism, and inflammation. Next, unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that the Mito-0 panel distinctly separated inflamed  from non-inflamed transcriptomes, which was also supported by principal component analysis (PCA) revealing distinct variation between sample types based on presence of the Mito-0 signature (PCA, p = 8.77e). Utilizing three independent  cohorts, we validated that 60 novel transcripts from the Mito-0 panel were significantly increased in inflamed tissue. Subsequently, KEGG generated bacterial TLR4 and NOD2 transcriptional signatures strongly associated with inflamed  transcriptomes and with the Mito-0 signature as determined by Spearman's analysis (coefficient of correlation, r = 0.92, p < .05).

Consistent with this function, a common variant of the autophagy gene  is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (), a disorder characterized by a chronic immune reaction directed against the gut microbiota. We recently contributed to our understanding of the link between autophagy and inflammatory signaling in the intestine by demonstrating that autophagy proteins including ATG16L1 are necessary in the epithelium to prevent a spontaneous type I interferon response to the gut microbiota. Enhanced innate immunity that occurs upon autophagy inhibition is protective in mouse models of infection by an enteric bacterial pathogen and acute epithelial injury.

The mechanism underlying myofibroblast hyper-proliferation in CD needs to be better understood. In this report, we found that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or mTOR deletion in CX3Cr1 mononuclear phagocytes inhibits expression of interleukin (IL)-23, accompanied by reduced intestinal production of IL-22 and ameliorated fibrosis in the TNBS-induced fibrosis mouse model. This inhibition of IL-23 expression is associated with elevated autophagy activity. Ablating the autophagy gene Atg7 increases the expression of IL-23, leading to increased expression of IL-22 and increased fibrosis. Both induction of IL-22 and intestinal fibrosis occurred in RAG mice and depletion of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) attenuates the fibrotic reaction, suggesting that the pro-fibrotic process is independent of T and  cells. Moreover, IL-22 facilitates the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Finally, the fibrotic reaction was attenuated upon neutralization of either IL-23 or IL-22. Altogether, this study elucidated a signaling cascade underlying intestinal fibrosis in which altered mTOR/autophagy in CX3Cr1 mononuclear phagocytes up-regulates the IL-23/IL-22 axis, leading to an excessive fibrotic response. Thus, our findings suggest that this cascade could be a therapeutic target for alleviation of CD fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187783>Knowledge and attitudes of primary healthcare physicians toward the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease following an educational intervention: A comparative analysis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic inflammatory condition that requires early diagnosis and proper management.

However, studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects result from local immunomodulation in the inflamed regions. Furthermore, topical inhibition of TNF in  ameliorates inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that orally administered IFX targeted to the ileo-colonic region in  may be an efficacious new treatment option. This study describes the development and validation of the production process of ileo-colonic-targeted 5 mg IFX tablets (ColoPulse-IFX) intended for the oral treatment of  by means of producing three consecutive validation batches (VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3, respectively). UV-VIS spectroscopy, HPLC-SEC analysis (content, fragments, aggregates), fluorescence spectroscopy (tertiary protein structure), and ELISA (potency) showed no noticeable deviations of IFX compounded to ColoPulse-IFX compared to fresh IFX stock. The average ± SD ( = 10) IFX content of VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 was 96 ± 2%, 97 ± 3%, and 96 ± 2%, respectively, and complied with the European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements for Content Uniformity. The average ± SD ( = 3) ColoPulse-IFX potency was 105 ± 4%, 96 ± 4%, and 97 ± 5%, respectively, compared to fresh IFX stock. The IFX release profile from the tablet core was complete (≥85%) after 10 min in simulated ileum medium. The in vitro coating performance of ColoPulse-IFX showed that the formulation was targeted to the simulated ileo-colonic region. Stability data showed that ColoPulse-IFX was stable for up to 6 months stored at 25 °C/60% RH. Based on these results, the production process can be considered validated and its application is discussed in light of the rationale and available evidence for the topical treatment of  with IFX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827274>Clostridium Difficile Infection in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.</a></h2><p>The rising incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the general population has been recognized by health care organizations worldwide. The emergence of hypervirulent strains has made CDI more challenging to understand and treat. Inflammatory bowel disease () patients are at higher risk of infection, including CDI.A diagnostic approach for recurrent CDI has yet to be validated, particularly for  patients. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for toxins A and , as well as glutamate dehydrogenase EIA, are both rapid testing options for the identification of CDI. Without a high index of suspicion, it is challenging to initially differentiate CDI from an  flare based on clinical evaluation alone.Here, we provide an up-to-date review on CDI in  patients. When caring for an  patient with suspected CDI, it is appropriate to empirically treat the presumed infection while awaiting further test results.Treatment with vancomycin or fidaxomicin, but not oral metronidazole, has been advocated by an expert review from the clinical practice update committee of the American Gastroenterology Association. Recurrent CDI is more common in  patients compared to non- patients (32% versus 24%), thus more aggressive treatment is recommended for  patients along with early consideration of fecal microbiota transplant.Although the use of infliximab during CDI has been debated, clinical experience exists supporting its use in an  flare, even with active CDI when needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560728>Regulatory interaction between the ZPBP2-ORMDL3/Zpbp2-Ormdl3 region and the circadian clock.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci for several immunity-mediated diseases (early onset asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (), primary biliary cholangitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) map to chromosomal region 17q12-q21. The predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased risk of developing asthma or  is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with disease. However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and disease is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin  (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that disease-associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615542>LB-9, Novel Probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria, Ameliorates Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice by Inhibiting TNF-α-Mediated Apoptosis of Intestinal Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, is a group of chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions within the gastrointestinal tract. An increase in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis is a major characteristic of UC. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays an essential role in the regulation of apoptosis. Aberrant activation of the immune response to resident microflora contributes to overproduction of TNF-α in the mucosal tissue of the gastrointestinal tract; a hallmark of UC. There are no curative medications for . Thus, establishment of novel strategies for the treatment of this disease is imperative. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been characterized as probiotics that can alleviate imbalances in indigenous microflora in UC, exhibiting beneficial effects for the treatment and prevention of . In this study, we elucidate the potential of LB-9, a novel probiotic LAB, to protect against colitis development using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model of UC. Treatment using LB-9 reduced clinical symptoms of colitis. In addition, both colitis-induced and NF-κ-mediated IEC apoptosis was markedly reduced in mice treated with LB-9. Moreover, these results were closely associated with reduced TNF-α levels. Our study demonstrates that the LB-9 probiotic exhibits therapeutic potential for UC through suppression of TNF-α-mediated IEC apoptosis in a murine DSS-induced colitis model, with important biological implications for treatment of  in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945037>Improved Antibody Response to Three Additional Hepatitis  Vaccine Doses Following Primary Vaccination Failure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown the efficacy of hepatitis  (HBV) vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease () is impaired, but few data exist regarding the effectiveness of revaccination strategies following primary vaccination failure. Our aim was to analyze the association between administration of additional vaccine doses and hepatitis  surface antibody (HBsAb) seroconversion.This is a retrospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria are as follows: age ≥ 18, diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), inadequate HBsAb < 10 IU/L following initial HBV vaccination series, subsequent administration of 1-3 additional doses of HBV vaccine with follow-up serum HBsAb measurements. Patients were stratified into groups of ≤ 2 or 3 doses received. Primary outcome was achieving HBsAb > 10 IU/L. Outcomes were stratified by age ≥ or < 40 years. We performed logistic and linear multivariable regression analyses for categorical and continuous data.The study cohort consists of (n = 149) 54.4% women; 77.9% white; 72.6% with CD, with mean age: 46.2. Patients of all ages and age ≥ 40 years, who received 3 additional doses of vaccine, were more likely to achieve seroprotective HBsAb levels than patients who received 1 or 2 doses (OR 1.77, P = 0.01; OR 1.9, P = 0.03, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, race, immunosuppressive medication exposure, time between vaccine/titer).Following initial HBV vaccination failure, patients with  of all ages are more likely to develop seroprotective levels of HBsAb following 3 additional vaccine doses, rather than 1 or 2 alone.

A microbial dysbiosis is observed in  patients, and intra-luminal colonic-iron is able to support a more pathogenic community of bacteria; whether this is attributed to the development of  and how iron could be mediating these microbial changes is still unknown. Dietary fibres are commonly used in pre-biotic supplements to beneficially affect the host by improving the viability of bacterial communities within the colon. Alginates are a class of biopolymers considered as prebiotics due to their fibre-like composition and are able to bind metal cations, in particular, iron. Considering that iron excess is able to negatively alter the microbiome, the use of alginate as a food supplement could be useful in colonic-iron chelation. As such, this first-in-man study aimed to assess whether the use of alginate as a dietary iron chelator was both safe and well tolerated. In addition, the impact of alginate on the microbiome and iron levels was assessed by using an intestinal model SHIME (Simulation of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem). Alginate was supplemented into the diets (3 g/day) of healthy volunteers ( = 17) for 28 days. Results from this study suggest that daily ingestion of 3 g alginate was well tolerated with very minor side effects. There were no detrimental changes in a variety of haematological parameters or the intestinal microbiome. The bacterial communities within the SHIME model were also not influenced by iron and or alginate; it is possible that alginate may be susceptible to bacterial or enzymatic degradation within the gastro-intestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456516>Are Viruses and Parasites linked to Celiac Disease? A question that still has no definite answer.</a></h2><p>Celiac disease is a complex autoimmune enteropathy of the small intestine that commonly occurs in genetically predisposed individuals due to intake of gluten and related proteins. Gluten consumption, duration of breast-feeding, various infections, especially frequent intestine infections, vaccinations and use of antibiotics can be linked to celiac disease. It is predicted that it affects 1% of the global population and its incidence rate is increasing. Celiac disease is closely related to Turner's syndrome, type I diabetes mellitus, Down's syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions and most people with the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 are at a higher risk of developing this disease. The link between infections and autoimmune diseases has been very much considered in recent years. In several studies, we explained that pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms probably have multiple roles in initiation, exacerbation, and development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (). In various studies, the relationship between infections caused by viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Rotavirus, Hepatitis C (HCV) and Hepatitis  virus (HBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza virus, and parasites including Giardia spp and Toxoplasma gondii with celiac disease has been raised. However, increasing evidence proposes that some of these microorganisms, especially helminths, can also have protective and even treatment roles in the celiac disease process. Therefore, in order to determine the role of microorganisms in the process of celiac disease, we explained and summarized the role of viral and parasitic infections in celiac disease.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31432443>A Spectrum of Clinical Findings from ALPS to CVID: Several Novel LRBA Defects.</a></h2><p>Autosomal recessively inherited lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein deficiency was shown to be responsible for different types of inborn errors of immunity, such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). The aim of this study was to compare patients with LRBA-related ALPS and LRBA-related CVID, to describe their clinical and laboratory phenotypes, and to prepare an algorithm for their diagnosis and management.Fifteen LRBA-deficient patients were identified among 31 CVID and 14 possible ALPS patients with Western blotting (WB), primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) gene, next-generation panel screening (NGS), and whole exome sequencing (WES).The median age on admission and age of diagnosis were 7 years (0.3-16.5) and 11 years (5-44), respectively. Splenomegaly was seen in 93.3% (14/15) of the patients on admission. Splenectomy was performed to 1/5. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (93.3% (14/15)), autoimmune cytopenia (80% (12/15)), chronic diarrhea (53.3% (8/15)), lower respiratory tract infections (53.3% (8/15)), lymphoma (26.6% (4/15)), Evans syndrome (26.6% (4/15)), and autoimmune thyroiditis (20% (3/15)) were common clinical findings and diseases. Lymphopenia (5/15), intermittant neutropenia (4/15), eosinophilia (4/15), and progressive hypogammaglobulinemia are recorded in given number of patients. Double negative T cells (TCRαβCD4CD8) were increased in 80% (8/10) of the patients.  cell percentage/numbers were low in 60% (9/15) of the patients on admission. Decreased switched memory  cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Thelper (Th) cells, markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA (TEMRA) Th were documented. Large PD1 population, increased memory, and enlarged follicular helper T cell population in the CD4 T cell compartment was seen in one of the patients. Most of the deleterious missense mutations were located in the DUF1088 and BEACH domains. Interestingly, one of the two siblings with the same homozygous LRBA defect did not have any clinical symptom. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed to 7/15 (46.6%) of the patients. Transplanted patients are alive and well after a median of 2 years (1-3). In total, one patient died from sepsis during adulthood before HSCT.Patients with LRBA deficiency may initially be diagnosed as CVID or ALPS in the clinical practice. Progressive decrease in  cells as well as IgG in ALPS-like patients and addition of  symptoms in the follow-up should raise the suspicion for LRBA deficiency. Decreased switched memory  cells, decreased naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) Th cells, and markedly increased effector memory/effector memory RA Th cells (TEMRA Th) cells are important for the diagnosis of the patients in addition to clinical features. Analysis of protein by either WB or flow cytometry is required when the clinicians come across especially with missense LRBA variants of uncertain significance. High rate of malignancy shows the regulatory T cell's important role of immune surveillance.

Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the management of various conditions including inflammatory and gastrointestinal diseases. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of onion particularly in inflammatory bowel disease ().To test the anti-inflammatory effects of onion bulb extract (OBE) in an  mouse model and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects such as modulation of the expression and/or the activity profile of various pro-inflammatory molecules.Colitis was induced in mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) daily administration for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed, colons were removed and the severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of various cytokines and chemokines were measured using proteome profiling-based assay, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques.DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by the daily OBE treatment and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, positive control), particularly at 100-200 mg/kg doses, at both the gross and histological levels. OBE was also shown to reduce colonic expression and activity of several pro-inflammatory molecules and signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinase family, mammalian target of rapamycin, cyclooxygenase-2, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We aim to investigate the effect of QBD on the mouse model of ulcerative colitis and its possible mechanism.C57/bL mice were given 5% DSS to induce colitis and were divided as QBD and mesalazine group. Weight, faeces and mental status were recorded each day and the histopathological changes (goblet cells etc) of the colon were observed after sacrificed. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000 was measured to reflect the intestinal mucosal permeability. In addition, cell junction-related proteins and possible signal pathways were investigated.QingBai decoction could significantly alleviate the inflammation and the protection effect of colitis is comparable as those in mesalazine enema group. It was found that the permeability reduced significantly with QBD treatment vs the control group, while no significant difference between the mesalazine and QBD groups. QBD treatment could upregulate the expression of tight junction complex（ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin）and muc-2 expression. It significantly reduced the production and secretion of serials proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, Kc and TNF-α) compared with the control group. Meanwhile, NF-κ and Notch pathways were regulated.QingBai decoction can effectively alleviate intestinal inflammation and mucosal barrier function in colitis mice, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of inflammatory cascade as well as enhanced mucus layer barrier and mechanical barrier function by NF-κ and Notch signalling.© 2019 The Authors.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco-2 cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco-2 cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase  (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco-2 cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614203>Patchouli alcohol activates PXR and suppresses the NF-κ-mediated intestinal inflammatory.</a></h2><p>Pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) is involved in inflammatory bowel disease (). Patchouli alcohol (PA) has anti-inflammatory effects; however, the mechanisms of PA on  remain largely unknown.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of PA that primarily focused on crosstalk between PA-mediated PXR activation and NF-κ inhibition.We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of PA with respect to PXR/NF-κ signalling using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, the identified PA as PXR agonist was evaluated by hPXR transactivation assays and assessing CYP3A4 expression and activity. NF-κ inhibition were analysed based on NF-κ Luciferase assays, NF-κ-mediated pro-inflammatory genes expression and NF-κ nuclear translocation after activating PXR by PA. In vivo, colonic mPXR and NF-κ signalling were analysed to assess PA-mediated the protective effect against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PXR was further evaluated the protection of PA against DSS-induced colitis.PA induced CYP3A4 expression and activity via an hPXR-dependent mechanism. PA-mediated PXR activation attenuated inflammation by inhibiting NF-κ activity and nuclear translocation. The anti-inflammatory effect of PA on NF-κ was abolished by PXR knockdown. PA prevented DSS-induced inflammation by regulating PXR/NF-κ signalling, whereas pharmacological PXR inhibition abated PA-mediated suppressive effects on NF-κ inflammation signalling.PA activates PXR signalling and suppresses NF-κ signalling, consequently causing ameliorating inflammation. Results highlight the importance of PXR-NF-κ crosstalk in colitis and suggest a novel therapeutic reagent.Copyright © 2019.

The mean follow-up was 5.8 years (Std. Dev.: 6.72). Abdominal imaging examinations were present in 220 patients and revealed findings from the liver, biliary tract and pancreas in 55% of examined patients (120/220). The most frequent findings or manifestations from the liver, biliary tract and pancreas were fatty liver (20%, 44/220), cholelithiasis (14.5%, 32/220) and acute pancreatitis (0.6%, 4/602), respectively. There were 7 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Regarding hepatitis viruses, one-third of the patients had been tested for hepatitis  and C. 5% (12/225) of them had positive hepatitis  surface antigen and 13.4% had past infection with hepatitis  virus (positive anti-HBcore). In addition, most of the patients were not immune against hepatitis  (negative anti-HBs), while 3% of patients were anti-HCV positive and only one patient had active hepatitis C. Furthermore, 24 patients had drug-related side effects from the liver and pancreas. The side effects included 21 cases of hepatotoxicity and 3 cases of acute pancreatitis. Moreover, there were two cases of HBV reactivation and one case of chronic hepatitis C, which were successfully treated.In our study, approximately one out of four patients had some kind by a hepatobiliary or pancreatic manifestation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns and to identify resistance genes of quinolones and colistin in Escherichia coli. There are very few patents on E. coli isolated from colorectal cancer. So, this study demonstrated that some bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin are not present resistance genes. As well as, new patterns for E. coli are presented for samples of patients with colorectal cancer.Of the three healthy, inflammatory bowel diseases () and colorectal cancer groups, 40 E. coli strains isolated after confirmation by biochemical and molecular methods. The susceptibility of isolates to antibiotics was investigated using disk diffusion test. After deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify genes encoding resistance to ciprofloxacin (qnr A, qnr ) and colistin (mcr-1).The results showed that E. coli isolates from colorectal cancer patients had the highest resistance to piperacillin (67.5%), ceftazidime (47.5%), and cefepime (42.5%). Also, E. coli strains isolated from  patients showed resistance to antibiotic ceftazidime 13%. More than 95% of E. coli strains isolated from healthy people were susceptible to antibiotics. Based on the results, 18 (15%) E. coli strains were showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. The qnr A gene was detected in 61.11% isolate; however qnr  was detected in 9 (50%). Isolates resistant to colistin were not observed.These findings indicate increased resistance of E. coli to ciprofloxacin in comparison with prior studies.

This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the disease pathogenesis and also the currently poorly described involvement of other systems such as the lymphatics. During DSS induced colitis, mice also develop a severe inflammation of terminal ileum with many features similar to . As well as inflammation within the ileum we have previously demonstrated lymphatic remodeling within the mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes of DSS-treated mice. The lymphatic remodeling includes lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic vessel dilation and leakiness, as well as cellular infiltration into the surrounding tissue and peripheral draining lymph nodes.  Intestinal inflammation was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Mice were treated with TLR4 blocker C34 or Polymyxin- (PMXB) daily from days 3 to 7 of DSS treatment via I.P. injection, and their therapeutic effects on disease activity and lymphatic function were examined. TLR activity and subsequent effect on lymphangiogenesis, lymphadenopathy, and mesenteric lymph node cellular composition were assessed.  DSS Mice treated with TLR4 inhibitor, C34, had a significantly improved disease phenotype characterized by reduced ileal and colonic insult. The change correlated with significant reduction in colonic and mesenteric inflammation, resolved mesenteric lymphangiectasia, and CD103 DC migration similar to that of healthy control. PMXB treatment however did not resolve inflammation within the colon or associated mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction but did however prevent lymphadenopathy within the MLN through alteration of CCL21 gradients and CD103 DC migration.  TLR4 appears to mediate several changes within the mesenteric lymphatics, more specifically it is shown to have different outcomes whether stimulation occurs through pathogen derived factors such as LPS or tissue derived DAMPs, a novel phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982369>Granulocyte-monocyte apheresis: an alternative combination therapy after loss of response to anti-TNF agents in ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p> To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of granulocyte-monocyte apheresis (GMA) after loss of response (LOR) to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in ulcerative colitis (UC).

Hence, it is important to develop radiation signatures that can distinguish between IR-induced inflammatory responses and pre-existing disease. In this study, we compared the gene expression response of a genetically modified mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (Il10) with that of a normal wild-type mouse to potentially develop transcriptomics-based biodosimetry markers that can predict radiation exposure in individuals regardless of pre-existing inflammatory condition.Wild-type (WT) and Il10 mice were exposed to whole body irradiation of 7 Gy X-rays. Gene expression responses were studied using high throughput whole genome microarrays in peripheral blood 24 h post-irradiation. Analysis resulted in identification of 1962 and 1844 genes differentially expressed (p < 0.001, FDR < 10%) after radiation exposure in Il10 and WT mice respectively. A set of 155 genes was also identified as differentially expressed between WT and Il10 mice at the baseline pre-irradiation level. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the 155 baseline differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in inflammatory response, glutathione metabolism and collagen deposition. Analysis of radiation responsive genes revealed that innate immune response and p53 signaling processes were strongly associated with up-regulated genes, whereas -cell development process was found to be significant amongst downregulated genes in the two genotypes. However, specific immune response pathways like MHC based antigen presentation, interferon signaling and hepatic fibrosis were associated with radiation responsive genes in Il10 mice but not WT mice. Further analysis using the IPA prediction tool revealed significant differences in the predicted activation status of T-cell mediated signaling as well as regulators of inflammation between WT and Il10 after irradiation.Using a mouse model we established that an inflammatory disease condition could affect the expression of many radiation responsive genes. Nevertheless, we identified a panel of genes that, regardless of disease condition, could predict radiation exposure. Our results highlight the need for consideration of pre-existing conditions in the population in the process of development of reliable biodosimetry markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123972>Extracellular Matrix Fragments of the Basement Membrane and the Interstitial Matrix Are Serological Markers of Intestinal Tissue Remodeling and Disease Activity in Dextran Sulfate Sodium Colitis.</a></h2><p>Chronic intestinal inflammation results in tissue damage partly caused by an increase in matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity causing degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.

Disease activity index (DAI) was scored daily. Serum was collected on day 0, 6, 7, and 16. ELISAs were used to quantify MMP-derived remodeling fragments of basement membrane type IV collagen (C4M and PRO-C4) and interstitial matrix type III collagen (C3M and rPRO-C3).In DSS rats, serum levels relative to baseline of C4M, PRO-C4, and C3M were elevated (P < 0.01; P < 0.001; P < 0.001) at day 7, which declined at day 16. Levels of rPRO-C3 were lower in DSS rats at day 7 and increased to normal levels at day 16. The ratio between C3M and rPRO-C3 showed an overall degradation (P < 0.0001) of collagen type III in DSS rats at day 7, which correlated to the DAI (r = 0.5588, P < 0.0001).Our data suggest that remodeling of the basement membrane (C4M and PRO-C4) and the interstitial matrix (C3M and rPRO-C3) increased during DSS-induced colitis and declined with reversal of the disease.

In this study, mice were infected with H. pylori SS1, and then colitis was induced by 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS), to investigate the role of the regulatory  cells in the effects of H. pylori infection on acute and chronic colitis. In acute and chronic colitis groups, DAI and colonic histological scores reduced significantly and colon length shorted less, the proinflammatory cytokines mRNA expression downregulated in colonic mucosa, and the percentages of CD19IL-10Breg cells were higher in the H. pylori/DSS co-treated groups compared with the DSS-treated groups.

Patients suffering from , including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning -associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an inflammatory milieu at the intestinal epithelium that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through gut-residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of gut immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the inflammatory microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice contain high levels of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened inflammatory response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κ activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa  kinase 2 (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, inflammatory, and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced colitis. Finally, using the DSS-induced colitis model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and halted colitis-associated bone loss. Our findings identify IKK2 in IECs as viable therapeutic target for colitis-associated osteopenia.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944110>Assessment of Crohn's disease-associated small bowel strictures and fibrosis on cross-sectional imaging: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Patients with Crohn's disease commonly develop ileal and less commonly colonic strictures, containing various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. While predominantly inflammatory strictures may benefit from a medical anti-inflammatory treatment, predominantly fibrotic strictures currently require endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery. Therefore, differentiation of the main components of a stricturing lesion is key for defining the therapeutic management. The role of endoscopy to diagnose the nature of strictures is limited by the superficial inspection of the intestinal mucosa, the lack of depth of mucosal biopsies and by the risk of sampling error due to a heterogeneous distribution of inflammation and fibrosis within a stricturing lesion. These limitations may be in part overcome by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT and MRI, allowing for a full thickness evaluation of the bowel wall and associated abnormalities. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary of currently used radiologic definitions of strictures. It discusses, by assessing only manuscripts with histopathology as a gold standard, the accuracy for diagnosis of the respective modalities as well as their capability to characterise strictures in terms of inflammation and fibrosis. Definitions for strictures on cross-sectional imaging are heterogeneous; however, accuracy for stricture diagnosis is very high. Although conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques have been reported to distinguish inflammation from fibrosis and grade their severity, they are not sufficiently accurate for use in routine clinical practice. Finally, we present recent consensus recommendations and highlight experimental techniques that may overcome the limitations of current technologies.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκ p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced -like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκ p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented -like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκ p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between  and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924357>Tryptophan (Trp) modulates gut homeostasis via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).</a></h2><p>The intestinal homeostasis is an orchestrated dynamic equilibrium state composed of the coexistence and interactions among the nutrients, microbial flora, and immune system. The intestinal balance disorder can trigger a series of diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (). Many of tryptophan (Trp) metabolites, such as kynurenine and indole, generated under a series of endogenous enzymes or microbial metabolism, have been reported enable to bind and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), this series of process is termed the Trp-AhR pathway. The activated Trp-AhR pathway can induce the expression of downstream cytokines such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), thereby regulating the intestinal homeostasis. This review highlights the advance of Trp-AhR pathway in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis and provides some insights for the clinical strategies that expect to effectively prevent and treat gut diseases via intervening the Trp-AhR pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266461>Structured physical activity interventions as a complementary therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease - a scoping review and practical implications.</a></h2><p>Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease () also suffer from a wide range of additional disorders, which may be caused by the disease, the side effect of the medication, or a lack of physical activity (PA). This results in reduced physical and psychological wellbeing. However, as known from other chronic diseases exercise could be utilized as supportive therapy for  patients. Main goals of this article are (a) collecting data of the effects structured physical activity interventions have on validated clinical parameters of  and health related symptoms, () developing activity recommendations for this clientele.A scoping review was conducted, searching for relevant articles published until May 2018, which investigated the effects of structured exercise interventions in  patients. The heterogeneity of the outcomes and the interventions did not support a quantitative synthesis thus, a qualitative discussion of the studies is provided.After reviewing 353 records, 13 eligible articles were identified. Five studies investigated aerobic exercise, three studies resistance exercise, three studies mind-body therapies and two studies yoga. The quality of the studies is mixed, and the duration is rather short for exercise interventions. Only few studies assessed validated  activity markers or inflammatory biomarkers. Nevertheless, the patients showed an increase in fitness, bone mineral density (BMD), quality of life and a decrease of  induced stress and anxiety. No severe adversial events were reported.Even though the evidence is limited the application of exercise interventions in  patients can be assumed to be safe and beneficial for the patients' overall-health, and  specific physical and psychosocial symptoms. But there is still a high demand for more thoroughly conducted studies, focussing on important clinical outcome parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30663410>Improved uptake and therapeutic intervention of curcumin via designing binary lipid nanoparticulate formulation for oral delivery in inflammatory bowel disorder.</a></h2><p>This study was focussed on development of curcumin loaded solid binary lipid nanoparticles (C-SBLNs) to ameliorate stability, uptake and therapeutic potential of curcumin during inflammatory bowel disease (). C-SBLNs with nano-size range (210.56 ± 41.22 nm) and high entrapment efficiency (83.12 ± 6.57%) were prepared by solvent emulsification evaporation method using binary lipids i.e. stearic acid and tristearin after optimizing various formulation and process variables. Physicochemical characterization of C-SBLNs by ATR-FTIR confirmed drug entrapment whereas thermal and pXRD study corroborated loss of crystallinity of drug into C-SBLNs. Lyophilized C-SBLNs were found to be spherical shaped with good gastrointestinal stability and prolonged drug release up to 24 h. Optimized C-SBLNs formulation displayed significantly enhanced cellular uptake and localization in inflamed tissues during . Oral administration of C-SBLNs in DSS induced colitis model revealed significant reduction in leucocyte infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) secretion and maintenance of colonic structure similar to healthy animal group compared to curcumin. Thus, in vitro and preclinical findings of study clearly confirmed that C-SBLNs could be a stable and efficacious alternative platform for curcumin delivery with strong competence in  chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666959>The Crohn's disease polymorphism,  T300A, alters the gut microbiota and enhances the local Th1/Th17 response.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is driven by dysfunction between host genetics, the microbiota, and immune system. Knowledge gaps remain regarding how  genetic risk loci drive gut microbiota changes. The Crohn's disease risk allele  T300A results in abnormal Paneth cells due to decreased selective autophagy, increased cytokine release, and decreased intracellular bacterial clearance. To unravel the effects of  T300A on the microbiota and immune system, we employed a gnotobiotic model using human fecal transfers into  T300A knock-in mice. We observed increases in  and Th1 and Th17 cells in  T300A mice. Association of altered Schaedler flora mice with  specifically increased Th17 cells selectively in  T300A knock-in mice. Changes occur before disease onset, suggesting that  T300A contributes to dysbiosis and immune infiltration prior to disease symptoms. Our work provides insight for future studies on  subtypes,  patient treatment and diagnostics.© 2019, Lavoie et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586453>Effects of Low-FODMAP Diet on Symptoms, Fecal Microbiome, and Markers of Inflammation in Patients With Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>There is limited evidence that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) reduces gut symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent .We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1.2, P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis,  longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent , we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent . www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Retrospective data were collected on consecutive children (age 2-18 years) referred to our pediatric gastroenterology clinic, for recurrent abdominal pain and/or altered bowel habit from 2007 to 2013. Subjects who had diagnostic workup: laboratory tests (FC, BII, white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) and IUS as initial assessment were eligible. Subjects with known gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, or signs or symptoms highly suggestive for organic diseases necessitating prompt endoscopy (e.g., perianal disease or rectal bleeding), or who had recently performed endoscopy were excluded. The accuracy of noninvasive tests for detecting  was assessed using endoscopic and/or radiological investigations, performed in subsequent clinical follow up, as reference gold standard.  Seventy-seven patients (mean age 11.3, 44 males) were included, 23 (29.9%) with a final diagnosis of . As single tests, FC gave the highest sensitivity (96%) but lower specificity (72%) and IUS highest specificity (96%) with lower sensitivity (70%). The combination of FC + IUS showed excellent accuracy for detecting children with  with positive predictive value: 100%; negative predictive value: 88.5%. The probability of  in children with normal FC, BII and IUS was 0.09%.  FC and increased BWT at IUS are accurate to guide reassurance or proceeding with further invasive procedures for detecting  in children with mild GI symptoms.</p></html>
