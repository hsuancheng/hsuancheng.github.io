First, cobalt  solution saturated electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous mat was subjected to sodium borohydride (NaBH) solution which results in the fabrication of three dimensional (3D) hierarchical multilayer network. Restructuring of the 2D mat into multilayered sponges with metal particles entrapment is attributed to the in-situ generated hydrogen gas into the interconnected pores of the fibrous network simultaneous with reduction of cobalt salt into metallic cobalt by NaBH. The resulting mesh was stabilized and carbonization at inert atmosphere to obtain metallic cobalt (Co) embedded 3D carbon nanofibrous networks (Co@3D-CNFs). Physicochemical characterization and electrochemical analysis were performed. Results show carbon network was found to be expanded with bubbling like structures often embedded metallic Co nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms the existence of the metallic cobalt particles on the carbon fiber networks. Furthermore, we establish a resulting composite (Co@3D-CNFs) identify the enhanced electrochemical performance having specific capacitance 762 F g compared to 173 and 180 F g for corresponding @3D-CNFs and 2D carbon nanofiber network with cobalt doped (Co@2D-CNFs) counterparts, respectively. The assembled Co2@3D-CNFs//NGH ASC device exhibits a high  density 24.6 W h Kg at 797 W kg power density with an operating voltage of 1.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The device further shows good capacitance retention (90.1%) after 5000 cycles. This research shows the simple and cost-effective strategy to make metallic particles embedded 3D porous carbonaceous electrode materials which can have great potential for  storage application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the effect of rehydrated and ensiled corn (REC), PS, and ST on intake, lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation profile, and chewing behavior of dairy cows. Kernels from an 84% vitreousness hybrid were finely (FN) or coarsely (CS) ground, yielding geometric mean particle sizes of 1,591 and 2,185 µm, respectively. Ground kernels were rehydrated [60% dry matter (DM)] and ensiled in 200-L buckets for ≥205 d. The grinding rate (t/h) was 3.9 for FN and 11.7 for CS. The PS did not affect DM loss (11.3% of ensiled) or silage pH (3.8). Samples of each bucket (n = 15/PS) before and after silage fermentation were incubated in situ for 0, 3, 6, 18, and 48 h in 4 rumen-cannulated lactating cows. Ensiling increased the effective ruminal in situ DM degradation (63.7 vs. 34.1%), regardless of PS. Sixteen Holstein cows (152 ± 96 d in milk) in 4 × 4 Latin squares (21-d periods) were individually fed a 2 × 2 factorial combination of low (LO) or high (HI) starch diets with FN or CS. Cows were fed the same REC incubated in situ. Varied concentration of starch in the diet (29.2 vs. 23.5% of DM) was achieved by partial replacement of REC (22.0 vs. 14.2% of DM) with citrus pulp (0 vs. 8.2% of DM). Milk, protein, fat, and lactose yields did not differ. Milk fat percentage was reduced and protein percentage was increased by HI. Treatment FN increased feed efficiency (-corrected milk/digestible organic matter intake) when fed with HI. Total-tract starch digestibility tended to be reduced by CS (96.4 vs. 97.2% of starch intake). Serum β-hydroxybutyrate was increased by LO. High-starch diet reduced the molar proportions of  and butyrate in ruminal fluid and increased propionate and isoacids. Particle size did not affect ruminal fermentation profile. Coarse grinding reduced plasma d-lactate concentration with HI. Diet HI reduced the proportion of daily intake from 1900 to 0700 h and induced preferential intake of feed particles <8 mm and greater refusal of particles >19 mm in the morning. Fine REC reduced rumination time per day and increased eating time per DM intake. Milk and plasma urea-N did not differ. Ensiling of mature flint corn for >200 d largely eliminated the effect of the PS of REC on the studied outcomes. The proportion of REC in the diet affected ruminal fermentation profile and milk solids concentration, but did not affect short-term performance and digestibility. Coarse grinding of REC may allow increasing the grinding rate and thus save labor and  during ensiling.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to  metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, , and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM  was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM SCFA function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590214>Chemical Compositions of Propolis from China and the United States and their Antimicrobial Activities Against .</a></h2><p>The chemical compositions of ethanol extracts of propolis from China (EEP-C) and the United States (EEP-A) and their antifungal activity against  were determined. The result showed that a total of 49 compounds were detected by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, 30 of which were present in samples from two regions. The major compounds of EEP-C and EEP-A were similar, including pinocembrin, pinobanksin-3--, galanin, chrysin, pinobanksin, and pinobanksin-methyl ether, and both of them showed antifungal activity against  with same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.8 mg·mL. In the presence of propolis, the mycelial growth was inhibited, the hyphae became shriveled and wrinkled, the extracellular conductivities were increased, and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were decreased. In addition, iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of  in response to propolis revealed that a total of 341 proteins were differentially expressed, of which 88 (25.8%) were upregulated and 253 (74.2%) were downregulated.

Here, we grew  with methanol provided as the electron donor and the humic analogue, anthraquione-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), provided as the electron acceptor when methane production was inhibited with bromoethanesulfonate. AQDS was reduced with simultaneous methane production in the absence of bromoethanesulfonate. Transcriptomics revealed that expression of the gene for the transmembrane, multiheme, -type cytochrome MmcA was higher in AQDS-respiring cells than in cells performing methylotrophic methanogenesis. A strain in which the gene for MmcA was deleted failed to grow via AQDS reduction but grew with the conversion of methanol or  to methane, suggesting that MmcA has a specialized role as a conduit for extracellular electron transfer. Enhanced expression of genes for methanol conversion to methyl-coenzyme M and the Rnf complex suggested that methanol is oxidized to carbon dioxide in AQDS-respiring cells through a pathway that is similar to methyl-coenzyme M oxidation in methanogenic cells. However, during AQDS respiration the Rnf complex and reduced methanophenazine probably transfer electrons to MmcA, which functions as the terminal reductase for AQDS reduction. Extracellular electron transfer may enable the survival of methanogens in dynamic environments in which oxidized humic substances and Fe(III) oxides are intermittently available.

In this work, we design a simple and facile bottom-up approach to fabricate a new family of 2D -based light lanthanide fluoride nanomaterials (F-Ln, Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) at room temperature and atmosphere pressure, for the first time. Various characterization techniques confirm that as-synthesized F-Ln exhibit an ultrathin morphology with thickness up to 1.45 nm and lateral dimensions up to several hundred nanometers. Microstructure analysis demonstrates that F-Ln are a series of defect-rich 2D nanomaterials, which consist of nanocrystals with sub-10 nm domains. Structure characterization of F-Ce, a typical example, infers that BN-like F-Ce one-atom-layers sandwiched by intercalated  anions stack alternately along [001] direction to form nanocrystal building blocks of F-Ce. The study of growth mechanism suggests that three procedures are involved in the formation of F-Ce: hydrolysis reaction of cerium(III) , structure transformation induced by fluorine ions, and assembly process guided by  anions. The as-prepared nanosheets show excellent stability with respect to environment stimuli such as air, heat, solvent, and high- electron beam.

To address this issue, the potential of different bacteria to produce biogas/biohydrogen from organic waste can be utilized as a source of renewable , however these pathogenic bacteria are not safe to use without strict contact isolation. In this study the role of safe food grade lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus spp.) was investigated for production of biogas from cheese waste with starting hexose concentration 32 g/L. The bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus was identified as one of the major biogas producers at optimum pH of 6.5. Further the optimum inoculum conditions were found to be 12.5% at inoculum age of 18 h. During the investigation the maximum biogas production was observed to be 1665 mL after 72 hours of incubation at pH 6.5. The biogas production was accompanied with production of other valuable metabolites in the form of organic acids including pyruvate, propionate, , lactate, formate and butyrate.

Cellulose can be modified by acetylation to provide a suitable and cost effective cellulose  which have high hydrophobic characteristics and are biodegradable. In this study, lignocellulosic samples-oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), pride of Barbados pods (POBP) and cocoa pods (CP)-with different compositions of lignin and hemicellulose, were acetylated using solvent free method. Effect of temperature on the acetylation of these samples at different reaction times were studied and used for the thermodynamic studies. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the significance of temperature variation with weight percent gain (WPG) due to acetylation of the lignocellulosics at different reaction times. FTIR studies showed evidence of successful acetylation reaction. ANOVA test showed no statistical difference in the observed variation of WPG due to acetylation of all the lignocellulosic samples, with temperature at different reaction times. The best acetylating period for OPEFB, POBP and CP were 60, 30 and 90 min respectively. Acetylation of the lignocellulosic samples were found to occur by absorbing heat from the environment. Values of entropy changes were positive while Gibb's free  change values were negative except at operating temperature of 303 K. Thus, acetylation of these lignocellulosic samples were spontaneous except at 303 K. Acetylated POBP has the lowest heat capacity (0.82 kJ mol K) compared to acetylated OPEFB (1.47 kJ mol K) and CP (1.15 kJ mol K). Low critical WPG showed that the mechanism of acetylating these materials were diffusion controlled. The critical temperatures of OPEFB, POBP and CP acetylation were found to be 282.6 K, 223.2 K and 260.5 K respectively.

However, CVD-grown graphene film contains surface contamination, which in turn hinders its potential applications, for example, in electrical and optoelectronic devices and in graphene-membrane-based applications.

During high-temperature CVD, the Cu-containing carbon source significantly increased the Cu content in the gas phase, which in turn suppressed the formation of contamination on the graphene surface by ensuring sufficient decomposition of the carbon feedstock. The as-received graphene with a surface cleanness of about 99% showed enhanced optical and electrical properties.

Long- and medium-chain fatty acids derived mainly from dietary triglycerides, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbial fermentation of the otherwise indigestible dietary fiber, constitute the major sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the metabolic network. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that FFAs serve not only as  sources but also as natural ligands for a group of orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), essentially intertwining metabolism and immunity in multiple ways, such as via inflammation regulation and secretion of peptide hormones. To date, several FFARs that are activated by the FFAs of various chain lengths have been identified and characterized. In particular, FFAR1 (GPR40) and FFAR4 (GPR120) are activated by long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, while FFAR3 (GPR41) and FFAR2 (GPR43) are activated by SCFAs, mainly , butyrate, and propionate.

However, according to our knowledge an overview on the methods used for prediction and the respective experimental data is missing. Therefore, we compiled experimental data, the techniques used for their determination and the models used for estimating the solubility. Our focus was on polymers commonly used in spray drying and hot-melt extrusion to form amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), namely polyvinylpyrrolidone grades (PVP), polyvinyl  (PVAc), vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl  copolymer (copovidone, COP), polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl -polyethylene glycol graft polymer (Soluplus®, SOL), different types of methacrylate copolymers (PMMA), polyethylene glycol grades (PEG) and hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose grades (HPMC). The literature data were further supplemented by our own results. The final data set included 37 APIs and two sugar derivatives. The majority of the prediction models was constituted by the melting point depression method, dissolution endpoint measurements, indirect solubility determination by T and the use of low molecular weight analogues. We observed that the API solubility depended more on the working group which conducted the experiments than on the measuring technique used. Furthermore, this compilation should assist researchers in choosing a prediction method suited for their investigations. Furthermore, a statistical assessment using recursive feature elimination was performed to identify descriptors of molecules, which are connected to the API solubility in polymeric matrices. It is capable of predicting the criterium 20% API soluble at 100 °C (Yes/No) for an unknown compound with a balanced accuracy of 71%. The identified 8 descriptors to be connected to API solubility in polymeric matrices were the number of hydrogen bonding donors, three descriptors related to the hydrophobicity of the molecule, glass transition temperature, fractional negative polar van der Waals surface area, out-of-plane potential  and the fraction of rotatable bonds. Finally, in addition to our own model, the data set should help researchers in training their own solubility prediction models.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing  intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group. Epididymal adipocyte volume was reduced in GbE-supplemented rats, as were epididymal [1-C]- incorporation into fatty acids, perilipin () and fatty acid synthase () mRNA, and FAS protein levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity is associated with insulin resistance, and in the present study we observed a reduction in the adipocyte volume of GbE-supplemented obese rats to dimensions equivalent to adipocytes from non-obese rats. GbE supplementation significantly reduced  accumulation and tended to reduce [H]-oleate incorporation, into epididymal adipose tissue, suggesting a potentially anti-obesogenic effect in longer term therapies. Further studies that investigate the effects of GbE supplementation in other experimental models are required to fully elucidate its suggested beneficial effects on mild chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051454>Green preparation of seaweed-based silver nano-liquid for cotton pathogenic fungi management.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were synthesised using the crude ethyl  extracts of  and evaluated their bioefficacy against two crop-damaging pathogens. The sets of lattice planes in the XRD spectrum for the Ag NPs were indexed to the 111, 200, 220 and 311 orientations and support the crystalline nature of the Ag NPs. The 3414 and 2968 cm peaks were observed in crude algal thallus extract and they were characteristic of terpenoids. Further, a peak at 1389 cm was observed as fatty acids. The marine macroalgae terpenoids and palmitic acid acted as reducing agent and stabiliser, respectively. The size (3 and 50 nm) and shape (spherical) of Ag NPs were recorded. The -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis exemplified the presence of silver in its elemental nature. Moreover,  Ag NPs were effective against two cotton phytopathogens namely  f.sp.

The influence of thermal treatment (90 °C) on the inhibition of the methanogenic archaea and enriching the acetogenic bacteria in different inocula (mesophilic and thermophilic) was initially tested. The most efficient inoculum that achieved the highest performance through the fermentation process was further used to define the optimum H/CO gas ratio that secures maximum production yield of chemicals and maximum biogas upgrading efficiency. In addition, 16S rRNA analysis of the microbial community was conducted at the end of the experimental period to target functional microbes. The maximum biogas content (77% (v/v)) and  yield (72%) were achieved for 2H:1CO ratio (v/v), with Moorella sp. 4 as the most dominant thermophilic acetogenic bacterium.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty Meishan gilts (body weight 30 ± 0.18 kg, n = 10 per treatment) were randomly assigned to a control (CON) or sweet potato vine (SPV) supplementation diet treatment. Gilts were housed in individual stalls. In the SPV treatment, 2 kg fresh sweet potato vine was used instead of 0.18 kg basal diet which provided the same amount of digestive  and crude protein with the exception of crude fiber (CON, 51.00 g/d vs. SPV, 73.94 g/d) in terms of dry matter intake. Gilts were slaughtered and samples were collected on day 19 after the third estrus cycle. The SPV treatment tended to increase slaughter weight of gilts ( = 0.07); it also increased ( < 0.05) gastrointestinal tract weight and intestinal muscle layer thickness. SPV treatment also decreased ( < 0.05) carcass yield and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The concentration of zonulin and endotoxin in plasma was decreased ( < 0.05) as the gilt consumed the SPV diet. Colonic fecal concentrations of endotoxin, lipocalin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were decreased ( < 0.05), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was increased ( < 0.05) in the SPV treatment. Butyric acid and  concentration in colonic content as well as  concentration in caecal content were increased ( < 0.05) in the SPV treatment. Furthermore, the expression of carnitine palmityl transferase () and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α () in gilt liver in SPV treatment was increased ( < 0.05) in comparison with CON treatment.

Xiexin Tang (XXT), a compound recipe composed of Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), has been reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, but its mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study found that Xiexin Tang markedly ameliorated the composition of the gut microbiota, especially for some short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, and then notably increased SCFAs production. However, the mechanism of XXT on the fermentation of gut bacteria and further improvement of obesity is not yet clear.This study aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism of XXT on the amelioration of obesity.Here, high-fat diet-induced obese rat model was established to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of XXT. Additionally, the expressions of key enzymes of gut microbe-derived SCFAs biosynthesis and key targets in the signaling pathway of  metabolism were investigated by ELISA and qPCR analysis.Results showed that XXT could notably correct lipid metabolism disorders, alleviate systematic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Additionally, XXT could increase gut microbiota-derived SCFAs-producing capacity by enhancing mRNA levels and activities of SCFA-synthetic key enzymes such as  kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD), butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), which markedly decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, elevated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and further lowered the  charge (EC) in obese rats via activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) signaling pathway. What's more, XXT could notably ameliorate dyslipidemia via increasing the gene expression of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocking mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Taken together, our data provided a novel insight into the role of XXT in losing weight from  metabolism regulation, which unraveled the molecular mechanism of XXT on the alleviation of dyslipidemia and fat heterotopic accumulation. The study provided useful information for XXT in clinical application to treat obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneously, encapsulation protects these active agents from oxidation, producing more stable active compounds. Formation of nanodroplets by spontaneously formed microemulsion (ME) offers, on one hand, a low- technology of encapsulation and, on the other hand, because of a small size of the droplets, it assures long-term stability even in harsher environments. In this study, oil-in-water MEs allowed the low- encapsulation of α-tocopherol (αToc) into an aqueous medium with the aid of fully food-grade ingredients, using isoamyl  as the dispersed oil phase, which was selected between three different types of oils. Both cosurfactant-free and cosurfactant-holder ME systems were formulated, in which Tween 20 and glycerol were employed as the surfactant and the cosurfactant, respectively. The ME monophasic area was determined through the construction of pseudoternary phase diagrams. The encapsulated αToc within 10-20 nm nanocapsules showed radical scavenging activity dependent on the encapsulated amount of αToc, as it was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The radical scavenging activity slightly increased within the time investigated, indicating a slow release of the active compound from the nanodroplets, which is a promising result for their application, especially in pharmaceuticals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425668>Mitochondria and Autophagy Dysfunction in Glucocorticoid-Induced Ocular Hypertension/Glaucoma Mice Model.</a></h2><p>: This study is aimed to investigate the effects of periocular steroids induction on intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and trabecular meshwork (TM) ultrastructure in glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension mice model. : Dexamethasone-21- (Dex-Ace) was administered through periocular conjunctival fornix injection every 3 days in C57BL/6J mice.

Here, we describe a salinity-tolerance mechanism mediated by lipid droplets (LDs). In the alga  grown under salt-stress conditions, we observed significant increases in cell size and LD content. LDs that were closely grouped along the plasma membrane shrank as the plasma membrane expanded, and some LDs were engulfed by vacuoles. Transcriptome analysis showed that genes encoding lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) and phospholipase A2 were significantly up-regulated following salt stress. Diacylglycerol kinase and LPLAT were identified in the proteome of salt-induced LDs, alongside vesicle trafficking and plastidial proteins and histone H2B. Analysis of fatty acid composition revealed an enrichment of C18:1 and C18:2 at the expense of C18:3 in response to salt stress. Pulse-chase experiments further suggested that variations of fatty acid composition were associated with LDs.  stimulation research further confirmed a positive role of LDs in cell growth under salt stress. These results suggest that LDs play important roles in salt-stress tolerance, through harboring proteins, participating in cytoplasmic component recycling, and providing materials and enzymes for membrane modification and expansion.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The introduced NFs have been fabricated in one step using a high-temperature thermal decomposition of the prepared electrospun nanofiber mats (nickel  tetrahydrate, chromium  dimer, and polyvinyl alcohol) in an inert atmosphere. The chemical composition of the NFs with different proportions of NiCr (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3) was established via standard characterization techniques. These techniques proved the formation of disorder CrNi alloy and carbon for all the formulations. The as-synthesized composite NFs exhibited a higher catalytic performance for AB dehydrogenation than that of Cr-free Ni-CNFs. Among all the formulations, the sample composed of 15% Cr shows the best catalytic performance, as more H was released in less time. Furthermore, it shows good stability, as it is recyclable with little decline in the catalytic activity after six cycles. It also demonstrates the activation , entropy (ΔS), and enthalpy (ΔH) with 37.6 kJ/mole, 0.094 kJ/mole, and 35.03 kJ/mole, respectively.

Organosolv pretreatment is commonly used for the fractionation of LCMs; however, these methods require high reaction temperatures, which remain problematic. In this study, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and electrochemical conversion were used for LCMs fractionation. This paper presents a modified organosolv pretreatment, termed electro-assisted organosolv pretreatment (EAOP), which utilises gamma-valerolactone and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium  as binary solution, in the presence of electrical . Importantly, EAOP can selectively fractionate lignin or cellulose at temperatures lower than 80 °C. Cellulose dissolution occurred at 2.4 V whereas lignin dissolution occurred at 4.2 V. A capacitance parameter was established and validated to describe the operating condition and selectively of EAOP. Operations conducted with capacitance less than 2317 F have the potential for cellulose solubilisation, whereas at capacitance exceeding 2317, lignin solubilisation was observed.

This study investigated the potential neuroprotective role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) against lead  (PbAc)-induced neurotoxicity. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups ( = 7) and treated as follows: the control group was injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl); the CoQ group was injected with CoQ (10 mg/kg); PbAc group was injected with PbAc (20 mg/kg); PbAc + CoQ group was injected first with PbAc, and after 1 h with CoQ. All groups were injected intraperitoneally for seven days. PbAc significantly increased cortical lipid peroxidation, nitrate/nitrite levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreased glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activity and mRNA expression, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and homoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. PbAc also promoted the secretion of interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited interleukin-10 production, triggered the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and suppressed anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, PbAc increased the cortical levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate, and decreased the level of ATP. However, treatment with CoQ rescued cortical neurons from PbAc-induced neurotoxicity by restoring the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppressing inflammation, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, and modulating cortical neurotransmission and  metabolism. Altogether, our findings indicate that CoQ has beneficial effects against PbAc-induced neuronal damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374279>Chitosan/tannic acid bilayers layer-by-layer deposited cellulose nanofibrous mats for antibacterial application.</a></h2><p>The research and development of environmentally friendly and nontoxic biomass products has become an important topic of worldwide concern.

Cellulose  (CA) mats prepared by electrospinning technology were converted to cellulose mats via alkali hydrolysis. Chitosan (CS) and tannic acid (TA) were used to fabricate the composite mats by using layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technology. The cellulose mats exhibited good fibrous structure, three-dimensional network and small average fiber diameter ranging from 300 to 400 nm. Besides, the results of mechanical properties testing and water contact angle measurements of these LBL-structured mats demonstrated that the LBL technology was able to improve their surface characteristics, hydrophilicity and mechanical properties. The analysis of antibacterial activity of the mats revealed over 86% antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and up to 99% antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Hence, the LBL-structured cellulose mats have excellent antibacterial activity and mechanical properties.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct metabolic pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential metabolic pathways. These metabolites and metabolic pathways were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism,  metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino acid metabolism,  metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various metabolic disorders (amino acid metabolism,  metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism). YGP, however, had the ability to mediate four kinds of microbes (i.e. Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and uncultured_bacterium_f_Bacteroidales_S24-7_group) and ten related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, valine, isoleucine, alanine, citrulline, , DMA, TMA, phenylalanine and tryptophan) mediated amino acid metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism, endocrine, immune and digestive system, and lipid metabolism, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on KYDS rats.Overall, our findings have preliminary confirmed that KYDS is closely related to metabolic and microbial dysbiosis, whereas YGP can improve the metabolic disorder of KYDS by acting on intestinal microbiota. Meanwhile, this will lay the foundation for the further KYDS's metagenomic research and the use of intestinal microbiotas as drug targets to treat KYDS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The method involves a rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-under voltage(UPLC-UV) technique using a sub-2 μm core-shell particle column for qualitative and quantitative analysis of four phenolic glycoside isomers from Idesia polycarpa Maxim. leaves. The partially purified samples from ethyl  extraction of ethanol extracts of I. polycarpa Maxim. leaves were obtained by HSCCC with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl -methanol-water solution (3:5:3:5, v/v/v/v) to obtain fractions I and II, which contain two phenolic glycoside isomers. The two fractions were further isolated by prep-HPLC to yield compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 with purities of 98.29%, 98.71%, 98.49% and 98.52%, and total recoveries of 93.5%, 72.2%, 75.5% and 88.3%, respectively. Compound 1 was first isolated from I. polycarpa Maxim., while compound 2 was reported to be a new phenolic glycoside, which is 1-[(6'-O-(Z)-p-coumaroyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl]-oxy-2-phenol. The chemical structures of the four phenolic glycoside isomers were analyzed and confirmed by UPLC, UV, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR), 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectra.

Increasing mouthguard thickness improved the mouthguards' shock absorption capacities. Also, adding labial inserts increased their preventive qualities in ascending order: Mouthguard with a soft insert (nylon mesh), a hard insert (PETG), air space plus a hard insert (PETG).Increasing EVA foil thickness of a mouthguard, increasing labial thickness, and adding labial inserts (soft, stiff and air space) improve mouthguard shock absorption capabilities during small hard object collisions, thereby improving dental trauma prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072263>Human TRPA1 activation by terpenes derived from the essential oil of daidai,  L. var.

As tons of industrial waste is obtained while processing the daidai juice, additional utilization of this waste has great social value. In our study, we prepared the essential oil from the waste obtained during daidai juice processing and demonstrated that the oil activates human TRPA1 (hTRPA1). This oil contains 10 types of terpenes, all of which activated hTRPA1 with an EC value of 6-167 µM. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show a hTRPA1 activation by five terpenes: linalyl , geranyl , osthole, geranyl propionate, and neryl .

The organisms that facilitate this process, methanogenic archaea, belong to a large and phylogenetically diverse group that thrives in a wide range of anaerobic environments. Two main subgroups exist within methanogenic archaea: those with and those without cytochromes. Although a variety of metabolisms exist within this group, the reduction of growth substrates to methane using electrons from molecular hydrogen is, in a phylogenetic sense, the most widespread methanogenic pathway. Methanogens without cytochromes typically generate methane by the reduction of CO with electrons derived from H, formate, or secondary alcohols, generating a transmembrane ion gradient for ATP production via an Na-translocating methyltransferase (Mtr). These organisms also conserve  with a novel flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism, wherein the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin is facilitated by the exergonic reduction of a disulfide terminal electron acceptor coupled to either H or formate oxidation. Methanogens that utilize cytochromes have a broader substrate range, and can convert  and methylated compounds to methane, in addition to the ability to reduce CO Cytochrome-containing methanogens are able to supplement the ion motive force generated by Mtr with an H-translocating electron transport system. In both groups, enzymes known as hydrogenases, which reversibly interconvert protons and electrons to molecular hydrogen, play a central role in the methanogenic process. This review discusses recent insight into methanogen metabolism and  conservation mechanisms with a particular focus on the genus .Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460484>Transparent Hydrophobic Hybrid Silica Films by Green and Chemical Surfactants.</a></h2><p>Monodispersed and transparent hybrid silica wires were synthesized by the sol-gel method using the chemical surfactant trimethoxyoctylsilane (CTMOS or CHOSi) and, for the first time, by green surfactants (/lotus leaf extract). The purpose was to introduce a less toxic, cost-effective, and one-step easy approach to get superhydrophobic silica films. Each of the surfactants was used at two different concentrations to investigate hydrophobicity of the films. Assembly of silica wires was obtained by dip-coating and vacuum filtration methods on glass and cellulose  filter paper as substrates, respectively. The water contact angle (CA) up to 154° was measured for hybrid silica films on filter paper, which revealed their superhydrophobicity as compared to hydrophobic behavior of those films coated on a glass substrate with CA up to 135°. Chemical, optical, and structural properties of prepared films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. The hybrid silica wires prepared displayed good transparency, low surface , and superhydrophobicity.

It is unclear whether these responses are triggered by sweet taste sensing per se. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of sweet taste sensing involving a low- sweetener, aspartame, alters gastric emptying, blood glucose, and plasma insulin responses during and after the prandial phase. Nine participants rinsed their mouths with either 25 mL of water (control) or a 2.5% GS solution, and then ingested 200 g (50 g × four times) of either 0.09% aspartame or 15% glucose solution containing 100 mg of C-sodium . Gastric emptying was measured with a C breath test. Blood glucose and plasma insulin were measured at baseline as well as during and after ingestion of the sweet solutions. Decreased subjective sweet taste intensity was observed in the GS group for both the aspartame and glucose trials. In the aspartame trial, no measurements showed significant differences between either group. In the glucose trial, gastric emptying was delayed in the GS group compared to controls. In the initial phase, both during and after glucose ingestion in the glucose trial, blood glucose and plasma insulin responses were lower in the GS group than the controls. The presence or absence of sweet taste-sensing involving glucose had a significant effect on gastric emptying and glycemic metabolism, both during and after the prandial phase, as opposed to the effects involving aspartame.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, an economic, green and easy-scalable sol-gel synthesis method was adopted to produce submicron-sized nanoporous CuO NP aggregates with a specific surface area > 18 m²/g. To this end, a copper-carbonate containing precursor was precipitated from a mixed solution of copper  and ammonia carbonate and subsequently calcinated at T ≥ 250 °C. The thus obtained CuO nanopowder is composed of weakly-bounded agglomerates, which are constituted of aggregated CuO NPs with a tunable size in the range of 100-140 nm. The CuO aggregates, in turn, are composed of equi-axed primary crystallites with a tunable crystallite size in the range of 20-40 nm. The size and shape of the primary CuO crystallites, as well as the nanoporosity of their fused CuO aggregates, can be tuned by controlled variation of the degree of supersaturation of the solution via the pH and the carbonate concentration.

Vibration damping is thus of interest from a comfort and performance standpoint. Our purpose was to assess whether changes in midsole material affect the properties of (a) soft-tissue vibrations and (b) myoelectric activity.Two midsole conditions were compared. The control condition corresponded to a full ethylene-vinyl- foam midsole. The experimental condition was a bi-material midsole with a material combination of viscous and visco-elastic materials. Twelve participants ran on an indoor track in both conditions while recording the longitudinal acceleration and EMG activity of vastus medialis (VM) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM). Wavelet transforms were performed for EMG and acceleration signals to assess the intensity of the muscle activity at low- and high-frequencies (37-128 Hz and 170-395 Hz, respectively), and to calculate the damping coefficient (D) for soft-tissue vibrations. The soft-tissue vibrations were also characterized by the peak of acceleration (apeak), the frequency of the power peak (fpeak) and the power of the soft-tissue vibrations (PSD[8-55]).The variables apeak and PSD[8-55] decreased for VM and GM in the viscous condition. Prior heel strike, low-frequency EMG activity decreased for VM and high-frequency EMG activity tended to decrease for GM in the viscous condition. The damping D was reduced only for VM, and fpeak was unchanged.A more viscous midsole substantially reduced the amplitude of soft-tissue vibrations, but not their frequency. Looking at individual results, it was noted that muscle activity was tuned in response to the acceleration input, and that the damping of soft-tissue vibrations was affected by the intensity of muscle activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108309>Organic carbon source-dependent properties of soluble microbial products in sequencing batch reactors and its effects on membrane fouling.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the influence of three different organic carbon sources including sodium  (SOD), glucose (GLU), and starch (STAR), on soluble microbial products (SMP), which presumably have dissimilar uptake rates and metabolic pathways, in sequencing batch reactors (SBR) and their subsequent effects on membrane fouling of ultrafiltration (UF). SMP were mainly characterized by fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SMP produced in SOD-fed SBR showed higher abundances of protein-like fluorescent component and large sized aliphatic biopolymer (BP) than GLU- or STAR-fed counterpart did, while the STAR-based operation resulted in more SMP enriched with humic-like fluorescence. The differences in SMP exerted marked effects on UF membrane fouling as indicated by the highest fouling potential with reversibility shown for the SMP from the SOD-fed reactor. Regardless of the carbon source, BP fraction and protein-like component exhibited the greatest extent of reversible fouling, suggesting that size exclusion plays a critical role. However, notable differences in the reversible fouling propensity of relatively smaller size fractions among the three SBRs signified the possible involvement of chemical interactions as a secondary fouling mechanism and its dependency on different carbon sources. Our results provide a new insight into the roles of carbon sources in the characteristics of SMP in biological treatment systems and their effects on the post-treatment using membrane filtration, which is ultimately beneficial to the optimization of biological treatment design and membrane filtration operation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, selective methanogenesis control using the coenzyme M (CoM) and 2-bromoethanesulfonate (2-BES) was investigated in a two-chambered MEC to evaluate the effect of CoM and 2-BES on the production of different electrobiofuels, net  conversion efficiency and microbial community structure. Because the CoM is a crucial methyl-group carrier in the final process of methanogenesis, it was postulated that CoM would stimulate methanogenic activity at the anode, while a structural analog of the CoM (i.e., 2-BES) was expected to improve cathodic H yield using electrons conserved because of methanogen inhibition (electron equivalence: 8 mol e = 1 mol CH = 4 mol H). CoM injection in MECs significantly enhanced their CH production rate, purity, and yield by 4.5-fold, 14.5%, and 76.1%, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, microbial community analysis indicated that Methanosaeta, the major acetoclastic methanogen, continued to dominate the microbial community but steadily decreased in relative abundance after the CoM injection. On the other hand, drastic increases in hydrogenotrophic methanogens, such as Methanoculleus and Methanolinea, were observed along with potential syntrophic -oxidizing bacteria. In contrast, CH production in the 2-BES injected trials was significantly inhibited by 79.5%, resulting in a corresponding increase of H production by 145.5% compared to the control. Unlike the CoM, the microbial community did not noticeably change when 2-BES was injected, although the population size gradually decreased over time. Also, a single injection of CoM and 2-BES, even at low concentrations (500 μM), enabled the desired allocation of electrons as characterized by a high sensitivity, fast response, and negligible interference. In terms of  conversion efficiency, methanogenesis stimulation approach resulted in higher net  production than inhibition approach, whereas the remained electrons were not fully converted to hydrogen in case of the inhibition trial, thus producing less .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The electrospun fibers, mechanically reinforced by polyethylene oxide and impregnated with zinc oxide powder, were applied as an adsorbent surface to incorporate plasmonic centers (silver nanoprisms). The resulting structures - prepared in the absence (CA-ZnO) and in the presence of silver nanoparticles (CA-ZnO-Ag) - were developed to support light excitation, guiding and scattering prototypes of a RL. Both materials were excited by a pulsed (5 Hz, 5 ns) source at 355 nm and their fluorescence emission monitored at 387 nm. The results suggest that the addition of silver nanoprisms to the ZnO- enriched fiber matrix allows large improvement of the RL performance due to the plasmon resonance of the silver nanoprisms, with ~80% reduction in threshold . Besides the intensity and spectral analysis, the RL characterization included its spectral and intensity angular dependences.

Different physicochemical and microbial community analyses were conducted on samples collected from playas and an alluvial fan from surface, 10, 20, 50, and 80 cm depth. Gravimetric moisture content peaks were measured in 10 and 20 cm depth samples (from 1.65 to 4.1% w/w maximum values) while, in general, main anions such as chloride, nitrate, and sulfate concentrations increased with depth, with maximum values of 13-1,125; 168-10,109; and 9,904-30,952 ppm, respectively. Small organic anions such as formate and  had maximum concentrations from 2.61 to 3.44 ppm and 6.73 to 28.75 ppm, respectively. Microbial diversity inferred from DNA analysis showed Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria as the most abundant and widespread bacterial taxa among the samples, followed by Chloroflexi and Firmicutes at specific sites. Archaea were mainly dominated by Nitrososphaerales, Methanobacteria, with the detection of other groups such as Halobacteria. Metaproteomics showed a high and even distribution of proteins involved in primary metabolic processes such as  production and biosynthetic pathways, and a limited but remarkable presence of proteins related to resistance to environmental stressors such as radiation, oxidation, or desiccation.

Mutants that utilize ethylene glycol as sole carbon source were isolated through adaptive laboratory evolution. Genomic analysis of these mutants revealed a central role of the transcriptional regulator GclR, which represses the glyoxylate carboligase pathway as part of a larger metabolic context of purine and allantoin metabolism. Secondary mutations in a transcriptional regulator encoded by PP_2046 and a porin encoded by PP_2662 further improved growth on ethylene glycol in evolved strains, likely by balancing fluxes through the initial oxidations of ethylene glycol to glyoxylate.

Fabrication of nanocomposite membranes by incorporating various nanomaterials in the polymer matrix has shown promise for enhancing membrane flux. In this study, we embed functionalized cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) with high aspect ratios in the polymer matrix to create hydrophilic nanochannels that reduce membrane resistance and facilitate the facile transport of water molecules through the membrane. The results showed that the incorporation of 0.1 wt % CNF into the polymer matrix did not change the membrane flux (~15 L · m - 2 · h - 1 ) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fraction V rejection, while increasing the CNF content to 0.3 wt % significantly enhanced the flux by seven times to ~100 L · m - 2 · h - 1 , but the rejection was decreased to 60-70%. Such a change in membrane performance was due to the formation of hydrophilic nanochannels by the incorporation of CNF (corroborated by the SEM images), decreasing the membrane resistance, and thus enhancing the flux. When the concentration of the CNF in the membrane matrix was further increased to 0.6 wt %, no further increase in the membrane flux was observed, however, the BSA rejection was found to increase to 85%. Such an increase in the rejection was related to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively-charged CNF-loaded nanochannels and the BSA, as demonstrated by zeta potential measurements.

We investigated the effects of roughage sources and concentrate types on growth performance, ruminal fermentation, and blood metabolite levels in growing cattle.In this 24-week trial, 24 Hanwoo cattle (224±24.7 kg) were fed similar nitrous and  levels of total mixed ration formulated using two kinds of roughage (timothy hay and ryegrass straw) and two types of concentrate mixes (high starch [HS] and high fiber [HF]). The treatments were arranged in a 2×2 factorial, consisting of 32% timothy-68% HS, 24% timothy-76% HF, 24% ryegrass-76% HS, and 17% ryegrass-83% HF. Daily feed intakes were measured. Every four weeks, blood were sampled, and body weight was measured before morning feeding. Every eight weeks, rumen fluid was collected using a stomach tube over five consecutive days.The mean dry matter intake (7.33 kg) and average daily gain (1,033 g) did not differ among treatments. However, significant interactions between roughage source and concentrate type were observed for the rumen and blood parameters (p<0.05). Total volatile fatty acid concentration was highest (p<0.05) in timothy-HF-fed calves. With ryegrass as the roughage source, decreasing the roughage inclusion rate increased the molar proportion of propionate and decreased the -to-propionate ratio; the opposite was observed with timothy as the roughage source. Similarly, the effects of concentrate types on plasma total protein, alanine transaminase, Ca, inorganic P, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine concentrations differed with roughage source (p<0.05).Decreasing the dietary roughage inclusion rate by replacing forage neutral detergent fiber with that from non-roughage fiber source might be a feasible feeding practice in growing cattle. A combination of low-quality roughage with a high fiber concentrate might be economically beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058160>The Effects of Vegetarian and Vegan Diets on Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>The difference in gut microbiota composition between individuals following vegan or vegetarian diets and those following omnivorous diets is well documented. A plant-based diet appears to be beneficial for human health by promoting the development of more diverse and stable microbial systems. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have significantly higher counts of certain -related operational taxonomic units compared to omnivores. Fibers (that is, non-digestible carbohydrates, found exclusively in plants) most consistently increase lactic acid bacteria, such as , and , and reduce  and  species. Polyphenols, also abundant in plant foods, increase  and , which provide anti-pathogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection. High fiber intake also encourages the growth of species that ferment fiber into metabolites as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including , propionate, and butyrate. The positive health effects of SCFAs are myriad, including improved immunity against pathogens, blood-brain barrier integrity, provision of  substrates, and regulation of critical functions of the intestine. In conclusion, the available literature suggests that a vegetarian/vegan diet is effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both human gut microbiome and overall health. This review will focus on effects of different diets and nutrient contents, particularly plant-based diets, on the gut microbiota composition and production of microbial metabolites affecting the host health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404417>Effect of dietary concentrate to forage ratio on growth performance, rumen fermentation and bacterial diversity of Tibetan sheep under barn feeding on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to research the effects of different dietary concentrate to forage (C:F) ratio on growth performance, rumen fermentation and bacteria diversity of barn feeding Tibetan sheep. The experiment contains fiver treatments (HS1, HS2 HS3, HS4 and HS5;  = 8, respectively) based on dietary C:F ratios 0:100, 15:85, 30:70, 45:55, and 60:40, respectively. The ruminal bacterial community structure was investigated through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in V4 hypervariable region. The results showed that increasing dietary concentrate feed level from 0% to 60% exerted a positive effect on DMI, BW gain, gain rate and feed conversation ratio (F) in Tibetan sheep. The increases dietary concentrate feed level elevatedNH-N, propionate and valerate concentrations, whereas, reduced molar ratio of  to propionate (A/P ratio) ( < 0.05). For rumen bacterial diversity, increases in dietary concentrate content contributed to lower alpha diversity indexes including Shannon wiener, Chao1 and observed species, meanwhile, significantly increased the abundances of the phylum  and the genus  ( < 0.05). In conclusion, increases dietary concentrate content improved the growth performance and Tibetan sheep fed diets of 45% concentrate obtained a better performance; the inclusion of concentrate in feed changed rumen fermentation from  fermentation to propionate fermentation, and improved the  utilization efficiency of Tibetan sheep; the increased in concentrate content significantly reduced rumen bacteria diversity and changed the abundance of some core bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271774>A concerted systems biology analysis of phenol metabolism in Rhodococcus opacus PD630.</a></h2><p>Rhodococcus opacus PD630 metabolizes aromatic substrates and naturally produces branched-chain lipids, which are advantageous traits for lignin valorization. To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C-metabolic flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol metabolism. We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; 2) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and 5) gluconeogenesis occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and ) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network. These findings improve our understanding of R. opacus' metabolism for future lignin valorization.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

However, low concentrations of VFAs in water have prevented their commercial production, even with modern separation technologies, due to the high operating costs. We have applied newly developed solvents, selected by chemical structure similarity, to the separation of five different VFAs.Since most of the water was separated by extraction using hexyl  and nonyl , the utilities necessary for solvent recovery and product purification were a fraction of those required by the existing VFAs' separation processes. The solvents separated almost all the water in the feed at the extraction stage, consuming no . The  use in this study is only 34% of the lowest case use among various processes of either distillation-only or combined extraction-distillation.The performance evaluation of the proposed VFAs separation process showed that product recovery was 99% and acid purity was 99.5% with eco-scores of 70% lower than those of the current processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404165>Origin of Short-Chain Organic Acids in Serpentinite Mud Volcanoes of the Mariana Convergent Margin.</a></h2><p>Serpentinitic systems are potential habitats for microbial life due to frequently high concentrations of microbial  substrates, such as hydrogen (H), methane (CH), and short-chain organic acids (SCOAs). Yet, many serpentinitic systems are also physiologically challenging environments due to highly alkaline conditions (pH > 10) and elevated temperatures (>80°C). To elucidate the possibility of microbial life in deep serpentinitic crustal environments, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 366 drilled into the Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoru serpentinite mud volcanoes on the Mariana Forearc. These mud volcanoes differ in temperature (80, 150, 250°C, respectively) of the underlying subducting slab, and in the porewater pH (11.0, 11.2, 12.5, respectively) of the serpentinite mud. Increases in formate and  concentrations across the three mud volcanoes, which are positively correlated with temperature in the subducting slab and coincide with strong increases in H concentrations, indicate a serpentinization-related origin. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that formate is produced by equilibrium reactions with dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) + H, and that equilibration continues during fluid ascent at temperatures below 80°C. By contrast, the mechanism(s) of  production are not clear. Besides formate, , and H data, we present concentrations of other SCOAs, methane, carbon monoxide, and sulfate, δC-data on bulk carbon pools, and microbial cell counts. Even though calculations indicate a wide range of microbial catabolic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable, concentration profiles of potential  substrates, and very low cell numbers suggest that microbial life is scarce or absent. We discuss the potential roles of temperature, pH, pressure, and dispersal in limiting the occurrence of microbial life in deep serpentinitic environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390749>Carnosine Decreases PMA-Induced Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide composed of β-alanine and L-histidine. This naturally occurring molecule is present at high concentrations in several mammalian excitable tissues such as muscles and brain, while it can be found at low concentrations in a few invertebrates. Carnosine has been shown to be involved in different cellular defense mechanisms including the inhibition of protein cross-linking, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species detoxification as well as the counteraction of inflammation. As a part of the immune response, macrophages are the primary cell type that is activated. These cells play a crucial role in many diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, carnosine was first tested for its ability to counteract oxidative stress. In our experimental model, represented by RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitors, carnosine was able to decrease the intracellular concentration of superoxide anions (O•) as well as the expression of Nox1 and Nox2 enzyme genes. This carnosine antioxidant activity was accompanied by the attenuation of the PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation, the down-regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs, and the up-regulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1. Additionally, when carnosine was used at the highest dose (20 mM), there was a generalized amelioration of the macrophage  state, evaluated through the increase both in the total nucleoside triphosphate concentrations and the sum of the pool of intracellular nicotinic coenzymes. Finally, carnosine was able to decrease the oxidized (NADP)/reduced (NADPH) ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in a concentration dependent manner, indicating a strong inhibitory effect of this molecule towards the main source of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our data suggest a multimodal mechanism of action of carnosine underlying its beneficial effects on macrophage cells under oxidative stress and inflammation conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257376>Cascade cyclization and acyl migration of propargylic esters with isocyanides: rapid access to substituted furans.</a></h2><p>A novel rearrangement of ester-activated propargylic  with isocyanide has been disclosed.

Two types of blends were prepared using nitrile rubber (NBR), brominated butyl rubber (BIIR) and ethylene-vinyl  copolymer (EVA): NBR/BIIR and NBR/BIIR/EVA. The vulcanization, mechanical and damping properties of the blends were analyzed. The results show that both blends exhibit excellent vulcanization plateaus and mechanical properties. For NBR/BIIR, as the BIIR content increases, the complementary effects of NBR and BIIR afforded by blending are enhanced. Two damping peaks appeared in the tanδ-T curve and shifted toward lower and higher temperatures, respectively, which clearly widened the effective damping temperature range. However, the damping value in the valley of the tanδ-T curve was as low as 0.39. For NBR/BIIR/EVA, the addition of EVA greatly increased damping in the valley of the tanδ-T curve to approximately 0.54. EVA was observed to be the optimal polymer for improving the compatibility of the NBR/BIIR blend. Moreover, hot air thermal aging tests showed that both blends demonstrated good stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109517>Impact of turning waste on performance and  balance in thermophilic solid-state anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste.</a></h2><p>Mixing is an important operation in solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) to improve the mass transfer of the solid phase. This study proposed simple turning by loader in common garage-type digester without commonly used mixer or percolation system (simplified SS-AD). In simplified-SS-AD, turning is conducted in open condition. Thus, oxidation of anaerobic sludge during turning would influence digestion performance. Therefore, in this study, the effect of turning wastes by mixing during digestion on a simplified SS-AD fed with rice straw and pig urine was investigated. Four different mixing frequency levels-no mixing (M0) and mixing once a day (M-1/1), once every 3 days (M-1/3) and once a week (M-1/7)-were conducted. Methane yields of M0, M-1/3 and M-1/7 were comparable with each other. Methane yield and lag period of M-1/1 were approximately 61% and 155% of M0 (351.2  mL/g VS and 4.7 days), respectively. Furthermore, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of  accumulated in the digestate of M-1/1 was comparable to the difference in the COD of methane production between M-1/1 and the other treatments. Mixing every day also resulted in a higher oxidation-reduction potential and carbon dioxide content. These findings suggest that methanogenesis was inhibited in M-1/1 by frequent mixing in the atmosphere. Net  analysis of SS-AD plant operation showed that M0 can obtain the highest net  gain, whereas net  production of M-1/7 was reduced by rewarming after mixing. Therefore, no mixing is the most effective approach for the proposed simplified process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Alkaline conditions alter the thermodynamic stability of iron minerals, influencing their availability for interspecies syntrophic interactions. We have modeled anaerobic alkaliphilic microbial associations in ethanol-oxidizing co-culture of an obligate syntroph Candidatus "Contubernalis alkalaceticum" and a facultative lithotroph Geoalkalibacter ferrihydriticus, which is capable of dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction and homoacetogenic oxidation of Fe(II) with CO. The co-cultures were cultivated with thermodynamically metastable ferric-containing ferrihydrite, or ferrous-containing siderite, or without minerals. Mössbauer spectral analysis revealed the transformation of both minerals to the stable magnetite. In the presence of ferrihydrite, G. ferrihydriticus firstly reduced Fe(III) with ethanol and then switched to syntrophic homoacetogenesis, providing the growth of obligate syntroph on ethanol. The ability of G. ferrihydriticus to accept hydrogen from its syntrophic partner and produce extra  from carbonate during ethanol oxidation was confirmed by co-culture growth without minerals. In the presence of siderite, G. ferrihydriticus performed homoacetogenesis using two electron donors simultaneously- siderite and hydrogen. Pieces of evidence for direct and indirect hydrogen-mediated electron exchange between partner organisms were obtained. Relative abundancies of partner organisms and the rate of  production by their co-cultures were strongly determined by thermodynamic benefits, which G. ferrihydriticus got from redox transformations of iron minerals. Even the minor growth of G. ferrihydriticus sustained the growth of the syntroph. Accordingly, microbe-to-mineral interactions could represent underestimated drivers of syntrophic interactions in alkaline sedimentary environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512699>Comparison of two field-induced Er single ion magnets.</a></h2><p>We present the synthesis, magnetic and photophysical properties of four mononuclear Ln complexes in two isostructural lattices containing Gd and Er.

The assays were conducted with heat-treated  cell-free extract devoid of background activity to allow the quick assessment of a relatively large number of (thermophilic) enzymes. Selected enzymes were also purified to allow the determination of the enzyme kinetics for competing cofactors. Following the results of the glucokinase (GK), galactokinase, xylulokinase (XK), and ribokinase assays, it seems that phosphorylation of monosaccharides by and large is mainly GTP-dependent. Some possible implications of this relating to the adenylate/guanylate  charge are discussed here. Besides the highly expressed pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, another 6-phosphofructokinase was found to be equally dependent on ATP and GTP, while no 6-phosphofructokinase activity could be demonstrated for a third.

We determine electron addition and water decomposition energetics for this water-containing molecule using density-functional methods and include the recent Fermi-Löwdin-Orbital self-interaction correction. We find that it only costs 0.32 eV to add four electrons to the parent molecule. Furthermore, due to the strong Coulomb attractions between hydroxyl anions and the Mn cations, the  cost for breaking the four coordinating water molecules into four coordinating hydroxyls and two hydrogen molecules is decreased in the tetra-anionic structure relative to the neutral structure. We calculate magnetic anisotropy barriers for the neutral molecule and the dehydrogenated tetra-anion and show that large changes in the magnetic anisotropy arise the strong attraction between the hydroxyl anions and four of the crown Mn cations.

However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced  in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for metabolic engineering because  causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow metabolism can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular metabolism caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C metabolic flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and metabolic perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to glycolysis, chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase  yield and recycle carbon sources. When the pathways for several valuable compounds were introduced to mutant strains, specific yield of them were highly improved.

Results indicated that although the three different HRTs provided a stable process with a steady-state of methane production, both methane yield (161 L kg-VS 25% higher) and volatile solids removal (VS, 50%, 2-fold higher) increased during longer HRTs. Redundancy analysis results indicated that Sporosarcina and Methnosarcina positively correlated to VS removal and methane yield, and negatively correlated to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation.

Polycrystalline CoO nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on CNT walls, providing additional confinement of polysulfides by strong chemical adsorption. In addition, the different content of CoO in the microspheres was regulated by the amount of added cobalt source during the preparation process.

However, most studies that have examined chemosensory responses to alcohols have reported that alcohols are sensed as repellents, which is consistent with their toxic properties. In this study, we examined the chemotaxis of  F1 to -alcohols with chain lengths of one to twelve carbons.  F1 was attracted to all -alcohols that served as growth substrates (C2-C12) for the strain, and the responses were induced when cells were grown in the presence of alcohols. By assaying mutant strains lacking single or multiple methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, the receptor mediating the response to C2-C12 alcohols was identified to be McfP, the ortholog of the  KT2440 receptor for C2 and C3 carboxylic acids. Besides -alcohols, McfP was required for the response of  F1 to pyruvate, L-lactate, , and propionate,which are detected by the KT2440 receptor, and the medium and long chain carboxylic acids hexanoic acid and dodecanoic acid. β-Galactosidase assays of  F1 carrying a  transcriptional fusion showed that the  gene is not induced in response to alcohols. Together, our results are consistent with the idea that the carboxylic acids generated from the oxidation of alcohols are the actual attractants sensed by McfP in  F1, rather than the alcohols themselves.Alcohols, released as fermentation products and produced as intermediates in the catabolism of many organic compounds including hydrocarbons and fatty acids, are common components of the microbial food web in soil and sediments. Although they serve as good carbon and  sources for many soil bacteria, alcohols have primarily been reported to be repellents rather than attractants for motile bacteria. Little is known about how alcohols are sensed by microbes in the environment. We report here that catabolizable -alcohols with linear chains of up to twelve carbons serve as attractants for the soil bacterium , and rather than being detected directly, alcohols appear to be catabolized to , which is then sensed by a specific cell-surface chemoreceptor protein.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257616>Strategy for rapid screening of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory active ingredients in Gynura procumbens (Lour.)

The modified kaolin is scanned by electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET), which indicate that the natural kaolin is peeled off to form fine flakes and the interlayer spacing is significantly increased. The coal-kaolin combustion tests were performed in a tube furnace from 900°C to 1300°C. It is found that the enrichment of heavy metals is enhanced obviously during the coal combustion, especially when the raw kaolin has high activity. Besides, the adsorption effects on the above four heavy metals are different. To be specific, the kaolin modified by potassium  has a better performance for Zn and Pb, but that intercalated by dimethyl sulfoxide shows better influences on Cd and Cr. The modified kaolin can provide more active sites for the adsorption of heavy metals, enhance chemical adsorption, and fix heavy metals in the form of aluminosilicates, silicates and aluminates. These founding could reduce the pollutant emissions of coal combustion in industrial applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521281>Modulating size and surface charge of ethylcellulose nanoparticles through the use of cationic nano-emulsion templates.</a></h2><p>Ethylcellulose nano-emulsions have been obtained by the low- phase inversion composition method in the Water / [Alkylamidoammonium: Cremophor WO7] / [6% ethylcellulose in ethyl ] system at 25 °C. It is shown that nano-emlulsions' composition variables (oil-to-surfactant ratio, cationic: nonionic surfactant ratio and polymer and water content) produce changes in their droplet diameter, surface charge and colloidal stability following defined trends. Nano-emulsions with good stability, droplet diameters between about 120 and 200 nm and surface charge from about 10 to 50 mV have been obtained. Nano-emulsions are further used as templates for nanoparticle dispersions preparation, which show sizes and surface charges typically smaller and similar respectively to their nano-emulsion templates. Cationic: nonionic surfactant ratio has the highest influence on both, size and surface charge, followed by oil-to-surfactant ratio and water content. Interestingly, the positive charge of the nanoparticles can be depleted under diluting conditions in a time-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This work reports an efficient heat localization material based on the renewable cellulose  cigarette filters and a reduced graphene oxide coating (RGO-CF) as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. RGO-CF possessed an aligned structure with superhydrophilic nature, lower thermal conductivity (0.0733 Wm  K ), and broad light adsorption (≈100 %). These characteristics enable rapid water transportation and excellent light-to-heat conversion by the resulting RGO-CF with an  conversion efficiency of 94 % under stimulated solar illumination (1 kW m ), which demonstrates that RGO-CF is a promising photothermal conversion material for solar steam generation. Such strategy for preparation of photothermal materials not only reduces the fabrication cost but also provides a fundamental guidance for the practical application of renewable polymer resources from used cigarette filters.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM 2.0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for  (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for  (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was 2:1. Under this condition, chemical oxygen demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.5%. Besides, volatile fatty acids were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.2. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation. The modified model will contribute to further investigating and predicting the characteristics of the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This system was revisited by employing isotopic substitution Raman spectroscopy (ISRS) and pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR self-diffusion measurements. The ISRS and PFG-NMR results obtained fully confirm our earlier findings. In particular, the self-diffusion coefficient of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom in AcOH is identical to that of the methyl hydrogen atoms within the experimental uncertainty, consistent with very little ionization. Therefore, a proton conduction mechanism similar to the Grotthuss mechanism for aqueous acid solutions is postulated to be responsible for the observed electrical conductivity. Laity resistance coefficients () are calculated from the transport properties, and the negative values obtained for the like-ion interactions are consistent with the -ionic liquid description, that is, the mixture is indeed a very weak electrolyte. The structure and rotational dynamics of the mixture were also investigated using high- X-ray total scattering experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Based on a comparison of activation energies and the well-known linear free  relationship between the kinetics and thermodynamics of autoprotolysis, we propose for [CHIm][OAc] a Grotthus-type proton conduction mechanism involving fast AcOH/AcO rotation as a decisive step.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075745>Synthesis and evaluation of Quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives as potential antibacterial agents.</a></h2><p>New quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their potential antibacterial behavior. Compounds were obtained by a one-pot multicomponent reaction of appropriate aldehyde, ethyl cyanoacetate, 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalin-1-one and ammonium . Structures were established by different physical and spectroscopic techniques. The molecular geometry, vibration frequencies, HOMO-LUMO  gap, molecular hardness (g), ionization  (IE), electron affinity (EA), and total  of these compounds was assessed by DFT studies, employing DFT/RB3LYP method. Preliminary antibacterial studies using both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and cytotoxicity studies on mammalian cells revealed their promising antibacterial activity, without causing any severe host toxicity. All the compounds (QD1-QD5) in this study obeyed the 'Lipinski's Rule of Five' with logP values <5 and HBA <10, hydrogen bond donor's <5. The most active compound QD4 showed good interaction with the target DNA gyrase; target enzyme for quinoline class of antibiotics, which reveals its probable mechanism of action. Results of all these studies establish these compounds as important scaffolds with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with no off-target toxicity. Having lower band gap  of 3.40 eV and a low lying LUMO for compound QD4, this compound may be a valuable starting point for the development of quinoline-3-carbonitrile based broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.Copyright © 2019.

Here, the accumulation of the heavy metals copper and zinc was studied in the acrocarp moss Atrichum undulatum. An in vitro culture of A. undulatum was established and the same line, size and equally old remets were exposed to six different treatments representing various metal exposure times and washing scenarios as rain simulation. The metal treatments were done in copper and zinc salts (Cu-, CuSO, ZnSO and ZnCl, respectively). -Dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) was employed to detect bound heavy metals on the moss plantlets. Element distribution in stems and leaves was measured separately. The aqueous solution of metal salts facilitated an adsorption of both elements in the moss tissue as compared to solid medium. Furthermore, A. undulatum can tolerate pollution of zinc and copper in a distinctive extent; our data point towards a higher zinc tolerance whereas copper is rather harmful. However, semi-quantitatively, less zinc was detected within the moss tissue compared to copper. Interestingly, a strong positive correlation between the accumulation of copper/zinc and iron, and a strong negative correlation between copper/zinc and magnesium, respectively, was documented.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although, some research groups have discussed the possible mechanisms involved in the perovskite degradation, no broader understanding has been developed so far. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal orientation of perovskite film plays a major role in its degradation. We observed that the films fabricated via different routes led to different degradation behaviors and unraveled that diversity in the degradation rate arises due to the difference in crystallographic characteristics of the films. Using optical and electrical measurements, we show that the film prepared via a single-step (lead chloride precursor based) route undergoes a much faster degradation rate as compared with films prepared using single step ( precursor based) and two-step (or sequential deposition) routes. Although the resulting film is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI) regardless of processing via different routes, their respective crystal orientation is different. In this manuscript, we correlate crystal orientation of MAPbI with their degradation pattern.

In the present work, we revisited the influence of solution and gas-phase GHRH molecular microenvironment using trapped ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TIMS-MS). The effect of the starting solvent composition (10 mM ammonium  (NHAc), 50% methanol (MeOH), 50% acetonitrile (MeCN), and 50% acetone (Ac)) and gas-phase modifiers (N, N + MeOH, N + MeCN, and N + Ac) on the conformational states of three GHRH analogues, GHRH (1-29), MR-406, and MIA-602, is described as a function of the trapping time (100-500 ms). Changes in the mobility profiles were observed showing the dependence of the conformational states of GHRH analogues according to the molecular microenvironment in solution, suggesting the presence of solution memory effects on the gas-phase observed structures. Modifying the bath gas composition resulted in smaller mobilities that are correlated with the size and mass of the organic modifier, and more importantly led to substantial changes in relative abundances of the IMS profiles. We attributed the observed changes in the mobility profiles by a clustering/declustering mechanism between the GHRH analogue ions and the gas modifiers, redefining the free  landscape and leading to other local minima structures. Moreover, inspection of the mobility profiles as a function of the trapping time (100-500 ms) allowed for conformational interconversions toward more stable "gas-phase" structures. These experiments enabled us to outline a more detailed description of the structures and intermediates involved in the biological activity of GHRH, MR-406, and MIA-602.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231036>Dynamic behaviors of batch anaerobic systems of food waste for methane production under different organic loads, substrate to inoculum ratios and initial pH.</a></h2><p>This study characterized dynamic behaviors of batch anaerobic digesters treating food waste in terms of methane production, organics destruction and process stability under different organic loads (OLs), substrate to inoculum (S/I) ratios [on volatile solid (VS) basis] and initial pH. The results showed that OL, S/I ratio and initial pH significantly affected batch anaerobic process. Methane yield was proved to be inversely proportional to OL and S/I ratio. Digester with lowest OL (5 g VS/L) obtained greatest methane yield (551.4 mL/g VS), highest organics removal (94.1%) and good stability. Enhancing OL to 10 g VS/L was recommended for satisfactory stability and higher volumetric methane productivity. When OL was designated as 10 g VS/L, digester with low S/I ratio (1/2) achieved satisfactory methane yield (539.3 mL/g VS), high organics removal (92.3%) and stable performance. When OL was relatively high (20 g VS/L), adjusting initial pH to 7.5 contributed to stable performance via enhancing buffering capacity against volatile fatty acids (VFA) disturbance. Strong VFA inhibition occurred under high OL (40 g VS/L) or great S/I ratio (2/1) or acidic initial pH (6.5). In this case,  was dominant VFA, followed by butyrate. However, when digester was stable,  was main VFA, followed by propionate. This study provided practical guidance on process configurations for batch digesters of food waste needed to achieve satisfactory performance and stability.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

With an increasing ratio of ionic liquid (IL):water, the long- and short-range ordered structures and granule morphology of both starches were disrupted progressively. The multiscale structure of maize starch was disrupted completely after treatment with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4, indicating good dissolution performance of this mixture for maize starch. This mixture seemed to provide a balance between the viscosity of the solvent and availability of ions to disrupt starch H-bonds. The different dissolution behaviors of maize and potato starches in [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures were attributed to structural differences of the granule surfaces.

The calculated solvation free energies in pure water were compared with the previous experimental and theoretical findings and found to be in agreement. We observe that the solvation free  of methylated nucleobases is more in the pure ionic liquid compared to that in the pure water and on changing the mole fraction of water in the ionic liquid, the solvation free  decreases gradually. Comparing the Coulombic and van der Waals contribution to the solvation free , electrostatic contribution is more compared to that of the latter for all nucleobases. To obtain the atomistic details and explain the solvation mechanism, we calculated radial distribution functions (RDFs), spatial distribution functions (SDFs), and stacking angle distribution of cations to the nucleobases. From RDFs and SDFs, we find that the  anions of the ionic liquid are forming strong hydrogen bonds with the amine hydrogen atoms of the nucleobases. These hydrogen bonds contribute to the major part of the Coulombic contribution to the solvation free . Stacking of cations to the nucleobases is primarily due to the van der Waals contribution to the solvation free .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut Microbiota Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota play an important role in immune responses and  metabolism.

However, few studies have examined how drugs of abuse alter astrocyte-neuron lactate transfer in neurocircuits related to addiction. This is particularly pertinent for ethanol (EtOH), which has been demonstrated to impair central nervious system (CNS) glucose uptake and significantly alter peripheral levels of glucose, lactate, , and ketones.We subjected C57BL/6J mice to a chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure paradigm to investigate how chronic EtOH exposure alters the concentration of glucose and lactate within the serum and CNS during withdrawal. Next, we determine how chronic injections of lactate (1 g/kg, twice daily for 2 weeks) influence central and peripheral glucose and lactate concentrations. Finally, we determine how CIE and chronic lactate injection affect astrocyte-neuron lactate transfer by analyzing the expression of MCTs.Our results show that CIE induces lasting changes in CNS glucose and lactate concentrations, accompanied by increased expression of MCTs. Interestingly, although chronic lactate injection mimics the effect of EtOH on CNS metabolites, chronic lactate injection is not associated with increased expression of MCTs.CIE increases CNS concentrations of glucose and lactate and augments the expression of MCTs. Although we found that chronic lactate injection mimics EtOH-induced increases in CNS lactate and glucose, lactate failed to alter the expression of MCTs. This suggests that although lactate may influence the homeostasis of bioenergetic molecules in the CNS, EtOH-associated increases in lactate are not responsible for increased MCT expression.© 2019 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151141>Micro-Scale Surface Patterning of Titanium Dental Implants by Anodization in the Presence of Modifying Salts.</a></h2><p>The bone-implant interface influences peri-implant bone healing and osseointegration.

Ethylene concentrations up to 1000 μL L were applied to dark green 'Konservolia' olives harvested shortly before the green maturation and exposed to 20 °C for up to 9 d. Surprisingly, the results indicated a tendency to fruit firmness increases in concentration-dependent manner in a non-climacteric fruit. The highest concentration increased the firmness within 12 h by approximately 1.35-fold, but transiently for approximately up to 5 d; all ethylene inhibitors tested, either of synthesis (ethoxyvinyl glycine or AVG), or perception (1 -methyl-cyclopropene or 1-MCP, and silver nitrate) prevented the firmness increase. Texture was evaluated by firmness and changes in lignin, cellulose (CL), total pectins (TPC), water soluble pectins (WSP) and total non-cellulosic sugars (total sugars) concentrations, and in pectin esterification degree (DE) in the alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) of 'Konservolia' fruit pericarp during 1.5-d, 5-d and 10-d treatments with 1000 μL L ethylene at 20 °C. Pectins in AIR were also extracted sequentially with cyclohexane-trans-1,2-diaminetetra- (CDTA), NaCO, 1 M and 4 M KOH. The results showed that on day 1.5, the increased firmness was consistent with increased CL (crystalline formation, as observed by microscopy), total sugars and DE levels, but reduced WSP, whereas softening reversed the changes and lowered TPC and CDTA-soluble pectins in all fruit on day 10. However, on day 5 ethylene-treated olives exhibited a transitional phase during softening, characterized by retention of high TPC concentration and  demand, as indicated by elevated respiration rates. The inhibitor 1-MCP, applied before ethylene, did inhibit the responses to ethylene treatment. Ethylene firming effect and the respective cell wall changes in olives are demonstrated for first time. The experiments could be used for research on perception and transcription responses to ethylene in olive, a non-climacteric fruit. In practice, high ethylene concentrations could also be beneficial for firmness increase and/or short storage of dark green olives.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Then synthesized particles were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning microscopy/ dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. Adsorbent potentials of the prepared nanocomposite were evaluated for sulfamethoxazole removal from polluted aqueous solutions via two different experimental methods, namely, "one-at-a-time" and "central composite design". The given results from the one-at-a-time method confirms that 0.007 g of silver@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite can remove 88% (188.57 mg/g) of sulfamethoxazole from a 0.05 dm solution (initial concentration 30 mg/dm) at pH = 5 after 3600 s' contact time.

The main mechanism for sulfamethoxazole removal can be suggested as a suitable interaction between S atoms in functional groups in the drug and Ag atoms on the surface of nanoparticles. The pseudo-second-order patterns and Freundlich model described the empirical data isotherm and kinetics for the adsorption processes, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity by experimental and theoretical isotherm methods (Langmuir) obtained 250 and 357 mg/g, respectively. Efficiency of the adsorbent in treatment of SMX from real samples displayed less hardness and electrical conductance samples have the maximum uptake percent while existence of nitrate ions in the solutions did not induce any negative effect on the removal of the SMX.

We also calculate ΔG for five example catabolisms at specific environmental conditions: aerobic respiration of glucose in freshwater, anaerobic respiration of  in marine sediment, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in a laboratory batch reactor, anaerobic ammonia oxidation in a wastewater reactor and aerobic pyrite oxidation in acid mine drainage.

Chloroplast membranes are unique in their lipid makeup, which is dominated by the galactolipids mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG and DGDG). The most abundant galactolipid, MGDG, is assembled through both plastid and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways in Arabidopsis, resulting in distinguishable molecular lipid species. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is the first glycerolipid formed by the plastid galactolipid biosynthetic pathway. It is converted to substrate diacylglycerol (DAG) for MGDG Synthase (MGD1) which adds to it a galactose from UDP-Gal. The enzymatic reactions yielding these galactolipids have been well established. However, auxiliary or regulatory factors are largely unknown. We identified a predicted rhomboid-like protease 10 (RBL10), located in plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana, that affects galactolipid biosynthesis likely through intramembrane proteolysis. Plants with T-DNA disruptions in RBL10 have greatly decreased 16:3 (acyl carbons:double bonds) and increased 18:3 acyl chain abundance in MGDG of leaves. Additionally, rbl10-1 mutants show reduced [ C]- incorporation into MGDG during pulse-chase labeling, indicating a reduced flux through the plastid galactolipid biosynthesis pathway. While plastid MGDG biosynthesis is blocked in rbl10-1 mutants, they are capable of synthesizing PA, as well as producing normal amounts of MGDG by compensating with ER-derived lipid precursors. These findings link this predicted protease to the utilization of PA for plastid galactolipid biosynthesis potentially revealing a regulatory mechanism in chloroplasts.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350361>Ferredoxin5 Deletion Affects Metabolism of Algae during the Different Phases of Sulfur Deprivation.</a></h2><p>Ferredoxin5 (FDX5), a minor ferredoxin protein in the alga  (), helps maintain thylakoid membrane integrity in the dark. Sulfur (S) deprivation has been used to achieve prolonged hydrogen production in green algae. Here, we propose that FDX5 is involved in algal responses to S-deprivation as well as to the dark. Specifically, we tested the role of FDX5 in both the initial aerobic and subsequent anaerobic phases of S-deprivation. Under S-deprived conditions, absence of FDX5 causes a distinct delay in achieving anoxia by affecting photosynthetic O evolution, accompanied by reduced  uptake, lower starch accumulation, and delayed/lower fermentative metabolite production, including photohydrogen. We attribute these differences to transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and increased stability of the PSII D1 protein. Interestingly, increased levels of FDX2 and FDX1 were observed in the mutant under oxic, S-replete conditions, strengthening our previously proposed hypothesis that other ferredoxins compensate in response to a lack of FDX5. Taken together, the results of our omics and pull-down experiments confirmed biochemical and physiological results, suggesting that FDX5 may have other effects on  metabolism through its interaction with multiple redox partners.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

P. denitrificans was transformed with the 1,3-PDO synthesis pathway composed of GDHt and 1,3-PDO oxidoreductase (PDOR), and its putative 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) dehydrogenase(s), leading to the production of 3-hydroxypropioninc acid form the intermediary 3-HPA, was identified and deleted. In addition, to improve the availability of NADH for PDOR, oxidation of NADH in the electron transport chain was disturbed by deletion of the nuo operon and/or ndh gene. Finally,  formation pathway was eliminated. One resulting strain could produce 68.95 mM 1,3-PDO with the yield of 0.92 mol 1,3-PDO/mol glycerol on flask scale and 440 mM with the yield of 0.89 mol 1,3-PDO/mol glycerol in a fed-batch bioreactor experiment. This study demonstrates that P. denitrificans is a promising recombinant host for the production of 1,3-PDO from glycerol.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no consensus has been reached on the ability of "Ca. Accumulibacter" members of clade IC to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Discrepancies might relate to the diverse operational conditions which could trigger the expression of the Nap and/or Nar enzyme and/or to the accuracy in clade classification. This study aimed to assess whether and how certain operational conditions could lead to the enrichment and enhance the denitrification capacity of "Ca. Accumulibacter" within clade IC. To study the potential induction of the denitrifying enzyme, an EBPR culture was enriched under anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) conditions that, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ppk gene sequencing, was composed of around 97% (on a biovolume basis) of affiliates of "Ca. Accumulibacter" clade IC. The influence of the medium composition, sludge retention time (SRT), polyphosphate content of the biomass (poly-P), nitrate dosing approach, and minimal aerobic SRT on potential nitrate reduction were studied. Despite the different studied conditions applied, only a negligible anoxic P-uptake rate was observed, equivalent to maximum 13% of the aerobic P-uptake rate. An increase in the anoxic SRT at the expenses of the aerobic SRT resulted in deterioration of P-removal with limited aerobic P-uptake and insufficient  uptake in the anaerobic phase. A near-complete genome (completeness = 100%, contamination = 0.187%) was extracted from the metagenome of the EBPR biomass for the here-proposed "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" clade IC. According to full-genome-based phylogenetic analysis, this lineage was distant from the canonical "Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis", with closest neighbor "Ca. Accumulibacter sp. UW-LDO-IC" within clade IC. This was cross-validated with taxonomic classification of the ppk1 gene sequences. The genome-centric metagenomic analysis highlighted the presence of genes for assimilatory nitrate reductase (nas) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap) but no gene for respiratory nitrate reductases (nar). This suggests that "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" clade IC was not capable to generate the required  (ATP) from nitrate under strict anaerobic-anoxic conditions to support an anoxic EBPR metabolism. Definitely, this study stresses the incongruence in denitrification abilities of "Ca. Accumulibacter" clades and reflects the true intra-clade diversity, which requires a thorough investigation within this lineage.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Various carbon sources including , succinate and methanol are utilized by  AM1 with the latter being a promising inexpensive substrate for use in the biotechnology industry. Itaconic acid (ITA) is a high-value building block widely used in various industries. Given that no wildtype methylotrophic bacteria are able to utilize methanol to produce ITA, we tested the potential of  AM1 as an engineered host for this purpose. In this study, we successfully engineered  AM1 to express a heterologous codon-optimized gene encoding aconitic acid decarboxylase. The engineered strain produced ITA using , succinate and methanol as the carbon feedstock. The highest ITA titer in batch culture with methanol as the carbon source was 31.6 ± 5.5 mg/L, while the titer and productivity were 5.4 ± 0.2 mg/L and 0.056 ± 0.002 mg/L/h, respectively, in a scaled-up fed-batch bioreactor under 60% dissolved oxygen saturation. We attempted to enhance the carbon flux toward ITA production by impeding poly-β-hydroxybutyrate accumulation, which is used as carbon and  storage, via mutation of the regulator gene . Unexpectedly, ITA production by the  mutant strain was not higher even though poly-β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was lower. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that  mutation in the ITA-producing strain led to complex rewiring of gene transcription, which might result in a reduced carbon flux toward ITA production. Besides poly-β-hydroxybutyrate metabolism, we found evidence that PhaR might regulate the transcription of many other genes including those encoding other regulatory proteins, methanol dehydrogenases, formate dehydrogenases, malate:quinone oxidoreductase, and those synthesizing pyrroloquinoline quinone and thiamine co-factors. Overall,  AM1 was successfully engineered to produce ITA using , succinate and methanol as feedstock, further supporting this bacterium as a feasible host for use in the biotechnology industry. This study showed that PhaR could have a broader regulatory role than previously anticipated, and increased our knowledge of this regulator and its influence on the physiology of  AM1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608868>Dissolution rate enhancement of new co-crystals of ezetimibe with maleic acid and isonicotinamide.</a></h2><p>Ezetimibe (EZT) is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor with poor aqueous solubility (0.012mg/ml 23oC) and low oral bioavailability (about 35-65% for a once 10mg dose).

Thermodynamics, electronic structure, and photophysical properties are computed by employing density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to explore selective sensing of these anions and its mechanism. Free- changes (Δ) and binding energies (Δ) suggest that among these anions, only binding of CN and F is thermodynamically feasible with a very strong binding affinity with the receptors. Boron atoms containing positive natural charges act as the electrophilic centers to bind the anions involving a 2p-2p orbital overlap resulting in charge transfer. In the receptor-analyte complexes with CN and F, fluorescence is quenched due to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions (π-π* transitions in the case of the receptors lead to fluorescence), internal conversion, and associated configurational changes. Among the six tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP/631G(d) is found to be the most accurate one.

The main operating conditions such as pretreatment temperature (25-150°C), time (40-180 min), WB and DWB loading (2-5% w/v) and concentration of [C2mim][OAc] in water [10-100% (v/v)] were screened through glucose and xylose yields and then optimized through a Partial Least Square (PLS)-Second Order Design. In an innovative way, the PLS results showed that the four factors and their interactions could be well-fitted by a second-order model ( < 0.05). The quadratic PLS models were used to predict optimal pretreatment conditions. Thus, maximum glucose (83%) and xylose (95%) yields were obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of WB pretreated at 150°C for 40 min with 10% of [C2mim][OAc] in water and 5% of WB loading. For DWB, maximum glucose (100%) and xylose (57%) yields were achieved for pretreatment temperatures of 150°C and 25°C, respectively. The required duration was still 40 min, with 20% of [C2mim][OAc] in water and a 5% DWB loading. Then, Multiple Response Optimization (MRO) performed by Nelder-Mead Simplex Method displayed sugar yields similar to those obtained by individual PLS optimization. This complete statistical study confirmed that the established models were appropriate to predict the sugar yields achieved after different pretreatment conditions from WB and DWB biomasses. Finally, Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) studies allowed us to establish clearer link between structural changes induced by pretreatment and the best enzymatic performances obtained.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203935>Exploring stability indicators for efficient monitoring of anaerobic digestion of pig manure under perturbations.</a></h2><p>Monitoring of anaerobic digestion process is essential for achieving efficient and stable performance, thus requiring identification of effective stability indicators. The response of two experimental, continuously stirred tank reactors under mesophilic condition (fed with pig manure) was investigated to analyze the perturbation of organic and hydraulic overloading, and low-temperature shock. The pH was stably maintained in the range of 7.2-7.7, regardless of the presence of most simulated perturbation situations. Monitoring of biogas production and composition is important to reflect the current state of biogas process, but cannot predict the imbalance in the system. Accumulation of total VFAs up to 21,718 mg/L was observed under the organic overloading condition (rapid increase of the organic loading rate of pig manure from 3 g VS/L/d to 9 g VS/L/d), but not for other perturbations. The ratio of propionate to  and that of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity are rapidly altered in response to all perturbations, indicating their potential to function as stability indicators. However, the determination of the ratio of intermediate alkalinity to partial alkalinity can be performed by simple titration methods and be easily applied to actual projects without significant investment in advanced equipment and skilled operators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The MS, H and C NMR were applied to elucidate their structures. UPLC-PDA method was applied for the simultaneous quantification of major compounds of EAFVC. Furthermore, the protective effect of the EAFVC was determined using APAP-induced acute hepatotoxicity in mice and BRL-3A cells model, respectively. In addition, the hepatoprotective activity of two main compounds in EAFVC on relieving APAP-induced liver injury was further evaluated. Finally, we have some concerns about the protective mechanism of EAFVC via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), western blot analysis and molecular docking.Thirteen compounds were successfully identified using UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS for the first time. Meanwhile, other twelve compounds were separated from EAFVC. Eventually, twenty-five compounds were successfully identified from the EAFVC. Among these compounds, fourteen compounds (3, 8, 10, 14-17, 19-25) were separated from V.ciliata for the first time. In addition, UPLC-PDA analysis method was first to establish for simultaneous determination of the main compounds (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12). Further assay indicated that the liver injury in mice induced by APAP showed a significant reversal by EAFVC, as evidenced by reducing the activities of liver function enzymes, suppressing the lipid peroxidation as well as increasing the serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Pathological sections showed that the liver in the high dose has significant improvement in mice. In vitro experiment also showed that EAFVC elevate the viability, inhibiting the activities of liver function enzymes as well as the generation of ROS of BRL-3A cells. In addition, Catalposide and verproside could reverse the low cell viability of BRL-3A cells induced by APAP. The mechanism research in vitro demonstrated that EAFVC could promote the mRNA and protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P) H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO-1) and catalytic or modify subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC/GCLCM) via enhancing nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and p62/SQSTM1 (p62) expression in protein level. Molecular docking results demonstrated that catalposide and verproside have strong affinity to the kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1(Keap1) Kelch domain.This research is the first to clarify the substance basis of the hepatoprotective activity of the EAFVC and provide the further scientific data for the traditional use of this Tibetan Medicine. EAFVC is valuable to be further investigated as active preparations for application in liver protection via activating p62- Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.Copyright © 2019.

To improve the release and acidification of organic matters in waste activated sludge (WAS) fermentation simultaneously, a novel method was proposed with magnetite addition under alkaline condition in this study. Compared with the control, SCFAs and acetic acids yields increased by 21.2% ± 3.1% and 31.0% ± 1.2% in the 0.6 g/gVSS magnetite-based system, respectively. Besides, the activities of α-glucosidase, protease and  kinase (AK) were enhanced with magnetite addition, and the abundance of acidogenic microbes was improved obviously. Furthermore, magnetite reduced the release of PO-P significantly via the precipitation reaction. Of all, a novel side-stream WAS hydrolysis and acidification process based on magnetite addition under suitable alkaline condition is proposed, realizing the efficient recovery of carbon and phosphorus resources along with wastewater and WAS treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Horn is a keratinized material that grows in discrete increments with the potential to preserve the historical record of past environmental exposures. While previous studies have leveraged this potential to examine environmental and biological phenomena in horns, Pb uptake has never been explored.Horns were collected post-mortem from three goats that had been previously used to produce blood lead reference materials for the New York State proficiency testing program. The animals were periodically dosed with lead , administered orally in a capsule, over a 5 to 8-year period. Horn cross sections were taken from each animal and analyzed using synchrotron radiation-induced micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR-μXRF) at the Cornell High  Synchrotron Source (CHESS).Elemental distribution maps were obtained by SR-μXRF for Pb, Ca, S, Se, and three other elements (Br, Zn and Cu), with values reported quantitatively as a mass fraction (μg/g for trace elements and mg/g for Ca and S). Accumulations of Pb were clearly visible as a series of narrow "rings" in each of the horn samples analyzed. The elements Ca, S, Br, Zn, and Cu were also detected as discrete rings within each cross-section, with Br strongly correlated with S in the samples examined. A marginal increase in Se may coincide with Pb accumulation in horn cross-sections. Annual mineralization estimates based on the relative distribution of Ca and S were used to establish a tentative timeline for horn growth, with each timeline linked to the pattern of Pb accumulation in the corresponding horn cross-section sample.Following ingestion, absorbed Pb is eventually deposited into caprine horns, resulting in discrete accumulations or "rings." Elemental mapping by SR-μXRF clearly show Ca-rich layers that vary with annual periodicity, consistent with previous reports of horn mineralization. Localized enrichment of Cu, Zn, Br and S appear to coincide with the keratinized regions related to the annual growth ring pattern in horns. Spatial analysis of horns for Pb accumulation may be useful as a qualitative marker of time-resolved exposures that may reflect specific periods of acute Pb absorption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

One potential green and sustainable method to solve this problem is to implement solar -driven water evaporation to collect freshwater. Capitalizing on the low cost, high production yield, and simplified fabrication process properties of nonstoichiometric CoS nanoparticles, we strategically designed and synthesized a CoS-deposited Teflon (PTFE) membrane for realizing efficient solar water evaporation and photothermal antibacterial properties under light irradiation. Compared with previously reported cellulose  and poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes, the PTFE membrane displayed significantly enhanced mechanical properties. Additionally, a CoS-deposited PTFE membrane with a hydrophobic treatment (termed as the Final-PTFE membrane) exhibited excellent durability. The light-to-heat conversion efficiency (η) of water evaporation reached a value of 82% for our as-prepared Final-PTFE membrane under two sun irradiation conditions. Moreover, the antibacterial mechanism observed by scanning electron microscopy was attributed to the thermal effect, which damaged the cell wall of bacteria.

The overall performances of COD removal and methane recovery initially exhibited an increase and subsequently decreased when the OLR was increased from 1 g-COD/L/d to 24 g-COD/L/d. At the optimal OLR of 8 g-COD/L/d, superior performance was obtained with a maximum COD removal efficiency of 97%, a methane production rate of 2.3 L/L/d, and specific methanogenic activity of 86 mg-CH/g-VSS/d (feeding on glutamate), with superior characteristics of sludge in VSS concentration, average diameter of granules, and settling velocity. According to the results of the specific methanogenic activity, the methanogenic pathway was more inclined to pass through  than through hydrogen. Methanosarcina instead of Methanosaeta, with Methanobacterium and greatly increased Firmicutes, dominated in the UASB reactor after long term operation. These results support that the OLR had a substantial effect on both the treatment and  recovery efficiency of MSG wastewater as well as on microbial community variations in the UASB reactor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The post-synthetic addition of octylphosphonic acid to oleic acid/oleylamine-capped CsPbBr NCs promoted the attachment of octylphosphonate to the NC surface, while the remaining oleylammonium ligands maintained the high dispersability of the NCs in non-polar solvent. Through powerful 2D solid-state P-H NMR, we demonstrated that an ethyl /acetonitrile purification regime was crucial for initiating the self-assembly of extensive octylphosphonate chains. Octylphosphonate ligands were found to preferentially bind in a monodentate mode through P-O, leaving polar P[double bond, length as m-dash]O and P-OH groups free to form inter-ligand hydrogen bonds. The octylphosphonate ligand network strongly passivated the nanocrystal surface, yielding a fully-purified CsPbBr NC ink with PLQY of 62%, over 3 times higher than untreated NCs. We translated this to LED devices, achieving maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance of 7.74% and 1022 cd m with OPA treatment, as opposed to 3.59% and 229 cd m for untreated CsPbBr NCs. This represents one of the highest efficiency LEDs obtained for all-inorganic CsPbBr NCs, accomplished through simple, effective passivation and purification processes. The robust binding of octylphosphonates to the perovskite lattice, and specifically their ability to interlink through hydrogen bonding, offers a promising passivation approach which could potentially be beneficial across a breadth of halide perovskite optoelectronic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336752>Growth Mechanism of Seed-Layer Free ZnSnO Nanowires: Effect of Physical Parameters.</a></h2><p>ZnSnO semiconductor nanostructures have several applications as photocatalysis, gas sensors, and  harvesting.

Here, we demonstrate an alternative strategy, a growth-coupled, high-yield bioconversion, by feeding cells a non-sugar substrate, by-passing central metabolism, and linking a key metabolic step to generation of acetyl-CoA that is required for biomass and  generation. Specifically, we converted levulinic acid (LA), an established degradation product of lignocellulosic biomass, to butanone (a.k.a. methyl-ethyl ketone - MEK), a widely used industrial solvent. Our strategy combines a catabolic pathway from Pseudomonas putida that enables conversion of LA to 3-ketovaleryl-CoA, a CoA transferase that generates 3-ketovalerate and acetyl-CoA, and a decarboxylase that generates 2-butanone. By removing the ability of E. coli to consume LA and supplying excess  as a carbon source, we built a strain of E. coli that could convert LA to butanone at high yields, but at the cost of significant  consumption. Using flux balance analysis as a guide, we built a strain of E. coli that linked  assimilation to production of butanone. This strain was capable of complete bioconversion of LA to butanone with a reduced  requirement and increased specific productivity. To demonstrate the bioconversion on real world feedstocks, we produced LA from furfuryl alcohol, a compound readily obtained from biomass. These LA feedstocks were found to contain inhibitors that prevented cell growth and bioconversion of LA to butanone. We used a combination of column chromatography and activated carbon to remove the toxic compounds from the feedstock, resulting in LA that could be completely converted to butanone. This work motivates continued collaboration between chemical and biological catalysis researchers to explore alternative conversion pathways and the technical hurdles that prevent their rapid deployment.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Biodegradation has tremendous potential for chloramphenicol removal in the environment. Six chloramphenicol-degrading consortia were acclimated under different culture conditions to investigate their chloramphenicol biodegradation behaviors, and the bacterial community structures were comprehensively characterized. The enriched consortia CL and CH which utilized chloramphenicol as their sole carbon and  source could thoroughly degrade 120 mg/L chloramphenicol within 5 days, and the mineralization rate reached up to 90%. Chloramphenicol biodegradation kinetics by different enriched consortia fit the modified Gompertz model or the first-order decay model (R≥0.97). Consortia CL could almost completely degrade 1-500 mg/L CAP with a final mineralization rate of 87.8-91.7%. Chloramphenicol 3- was identified to be a major intermediate of CAP biodegradation by metabolite analysis and enzyme activity assay. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that the diversities and abundances of the main genera in the enriched consortia were distinct from each other. Forty-one core OTUs belonging to 18 genera were the core bacteria which might be related to chloramphenicol biodegradation. Among them, the genera Sphingomonas, Chryseobacterium, Cupriavidus, Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, and Afipia with high abundance may play potential roles for chloramphenicol biodegradation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One of the key intermediates in central carbon metabolism is acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which can be either oxidized in the citric acid cycle or assimilated into biomass through dedicated pathways. Two acetyl-CoA assimilation strategies in bacteria have been described so far, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) and the glyoxylate cycle (GC). Here, we show that  uses both strategies for acetyl-CoA assimilation during different growth stages, revealing an unexpected metabolic complexity in the organism's central carbon metabolism. The EMCP is constitutively expressed on various substrates and leads to high biomass yields on substrates requiring acetyl-CoA assimilation, such as , while the GC is specifically induced on these substrates, enabling high growth rates. Even though each acetyl-CoA assimilation strategy alone confers a distinct growth advantage,  recruits both to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as a switch from succinate to . Time-resolved single-cell experiments show that during this switch, expression of the EMCP and GC is highly coordinated, indicating fine-tuned genetic programming. The dynamic metabolic rewiring of acetyl-CoA assimilation is an evolutionary innovation by  that allows this organism to respond in a highly flexible manner to changes in the nature and availability of the carbon source to meet the physiological needs of the cell, representing a new phenomenon in central carbon metabolism. Central carbon metabolism provides organisms with  and cellular building blocks during growth and is considered the invariable "operating system" of the cell. Here, we describe a new phenomenon in bacterial central carbon metabolism. In contrast to many other bacteria that employ only one pathway for the conversion of the central metabolite acetyl-CoA,  possesses two different acetyl-CoA assimilation pathways. These two pathways are dynamically recruited during different stages of growth, which allows  to achieve both high biomass yield and high growth rates under changing environmental conditions. Overall, this dynamic rewiring of central carbon metabolism in  represents a new strategy compared to those of other organisms employing only one acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway.Copyright © 2019 Kremer et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358705>Assessment of the Ability of Different Cleaning Protocols to Remove Eugenol-based Endodontic Sealer from the Root Dentin.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to assess three protocols for removing a eugenol-based filling endodontic sealer from root dentin and the bond strength of fiberglass posts luted with resin cement.Sixty single-rooted bovine teeth were prepared and filled with the Endofill endodontic sealer and gutta-percha cones.

Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and volatile fatty acids concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas  concentrations and  : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075175>Effects of Weight-Loss Interventions on Short-Chain Fatty Acid Concentrations in Blood and Feces of Adults: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, mainly , propionate, and butyrate), which are primarily derived from the gut microbiome, may exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and regulate  homeostasis. It has been suggested that weight loss may affect SCFA metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/m2)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of , propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal SCFA concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total SCFA concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased SCFA concentrations were low (≤5% of ) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in SCFA concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

The results showed that the three treatment methods could degrade cephalosporin C effectively, with the removal efficiency of 85.5% for radiation at dose of 100 kGy, 79.9% for ozonation at dosage of 5.2 g O/L, and 71.9% and 87.3% for thermal treatment at 60 °C and 90 °C for 4 h.

The presence of protein, glucose and  in the CEPF residues had inhibitive influence on the degradation of cephalosporin C by ionizing radiation, and the effect was more significant when the antibiotic concentration was lower. The total content of COD, polysaccharides and protein changed slightly after radiation and thermal treatment, while they were decreased greatly by ozonation. The primary techno-economic analysis showed that the operational cost of ionizing radiation by electron beam at 50 kGy ($5.2/m) was comparable to thermal treatment ($4.3-7.9/m), which was more economical than ozonation ($14.6/m).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Granular characteristics, process performance, and the corresponding microbial ecology dynamics were comprehensively explored with sodium  and succinate as mixed carbon source. Results revealed that aerobic granules kept structural and functional resilience, while mixed carbon source largely altered and balanced the growth and competition of phosphorus/glycogen accumulating organisms (PAOs/GAOs). Appropriate ratio of mixed carbon source was vital for superb physiochemical behaviors and reliable removal performance by aerobic granules. Therefore, the aerobic granular SNDPR system could achieve deep-level nutrients removal through enhancing the anaerobic carbon uptake rate and strengthening the carbon usage efficiency.

Recently, satiating effects for the capsaicinoid nonivamide have been demonstrated. As various proteins and amino acids have also been demonstrated to decrease  intake, oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT)-based bolus interventions of 75 g glucose + 0.15 mg nonivamide (NV control) are tested with/without combination of a wheat protein hydrolysate (WPH: 2 g) and/or l-arginine (ARG: 3.2 g) for their satiating effects in 27 moderately overweight male subjects.Compared to NV control intervention, ARG and WPH + ARG treatment both reduce (p < 0.01) total calorie intake from a standardized breakfast by -5.9 ± 4.15% and -6.07 ± 4.38%, respectively.

Conformation-specific electronic and IR spectroscopy combined with quantum chemistry calculations confirm the presence of only the cis conformer of phenyl  in the experiment. The cis conformer of phenyl  has n→π* interaction between the lone-pair electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom and the π* orbitals of the phenyl group. The n→π* interaction is absent in the trans conformer which has additional steric repulsion between the methyl group and phenyl ring. The trans conformer is higher in  than the cis conformer by ≈3 kcal mol . We have found the effect of methyl substitution on the strength of the n→π* interaction, steric repulsion, and hyperconjugation in phenyl . The red-shift observed in the cis conformer of phenyl  with respect to the trans conformer is affected due to the influence of the methyl substituent on the strength of the n→π* interaction as well as hyperconjugation. The present result demonstrates that the introduction of a bulkier substituent can induce steric as well as electronic control to reduce conformational heterogeneity of a molecular system. Understanding the effect of bulkier substituents to promote defined conformations having specific non-covalent interactions may have implication in better perception of the optimum structure and function of biomolecules as well as recognition of drugs by biomolecules.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These substrates are becoming increasingly important feedstock in industrial microbiology. The main potential industrial application of acetogenic bacteria is the production of metabolites that constitute renewable  sources (biofuel); such bacteria are of particular interest for this purpose thanks to their low  requirements for large-scale cultivation. Here, we report new genome sequences for four species, three of them are reported for the first time, namely Acetobacterium paludosum DSM 8237, Acetobacterium tundrae DSM 917, Acetobacterium bakii DSM 8239, and Alkalibaculum bacchi DSM 221123. We performed a comparative genomic analysis focused on the WL pathway's genes and their encoded proteins, using Acetobacterium woodii as a reference genome. The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values ranged from 70% to 95% over an alignment length of 5.4-6.5 Mbp. The core genome consisted of 363 genes, whereas the number of unique genes in a single genome ranged from 486 in A. tundrae to 2360 in A.bacchi. No significant rearrangements were detected in the gene order for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway however, two species showed variations in genes involved in formate metabolism: A. paludosum harbor two copies of fhs1, and A. bakii a truncated fdhF1. The analysis of protein networks highlighted the expansion of protein orthologues in A. woodii compared to A. bacchi, whereas protein networks involved in the WL pathway were more conserved.

Such systems have been used to reduce CO to  and other C-based compounds. Here, we report an electrosynthetic system that couples a diazotrophic, photoautotrophic bacterium,  TIE-1, to the cathode of an electrochemical cell through the mediator H that allows reductive capture of both CO and N with all of the  coming from the electrode and infrared (IR) photons.  TIE-1 was shown to utilize a narrow band of IR radiation centered around 850 nm to support growth under both photoheterotrophic, non-diazotrophic and photoautotrophic, diazotrophic conditions with growth rates similar to those achieved using broad spectrum incandescent light. The bacteria were also successfully cultured in the cathodic compartment of an electrochemical cell with the sole source of electrons coming from electrochemically generated H, supporting reduction of both CO and N using 850 nm photons as an  source. Growth rates were similar to non-electrochemical conditions, revealing that the electrochemical system can fully support bacterial growth. Faradaic efficiencies for N and CO reduction were 8.5 and 47%, respectively. These results demonstrate that a microbial-electrode hybrid system can be used to achieve reduction and capture of both CO and N using low  IR radiation and electrons provided by an electrode.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183135>Variations of thermophysical properties and heat transfer performance of nanoparticle-enhanced ionic liquids.</a></h2><p>The ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium  ([EMIm]Ac) was investigated as a promising absorbent for absorption refrigeration. To improve the thermal conductivity of pure [EMIm]Ac, IL-based nanofluids (ionanofluids, INFs) were prepared by adding graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The thermal stability of the IL and INFs was analysed. The variations of the thermal conductivity, viscosity and specific heat capacity resulting from the addition of the GNPs were then measured over a wide range of temperatures and mass fractions. The measured data were fitted with appropriate equations and compared with the corresponding classical models. The results revealed that the IL and INFs were thermally stable over the measurement range. The thermal conductivity greatly increased with increasing mass fraction, while only slightly changed with increasing temperature. A maximum enhancement in thermal conductivity of 43.2% was observed at a temperature of 373.15 K for the INF with a mass fraction of 5%.

Two major challenges in its large-scale deployment is the material instability and hazardous lead waste. Several studies have identified that lead replacement with its other alternatives does not show the similar assurance. In this manuscript, we introduce the concept of recycling of the degraded perovskite film (PbI), gaining back the initial optoelectronic properties as the best possible solution to avoid lead waste. The simple recycling procedure allows the utilization of some of the most expensive (fluorine-doped tin oxide), primary -consuming (TiO), and toxic (Pb) parts of the solar cell, reducing the payback time even further. This addresses the major issues of instability and expensive toxic lead disposal, altogether. We have demonstrated the comparative study of feasibility of recycling in degraded perovskite films deposited by three different standard fabrication routes. Films fabricated via  route shows efficient recycling compared to the other routes, i.e., chloride and sequential deposition routes. Moreover, recycling in sequentially deposited films needs further optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364272>Carbon isotopic heterogeneity of coenzyme F430 and membrane lipids in methane-oxidizing archaea.</a></h2><p>Archaeal ANaerobic MEthanotrophs (ANME) facilitate the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), a process that is believed to proceed via the reversal of the methanogenesis pathway. Carbon isotopic composition studies indicate that ANME are metabolically diverse and able to assimilate metabolites including methane, methanol, , and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Our data support the interpretation that ANME in marine sediments at methane seeps assimilate both methane and DIC, and the carbon isotopic compositions of the tetrapyrrole coenzyme F430 and the membrane lipids archaeol and hydroxy-archaeol reflect their relative proportions of carbon from these substrates. Methane is assimilated via the methyl group of CH -tetrahydromethanopterin (H MPT) and DIC from carboxylation reactions that incorporate free intracellular DIC. F430 was enriched in  C (mean δ C = -27‰ for Hydrate Ridge and -80‰ for the Santa Monica Basin) compared to the archaeal lipids (mean δ C = -97‰ for Hydrate Ridge and -122‰ for the Santa Monica Basin). We propose that depending on the side of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle used to synthesize F430, its carbon was derived from 76% DIC and 24% methane via the reductive side or 57% DIC and 43% methane via the oxidative side. ANME lipids are predicted to contain 42% DIC and 58% methane, reflecting the amount of each assimilated into acetyl-CoA. With isotope models that include variable fractionation during biosynthesis for different carbon substrates, we show the estimated amounts of DIC and methane can result in carbon isotopic compositions of - 73‰ to - 77‰ for F430 and - 105‰ for archaeal lipids, values close to those for Santa Monica Basin. The F430 δ C value for Hydrate Ridge was  C-enriched compared with the modeled value, suggesting there is divergence from the predicted two carbon source models.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266303>Formation of Copper(I) Oxide- and Copper(I) Cyanide-Polyacetonitrile Nanocomposites through Strong-Field Laser Processing of Acetonitrile Solutions of Copper(II)  Dimer.</a></h2><p>Irradiation studies of acetonitrile solutions of copper(II)  dimer ([Cu(OAc)]) using high , simultaneously spatially and temporally focused (SSTF) ultrashort laser pulses are reported. Under ambient conditions, irradiation for relatively short periods of time (10-20 s) selectively produces relatively small, narrowly size-dispersed (3.5 ± 0.7 nm) copper(I) oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) embedded in CuCN-polyacetonitrile polymers generated  by the laser. The CuO NPs become embedded in a CuCN-polyacetonitrile network as they form, stabilizing them and protecting the air-sensitive material from oxygen. Laser irradiation of acetonitrile causes fragmentation into transient radicals that initiate and terminate polymerization of acetonitrile. Control and mechanistic investigations reveal that HCN formed during laser irradiation reacts rapidly to reduce the Cu(II) centers in [Cu(OAc)], leading to the formation of CuCN or, in the presence of water, CuO nanoparticles that bind and cross-link CuCN-polyacetonitrile chains. The -bridged Cu(II) dimer unit is a required structural feature that functions to preorganize and direct the Cu(II) reduction and selective formation of CuCN and CuO nanoparticles. This study illustrates how rapid deposition of  using shaped, ultrashort laser pulses can initiate multiple photolytic and thermal processes that lead to the selective formation of composite nanoparticle/polymer materials for applications in electronics and catalysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067729>Surface Engineering of Carbon-Based Microelectrodes for High-Performance Microsupercapacitors.</a></h2><p>In this research, the enhancement in electrochemical performance of pyrolyzed carbon microelectrodes by surface modification is investigated.

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/HSO electrolyte (1 M) was applied to assemble this carbon/CNT microelectrode-based all-solid-state microsupercapacitor (carbon/CNT-MSC). The carbon/CNT-MSC shows a higher electrochemical performance compared with that of pyrolyzed carbon microelectrode-based MSC (carbon-MSC). The specific areal and volumetric capacitances of carbon/CNT-MSC (4.80 mF/cm and 32.0 F/cm) are higher than those of carbon-MSC (3.52 mF/cm and 23.4 F/cm) at the scan rate of 10 mV/s. In addition, higher  density and power density of carbon/CNT-MSC (2.85 mWh/cm and 1.98 W/cm) than those of carbon-MSC (2.08 mWh/cm and 1.41 W/cm) were also achieved. This facile surface modification and optimization are potentially promising, being highly compatible with modern microfabrication technologies and allowing integration of highly electrically conductive CNTs into pyrolyzed carbon to assemble MSCs with improved electrochemical performance.

One is the reduced mass, and the other factor is cluster binding  between an ion and a neutral solvent molecule (modifier). Therefore, separations of isomeric analytes using a modifier can be related to the thermochemistry of the cluster formation, as subtle changes in the molecular structure will affect its charge delocalization and the binding  with the corresponding modifier will be different. We have examined the relationship between calculated Gibbs free energies of the cluster formation and experimental ion mobility measurements (CoV dispersion plots) considering the most prominent ion-modifier interactions: charge-dipole, dipole-dipole, and charge-quadrupole. To explain selectivity effects due to the modifier, we have selected a series of positional isomers of sulfonamide drugs that were analyzed in positive and negative electrospray and the diastereoisomers ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in positive mode. The following modifiers were investigated: water, linear and branched alcohols, acetonitrile, acetone, toluene, and ethyl . We could demonstrate a dependence of the separation selectivity of the differential mobility on the reduced mass and Gibbs free  of the cluster formation. These results are supported by thermochemistry calculations (DFT) and interpreted by molecular modeling. Finally, we describe differential mobility spectrometry selectivity tuning for the multidimensional LCxDMS-MS separation of sulfonamide isomers in human plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562920>Simple or complex organic substrates inhibit arsenite oxidation and aioA gene expression in two β-Proteobacteria strains.</a></h2><p>Microbial transformation of arsenic species and their interaction with the carbon cycle play a major role in the mobility of this toxic metalloid in the environment. The influence of simple or complex organic substrates on arsenic bio-oxidation was studied using two bacterial strains: one - the arsenivorans strain of Thiomonas delicata - is able to use AsIII as sole  source; the other, Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, is not. Experiments were performed at two AsIII concentrations (75 and 2 mg/L). At 75 mg/L As, for both strains, expression of aioA gene decreased when yeast extract concentration was raised from 0.2 to 1 g/L. At 2 mg/L As, the presence of either yeast extract or simple (succinate or ) organic substrates in the medium during bacterial growth decreased the AsIII-oxidation rate by both strains. When added specifically during oxidation test, yeast extract but not simple organic substrates seems to have a negative effect on AsIII oxidation. Taken together, results confirm the negative influence of simple or complex organic substrates on the kinetics of microbial AsIII oxidation and suggest that this effect results from different mechanisms depending on the type of organic substrate. Further, for the first time, the influence of a complex organic substrate, yeast extract, on aioA gene expression has been evidenced.Copyright © 2019 Institut Pasteur.

Given its strong adsorption capacity and its ability to co-precipitation with heavy metals, jarosite is considered a potent scavenger of contaminants in AMD-impacted environments. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the reductive dissolution of jarosite; however, the mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. In this study, an indigenous SRB community enriched from the Dabaoshan mine area (Guangdong, China) was employed to explore the mechanism of the microbial reduction of jarosite. Different cultures, with or without dissolved sulfate and the physical separation of jarosite from bacteria by dialysis bags, were examined. Results indicate that the reduction of jarosite by SRB occurred via an indirect mechanism. In systems with dissolved sulfate, lactate was incompletely oxidized to  coupled with the reduction of SO to S, which subsequently reduced the Fe in jarosite, forming secondary minerals including vivianite, mackinawite and pyrite. In systems without dissolved sulfate, jarosite dissolution occurred prior to reduction, and similar secondary minerals formed as well. Extracellular polymeric substances secreted by SRB appeared to facilitate the release of sulfate from jarosite. Structural sulfate in the solid phase of jarosite may not be available for SRB respiration. Although direct contact between SRB and jarosite is not necessary for mineral reduction, wrapping jarosite into dialysis bags suppressed the reduction to a certain extent. Microbial community composition differed in direct contact treatments and physical separation treatments. Physical separation of the SRB community from jarosite mineral supported the growth of Citrobacter, while Desulfosporosinus dominated in direct contact treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

An inclusion rate of 15% of beet tops silage treated with LAB (replacing 50% of corn silage) in the diet was the most suitable level for lactating cows under the current experimental conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223338>Phosphate removal combined with  supplementation enhances lipid production from water hyacinth by .</a></h2><p>Microbial lipids derived from various lignocellulosic feedstocks have emerged as a promising candidate for the biodiesel industry and a potential substitute for high value-added fats. However, lignocellulosic biomass, especially herbaceous biomass, such as water hyacinth, contains high concentrations of nitrogenous components. These compounds impede microbial lipid production, as lipid biosynthesis is commonly induced by imposing a nutrient deficiency, especially nitrogen starvation. Novel strategies and bioprocesses are pivotal for promoting lipid production from nitrogen-rich biomass.Here a combined strategy of phosphate removal and  supplementation was described for enhanced microbial lipid production on water hyacinth hydrolysates by  (formerly ). Lipid production was significantly improved, when the phosphorus limitation and sugars/ co-utilization strategies were used separately. In this case,  and glucose were consumed simultaneously. Lipid production was observed by the combination of phosphate removal with  supplementation. Lipid titer, content, and yield were determined to be 7.3 g/L, 59.7% and 10.1 g/100 g raw water hyacinth, respectively. These data were increased by 4.2, 4.6, and 4.3 times, respectively, compared to those from the unprocessed hydrolysates. The fatty acid compositions of the resulting lipids bear a marked resemblance to those of rapeseed oil, indicating their applicability to the biodiesel industry.The combination of phosphate removal and  supplementation was successful in significantly enhancing microbial lipid production. This strategy offers a valuable solution for nitrogen-rich lignocellulosic feedstocks utilization, which should foster more economical nitrogen-rich biomass-to-lipid bioprocesses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115632>Development of a shuttle plasmid without host restriction sites for efficient transformation and heterologous gene expression in Clostridium cellulovorans.</a></h2><p>Clostridium cellulovorans capable of producing large amounts of  and butyrate from cellulose is a promising candidate for biofuels and biochemicals production from lignocellulosic biomass. However, the restriction modification (RM) systems of C. cellulovorans hindered the application of existing shuttle plasmids for metabolic engineering of this organism. To overcome the hurdle of plasmid digestion by host, a new shuttle plasmid (pYL001) was developed to remove all restriction sites of two major RM systems of C. cellulovorans, Cce743I and Cce743II. The pYL001 plasmid remained intact after challenge by C. cellulovorans cell extract. Post-electroporation treatments and culturing conditions were also modified to improve cell growth and colony formation on agar plates. With the improvements, the pYL001 plasmid, without in vivo methylation, was readily transformed into C. cellulovorans with colonies of recombinant cells formed on agar plates within 24 h. Three pYL001-derived recombinant plasmids free of Cce743I/Cce743II restriction sites, after synonymous mutation of the heterologous genes, were constructed and transformed into C. cellulovorans. Functional expression of these genes was confirmed with butanol and ethanol production from glucose in batch fermentations by the transformants. The pYL001 plasmid and improved transformation method can facilitate further metabolic engineering of C. cellulovorans for cellulosic butanol production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386790>Nutritive value of treated Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani leaves with the tannin-degrading bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae for ruminant feeding in vitro.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and in vitro gas production (GP) and fermentation parameters of Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani leaves following treatment with the Klebsiella pneumoniae, a tannin-degrading bacterium.This isolate was isolated on medium containing tannic acid as the sole source of carbon and , and identified based on 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. In both oak leaf species (i.e. Q. infectoria and Q. libani), inoculation with Klebsiella pneumoniae significantly increased (P < 0·05) dry matter (DM) loss. For Q. libani, crude protein content was increased (P = 0·02) by bacterial treatment vs. control. In both oak leaves, total phenolic content and total tannins were decreased (P < 0·05) as a consequence of bacterial treatment. However, bacterial processing didn't changed (P > 0·05) organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre or acid detergent lignin content of treated leaves. In both oak leaves the measuring parameters including GP volume, in vitro digestibility of DM and OM, estimated metabolizable , total volatile fatty acids, , ammonia nitrogen concentration, total protozoal population and the subfamily Isotricha in treatments were higher (P < 0·05) than control.It can be concluded that biological treatment of Q. infectoria and Q. libani leaves with K. pneumoniae represents a useful approach to decrease their phenolic compound content and improve their nutritive value as ruminant feed.This study demonstrated that biologically processing of tannin-containing by-products with K. pneumoniae could increase their nutritive value as ruminant feeds and increase animal productivity.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279552>Form of calf diet and the rumen. II: Impact on volatile fatty acid absorption.</a></h2><p>Diet is known to affect rumen growth and development. Calves fed an all-liquid diet have smaller and less developed rumens and a decreased ability to absorb volatile fatty acids (VFA) compared to calves fed both liquid and dry feed. However, it is unknown how rumens respond when challenged with a defined concentration of VFA. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of 2 different feeding programs on VFA absorption in preweaned calves. Neonatal Holstein bull calves were individually housed and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets. The diets were milk replacer only (MRO; n = 5) or milk replacer with starter (MRS; n = 6). Diets were isoenergetic (3.87 ± 0.06 Mcal of metabolizable  per day) and isonitrogenous (0.17 ± 0.003 kg/d of apparent digestible protein). Milk replacer was 22% crude protein, 21.5% fat (dry matter basis). The textured calf starter was 21.5% crude protein (dry matter basis). Feed and ad libitum water intakes were recorded daily. Calves were exposed to a defined concentration of VFA buffer ( 143 mM, propionate 100 mM, butyrate 40.5 mM) 6 h before euthanasia on d 43 ± 1. Rumen fluid samples were obtained every 15 to 30 min for 6 h to measure the rate of VFA absorption. Rumen tissues were obtained from the ventral sac region and processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analyses of the VFA transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4). Body growth did not differ between diets, but empty reticulorumens were heavier in MRS than MRO calves (0.67 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04 kg) and MRS calves had larger papillae areas (0.76 vs. 15 ± 0.08 mm). We observed no differences between diets in terms of the abundance of MCT1 and MCT4 per unit area. These results indicate that the extrapolated increase in total abundance of MCT1 or MCT4 in MRS calves was not due to increased transporter density per unit area. Modeled VFA absorption metrics (flux, mmol/h, or 6 h absorbed VFA in mmol) were not different across diets. These results demonstrate that the form of calfhood diet, whether solely MR or MR and starter, does not alter VFA absorption capacity when the rumen is exposed to a defined concentration of VFA at 6 wk of age.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Gut bacteria are known to produce  substrates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and . The aim of this study was to determine whether ABA alters the proteome of gut microbiota relevant to ATP and  production.The ABA was developed in male mice and compared with food-restricted and ad libitum-fed conditions. Proteomic analysis of feces was performed using the two-dimentional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The in vitro ATP-producing capacity of proteins extracted from feces was assayed.Increased levels of the phosphoglycerate kinase, an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme, was detected in feces of food-restricted mice and this enzyme was further increased in the ABA group. Starvation also upregulated several other proteins synthetized by order Clostridiales including Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. No significant differences in the in vitro ATP-producing capacity by bacterial proteins from ABA, food-restricted, and ad libitum-fed control mice were found. However, plasma levels of  strongly tended to be increased in the activity groups including ABA mice.The data revealed that starvation in food-restricted and ABA mice induced proteome modification in gut bacteria favoring ATP production mainly by the order Clostridiales. However, this did not result in increased total ATP-production capacity by gut microbiota. These changes can be interpreted as an adaptation of specific gut bacteria to the host malnutrition beneficial for host survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Primary method analytes were seven cycloaddition or photohydration transformation products of 17α-trenbolone (17α-TBOH), 17β-trenbolone (17β-TBOH), trendione (TBO), and altrenogest (ALT), which are key contributors to the fate and environmental risks of these steroidal pharmaceuticals. Because commercial analytical standards are not available, reference standards for photoproducts were generated from trenbolone or ALT with a solar simulator (˜6 h, >10 half-lives). Efficient detection of metastable photoproducts required cold and pH neutral conditions, rapid sample processing, minimal sample storage, and consideration of cationic artifacts. Method detection limits (MDLs) were 0.034-0.40 ng L for parent compounds and 0.16-2.1 ng L for photoproducts, sufficient for their detection in agroecosystems. Matrix suppression was observed and corrected by internal standards, and relative recovery rates were near 100% for all analytes except for 12-OH-17α-TBOH (˜75% recovery). Intra-day variation was <20% and inter-day variation <25% for all the analytes. The developed method is capable of the analysis of trenbolone, altrenogest, and their key bioactive photoproducts in agricultural receiving waters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Body weight, rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR) and urine volume, food intake (FI), dry matter intake (DMI) and water intake (WI) were measured daily. Nutrient digestibility was determined from five consecutive days of last week in each diet. Ruminal fluid, urine and blood were collected at the end for determination of rumen protozoa and VFA contents, urinary allantoin excretion, blood cell count and chemistry profiles.Goats fed T2 and T3 showed higher dry matter and nutrients intakes while protein digestibility was suppressed compared with those for T1. Crude fat digestibility declined in T2 but maintained after adding the OPM (T3). High fat intake by giving OPF and OPM corresponded to a higher ruminal /propionate ratio (C2/C3) and serum cholesterol level. An increased urinary allantoin/creatinine ratio was found in T2 and T3 compared with T1, implying an increased number of ruminal microbes.Increased dry matter intake in T2 and T3 suggested that oil palm by-products are partly useful as a replacement for para-grass in goats. Replacement with the by-products increased plasma cholesterol level, which suggested that these products are a useful  source. Changes in rumen parameters suggested an increased microbial number and activity suitable for  production. However, the limited digestibility of protein implies that addition of high protein feeds may be recommended to increase body weight gain of goats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557581>Large-scale synthesis of Ni(OH)/peach gum derived carbon nanosheet composites with high  and power density for battery-type supercapacitor.</a></h2><p>Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)) has been regarded as a potential candidate for battery-type supercapacitor (BTSC) electrodes, but there is still a challenging task to improve its poor cycling life and low conductivity. In this work, a BTSC positive electrode material of Ni(OH)/carbon nanosheets (CNS) was prepared during carbonization of the mixture of hydrothermal peach gum and magnesium , followed by the ion-exchange between Ni and Mg in the resultant. The ion-exchange method avoids the high-temperature treatment, and the obtained Ni(OH) on CNS has nanosheet-like morphology that possesses abundant active surface, facilitating rapid electrochemical charge/discharge process. More importantly, the coupling of CNS material can improve the electric conductivity and provide developed porosities for electrolyte diffusion. A BTSC device was fabricated using the optimized Ni(OH)/CNS-4 composite as the positive electrode and the SNACNS reported in our previous work as the negative electrode, which shows satisfactory capacitive behavior (166 C g) and capacitance retention of 83.9% over continuous 5000 cycles. In addition, high  density of 36.9 Wh kg and power density of 400 W kg have been implemented, which is superior to some BTSCs reported previously. Such an attractive performance indicates that Ni(OH)/CNS-4 composite can be a potential candidate for electrochemical BTSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Four experimental diets were formulated to include 5% of either fresh canola oil (0 mEq/kg of peroxide value) or oxidized canola oil (180 mEq/kg of peroxide value). An equal portion of each diet was supplemented with 0.1% TA. Eight pigs (initial body weight of 82.89 ± 2.26 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum. At the beginning of the experiments, all pigs were fed a nitrogen-free diet for 7 d. Then, they were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to an incomplete replicated 4 × 3 Latin square design with 3 periods to give 6 replicates per treatment. Each experimental period lasted for 9 d, starting with a 5-d adaptation period followed by 2 consecutive 2-d periods for fecal (day 6 and day 7) and ileal digesta (day 8 and day 9) collection. The inclusion of oxidized oil reduced (P < 0.05) the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Pro and the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of NDF. Also, pigs fed the oxidized oil tended to have lower (P ≤ 0.10) lactate and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the ileum and lower (P ≤ 0.10)  and propionate concentrations in the feces than those fed the fresh oil. The supplementation of 0.1% TA reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of NDF and the ATTD of gross , crude protein, and NDF. Additionally, the TA-supplemented diet tended to have a lower (P ≤ 0.10) digestible  content than the nonsupplemented diet. Pigs fed the TA-supplemented diet showed reduced (P < 0.05) AID and SID of His, Cys, and Pro compared with those fed the nonsupplemented diet. There were interactive effects (P < 0.05) of oxidized oil and TA supplementation on , isovalerate, total short chain fatty acids, and pH level in the ileum. In conclusion, the results indicated that the effects of oxidized oil are greater on microbial activities rather than nutrient digestibility. Although negative effects of dietary TA supplementation were observed in relation to nutrient digestibility, TA supplementation was found to ameliorate these negative effects of oxidized oil on microbial metabolites. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the interaction between dietary oxidized oil and TA in relation with the gut microbiota in pigs.© The Author(s) 2019.

Unbleached wood fibers produced from AHF using p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) with or without post-treatments with lignin and hemicelluloses content up to 15% and 25%, respectively, were dissolved directly into the IL DBNH[OAc]. Post-AHF treatments using dilute alkaline and glycerol swelled the cellulose and partially removed residual lignin resulting in improved dissolution. Semi-quantitative 2D HSQC NMR analyses revealed that the undissolved wood fiber residues were enriched with G units and condensed S units (S), demonstrating, as expected, that G units and condensed lignin substructures have a negative effect on dissolution in DBNH[OAc].

This study aimed to develop a continuous methanol-based chain elongation process for the open-culture production of a new-generation biofuel precursor and potential platform chemical: -valerate. Propionate was used as a substrate for chain elongation to -valerate in an anaerobic open-culture bioreactor. In addition, the co-production of - and iso-butyrate in addition to -valerate via, respectively,  and propionate elongation was investigated.-Valerate was produced during batch and continuous experiments with a pH in the range 5.5-5.8 and a hydraulic retention time of 95 h. Decreasing the pH from 5.8 to 5.5 caused an increase of the selectivity for -valerate formation (from 58 up to 70 wt%) during methanol-based propionate elongation. -Valerate and both - and iso-butyrate were produced during simultaneous methanol-based elongation of propionate and . Propionate was within the open-culture preferred over  as a substrate with 10-30% more consumption. Increasing the methanol concentration in the influent (from 250 to 400 mM) resulted in a higher productivity (from 45 to 58 mmol C/L/day), but a lower relative product selectivity (from 49 to 43 wt%) of -valerate. The addition of  as a substrate did not change the average -valerate productivities. Within the continuous bioreactor experiments, 6 to 17 wt% of formed products was methane. The microbial community during all steady-states in both methanol-based elongation bioreactors was dominated by species related to  and .  is the main candidate for -valerate formation from methanol and propionate.-Valerate was for the first time proven to be produced from propionate and methanol by an open-culture bioreactor. Methanogenic activity can be inhibited by decreasing the pH, and the -valerate productivity can be improved by increasing the methanol concentration. The developed process can be integrated with various biorefinery processes from thermochemical, (bio)electrochemical, photovoltaic and microbial technologies.

Such a subtle change in the coordination anion around the Dy site imposes a significant effect on the distinct relaxation dynamics in 1 and 2. Their magnetic properties were characterized through SQUID magnetometry and theoretical calculations to determine the effective  barrier,  levels, magnetic anisotropy and intracluster magnetic exchange coupling interactions. Both tetramers display frequency dependence of the out-of-phase ac magnetic susceptibility signal under zero applied dc field associated with single-molecule magnetic behaviour. The effective  barriers of 1 and 2 are 108 and 40 cm, respectively. Theoretical calculations suggest that the different relaxation dynamics between them are mainly ascribed to the variation of the coordination anion around the Dy site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592578>Europium and  Co-doping Strategy for Developing Stable and Efficient CsPbI Br Perovskite Solar Cells.</a></h2><p>All-inorganic perovskite solar cells have developed rapidly in the last two years due to their excellent thermal and light stability. However, low efficiency and moisture instability limit their future commercial application. The mixed-halide inorganic CsPbI Br perovskite with a suitable bandgap offers a good balance between phase stability and light harvesting. However, high defect density and low carrier lifetime in CsPbI Br perovskites limit the open-circuit voltage (V < 1.2 V), short-circuit current density (J < 15 mA cm ), and fill factor (FF < 75%) of CsPbI Br perovskite solar cells, resulting in an efficiency below 14%. For the first time, a CsPbI Br perovskite is doped by Eu(Ac) to obtain a high-quality inorganic perovskite film with a low defect density and long carrier lifetime. A high efficiency of 15.25% (average efficiency of 14.88%), a respectable V of 1.25 V, a reasonable J of 15.44 mA cm , and a high FF of 79.00% are realized for CsPbI Br solar cells.

Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria exhibit a variety of growth styles and high PHA production activity. Here, we characterized PHA production by four marine purple non-sulfur bacteria strains (, and ) under different growth conditions. Unlike the well-studied PHA-producing bacteria, nutrient limitation is not appropriate for PHA production in marine purple non-sulfur bacteria.

The basal substrate was incubated without additives (control, CTL) and with monensin (MON, 6 μM/g DM) or patchouli essential oil (PEO, 90 μg/g DM) for 24 h. In three different runs, the gas production (GP) was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of incubation using a semi-automatic system. The results revealed that MON had decreased (P < 0.05) the net GP and CH production and digestible and metabolizable  relative to PEO supplementation. The in vitro truly degraded organic matter was not influenced by PEO application, while was reduced (P = 0.027) with MON. Both PEO and MON had similar reducing effect on the activity of carboxymethylcellulase (P = 0.030), in vitro truly degraded neutral detergent fiber (P = 0.010), NH-N concentrations (P = 0.012),  proportion (C2, P = 0.046), C2 to C3 ratio (P = 0.023), and total protozoal count (P = 0.017). Both additives recorded similar elevating potential on the α-amylase activity (P = 0.012), propionate (C3) proportion (P = 0.011), and microbial protein (P = 0.034) compared with CTL. Effects of MON and PEO on ruminal feed degradability, microbial enzyme activities, and total protozoa counts may be responsible for modifying rumen fermentation ecology.

Sixteen Holstein cows were assigned to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 28 d each. Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial with 2 protein sources (SBM and CM) and 2 dietary starch concentrations (21 and 27% dry matter, DM). Diets were formulated to contain 16.5% CP, and the 21% starch diets were obtained by replacing corn grain with soybean hulls and beet pulp. Protein source × starch interactions were observed for DM intake (DMI), milk fat and protein concentrations, milk protein yield, milk urea nitrogen, and feed efficiency. Cows fed CM diets had a higher DMI when dietary starch concentration was 27% compared with 21%, but those cows had DMI similar to that of cows on SBM diets regardless of the starch concentration. Milk fat percentage was decreased in cows fed CM with 27% starch compared with cows fed CM with 21% starch and cows fed SBM with 27% starch. Milk protein percentage and yield and milk lactose percentage were least in cows fed CM with 21% starch compared with the other 3 diets, but feed efficiency was greater for cows fed CM with 21% starch. Milk urea nitrogen was least in cows fed CM with 27% starch compared with the other 3 diets. Cows fed diets with 27% starch produced 2.5 kg/d more milk and 1.9 kg/d more -corrected milk compared with cows fed 21% starch. Digestibility of DM and organic matter was higher in cows fed SBM diets than in cows on CM diets, and cows fed 27% starch showed greater DM and organic matter digestibility than cows on 21% starch. Digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber was greater in diets with SBM than in those with CM. Molar proportion of  was the lowest for cows fed CM with 21% starch compared with cows fed SBM with 21% starch, with the remaining cows fed being intermediate and similar. However, propionate was highest for cows fed CM with 21% starch than for cows fed SBM with 21% starch, but the remaining treatments were intermediate and similar. Isobutyrate was greater for cows fed CM with 21% starch, which resulted in the lowest :propionate ratio compared with cows fed the remaining treatments. Overall, we confirmed that the interaction of protein with starch in CM diets can sustain similar cow performance as with the SBM diets. Those making decisions about starch concentration and protein source should consider feed price when SBM or CM and different starch levels are being formulated in diets for lactating dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

By comparing the binding  and b-oriented angle of zeolite film on each modified α-quartz substrate, the orientations, and combinations derived from structure-adsorption relationship were investigated with Material Studio simulation. Furthermore, the effects of calcination temperature and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation time on the surface structure and adsorption activity of TiO coating were studied. The increase adsorption potential  and the formation of Ti-O-Si bind between zeolite crystal phase and substrate facilitate the continuous and uniform zeolite film growth. The TiO interlayer with anatase phase after UV irradiation presents a smooth surface with high Ti-OH density, consequently to high selectivity of b-orientation growth for the ZSM-5 crystals. Compared with the traditional ZSM-5, the higher stability has been exhibited with b-oriented ZSM-5 film /TiO/α-quartz in the MTA reaction, and the methanol conversion and BTX selectivity remained higher than 90 and 70%, after 6 h reaction.Copyright © 2019 Chu, Yang, Meng, Yu, Wan, Wu and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464416>Effects of Methyl  as a Co-Solvent in Carbonate-Based Electrolytes for Improved Lithium Metal Batteries.</a></h2><p>In lithium metal batteries (LMBs), electrolytes composed of salts and organic solvents play a significant role in transporting Li ions and creating the surface film on Li-metal anodes.

Herein, we develop a general water-induced self-exfoliation (WISE) strategy to achieve the fast synthesis of metal hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets with alomost single-layer atoms thickness in a large scale. In a typical process of layered cobalt hydroxide (LCH) nanosheets, the pre-synthesized cobalt  hydroxide precursor is directly exfoliated to form nanosheets under the attack of H2O in a few seconds. The water-induced self-exfoliation mechanism has also been proposed based on the analysis of the designed alcohol-mediated slow-down process. In addition, the used solutions and effluents can be recycled making WISE a green, efficient and surfactants-free method.

In particular, odd-chain carboxylic acids (OCCAs) such as valerate (C) and heptanoate (C), were produced at relatively high concentrations upon propionate supplementation. Using a statistical experimental design method, the optimal culture medium was established for the selective production of OCCAs among the total produced acids.

To clarify the metabolism of the exogenous added propionate for OCCAs production, C tracer experiments were performed by supplementing the culture broth with [1,2,3-C] propionate.

Clustering by gut microbiota revealed the existence of two communities mainly driven by diet as host properties showed little effect. Community 1 presented lower richness and diversity, but higher dominance and rarity of species, including some pathobionts. Moreover, its microbiota composition was tightly linked to host blood metabolites related to lipid metabolism and glycolysis at basal time. Despite the lower fiber intake, community type 1 appeared more specialized to produce  as a mean of maintaining the  supply as glucose concentrations fell during the race. On the other hand, community type 2 showed an enrichment of fibrolytic and cellulolytic bacteria as well as anaerobic fungi, coupled to a higher production of propionate and butyrate. The higher butyrate proportion in community 2 was not associated with protective effects on telomere lengths but could have ameliorated mucosal inflammation and oxidative status.

This strongly contrasts to the previous case, where only the MnCl precursor was suitable for Mn doping by considering the matching of bond dissociation energies between Mn-Cl and Pb-Cl. The Mn doping concentration and luminescence quantum yield are highly dependent on trimethylchlorosilane content. A new doping mechanism is proposed, where the incorporation of Mn into CsPbCl is achieved via directly inserting [MnCl] octahedra into the perovskite structure during the nucleation/growth processes instead of Mn-to-Pb cation exchange. Accordingly, increasing Cl content in the reaction solution indeed promotes the doping of other divalent transition metal ions such as Ni, Cu and Zn in CsPbCl and improve the quantum yield of CsPbCl nanocrystals up to ∼20% compared to the undoped counterparts (∼1%).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360415>Combination of gallium(iii) with  for combating antibiotic resistant .</a></h2><p>Gallium(iii) has been widely used as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent in clinics for the treatment of various diseases, in particular, Ga-based drugs have been exploited as antimicrobials to combat the crisis of antimicrobial resistance.

The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of a folic acid and vitamin B12 supplement and feed restriction on several immune parameters. Sixteen cows at 45 ± 3 days in milk were assigned to 8 blocks of 2 cows each according to each cow's milk production in the previous week, and within each block, the cows randomly received weekly intramuscular injections of either saline or 320 mg of folic acid and 10 mg of vitamin B12 for 5 weeks. During week 5, the cows were fed 75% of their ad libitum intake for 4 days. Blood samples were taken before the beginning of the experiment, just before feed restriction and after 3 days of feed restriction, in order to evaluate blood cell populations, the phagocytosis capacity and oxidative burst of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and β-hydroxybutyrate. The vitamin supplement did not affect any of the tested variables except milk fat and lactose content. Feed restriction reduced milk production and increased the concentration of NEFAs. Feed restriction did not affect blood cell populations but did reduce the percentage of PMN positive for oxidative burst after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-. The proliferation of PBMCs was reduced when the cell culture medium was supplemented with sera collected during the feed restriction. In conclusion, feed restriction affected the functions of PMN and PBMC and this effect was not prevented by the folic acid and vitamin B12 supplement. These results support the hypothesis that the greater risk of infectious diseases in cows experiencing a NEB is related to impaired immune cell functions by high circulating concentration of NEFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31092798>Metabolite Profile Analysis of Aurantiochytrium limacinum SR21 Grown on -based Medium for Lipid Fermentation.</a></h2><p>Thraustochytrids, a group of marine protists, are continuously gaining attention due to their capability in producing lipids for various biotechnological applications towards foods, medicines, chemicals, and biofuels.

Till now, the effects of PCB on methane production during WAS anaerobic digestion was still limited. This study aimed to investigate whether and how PCB affects methane production. Results showed that the increased PCB concentration led to the less methane produced. At the highest concentrations of PCB (100 mg/kg DS) in this study, the methane production (112 ± 6 L CH/kg VS) was significantly reduced by 26.6 ± 0.1% compared to the control (153 ± 7 L CH/kg VS). Correspondingly, VS destruction at the studied concentrations showed the similar trend. In addition, the dewaterability evaluation indicated that the PCB resulted in the deteriorative sludge dewaterability. The mechanism studies suggested that the decreased methane production with the increased levels of PCB was attributed to the suppression on hydrolysis-acidification and methanation processes. This also was supported by the decreasing key enzymes activities associated with methane production (protease, cellulase,  kinase (AK) and coenzyme F).

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).

In this research, an intimately coupled autarkical electrosorption (ES)-microbial fuel cell (MFC) system was developed for real-time removal of the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) from wastewater. The removal efficiency was founded to be up to 98.8% at an OTC concentration of 2 mg/L with 3 g/L sodium  (NaAC) as co-substrate and 3 MFCs as power supply. The removal efficiencies increased in the ES unit and decreased in the MFC unit with increasing treating time. The adsorption of OTC on activated carbon fibers (ACFs) in the ES unit proceeds via chemical adsorption resulting from electrostatic attraction and cation exchange. The OTC degradation pathways in the MFC unit were proposed by identifying the intermediates with HPLC-MS/MS. The ACFs in the ES unit were proven to be recyclable and the coupled ES-MFC system is applicable for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The capturing agents were calcium and magnesium oxides formed during the transformation of calcite and dolomite. The effectiveness of two different scrubbing solutions (0.15 M cadmium  and 1.1 M potassium hydroxide) for absorption of volatilized HS and SO was also investigated. The bituminous coal (coal A) contained dolomite, calcite, pyrite, and organic sulfur. Lignite (coal B) had a high organic sulfur content and contained gypsum, no or low dolomite and pyrite contents, and no calcite. A third sample (coal C) was prepared by adding 5 wt % potassium carbonate to coal A. Under oxidizing conditions and at elevated temperatures, FeS produced FeO, FeO, and SO. It transformed to FeS and released HS under inert conditions. Organic sulfur interacted with organically bound calcium and magnesium at 400 °C in an inert atmosphere to form calcium sulfate and oldhamite ((Ca,Mg)S). CaO, produced from calcite or dolomite, reacted with SO and O at 950 °C to form calcium sulfate. Treatment of lignite at 400-950 °C resulted in 96-98% evolution of sulfur as gases. Hydrogen sulfide formation increased with the increasing thermal treatment temperature under inert conditions for the three coals. Under oxidizing conditions, sulfur dioxide formation decreased with the increasing temperature when heating coals B and C. The lowest ratio (0.01) of HS to SO was achieved during thermal treatment of the blend of coal and potassium carbonate (coal C), implying that almost all of sulfur was retained in the coal C ash/char samples. In situ capturing of sulfur gases by CaO and MgO and by the added KCO in coal C to form calcium/magnesium/potassium sulfates and potassium/calcium/magnesium aluminosilicate glasses during utilization of these and similar coals could reduce the percentage of sulfur volatilized from the coals by 54-100%, thereby potentially decreasing their impact on the environment.</p></html>
