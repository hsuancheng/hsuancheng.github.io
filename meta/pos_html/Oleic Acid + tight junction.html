By varying the polar head (carbohydrate moiety) and the hydrophobic tail (fatty ), surfactants with different physico-chemical characteristics can be easily prepared. While many research papers have focused on sucrose derivatives, relatively few studies have been carried out on lactose-based surfactants. In this work, we present the synthesis and the physico-chemical characterization of lactose oleate. The new derivative was obtained by enzymatic mono-esterification of lactose with . Thermal, surface, and aggregation properties of the surfactant were studied in detail and the cytotoxicity profile was investigated by MTS and LDH assays on intestinal Caco-2 monolayers. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements on Caco-2 cells showed a transient and reversible effect on the  opening, which correlates with the increased permeability of 4 kDa fluorescein-labelled dextran (as model for macromolecular drugs) in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, lactose oleate displayed a satisfactory antimicrobial activity over a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, the obtained results are promising for a further development of lactose oleate as an intestinal absorption enhancer and/or an alternative biodegradable preservative for pharmaceutical and food applications.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Endogenous oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and the dietary metabolite, 2-monoacylglycerol (2-OG), can each activate GPR119. Here, we compared mucosal responses with selective, synthetic GPR119 agonists (AR440006 and AR231453) and the lipids, OEA, 2-OG, and N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA), monitoring epithelial ion transport as a readout for L-cell activity in native mouse and human gastrointestinal (GI) mucosae. We also assessed GPR119 modulation of colonic motility in wild-type (WT), GPR119-deficient (GPR119-/-), and PYY-deficient (PYY-/-) mice. The water-soluble GPR119 agonist, AR440006 (that cannot traverse epithelial tight junctions), elicited responses, when added apically or basolaterally in mouse and human colonic mucosae. In both species, GPR119 responses were PYY, Y1 receptor mediated, and glucose dependent. AR440006 efficacy matched the GI distribution of L-cells in WT tissues but was absent from GPR119-/- tissue. OEA and 2-OG responses were significantly reduced in the GPR119-/- colon, but OLDA responses were unchanged. Alternative L-cell activation via free fatty  receptors 1, 3, and 4 and the G protein-coupled bile  receptor TGR5 or by the melanocortin 4 receptor, was unchanged in GPR119-/- tissues. The GPR119 agonist slowed transit in WT but not the PYY-/- colon in vitro. AR440006 (intraperitoneally) slowed WT colonic and upper-GI transit significantly in vivo. These data indicate that luminal or blood-borne GPR119 agonism can stimulate L-cell PYY release with paracrine consequences and slower motility. We suggest that this glucose-dependent L-cell response to a gut-restricted GPR119 stimulus has potential therapeutic advantage in modulating insulinotropic signaling with reduced risk of hypoglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25505251>A gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic , ameliorates intestinal epithelial  impairment partially via GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway.</a></h2><p>Gut microbial metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted much attention because of their various physiological properties. Dysfunction of tight junction (TJ) in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of many disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We evaluated the effects of five novel gut microbial metabolites on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced  impairment in Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. 10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , suppressed TNF-α and dextran sulfate sodium-induced changes in the expression of TJ-related molecules, occludin, zonula occludens-1, and myosin light chain kinase. HYA also suppressed the expression of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) mRNA and protein expression in Caco-2 cells and colonic tissue. In addition, HYA suppressed the protein expression of TNFR2 in murine intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, HYA significantly up-regulated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 expression in Caco-2 cells. It also induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in HEK293 cells expressing human GPR40 with higher sensitivity than linoleic , its metabolic precursor. The -recovering effects of HYA were abrogated by a GPR40 antagonist and MEK inhibitor in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, 10-hydroxyoctadacanoic , which is a gut microbial metabolite of  and lacks a carbon-carbon double bond at Δ12 position, did not show these TJ-restoring activities and down-regulated GPR40 expression. Therefore, HYA modulates TNFR2 expression, at least partially, via the GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway and may be useful in the treatment of TJ-related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822974>The effect of non-specific tight junction modulators on the transepithelial transport of poorly permeable drugs across airway epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The epithelial  in the respiratory system is a major obstacle for drug delivery to the systemic circulation in the lung. Epithelial  hinders the transport of large macromolecules or polar drugs. Essential components of this epithelial fence are physical intercellular structures termed tight junctions. Therefore, modulating tight junctions can enhance paracellular transport across epithelial . In this study, the effect of some of non-specific tight junction modulators (TJMs); (Sodium (Na) decanoate,  and ethyleneglycol-bis-(β-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic  (EGTA)) with established effect on intestinal tight junctions was evaluated for its effects on bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells). It was demonstrated that the effect of TJMs especially Na decanoate resulted in a reversible opening of tight junctions evidenced by the decrease in the transepithelial resistance. It was also demonstrated that this reduction of TEER upon exposing the epithelial cells to the TJMs resulted in a significant increase in Flu-Na (paracellular marker) and PXS25 (anti-fibrotic compound) transepithelial transport through this . In conclusion, among the investigated non-specific TJMs, Na decanoate fulfilled the requirements of an effective, non-toxic and reversible tight junction modulator for Calu-3 lung epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30581478>Colquhounia Root Tablet Protects Rat Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cells against TNF--Induced Injury by Upregulating the Expression of  Proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1.</a></h2><p>There are currently limited effective pharmacotherapy agents for acute lung injury (ALI). Inflammatory response in the lungs is the main pathophysiological process of ALI. Our preliminary data have shown that colquhounia root tablet (CRT), a natural herbal medicine, alleviates the pulmonary inflammatory responses and edema in a rat model with -induced ALI. However, the potential molecular action mechanisms underlining its protective effects against ALI are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of CRT in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMEC) with TNF--induced injury.PMECs were divided into 6 groups: normal control, TNF- (10 ng/mL TNF-), Dex (1×10 M Dex + 10 ng/mL TNF-), CRT high (1000 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-), CRT medium (500 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-), and CRT low group (250 ng/mL CRT + 10 ng/mL TNF-). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell micromorphology was observed under transmission electron microscope. The localization and expression of  proteins Claudin-5 and ZO-1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, respectively.TNF-a had successfully induced an acute endothelial cell injury model. Dex and CRT treatments had significantly stimulated the growth and reduced the apoptosis of PMECs (all  < 0.05 or 0.01) and alleviated the TNF--induced cell injury. The expression of Claudin-5 and ZO-1 in Dex and all 3 CRT groups was markedly increased compared with TNF-a group (all  < 0.05 or 0.01).CRT effectively protects PMECs from TNF--induced injury, which might be mediated via stabilizing the structure of . CRT might be a promising, effective, and safe therapeutic agent for the treatment of ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30541647>[Effects of keratinocyte growth factor-2 on expressions of chemokine FKN and tight junction protein claudin-5 in lung of rats with acute lung injury].</a></h2><p>To observe the effects of keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) on the expressions of chemokine FKN and tight junction protein claudin-5 in lung tissue of rats with acute lung injury (ALI).Healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal saline (NS) control group, ALI model group and KGF-2 pretreatment group, with 10 rats in each group. The rat ALI model was reproduced by injection of 0.01 mL/kg  into the tail vein, and the rats in NS control group were injected with the same amount of NS. The rats in KGF-2 pretreatment group were instilled with 5 mg/kg KGF-2 in the airway at 72 hours before the model reproduction, and the rats in the NS control group and the ALI model group were instilled with the same amount of NS. The abdominal aortic blood of rats was collected at 8 hours after model reproduction, and then the rats were sacrificed, bronchoalveolar in left lung was lavage, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for determination of protein levels in plasma and BALF, and the lung permeability index (LPI) was calculated. The lung tissues were harvested, after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the histopathological changes were observed under light microscope, and the ALI pathology score (LIS) was calculated. The lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio was determined. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the expressions of FKN and claudin-5 in the lung tissue. The correlation between two variables was analyzed by linear or curve fitting correlation analysis.In the ALI model group, the lung tissue was severely damaged, and obvious pathological changes were observed, including thickened alveolar space and inflammatory cell infiltration, and LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly higher than those of the NS control group (LIS: 3.56±0.28 vs. 0.62±0.36, lung W/D ratio: 6.37±0.29 vs. 4.39±0.33, LPI: 3.46±0.69 vs. 0.98±0.17, all P < 0.01). Compared with the NS control group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of the ALI model group was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.97±0.18 vs. 0.62±0.04, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.56±0.11 vs. 1.06±0.13, P < 0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.817, P = 0.025). After pretreatment with KGF-2, the degree of lung tissue damage was significantly reduced, and the pathological changes were significantly improved, and the LIS score, lung W/D ratio and LPI were significantly lower than those of the ALI model group (LIS: 2.41±0.17 vs. 3.56±0.28, lung W/D ratio: 5.45±0.55 vs. 6.37±0.29, LPI: 2.42±0.19 vs. 3.46±0.69, all P < 0.01). Compared with the ALI model group, the positive expression of FKN in the lung tissue of KGF-2 pretreatment group was significantly decreased, and the expression level was significantly decreased (FKN/GAPDH: 0.79±0.03 vs. 0.97±0.18, P < 0.01); the positive expression of claudin-5 was significantly increased, and the expression level was significantly increased (claudin-5/GAPDH: 0.80±0.05 vs. 0.56±0.11, P < 0.01). There was still a significant negative correlation between FKN and claudin-5 protein expression (r = -0.847, P = 0.012).KGF-2 may restore the expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 by down-regulating the expression of chemokine FKN, thereby reducing the damage of blood  in ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652184>Irsogladine maleate regulates gap junctional intercellular communication-dependent epithelial  in human nasal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>The airway epithelium of the human nasal mucosa acts as the first physical  that protects against inhaled substances and pathogens. Irsogladine maleate (IM) is an enhancer of gastric mucosal protective factors via upregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). GJIC is thought to participate in the formation of functional tight junctions. However, the effects of IM on GJIC and the epithelial  in human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) remain unknown. To investigate the effects of IM on GJIC and the tight junctional  in HNECs, primary cultures of HNECs transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-HNECs) were treated with IM and the GJIC inhibitors oleamide and 18β-GA. Some cells were pretreated with IM before treatment with TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) to examine whether IM prevented the changes via TLR3-mediated signal pathways. In hTERT-HNECs, GJIC blockers reduced the expression of tight junction molecules claudin-1, -4, -7, occludin, tricellulin, and JAM-A. IM induced GJIC activity and enhanced the expression of claudin-1, -4, and JAM-A at the protein and mRNA levels with an increase of  . GJIC blockers prevented the increase of the tight junction proteins induced by IM. Furthermore, IM prevented the reduction of JAM-A but not induction of IL-8 and TNF-α induced by poly(I:C). In conclusion, IM can maintain the GJIC-dependent tight junctional  via regulation of GJIC in upper airway nasal epithelium. Therefore, it is possible that IM may be useful as a nasal spray to prevent the disruption of the epithelial  by viral infections and exposure to allergens in human nasal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438083>Supplemental feeding of a gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic , alleviates spontaneous atopic dermatitis and modulates intestinal microbiota in NC/nga mice.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the antiallergic and anti-inflammatory effects of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), a novel gut microbial metabolite of linoleic , in NC/Nga mice, a model of atopic dermatitis (AD). Feeding HYA decreased the plasma immunoglobulin E level and skin infiltration of mast cells with a concomitant decrease in dermatitis score. HYA feeding decreased TNF-α and increased claudin-1, a  protein, levels in the mouse skin. Cytokine expression levels in the skin and intestinal Peyer's patches cells suggested that HYA improved the Th1/Th2 balance in mice. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the feces of the HYA-fed mice was approximately four times higher than that in the control mice. Finally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene of fecal microbes indicated the modification of microbiota by HYA. Taken together, the alterations in the intestinal microbiota might be, at least in part, associated with the antiallergic effect of HYA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut microbiota and fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to M2 pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with . Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of , which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed only in distantly related models and remains poorly understood. Although polarized epithelial cells have a rather simple morphology with a basolateral and an apical domain, hepatocytes exhibit complex polarization structures. However, it has been reported that some selected polarized HepG2 cell clones can exhibit a honeycomb pattern of distribution of the  proteins typical of columnar polarized epithelia, which can be used as a simple model to study the role of cell polarization in viral infection of hepatocytes. To obtain similar clones, HepG2 cells expressing CD81 (HepG2-CD81) were used, and clones were isolated by limiting dilutions. Two clones exhibiting a simple columnar polarization capacity when grown on a semipermeable support were isolated and characterized. To test the polarity of HCV entry and release, our polarized HepG2-CD81 clones were infected with cell culture-derived HCV. Our data indicate that HCV binds equally to both sides of the cells, but productive infection occurs mainly when the virus is added at the basolateral domain. Furthermore, we also observed that HCV virions are released from the basolateral domain of the cells. Finally, when polarized cells were treated with  and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, to promote lipoprotein secretion, a higher proportion of infectious viral particles of lower density were secreted. This cell culture system provides an excellent model to investigate the influence of cell polarization on the HCV life cycle. Hepatitis C is a major health burden, with approximately 170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) primarily infects hepatocytes, which are highly polarized cells with a complex organization. The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed in distantly related models and remains unclear. Hepatocyte organization is complex, with multiple apical and basolateral surfaces. A simple culture model of HepG2 cells expressing CD81 that are able to polarize with unique apical and basolateral domains was developed to study HCV infection. With this model, we demonstrated that HCV enters and exits hepatocytes by the basolateral domain. Furthermore, lower-density viral particles were produced under conditions that promote lipoprotein secretion. This cell culture system provides a useful model to study the influence of cell polarization on HCV infection.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29224009>ITRAQ-Based Proteomics Analysis of Acute Lung Injury Induced by  in Mice.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and the pathogenesis of  (OA)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice.Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were injected with OA through the tail vein and sacrificed 6 hours after OA administration to identify protein expression levels in lung tissue using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology. Then, DEPs such as antithrombin III (AT III), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO), dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), polycystin-2 and plasminogen were identified by western blotting. Subsequently, we focused on investigating the effect of AT III on endothelial integrity using siRNA interference technology. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β expression were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alterations in the  component ZO-1 and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC) were determined by western blotting. The stress fiber F-actin were also detected by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, endothelial permeability was determined via a transwell permeability assay.A total of 5152 proteins were found to be expressed in lung tissues from the OA-treated and saline-treated mice. Among these proteins, 849 were differentially expressed between the two groups, including 545 upregulated and 304 downregulated proteins. After AT III knockdown, the levels of inflammatory factors and endothelial permeability were elevated, the expression of ZO-1 was decreased, and the expression of F-actin and pMLC was increased. All these results illustrated that AT III knockdown exaggerated the disruption of endothelial integrity mediated by OA.These findings using iTRAQ technology demonstrate, for the first time, differences in the lung tissue expression levels of proteins between OA-treated mice and saline-treated mice. This study reveals that 12-LO, DOCK2 and especially AT III may be candidate biomarkers for OA-induced acute lung injury.© 2017 The Author(s). Published by S.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.
