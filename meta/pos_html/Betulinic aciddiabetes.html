Recently, they have been demonstrated to maintain insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic properties, and they serve as an alternative treatment for metabolic diseases. In this work, an affinity-based bioassay was found to be effective for selecting PPAR ligands from the dried extract of an African plant (Diospyros bipindensis). Among the ligands, we identified  (BA), a compound already known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antidiabetic properties, as a PPARγ and PPARα antagonist. Cell differentiation assays showed that BA inhibits adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis; either down-regulates or does not affect the expression of a series of adipogenic markers; and up-regulates the expression of osteogenic markers. Moreover, BA increases basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The crystal structure of the complex of BA with PPARγ sheds light, at the molecular level, on the mechanism by which BA antagonizes PPARγ, and indicates a unique binding mode of this antagonist type. The results of this study show that the natural compound BA could be an interesting and safe candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and bone diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884795>A 70% Ethanol Extract of Mistletoe Rich in Betulin, , and Oleanolic Acid Potentiated β-Cell Function and Mass and Enhanced Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity.</a></h1><p>We investigated that the long-term consumption of the water (KME-W) and 70% ethanol (KME-E) mistletoe extracts had antidiabetic activities in partial pancreatectomized (Px) rats. Px rats were provided with a high-fat diet containing 0.6% KME-E, 0.6% KME-W, and 0.6% dextrin (control) for 8 weeks. As normal-control, Sham-operated rats were provided with 0.6% dextrin. In cell-based studies, the effects of its main terpenoids (betulin, , and oleanolic acid) on glucose metabolism were measured. Both KME-W and KME-E decreased epididymal fat mass by increasing fat oxidation in diabetic rats. KME-E but not KME-W exhibited greater potentiation of first-phase insulin secretion than the Px-control in a hyperglycemic clamp. KME-E also made β-cell mass greater than the control by increasing β-cell proliferation and decreasing its apoptosis. In a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, whole-body glucose infusion rate and hepatic glucose output increased with potentiating hepatic insulin signaling in the following order: Px-control, KME-W, KME-E, and normal-control. Betulin potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via increased PPAR-γ activity and insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas oleanolic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation in insulinoma cells. In conclusion, KME-E prevented the deterioration of glucose metabolism in diabetic rats more effectively than KME-W and KME-E can be a better therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes than KME-W.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077913>Structural modifications of 2,3-indolobetulinic acid: Design and synthesis of highly potent α-glucosidase inhibitors.</a></h1><p>A series of nineteen nitrogen-containing lupane triterpenoids was obtained by modification of C2, C3, C20 and C28 positions of betulonic acid and their α-glucosidase inhibiting activity was investigated. Being a leader compound from our previous study, 2,3-indolo- was used as the main template for different modifications at C-(28)-carboxyl group to obtain cyano-, methylcyanoethoxy-, propargyloxy- and carboxamide derivatives. 20-Oxo- and 29-hydroxy-20-oxo-30-nor-analogues of 2,3-indolo- were synthesized by ozonolysis of betulonic acid followed by Fischer indolization reaction. To compare the influence of the fused indole or the seven-membered A-ring on the inhibitory activity, lupane A-azepanones with different substituents at C28 were synthesized. The structure-activity relationships revealed that the enzyme inhibition activity dramatically increased (up to 4730 times) when the carboxylic group of 2,3-indolo- was converted to the corresponding amide. Thus, the IC values for glycine amide and L-phenylalanine amides were 0.04 and 0.05 μM, respectively. This study also revealed that 2,3-indolo-platanic acid is 4.5 times more active than the parent triterpenoid with IC of 0.4 μM. Molecular modeling suggested that improved potency is due to additional polar interactions formed between C28 side chain and a sub-pocket of the α-glucosidase allosteric site.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For α-amylase inhibitory activity, the IC values of ursolic acid, corosolic acid, and oleanolic acid were 22.6±2.4μM, 31.2±3.4μM, and 94.1±6.7μM, respectively. For α-glucosidase inhibition, the IC values of ursolic acid, corosolic acid, , and oleanolic acid were 12.1±1.0μM, 17.2±0.9μM, 14.9±1.9μM, and 35.6±2.6μM, respectively. The combination of corosolic acid and oleanolic acid with acarbose showed synergistic inhibition against α-amylase. The combination of the tested triterpenes with acarbose mainly exhibited additive inhibition against α-glucosidase. Kinetic studies revealed that corosolic acid and oleanolic acid showed non-competitive inhibition and acarbose showed mixed-type inhibition against α-amylase. The results provide valuable implications for the triterpenes (ursolic acid, corosolic acid, and oleanolic acid) alone or in combination with acarbose as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, and no established therapeutic regimens for treating NAFLD exist. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main cellular energy sensor, has been implicated as a key regulator of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism. Recently, emerging evidence indicates that many plant-derived natural products are capable of ameliorating NAFLD by targeting AMPK.The published literature in PubMed relating to this topic was searched through June 2016.Significant advances have been made with respect to understanding the protective effects of plant-derived natural products against NAFLD. A variety of natural products, including alkaloids (berberine, demethyleneberberine, nicotine, caffeine, etc.), polyphenols (resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, caffeic acid, etc.) and other compounds (β- caryophyllene, gastrodin, compound K, , etc.), have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies. Mechanistic studies of these compounds have focused on their activation of AMPK and its downstream effectors involved in lipid metabolism.The findings of this review confirm that plant-derived natural products capable of activating the AMPK signaling pathway are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435224>Investigation of triamterene as an inhibitor of the TGR5 receptor: identification in cells and animals.</a></h1><p>G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) has been shown to participate in glucose homeostasis. In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5. Therefore, triamterene can be developed as a clinical inhibitor of TGR5 activation in future studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909900>In vitro evaluation of the α-glucosidase inhibitory potential of methanolic extracts of traditionally used antidiabetic plants.</a></h1><p>Different plant parts of Roylea cinerea (D.

(Cornaceae) are traditionally used in the management of  and various other diseases.The air-dried plant parts from different plants were coarsely powdered and macerated in methanol to obtain their crude extracts. The crude extracts were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. On the basis of results obtained, the methanolic crude extract of Cornus capitata Wall. was further sequentially fractionated in hexane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol. Fractions obtained were also evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential. The kinetic study was performed using Lineweaver Burk plot to evaluate the type of inhibition. Furthermore, in silico analysis was also carried with active sites of the enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) using Autodock4.Among all the plant extracts, Cornus capitata extract showed maximum inhibitory activity. Therefore its methanolic extract was further fractionated with the help of different solvents and the maximum activity was shown by the ethyl acetate fraction (IC 50 μg/mL). Kinetic analysis indicated that Vmax and Km were increased indicating a competitive type of inhibition. In docking studies, among different constituents known in this plant,  showed minimum binding energy (- 10.21 kcal/mol).

In animals, TGR5 activation by a chemical agonist may increase incretin secretion and reduce the blood sugar level. Recently,  has been suggested to activate TGR5. Ursolic acid is a well-known pentacyclic triterpenoid that is similar to . It is of special interest to determine the potential effect of ursolic acid on TGR5. Therefore, we transfected cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells with the TGR5 gene. The functions of the transfected cells were confirmed via glucose uptake using a fluorescent indicator. Moreover, NCI-H716 cells that secreted incretin were also investigated, and the glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) levels were quantified using ELISA kits. In addition, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetic rats were used to identify the effect of ursolic acid in vivo. Ursolic acid concentration dependently increased glucose uptake in CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. In NCI-H716 cells, ursolic acid induced a concentration-dependent elevation in GLP-1 secretion, which was inhibited by triamterene at the effective concentrations to block TGR5. Ursolic acid also increased the plasma GLP-1 level via TGR5 activation, which was further characterized in vivo with type 1-like diabetic rats. Moreover, ursolic acid is more effective than  in reduction of hyperglycemia and increase of GLP-1 secretion. Therefore, we demonstrated that ursolic acid can activate TGR5, enhancing GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, ursolic acid is suitable for use in TGR5 activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009869>The protective effect of  (BA) diabetic nephropathy on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.</a></h1><p>The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of  (BA) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.

The blood glucose, the contents of insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum were examined. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in kidney tissues were measured. Moreover, the histopathological alteration and the protein expressions of the signaling pathway were detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and western blotting, respectively. BA significantly decreased the levels of serum insulin, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and blood glucose. In addition, BA increased the activities of SOD, CAT and reduced the contents of MDA, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in kidney tissues. BA also ameliorated the histopathological condition.

Previous drug design has focused on inhibitors targeting the active site of PTP1B. However, this has not been successful because the active site is positively charged and conserved among the protein tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, it is important to develop PTP1B inhibitors with alternative inhibitory strategies. Using computational studies including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations, we found that lupane triterpenes selectively inhibited PTP1B by targeting its more hydrophobic and less conserved allosteric site. These findings were verified using two enzymatic assays. Furthermore, the cell culture studies showed that lupeol and  inhibited the PTP1B activity stimulated by TNFα in neurons.

Molecular docking studies showed significant molecular interactions of the triterpene inhibitors with Gly220, Cys215, Gly218 and Asp48 inside the active site of PTP1B. The antidiabetic activity of A. roxburghiana could be attributed due to PTP1B inhibition by its triterpene constituents, betulin,  and taraxeryl acetate.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported to have a variety of biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study was designed to determine whether BA could prevent atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein-E gene knockout (ApoE KO) mice. The mice were treated with BA for 12 weeks to examine its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis in ApoE KO mice. Male ApoE KO mice and age-matched control group mice (C57BL/6Jms) were used as experimental systems and their systolic blood pressure, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation were measured. BA-treated ApoE KO mice showed lowered systolic blood pressure. The metabolic parameter showed that BA decreased blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. Blood glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance results, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were found to be better in BA-treated ApoE KO mice than untreated ApoE KO mice. Consistent with the change in lipid profiles, oil red O and H&E staining revealed that treatment with BA reduced atherosclerotic lesions such as roughened endothelial layers. BA ameliorated the reduction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, leading to the inhibition of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin 1 (ET-1) expression. These results suggest that BA may be useful in the treatment and prevention of early atherosclerosis via the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic ApoE KO mice.Copyright © 2017.

(BA), a pentacyclic triterpene derived from the bark of the white birch tree, has been demonstrated to have many pharmacological activities. However, the effect of BA on DN has not been fully elucidated. To explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of BA and their underlying mechanisms, we used streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat kidneys and high glucose-treated glomerular mesangial cells. Our study showed BA could inhibit the degradation of IκBα and the activity of NF-κB in diabetic rat kidneys and high glucose-induced mesangial cells, resulting in reduction of FN expression. In addition, BA suppressed the DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity of NF-κB in high glucose-induced glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). Furthermore, BA enhanced the interaction between IκBα and β-arrestin2 in mesangial cells.

The aqueous extract inhibited yeast α-glucosidase with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 28.6 μg/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of several compounds, including one cyanogenic glycoside [prunasin (1)], five flavonoids [(-)-epi-catechin (2), hyperoside (3), isoquercetin (4), quercitrin (5) and quercetin-3-O-(6''-benzoyl)-β-galactoside (6)] and two simple aromatic compounds [picein (7) and methylarbutin (8)]. The most active compound was 6 with IC50 values of 30 μM in the case of yeast α-glucosidase, and 437 μM in the case of the mammalian enzyme. According to the kinetic analyses performed with rat and yeast enzymes, this compound behaved as mixed-type inhibitor; the calculated inhibition constants (Ki) were 212 and 50 μM, respectively. Molecular docking analyses with yeast and mammalian α-glucosidases revealed that compound 6 bind differently to these enzymes. Altogether, the results of this work suggest that preparations of V. corymbosa might delay glucose absorption in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606968>The effect of  on leptin, adiponectin, hepatic enzyme levels and lipid profiles in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is developed by lack of insulin secretion or reduction of tissues sensitivity to insulin, which lead to serious complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate antihyperlipidemic effect of  (BA) on streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic mice. In this experimental study, seventy adult male NMRI mice (20-25 g) were divided randomly into seven groups ( = 10) of control, sham, diabetes, diabetes + BA (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), and diabetes + metformin (200 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a single dose of STZ (50 mg/kg) 15 min after an i.p. administration of nicotinamide (NA) (120 mg/kg). BA and metformin were orally administered and after two weeks blood samples were taken. Blood levels of leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile and liver enzyme were then measured. One day after the last drug administration, liver was removed to evaluate the histological changes. A significant increase ( < 0.05) in the plasma levels of leptin, alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), cholesterol, and a significant decrease in adiponectin and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed in diabetic mice. The groups treated with BA indicated a significant decrease in leptin, AST, ALT, ALP, TG, cholesterol, LDL-C and an increases in adiponectin and HDL levels, while VLDL did not show significant changes. BA was found to have positive effects on liver injury. BA has an effective role on liver damage induced by diabetes through amelioration of leptin, adiponectin, liver enzyme levels and lipid profile. Since BA has a positive effect on lipid profile, adiponectin and leptin, it may improve metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012451>Oleanolic, Ursolic, and Betulinic Acids as Food Supplements or Pharmaceutical Agents for Type 2 Diabetes: Promise or Illusion?</a></h1><p>Oleanolic (OA), ursolic (UA), and betulinic (BA) acids are three triterpenic acids (TAs) with potential effects for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Mechanistic studies showed that these TAs act as hypoglycemic and antiobesity agents mainly through (i) reducing the absorption of glucose; (ii) decreasing endogenous glucose production; (iii) increasing insulin sensitivity; (iv) improving lipid homeostasis; and (v) promoting body weight regulation. Besides these promising beneficial effects, it is believed that OA, UA, and BA protect against diabetes-related comorbidities due to their antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. We also highlight the protective effect of OA, UA, and BA against oxidative damage, which may be very relevant for the treatment and/or prevention of T2DM. In the present review, we provide an integrative description of the antidiabetic properties of OA, UA, and BA, evaluating the potential use of these TAs as food supplements or pharmaceutical agents to prevent and/or treat T2DM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26435737>Phytochemical composition, antiparasitic and α-glucosidase inhibition activities from .</a></h1><p>Panama has an extensive mangrove area and it is one of the countries with the highest biodiversity in America. Mangroves are widely used in traditional medicine, nevertheless, there are very few studies that validates their medicinal properties in America. Given the urgent need for therapeutic options to treat several diseases of public health importance, mangrove ecosystem could be an interesting source of new bioactive molecules. This study was designed to evaluate the potential of  as a source of bioactive compounds.The present investigation was undertaken to explore the possible antiparasitic potential and α-glucosidase inhibition by compounds derived from the Panamanian mangrove . Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of ten chemical compounds: α-amyrine (), β-amyrine (), ursolic acid (), oleanolic acid (),  (), brugierol () iso-brugierol (), kaempferol (), quercetin (), and quercetrin (). The structures of these compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses including APCI-HR-MS and NMR. Compounds  (IC = 5.3 µM),  (IC = 22.9 µM) and  (IC = 3.4 µM) showed selective antiparasitic activity against , while compounds  (IC = 19.0 µM) and  (IC = 18.0 µM) exhibited selectivity against  and , respectively. Moreover, compounds - inhibited α-glucosidase enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner with IC values of 1.45, 0.02, 1.08, 0.98 and 2.37 µM, respectively. Their inhibitory activity was higher than that of antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC 217.7 µM), used as a positive control. Kinetic analysis established that the five compounds acted as competitive inhibitors. Docking analysis predicted that all triterpenes bind at the same site that acarbose in the human intestinal α-glucosidase (PDB: 3TOP).Three groups of compounds were isolated in this study (triterpenes, flavonols and dithiolanes). Triterpenes and flavones showed activity in at least one bioassay (antiparasitic or α-glucosidase). In addition, only the pentacyclic triterpenes exhibited a competitive type of inhibition against α-glucosidase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153652>A simple and visible colorimetric method through Zr(4+)-phosphate coordination for the assay of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and screening of its inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) are promising agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and , so a colorimetric method has been developed in this work for PTP1B assay and screening of its inhibitors. The method is based on the chelation effect of zirconium (Zr(4+)) ions on the phosphate group, which may induce aggregation of 4-aminophenylphosphate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (APP/AuNPs) and the corresponding color change of the testing solution. Owing to the dephosphorylation of PTP1B, the aggregation of AuNPs will be influenced by PTP1B since there is no coordination reactivity between Zr(4+) ions and 4-aminophenol, the hydrolyzed product of APP catalyzed by the enzyme. Therefore, a simple colorimetric method for the assay of PTP1B activity can be developed. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ratios of absorbance at a wavelength of 650 nm to that at 522 nm vary linearly with the PTP1B activity in the range from 0.005 to 0.18 U mL(-1) with the lowest detection limit of 0.0017 U mL(-1). Moreover, using this proposed method, the inhibition effect of 6-chloro-3-formyl-7-methylchromone, , ursolic acid, and sodium orthovanadate on PTP1B activity can be tested with IC50 values of 10, 13, 9, and 1.1 μM, respectively. Therefore, this new method has great potential not only for the detection of PTP1B activity but also for the screening of the inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799179> inhibits high-fat diet-induced  and improves energy balance by activating AMPK.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including , cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.  (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of .Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA.The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

(Sarraceniaceae).</a></h1><p>The Cree of Eeyou Istchee in Northern Quebec identified Sarracenia purpurea L. as an important plant for the treatment of Type 2 . Traditionally the plant is used as a decoction (boiling water extract) of the leaf, however, in order to study the extract in a laboratory setting, an 80% ethanol extract was used. In this study, the phytochemistry of both extracts of the leaves was compared and quantified.Two S. purpurea leaf extracts were prepared, one a traditional hot water extract and the other an 80% ethanol extract. Using UPLC-ESI-MS, the extracts were phytochemically compared for 2 triterpenes,  and ursolic acid, using one gradient method and for 10 additional substances, including the actives quercetin-3-O-galactoside and morroniside, using a different method.The concentrations of the nine phenolic substances present, as well as an active principle, the iridoid glycoside morroniside, were very similar between the two extracts, with generally slightly higher concentrations of phenolics in the ethanol extract as expected. However, two triterpenes,  and ursolic acid, were 107 and 93 times more concentrated, respectively, in the ethanol extract compared to the water extract.The main phytochemical markers and most importantly the antidiabetic active principles, quercetin-3-O-galactoside and morroniside, were present in similar amounts in the two extracts, which predicts similar bioactivity.This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.
