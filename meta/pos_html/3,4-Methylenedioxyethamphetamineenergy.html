<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10073892>3,4-Methylenedioxy analogues of amphetamine: defining the risks to humans.</a></h1><p>The 3,4-methylenedioxy analogues of amphetamine [MDMA ("Ecstasy", "Adam"), MDA ("Love") and MDE ("Eve")] are recreational drugs that produce feelings of euphoria and  and a desire to socialize, which go far to explain their current popularity as "rave drugs". In addition to these positive effects, the drugs are relatively inexpensive to purchase and have the reputation of being safe compared to other recreational drugs. Yet there is mounting evidence that these drugs do not deserve this reputation of being safe. This review examines the relevant human and animal literature to delineate the possible risks MDMA, MDA and MDE engender with oral consumption in humans. Following a summary of the behavioral and cognitive effects of MDMA, MDA and MDE, risks will be discussed in terms of toxicity, psychopathology, neurotoxicity, abuse potential and the potential for drug-drug interactions associated with acute and chronic use.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485894>Altered  production, lowered antioxidant potential, and inflammatory processes mediate CNS damage associated with abuse of the psychostimulants MDMA and methamphetamine.</a></h1><p>Central nervous system (CNS) damage associated with psychostimulant dependence may be an ongoing, degenerative process with adverse effects on neuropsychiatric function. However, the molecular mechanisms regarding how altered  regulation affects immune response in the context of substance use disorders are not fully understood. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the effects of psychostimulant [particularly 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine] exposure on brain  regulation, immune response, and neuropsychiatric function. Importantly, the neuropsychiatric impairments (e.g., cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety) that persist following abstinence are associated with poorer treatment outcomes - increased relapse rates, lower treatment retention rates, and reduced daily functioning. Qualifying the molecular changes within the CNS according to the exposure and use patterns of specifically abused substances should inform the development of new therapeutic approaches for addiction treatment.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p></html>
