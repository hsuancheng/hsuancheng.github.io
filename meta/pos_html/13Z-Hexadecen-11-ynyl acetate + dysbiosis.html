Endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus is related to both increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-driven superoxide production and Rho-kinase-mediated eNOS inhibition. LC40 treatment prevents all the aortic changes induced by tacrolimus. LC40 restores the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells induced by tacrolimus in mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Tacrolimus-induced gut , that is, it decreases microbial diversity, increases the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and decreases - and butyrate-producing bacteria, and these effects are prevented by LC40. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from LC40-treated mice to control mice prevents the increase in SBP and the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine induced by tacrolimus.LC40 treatment prevents hypertension and endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus by inhibiting gut . These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular oxidative stress, mainly through NOX2 downregulation and prevention of eNOS uncoupling, and inflammation possibly because of decreased Th17 and increased Treg cells polarization in mesenteric lymph nodes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Fecal samples were collected at the start, middle, and end of this period and were analyzed for major bacterial groups by using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridization and for SCFAs by using gas-liquid chromatography.Although no significant changes in fecal microbiota or SCFAs were observed during enteral feeding, stark alterations occurred within individual patients. Ten patients (50%) developed diarrhea, and these patients had significantly higher concentrations of clostridia (P = 0.026) and lower concentrations (P = 0.069) and proportions (P = 0.029) of bifidobacteria. Patients with and without diarrhea had differences in the proportion of bifidobacteria (median: 0.4% and 3.7%; interquartile range: 0.8 compared with 4.3; P = 0.035) and clostridia (median: 10.4% and 3.7%; interquartile range: 14.7 compared with 7.0; P = 0.063), respectively, even at the start of enteral feeding.

Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether  induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of microbiota recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of probiotics. Central and peripheral immunity, plasma  and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut microbiota recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d B cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production .

Decreased cardiac function can reduce intestinal perfusion, resulting in morphological alterations, which may contribute to changes in the gut microbiota composition in patients with heart failure (HF). In this regard, a germane question is whether changes in gut microbiota composition are a cause or consequence of the cardiovascular disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that the development of HF, after myocardial infarction, would cause gut . Fecal samples were collected before and 6 wk after myocardial infarction or sham surgery. Gut microbiota were characterized by sequencing the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA. The composition of bacterial communities in the fecal samples was evaluated by calculating three major ecological parameters: ) the Chao 1 richness, ) the Pielou evenness, and ) the Shannon index. None of these indices was changed in either sham or HF rats. The  ratio was not altered in HF rats. The number of species in each phylum was also not different between sham and HF rats. β-Diversity analysis showed that the composition of gut microbiota was not changed with the development of HF. Bacterial genera were grouped according to their major metabolic end-products (, butyrate, and lactate), but no differences were observed in HF rats. Therefore, we conclude that HF induced by myocardial infarction does not affect gut microbiota composition, at least in rats, indicating that the  observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular disturbance. Our study demonstrated that, following myocardial infarction in rats, heart failure (HF) development did not affect the intestinal microbiota despite distinct differences reported in the gut microbiota of humans with HF. Our finding is consistent with the notion that  observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular dysfunction and therefore offers potential for early diagnosis and treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27527211>Urinary Metabolomic Approach Provides New Insights into Distinct Metabolic Profiles of Glutamine and N-Carbamylglutamate Supplementation in Rats.</a></h2><p>Glutamine and N-carbamylglutamate can enhance growth performance and health in animals, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of glutamine and N-carbamylglutamate supplementation in rat metabolism. Thirty rats were fed a control, glutamine, or N-carbamylglutamate diet for four weeks. Urine samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, specifically high-resolution ¹H NMR metabolic profiling combined with multivariate data analysis. Glutamine significantly increased the urine levels of acetamide, , citrulline, creatinine, and methymalonate, and decreased the urine levels of ethanol and formate (p < 0.05). Moreover, N-carbamylglutamate significantly increased the urine levels of creatinine, ethanol, indoxyl sulfate, lactate, methymalonate, acetoacetate, m-hydroxyphenylacetate, and sarcosine, and decreased the urine levels of acetamide, , citrulline, creatine, glycine, hippurate, homogentisate, N-acetylglutamate, phenylacetyglycine, acetone, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05). Results suggested that glutamine and N-carbamylglutamate could modify urinary metabolome related to nitrogen metabolism and gut microbiota metabolism. Moreover, N-carbamylglutamate could alter energy and lipid metabolism.

This internal ecosystem, far from being a static environment, can be manipulated by diet and dietary components. Feeding animals with high-fat sucrose (HFS) diets entails diet-induced obesity, a model which is usually used in research to mimic the obese phenotype of Western societies. The aim of the present study was to identify gut microbiota  and associated metabolic changes produced in male Wistar rats fed a HFS diet for 6 weeks and compare it with the basal microbial composition. For this purpose, DNA extracted from faeces at baseline and after treatment was analysed by amplification of the V4-V6 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene using 454 pyrosequencing. Short-chain fatty acids, i.e. , propionate and butyrate, were also evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At the end of the treatment, gut microbiota composition significantly differed at phylum level (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) and class level (Erisypelotrichi, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Bacilli). Interestingly, the class Clostridia showed a significant decrease after HFS diet treatment, which correlated with visceral adipose tissue, and is likely mediated by dietary carbohydrates. Of particular interest, Clostridium cluster XIVa species were significantly reduced and changes were identified in the relative abundance of other specific bacterial species (Mitsuokella jalaludinii, Eubacterium ventriosum, Clostridium sp. FCB90-3, Prevotella nanceiensis, Clostridium fusiformis, Clostridium sp. BNL1100 and Eubacterium cylindroides) that, in some cases, showed opposite trends to their relative families. These results highlight the relevance of characterising gut microbial population differences at species level and contribute to understand the plausible link between diet and specific gut bacterial species that are able to influence the inflammatory status, intestinal barrier function and obesity development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802154>Interplay of host genetics and gut microbiota underlying the onset and clinical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics.

Therefore, we performed a case-control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD.Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort.

Bacterial DNA from fecal samples of 2 rat models of hypertension and a small cohort of patients was used for bacterial genomic analysis. We observed a significant decrease in microbial richness, diversity, and evenness in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, in addition to an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. These changes were accompanied by decreases in - and butyrate-producing bacteria. In addition, the microbiota of a small cohort of human hypertensive patients was found to follow a similar dysbiotic pattern, as it was less rich and diverse than that of control subjects. Similar changes in gut microbiota were observed in the chronic angiotensin II infusion rat model, most notably decreased microbial richness and an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. In this model, we evaluated the efficacy of oral minocycline in restoring gut microbiota. In addition to attenuating high blood pressure, minocycline was able to rebalance the dysbiotic hypertension gut microbiota by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.

In this hospitalized intervention trial with PWS (n = 17) and simple obesity (n = 21) children, a diet rich in non-digestible carbohydrates induced significant weight loss and concomitant structural changes of the gut microbiota together with reduction of serum antigen load and alleviation of inflammation. Co-abundance network analysis of 161 prevalent bacterial draft genomes assembled directly from metagenomic datasets showed relative increase of functional genome groups for  production from carbohydrates fermentation. NMR-based metabolomic profiling of urine showed diet-induced overall changes of host metabotypes and identified significantly reduced trimethylamine N-oxide and indoxyl sulfate, host-bacteria co-metabolites known to induce metabolic deteriorations. Specific bacterial genomes that were correlated with urine levels of these detrimental co-metabolites were found to encode enzyme genes for production of their precursors by fermentation of choline or tryptophan in the gut. When transplanted into germ-free mice, the pre-intervention gut microbiota induced higher inflammation and larger adipocytes compared with the post-intervention microbiota from the same volunteer. Our multi-omics-based systems analysis indicates a significant etiological contribution of dysbiotic gut microbiota to both genetic and simple obesity in children, implicating a potentially effective target for alleviation.Poorly managed diet and genetic mutations are the two primary driving forces behind the devastating epidemic of obesity-related diseases. Lack of understanding of the molecular chain of causation between the driving forces and the disease endpoints retards progress in prevention and treatment of the diseases. We found that children genetically obese with Prader-Willi syndrome shared a similar  in their gut microbiota with those having diet-related obesity. A diet rich in non-digestible but fermentable carbohydrates significantly promoted beneficial groups of bacteria and reduced toxin-producers, which contributes to the alleviation of metabolic deteriorations in obesity regardless of the primary driving forces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29686297>Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates suppress Clostridium difficile infection in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile is an opportunistic diarrhoeal pathogen, and C. difficile infection (CDI) represents a major health care concern, causing an estimated 15,000 deaths per year in the United States alone  . Several enteric pathogens, including C. difficile, leverage inflammation and the accompanying microbial  to thrive in the distal gut  . Although diet is among the most powerful available tools for affecting the health of humans and their relationship with their microbiota, investigation into the effects of diet on CDI has been limited. Here, we show in mice that the consumption of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary plant polysaccharides has a significant effect on CDI. Specifically, using a model of antibiotic-induced CDI that typically resolves within 12 days of infection, we demonstrate that MAC-deficient diets perpetuate CDI. We show that C. difficile burdens are suppressed through the addition of either a diet containing a complex mixture of MACs or a simplified diet containing inulin as the sole MAC source. We show that switches between these dietary conditions are coincident with changes to microbiota membership, its metabolic output and C. difficile-mediated inflammation. Together, our data demonstrate the outgrowth of MAC-utilizing taxa and the associated end products of MAC metabolism, namely, the short-chain fatty acids , propionate and butyrate, are associated with decreased C. difficile fitness despite increased C. difficile toxin expression in the gut. Our findings, when placed into the context of the known fibre deficiencies of a human Western diet, provide rationale for pursuing MAC-centric dietary strategies as an alternate line of investigation for mitigating CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900399>The effect of synbiotics  and milk oligosaccharides on shaping gut microbiota community structure and NASH treatment.</a></h2><p>Probiotic  subspecies  () consumes human milk oligosaccharides (MO) and protects intestinal permeability thereby having anti-inflammatory effects (Underwood et al., 2015; Bode, 2006; Asakuma et al., 2011) [1-3].

However, the close interplay between these three systems presents us with difficulties in deciphering the cause-effect relationship in disease. The present study utilized beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptor knock out (AdrB1AdrB2/J KO) mice to isolate the effects of reduced overall sympathetic drive on gut microbiota and systemic immune system. We observed the following: (i) Diminished beta adrenergic signaling mainly reflects in shifts in the Firmicutes phyla, with a significant increase in abundance of largely beneficial Bacilli Lactobacillales in the KO mice; (ii) This was associated with increased colonic production of beneficial short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate,  and propionate, confirming functional microbiota shifts in the KO mice; (iii) Dampened systemic immune responses in the KO mice reflected in reduction on circulating CD4.IL17 T cells and increase in young neutrophils, both previously associated with shifts in the gut microbiota. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that reduced expression of beta adrenergic receptors may lead to beneficial shifts in the gut microbiota and dampened systemic immune responses.

However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which CHD results in intestinal damage remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the impact of chronic drinking on transcriptional and functional responses of lamina propria leukocytes (LPLs) isolated from the 4 major gut sections. Although no significant differences were detected between LPLs isolated from the ethanol and control groups at resting state within each major gut section, our analysis uncovered key regional differences in composition and function of LPLs independent of alcohol consumption. However, in response to phorbol myristate  and ionomycin, duodenal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals generated a dampened response, whereas jejunal and ileal LPLs from ethanol-drinking animals produced a heightened response. Transcriptional responses following stimulation were pronounced in ileal and duodenal LPLs from the ethanol-drinking group but less evident in jejunal and colonic LPLs compared with controls, suggesting a more significant impact of alcohol on these gut regions.

In these cases, parasitic infections require sensitive stool testing to be identified and treated effectively. The standard practice for stool analysis typically requires 3 separate stool specimens to be collected on 3 separate days to overcome the possibility of misdiagnosis due to intermittent shedding. Nonetheless, this practice is not often utilized due to very short periods of sample viability, which often leads to patient misdiagnosis. In this study, a patient with a history that eluded to possible acute GI parasitic infection, but without classic symptomology, was screened using a sodium  acetic acid formalin (SAF)-fixative triple-faeces test. Even though the patient's symptoms did not strongly suggest stool analysis, her history of travel was clinically relevant. The faeces test revealed the patient was positive for Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis trophs, Endolimax nana trophs, Entamoeba coli trophs, a-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeast.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct metabolic pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential metabolic pathways. These metabolites and metabolic pathways were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, , taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various metabolic disorders (amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism). YGP, however, had the ability to mediate four kinds of microbes (i.e. Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and uncultured_bacterium_f_Bacteroidales_S24-7_group) and ten related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, valine, isoleucine, alanine, citrulline, , DMA, TMA, phenylalanine and tryptophan) mediated amino acid metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile acid metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty acid metabolism, endocrine, immune and digestive system, and lipid metabolism, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on KYDS rats.Overall, our findings have preliminary confirmed that KYDS is closely related to metabolic and microbial , whereas YGP can improve the metabolic disorder of KYDS by acting on intestinal microbiota. Meanwhile, this will lay the foundation for the further KYDS's metagenomic research and the use of intestinal microbiotas as drug targets to treat KYDS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Silybin (Sil), a naturally occurring hepatoprotective agent, was widely used for treating NAFLD. Whether Sil effects gut microbiota during its actions in treating NAFLD, which is unknown. We aimed to examine the effect of Sil on intestinal flora  induced by high-fat diet (HFD).After 10 weeks of feeding normal chow diet (NCD) or HFD, mice were given daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were harvested for study of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and gut microbiota alteration.Sil showed protective effects against dietary-induced obesity and liver steatosis, accordingly gut microbiota composition changed. At phylum level, compared with HFD group, mice in the Sil-treated group had significant lower level of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P<0.05). At genus level, Sil-treated group have significant lower level of Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Mollicutes_RF9, which were reported to be potentially related to diet-induced obesity, and increased levels of Blautia (P<0.05), Akkermansia (P<0.05), Bacteroides(P<0.05) which were known to have beneficial effect on improving NAFLD. Sil also showed inhibitory effect on well-known beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus. Moreover, production of , propionate and butyrate increased, while generation of formate and conversion of cytotoxic secondary metabolites (LCA, DCA) decreased in mice treated with Sil.Sil might have beneficial effects on ameliorating NAFLD and mediate HFD-induced change of gut microbiota composition, followed with major changes in secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs and BAs.This article is protected by copyright.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, -produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic  (a particular form of ) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic  is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic . Since in the metabolic  metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic  are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic  can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic  due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS.

Hence, microbiome modulators such as probiotics may be helpful in maintaining or even restoring normal gut microbiome composition to benefit host health. Herein, we developed a human-origin probiotic cocktail with the ability to modulate gut microbiota to increase native SCFA production. Following a robust protocol of isolation, characterization and safety validation of infant gut-origin Lactobacillus and Enterococcus strains with probiotic attributes (tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, absence of potential virulence genes, cell-surface hydrophobicity, and susceptibility to common antibiotics), we select 10 strains (5 from each genera) out of total 321 isolates. A single dose (oral gavage) as well as 5 consecutive doses of this 10-strain probiotic cocktail in mice modulates gut microbiome and increases SCFA production (particularly propionate and butyrate). Inoculation of these probiotics in human feces also increases SCFA production along with microbiome modulation.

Based on recent insights in community ecology of the vaginal microbiome, we hypothesize that sustained vaginal DL-lactic acid enrichment will enhance the recruitment of lactobacilli, while counteracting bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. We therefore aimed to develop an intravaginal device that would be easy to insert and remove, while providing sustained DL-lactic acid release into the vaginal lumen. The final prototype selected is a vaginal ring matrix system consisting of a mixture of ethylene vinyl  and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer loaded with 150 mg DL-lactic acid with an L/D-lactic acid ratio of 1:1. Preclinical safety assessment was performed by use of the Slug Mucosal Irritation test, a non-vertebrate assay to evaluate vaginal mucosal irritation, which revealed no irritation. Clinical safety was evaluated in a phase I trial with six healthy nulliparous premenopausal volunteering women, with the investigational drug left in place for 7 days. Colposcopic monitoring according to the WHO/CONRAD guidelines for the evaluation of vaginal products, revealed no visible cervicovaginal mucosal changes. No adverse events related to the investigational product occurred. Total release from the intravaginal ring over 7 days was estimated through high performance liquid chromatography at 37.1 (standard deviation 0.9) mg DL-lactic acid. Semisolid lactic acid formulations have been studied to a limited extent in the past and typically consist of a large volume of excipients and very high doses of lactic acid, which is of major concern to mucosal safety. We have documented the feasability of enriching the vaginal environment with pure DL-lactic acid with a prototype intravaginal ring. Though the efficacy of this platform remains to be established possibly requiring further development, this approach may offer a novel avenue to modulate and protect the vaginal microbiota.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30211234>Tributyrin Supplementation Protects Immune Responses and Vasculature and Reduces Oxidative Stress in the Proximal Colon of Mice Exposed to Chronic-Binge Ethanol Feeding.</a></h2><p>Excessive ethanol consumption causes adverse effects and contributes to organ dysfunction. Ethanol metabolism triggers oxidative stress, altered immune function, and gut . The gut microbiome is known to contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and disturbances are associated with pathology. A consequence of gut  is also alterations in its metabolic and fermentation byproducts. The gut microbiota ferments undigested dietary polysaccharides to yield short-chain fatty acids, predominantly , propionate, and butyrate. Butyrate has many biological mechanisms of action including anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective effects, and its depletion is associated with intestinal injury. We previously showed that butyrate protects gut-liver injury during ethanol exposure. While the intestine is the largest immune organ in the body, little is known regarding the effects of ethanol on intestinal immune function. This work is aimed at investigating the effects of butyrate supplementation, in the form of the structured triglyceride tributyrin, on intestinal innate immune responses and oxidative stress following chronic-binge ethanol exposure in mice. Our work suggests that tributyrin supplementation preserved immune responses and reduced oxidative stress in the proximal colon during chronic-binge ethanol exposure.

We aimed to investigate the location and magnitude of altered intestinal bacterial fermentation in IBS and its clinical subtypes.IBS patients who satisfied the Rome III criteria (114) and 33 healthy controls (HC) were investigated. Intestinal fermentation was assessed using two surrogate measures: intestinal intraluminal pH and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Intraluminal pH and intestinal transit times were measured in the small and large bowel using a wireless motility capsule (SmartPill) in 47 IBS and 10 HC. Fecal SCFAs including , propionate, butyrate, and lactate were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography in all enrolled subjects. Correlations between intestinal pH, fecal SCFAs, intestinal transit time, and IBS symptom scores were analyzed.Colonic intraluminal pH levels were significantly lower in IBS patients compared with HC (total colonic pH, 6.8 for IBS vs. 7.3 for HC, P=0.042). There were no differences in total and segmental pH levels in the small bowel between IBS patients and HC (6.8 vs. 6.8, P=not significant). The intraluminal colonic pH differences were consistent in all IBS subtypes. Total SCFA level was significantly lower in C-IBS patients than in D-IBS and M-IBS patients and HC. The total SCFA level in all IBS subjects was similar with that of HC. Colonic pH levels correlated positively with colon transit time (CTT) and IBS symptoms severity. Total fecal SCFAs levels correlated negatively with CTT and positively with stool frequency.Colonic intraluminal pH is decreased, suggesting higher colonic fermentation, in IBS patients compared with HC.

Studies are conflicting as to whether SCFAs are beneficial or detrimental to cardiometabolic health, and how gut  associated with SCFAs is unclear. In this study of 441 community-dwelling adults, we examined associations of fecal SCFAs, gut  diversity and composition, gut permeability, and cardiometabolic outcomes, including obesity and hypertension. We assessed fecal  by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and SCFA concentrations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fecal SCFA concentrations were inversely associated with  diversity, and 70 unique microbial taxa were differentially associated with at least one SCFA (, butyrate or propionate). Higher SCFA concentrations were associated with a measure of gut permeability, markers of metabolic dysregulation, obesity and hypertension. Microbial diversity showed association with these outcomes in the opposite direction. Associations were significant after adjusting for measured confounders. In conclusion, higher SCFA excretion was associated with evidence of gut dysbiosis, gut permeability, excess adiposity, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Studies assessing both fecal and circulating SCFAs are needed to test the hypothesis that the association of higher fecal SCFAs with obesity and cardiometabolic dysregulation is due to less efficient SCFA absorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut  as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases.

After the administration of a non-absorbable sugar, such as lactulose, an increase of breath hydrogen and methane is evident; this phenomenon is considered an index of colonic fermentation. It is not clear, however, if the levels of these compounds correlate with the presence and severity of functional symptoms, nor if they accurately reflect gas production at colonic level. So far, apart from flatulence, we have no indications regarding the ability of hydrogen or methane to act as biomarkers of intraluminal events. On the other hand, it has been shown that in functional bowel disease a colonic  exists, and that the modification of bacterial flora might result in a reduction of symptom severity.

We observed separation of global urinary and fecal metabolic profiles in critically ill compared with healthy children. Urinary excretion of mammalian-microbial co-metabolites hippurate, 4-cresol sulphate, and formate were reduced in critical illness compared with healthy children. Reduced fecal excretion of short-chain fatty acids (including butyrate, propionate, and ) were observed in the patient cohort, demonstrating that these metabolites also distinguished between critical illness and health. Dysregulation of intestinal bile metabolism was evidenced by increased primary and reduced secondary fecal bile acid excretion. Fecal butyrate correlated with days free of intensive care at 30 days (r = 0.38; p = 0.03), while urinary formate correlated inversely with vasopressor requirement (r = -0.2; p = 0.037).Disruption to the functional activity of the intestinal microbiome may result in worsening organ failure in the critically ill child.

We have shown that gut  plays a causal role in the development of hypertension in a rat model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional analysis of the dysbiotic microbiota in OSA demonstrates a loss of short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. However, measurements of short chain fatty acid concentrations and testing of their role in blood pressure regulation are lacking. We hypothesized that reduced short chain fatty acids in the gut are responsible for OSA-induced hypertension. OSA significantly increased systolic blood pressure at 7 and 14 days ( P<0.05), an effect that was abolished by the probiotic Clostridium butyricum or the prebiotic Hylon VII. The 16S rRNA analysis identified several short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that were significantly increased by Cbutyricum and Hylon treatment.  concentration in the cecum was decreased by 48% after OSA ( P<0.05), an effect that was prevented by Cbutyricum and Hylon.

Modulation of the intestinal microbial ecosystem (IME), in principle, can ameliorate lipid profiles. In this study, we characterized the IME of children and adolescents with primary hyperlipidemia by analyzing fecal samples through 16S rRNA gene profiling (n = 15) and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) quantification (n = 32). The same analyses were also carried out on age-matched normolipidemic controls (n = 15). Moreover, we evaluated the modulatory effect of regular hazelnut intake (approximately 0.43 g of hazelnuts with skin per kg of body weight) on the IME of 15 children and adolescents with hyperlipidemia for eight weeks. We found alterations of numerous operational taxonomic units potentially associated with SCFA-producing bacteria and reductions in the fecal levels of , butyrate and propionate in hyperlipidemic subjects. Furthermore, we observed that an eight-week hazelnut intervention may induce limited changes in fecal microbiota composition but can significantly modulate the fecal levels of predominant intestinal SCFAs, such as . Finally, correlation analyses indicated that changes in lipidemic parameters are linked to modifications of the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, such as the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and the genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium. This study suggests that children and adolescents with primary hyperlipidemia possess an altered IME.

Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a  of the vaginal microbiota can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the barrier functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance barrier function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced barrier function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced barrier function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of barrier function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of barrier function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines.

Animal and human studies have linked small molecule metabolites produced by commensal bacteria in the gut contribute to not only intestinal inflammation, but also to hepatic inflammation. These immunomodulatory metabolites are capable of engaging host cellular receptors, and may mediate the observed association between gut dysbiosis and NAFLD. This review focuses on the effects and potential mechanisms of three specific classes of metabolites that synthesized or modified by gut bacteria: short chain fatty acids, amino acid catabolites, and bile acids. In particular, we discuss their role as ligands for cell surface and nuclear receptors regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways in the intestine and liver. Studies reveal that the metabolites can both agonize and antagonize their cognate receptors to reduce or exacerbate liver steatosis and inflammation, and that the effects are metabolite- and context-specific. Further studies are warranted to more comprehensively understand bacterial metabolite-mediated gut-liver in NAFLD.

Metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the T-CD children. As shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest Shannon's diversity and substrate richness were found in HC. Pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for HC. Levels of Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, and Streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the T-CD children. Streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in T-CD children. The saliva of T-CD children showed the largest amount of Bacteroidetes (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of Actinobacteria. T-CD children were also characterized by decreased levels of some Actinomyces species, Atopobium species, and Corynebacterium durum. Rothia mucilaginosa was the only Actinobacteria species found at the highest level in T-CD children. As shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated T-CD children. Some compounds (e.g., ethyl-, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with T-CD children. Correlations (false discovery rate [FDR], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings of this study indicated that CD is associated with oral  that could affect the oral metabolome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131846>Depot medroxyprogesterone  and the vaginal microbiome as modifiers of tenofovir diphosphate and lamivudine triphosphate concentrations in the female genital tract of Ugandan women: Implications for TDF/3TC in pre-exposure prophylaxis.</a></h2><p>Effective concentrations of antiretrovirals in the female genital tract (FGT) are critical for suppression of viral shedding or effective pre-exposure prophylaxis. The disposition of tenofovir diphosphate (TFVdp) and emtricitabine triphosphate (FTCtp) in the FGT have been previously described. Despite widespread use, however, lamivudine triphosphate (3TCtp) exposure in FGT is unknown. Depot medroxyprogesterone  (DMPA) and vaginal  have been implicated in increased risk of HIV acquisition but whether they alter TFVdp or 3TCtp exposure, and therefore compromise prevention efficacy, is unknown.Fifty pre-menopausal women living with HIV in Kampala, Uganda and receiving daily tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine, were recruited. Ectocervical biopsies were obtained for quantification of TFVdp and 3TCtp using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from vaginal swabs. Wilcoxon rank sum was used to test for differences between contraceptive groups.3TCtp concentrations were on average 17-fold greater than TFVdp concentrations in cervical tissues. TFVdp concentrations in cervical biopsies were 76% greater in DMPA users compared to women using non-hormonal contraception (n=23/group). Abundance of Lactobacillus in vaginal swabs was correlated with 3TCtp concentrations in cervical tissues.We found that TFVdp concentrations were significantly greater in DMPA-users compared to women using non-hormonal contraception, suggesting prevention efficacy is unlikely to be compromised by DMPA use. Similar to reports of FTCtp, 3TCtp exposure was significantly greater than TFVdp in cervical tissue and was correlated with abundance of Lactobacillus. These data support lamivudine as an option for pre-exposure prophyalxis.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

This lethal hereditary disease has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut . High-throughput meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of symbiosis modifications.The aim of this study was to provide a predictive and functional model of the gut  enterophenotype of pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability.Thirty-one fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age range, 1-6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut . The multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification analysis.The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut  profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, , phenol, benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut  pattern revealed an enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to oral antibiotic administration or lung colonization/infection.All together, the results obtained suggest that the gut  enterophenotypes of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it's possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This new understanding of CF host-gut  interactions may be helpful to rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children's nutritional status and intestinal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796545>Methanogens as emerging pathogens in anaerobic abscesses.</a></h2><p>Methanogens are strictly anaerobic archaea metabolising by-products of bacterial fermentation into methane by using three known metabolic pathways, i.e. the reduction of carbon dioxide, the fermentation of  or the dismutation of methanol or methylamines. Methanogens described in human  include only Euryarchaeota, i.e. Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Ca. Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral , periodontitis and peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive tract  linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer). Their detection in anaerobic pus specimens and oral and digestive tract specimens relies on microscopic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, specific DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene fragments and isolation and culture in the supporting presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Diagnostic identification can be performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and can be further completed by genotyping through multi-spacer sequencing and, ultimately, whole genome sequencing (WGS). Ornidazole derivatives, fusidic acid and rifampicin are the compounds to be included in in vitro susceptibility testing to complete the clinical workflow. Clinical microbiology laboratories should work toward developing cheap and easy protocols for the routine detection and identification of methanogens in selected specimens in order to refine the diagnosis of infections, as well as to expand the knowledge about this group of intriguing microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27223303>Impact of a High-Fat or High-Fiber Diet on Intestinal Microbiota and Metabolic Markers in a Pig Model.</a></h2><p>To further elaborate interactions between nutrition, gut microbiota and host health, an animal model to simulate changes in microbial composition and activity due to dietary changes similar to those in humans is needed. Therefore, the impact of two different diets on cecal and colonic microbial gene copies and metabolic activity, organ development and biochemical parameters in blood serum was investigated using a pig model. Four pigs were either fed a low-fat/high-fiber (LF), or a high-fat/low-fiber (HF) diet for seven weeks, with both diets being isocaloric. A hypotrophic effect of the HF diet on digestive organs could be observed compared to the LF diet (p < 0.05). Higher gene copy numbers of Bacteroides (p < 0.05) and Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001) were present in intestinal contents of HF pigs, bifidobacteria were more abundant in LF pigs (p < 0.05). Concentrations of  and butyrate were higher in LF pigs (p < 0.05). Glucose was higher in HF pigs, while glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) showed higher concentrations upon feeding the LF diet (p < 0.001). However, C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased with time in LF pigs (p < 0.05). In part, these findings correspond to those in humans, and are in support of the concept of using the pig as human model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160670>[The intestinal microbiota composition in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving different disease-modifying therapies DMT].</a></h2><p>To describe characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with glatiramer  (GA) or fingolimode (FG) for understanding causal relationships between gut microbiota and autoimmune processes in MS patients.The study included 34 patients treated with GA (n=17) or FG (n=17). GA was used in a dose of 20 mg/kg subcutaneously once a day, FG in a dose of 0.5 mg daily. All patients were examined during remission. To assess the composition of gut microbiota, bacteriological and real-time PCR techniques were used. DNA was extracted from feces using DNA-EXPRESS kit.There was a decrease in numbers of Escherichia coli with normal enzymatic activity, which was replaced by atypical forms of E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and fungi of the genus Candida, and, during treatment with GA, by atypical forms of E. coli, Proteus spp., Parvimonas micra.

The administration of prebiotics could be a promising method of restoring gut homeostasis in CD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prolonged oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) administration on the characteristics and metabolism of intestinal microbiota in CD children following a gluten-free diet (GFD). Thirty-four paediatric CD patients (mean age 10 years; 62% females) on a GFD were randomized into two experimental groups receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin; 7 g/day) for 3 months. The quantitative gut microbiota characteristics and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration were analysed. In addition, side effects were monitored. Generally, the administration of Synergy 1 in a GFD did not cause any side effects. After the intervention period,  count increased significantly ( < 0.05) in the Synergy 1 group. Moreover, an increase in faecal  and butyrate levels was observed in the prebiotic group. Consequently, total SCFA levels were 31% higher than at the baseline. The presented trial shows that Synergy 1 applied as a supplement of a GFD had a moderate effect on the qualitative characteristics of faecal microbiota, whereas it stimulated the bacterial metabolite production in CD children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29423216>Dietary proline supplementation alters colonic luminal microbiota and bacterial metabolite composition between days 45 and 70 of pregnancy in Huanjiang mini-pigs.</a></h2><p>Pregnancy is associated with important changes in gut microbiota composition. Dietary factors may affect the diversity, composition, and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota. Among amino acids, proline is known to play important roles in protein metabolism and structure, cell differentiation, conceptus growth and development, and gut microbiota re-equilibration in case of .Dietary supplementation with 1% proline decreased ( < 0.05) the amounts of , , , and  spp. in distal colonic contents than that in the control group. The colonic contents of ,  sp., , ,  subgroup, , , , and  increased ( < 0.05) on d 70 of pregnancy as compared with those on d 45 of pregnancy. The colonic concentrations of , total straight-chain fatty acid, and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the proline-supplemented group were lower ( < 0.05), and butyrate level ( = 0.06) decreased as compared with the control group. Almost all of the SCFA displayed higher ( < 0.05) concentrations in proximal colonic contents on d 70 of pregnancy than those on d 45 of pregnancy. The concentrations of 1,7-heptyl diamine ( = 0.09) and phenylethylamine ( < 0.05) in proximal colonic contents were higher, while those of spermidine ( = 0.05) and total bioamine ( = 0.06) tended to be lower in the proline-supplemented group than those in the control group. The concentrations of spermidine, spermine, and total bioamine in colonic contents were higher ( < 0.05) on d 70 of pregnancy than those measured on d 45 of pregnancy. In contrast, the concentration of phenylethylamine was lower ( < 0.05) on d 70 than on d 45 of pregnancy.These findings indicate that -proline supplementation modifies both the colonic microbiota composition and the luminal concentrations of several bacterial metabolites. Furthermore, our data show that both the microbiota composition and the concentrations of bacterial metabolites are evolving in the course of pregnancy. These results are discussed in terms of possible implication in terms of luminal environment and consequences for gut physiology and health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460516>Second-generation antipsychotics and metabolism alterations: a systematic review of the role of the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Multiple drugs are known to induce metabolic malfunctions, among them second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The pathogenesis of such adverse effects is of multifactorial origin.We investigated whether SGAs drive , assessed whether gut microbiota alterations affect body weight and metabolic outcomes, and looked for the possible mechanism of metabolic disturbances secondary to SGA treatment in animal and human studies.A systematic literature search (PubMed/Medline/Embase/ClinicalTrials.gov/PsychInfo) was conducted from database inception until 03 July 2018 for studies that reported the microbiome and weight alterations in SGA-treated subjects.Seven articles reporting studies in mice (experiments = 8) and rats (experiments = 3) were included. Olanzapine was used in five and risperidone in six experiments. Only three articles (experiments = 4) in humans fit our criteria of using risperidone and mixed SGAs. The results confirmed microbiome alterations directly (rodent experiments = 5, human experiments = 4) or indirectly (rodent experiments = 4) with predominantly increased Firmicutes abundance relative to Bacteroidetes, as well as weight gain in rodents (experiments = 8) and humans (experiments = 4). Additionally, olanzapine administration was found to induce both metabolic alterations (adiposity, lipogenesis, plasma free fatty acid, and  levels increase) (experiments = 3) and inflammation (experiments = 2) in rodents, whereas risperidone suppressed the resting metabolic rate in rodents (experiments = 5) and elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, LDL, hs-CRP, antioxidant superoxide dismutase, and HOMA-IR in humans (experiment = 1). One rodent study suggested a gender-dependent effect of  on body weight.Antipsychotic treatment-related microbiome alterations potentially result in body weight gain and metabolic disturbances.

Within the human colon, such insoluble particles may be colonized by specific microbial teams which can stimulate cross-feeding, leading to a more efficient carbohydrate fermentation and an increased butyrate production. We investigated the extent to which WB fractions with different properties affect the fermentation of other carbohydrates in the colon. Ten healthy subjects performed four test days, during which they consumed a standard breakfast supplemented with 10 g C-inulin. A total of 20 g of a WB fraction (unmodified WB, wheat bran with a reduced particle size (WB RPS), or de-starched pericarp-enriched wheat bran (PE WB)) was also added to the breakfast, except for one test day, which served as a control. Blood samples were collected at regular time points for 14 h, in order to measure C-labeled short-chain fatty acid (SCFA; , propionate and butyrate) concentrations. Fermentation of C-inulin resulted in increased plasma SCFA for about 8 h, suggesting that a sustained increase in plasma SCFA can be achieved by administering a moderate dose of carbohydrates, three times per day. However, the addition of a single dose of a WB fraction did not further increase the C-SCFA concentrations in plasma, nor did it stimulate cross-feeding (Wilcoxon signed ranks test).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708835>Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 and their interaction.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health and disease by acting as a metabolic organ. Metagenomic sequencing has shown how  in the gut microbiota is associated with human metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Modeling may assist to gain insight into the metabolic implication of an altered microbiota. Fast and accurate reconstruction of metabolic models for members of the gut microbiota, as well as methods to simulate a community of microorganisms, are therefore needed. The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database contains functional annotation for nearly 4,650 bacterial genomes. This tremendous new genomic information adds new opportunities for systems biology to reconstruct accurate genome scale metabolic models (GEMs).Here we assembled a reaction data set containing 2,340 reactions obtained from existing genome-scale metabolic models, where each reaction is assigned with KEGG Orthology. The reaction data set was then used to reconstruct two genome scale metabolic models for gut microorganisms available in the IMG database Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32, which produces  during fermentation, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165, which consumes  and produces butyrate. F. prausnitzii is less abundant in patients with Crohn's disease and has been suggested to play an anti-inflammatory role in the gut ecosystem. The B. adolescentis model, iBif452, comprises 699 reactions and 611 unique metabolites. The F. prausnitzii model, iFap484, comprises 713 reactions and 621 unique metabolites. Each model was validated with in vivo data. We used OptCom and Flux Balance Analysis to simulate how both organisms interact.The consortium of iBif452 and iFap484 was applied to predict F. prausnitzii's demand for  and production of butyrate which plays an essential role in colonic homeostasis and cancer prevention.

Here, we found that high-fat diet promoted the lipid accumulation and intestinal microbiota  in mice, while oral melatonin supplementation alleviated the lipid accumulation and reversed gut microbiota , including the diversity of intestinal microbiota, relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes, and functional profiling of microbial communities, such as energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Interestingly, melatonin failed to alleviate the high-fat-induced lipid accumulation in antibiotic-treated mice; however, microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Notably, short-chain fatty acids were decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice, while melatonin treatment improved the production of acetic acid. Correlation analysis found a marked correlation between production of acetic acid and relative abundances of Bacteroides and Alistipes. Importantly, sodium  treatment also alleviated high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin improves lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice, and the potential mechanisms may be associated with reprogramming gut microbiota, especially, Bacteroides and Alistipes-mediated acetic acid production. Future studies are needed for patients with metabolic syndrome to fully understand melatonin's effects on body weight and lipid profiles and the potential mechanism of gut microbiota.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Dysbiosis of the gut  is increasingly considered to be causatively related to IBD and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD, as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active IBD. SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation. Here, we present an overview of microbial SCFAs production and their effects on the intestinal mucosa with specific emphasis on their relevance for IBD. Moreover, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SCFAs for IBD, either applied directly or by stimulating SCFAs-producing bacteria through pre- or probiotic approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359019>Eurotium cristatum, a potential probiotic fungus from Fuzhuan brick tea, alleviated obesity in mice by modulating gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide, mainly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles and diet. Gut microbiota  may lead to obese humans and animals. Modulating gut bacteria through probiotics or certain dietary supplements could normalize gut microbiota and subsequently alleviate obesity. The daily consumption of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) or its extracts has been observed to alleviate obesity in humans and experimental animals. In this study, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, such as body weight gain and fat accumulation, was prevented by the consumption of Eurotium cristatum, the dominant fungus during the manufacturing and storage of FBT. The  of gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice was also partially normalized. E. cristatum was able to modulate both gut fungal and bacterial compositions, based on the analysis of the microbiota composition of mice fecal samples (n = 5). E. cristatum increased  and butyrate-producing bacteria in mouse gut. There was five times more butyrate in the fecal samples from mice fed with E. cristatum than that from untreated HFD mice.

Recently, we identified a critical window early in the life of both mice and Canadian infants during which gut microbial changes () affect asthma development. Given geographic differences in human gut microbiota worldwide, we studied the effects of gut microbial  on atopic wheeze in a population living in a distinct developing world environment.We sought to determine whether microbial alterations in early infancy are associated with the development of atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting.We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort from rural Ecuador in which we identified 27 children with atopic wheeze and 70 healthy control subjects at 5 years of age. We analyzed bacterial and eukaryotic gut microbiota in stool samples collected at 3 months of age using 16S and 18S sequencing. Bacterial metagenomes were predicted from 16S rRNA data by using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States and categorized by function with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ontology. Concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids were determined by using gas chromatography.As previously observed in Canadian infants, microbial  at 3 months of age was associated with later development of atopic wheeze. However, the  in Ecuadorian babies involved different bacterial taxa, was more pronounced, and also involved several fungal taxa. Predicted metagenomic analysis emphasized significant -associated differences in genes involved in carbohydrate and taurine metabolism. Levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids  and caproate were reduced and increased, respectively, in the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In consequence, and fueled by major technological advances, the composition of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease has been intensively studied by high throughput sequencing approaches. Observations linking  of the intestinal microbiota with a number of serious medical conditions including chronic inflammatory disorders and allergic diseases suggest that restoration of the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota may be a treatment option at least for some of these diseases. One possibility to shape the intestinal microbiota is the administration of prebiotic carbohydrates such as resistant starch (RS). In the present study, we aim at establishing RNA-based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) to identify bacterial populations that are involved in the assimilation of RS using anaerobic  fermentation of murine fecal material with stable [UC] isotope-labeled potato starch. Total RNA from these incubations was extracted, processed by gradient ultracentrifugation and fractionated by density. 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from reverse transcribed RNA of high and low density fractions suspected to contain labeled and unlabeled RNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences revealed a distinct subset of the intestinal microbiota involved in starch metabolism. The results suggest , in particular genera affiliated with , as well as members of the  family to be primary assimilators of resistant starch due to a significantly higher relative abundance in higher density fractions in RNA samples isolated after 2 h of incubation. Using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HPLC-IRMS) analysis, some stable isotope label was recovered from , propionate and butyrate. Here, we demonstrate the suitability of RNA-SIP to link specific groups of microorganisms with fermentation of a specific substrate. The application of RNA-SIP in future  studies will help to better understand the mechanisms behind functionality of a prebiotic carbohydrate and its impact on an intestinal ecosystem with potential implications for human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596218>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut  as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut , OSA and gut , and whether gut  is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut ." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut . Gut , however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut  seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut  at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

Four mature horses were assigned to a crossover design and fed a basal diet (60:40 forage to concentrate; 1.45% BW on a DM basis), with or without supplementation, of 2 × 10(10) cfu/d of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077. After a 14-d adaptation to dietary treatments, the 5-d experiment started 1 d before transportation (d -1). At d 0, horses were simultaneously transported in a truck for 2 h. Feces were sampled 4 h after the morning meal of concentrate at d -1, 0 (immediately after transportation), and 3 for enumeration of the main functional bacterial groups and determination of fermentative variables. Within each dietary treatment, feces were pooled before DNA extraction and molecular analysis of the bacterial communities, using temporal temperature gradient electrophoreses (TTGE). Blood samples were collected at the same time for determination of white blood cells (WBC) counts and glucose and total protein concentrations. Regardless of dietary treatment, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio increased during transportation (P < 0.01), indicating that horses were stressed. In both treatments, TTGE profiles were clearly different before and 3 d after transportation, and the percentage of similarity between profiles at d -1 and 3 was greater in supplemented horses compared with the controls. From d 0 to 3, the molar percentage of propionate increased and total concentration of VFA and the  + butyrate to propionate ratio decreased, regardless of dietary treatment (P < 0.01, P = 0.02, and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas pH decreased only in control horses (P = 0.03). Regardless of day of sampling, fecal concentrations of lactate-utilizing bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria were greater in supplemented horses than in control horses (P = 0.04 and 0.08, respectively).

This alteration may potentially lead to adverse effects on the host metabolism, with the depletion of butyrate producer genus. However, an increased production of butyrate and propionate was verified in metformin-treated Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. The mechanisms underlying these nutritional alterations and their relation with gut microbiota  remain unclear. Here, we used Genome-scale Metabolic Models of the representative gut bacteria  spp., , and  to elucidate their bacterial metabolism and its effect on intestinal nutrient pool, including macronutrients (e.g., amino acids and short chain fatty acids), minerals and chemical elements (e.g., iron and oxygen). We applied flux balance analysis (FBA) coupled with synthetic lethality analysis interactions to identify combinations of reactions and extracellular nutrients whose absence prevents growth. Our analyses suggest that  sp. is the bacteria least vulnerable to nutrient availability. We have also examined bacterial contribution to extracellular nutrients including short chain fatty acids, amino acids, and gasses. For instance,  sp. and  may contribute to the production of important short chain fatty acids (e.g.,  and butyrate, respectively) involved in the host physiology under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We have also identified pathway susceptibility to nutrient availability and reaction changes among the four bacteria using both FBA and flux variability analysis. For instance, lipopolysaccharide synthesis, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and amino acid metabolism are pathways susceptible to changes in  sp. and .

Therefore, uncovering the sensing mechanism of bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) may help us to understand the host-microbiota interaction both in physiological and nonphysiological conditions.The colonic lumen is continually exposed to many kinds of chemicals, including beneficial and harmful compounds that are produced by gut microbiota in addition to ingested nutrients. In the mammalian colon SCFAs such as , propionate and butyrate are produced by bacterial fermentation and reach about 100 mM under physiological conditions. In this decade, SCFA receptor genes and their expression in the intestine have been identified as free fatty acid receptor (FFA)2 and FFA3. The FFAs are located in colonic enteroendocrine L cells producing and releasing an insulinotropic hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and an anorectic hormone, peptide YY. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that SCFAs stimulate gut hormone secretion. Therefore, the SCFA-FFA signal is likely to be important for gut physiological functions.Colonic epithelial cells express chemical receptors that detect the luminal contents, particularly bacterial metabolites, and may be involved in the host's energy metabolism via GLP-1 release, as well as the mucosal defense system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575294>Probiotic research in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions - Now is the time.</a></h2><p>Neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions (CGISC) receive parenteral nutrition, get exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics, undergo invasive procedures, and are nursed in intensive care units. They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut colonization with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut barrier function, facilitate colonization with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of , reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate immunity, and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs.© 2018 The Authors.

We recently showed that replacing corn with molassed sugar beet pulp (Bp) improved fiber degradation in high-producing dairy cattle, possibly because of an improvement of rumen and hindgut conditions for microbes by Bp feeding. However, little is known about the effects of high inclusion rates of Bp on hindgut microbes and fermentation. Thus fecal grab samples were taken from 18 high-yielding Simmental cows after 28 d of feeding 3 different levels of Bp (n = 6) for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the reticular pH was continuously monitored with indwelling sensors and eating and ruminating behavior was evaluated with noseband sensors. The Bp inclusion rates were 0 g/kg (i.e., no Bp inclusion as control, CON), 120 g/kg (12Bp), or 240 g/kg (24Bp) replacing corn grain and limestone on a dry matter basis. The amount of time spent eating and ruminating was unaffected by Bp level, and the daily fluctuation in the reticular pH was reduced by 25% with Bp inclusion from 0.8 in the CON diet to 0.6 in 24Bp fed animals. Also, the fecal pH tended to increase with dietary Bp inclusion. Fecal  production showed a quadratic tendency with the lowest concentration (58.9%) of the total short-chain fatty acid in the 12Bp treatment. Inclusion of Bp up to 24% of the diet decreased the fecal butyrate proportion by 27%. The Shannon diversity index was increased from 5.50 to 8.09 with dietary Bp inclusion indicating increased species diversity. Of the 200 most abundant operational taxonomic units, 25 were increased by dietary Bp inclusion, whereas 15 were decreased and 7 were quadratically affected. The second most abundant group was proposed taxon "CF231" of the family Paraprevotellaceae. Although it accounted for only 2.52% of the operational taxonomic units in the CON diet, it was increased by 64% with dietary Bp inclusion. The largest relative change in the abundance was found for the genus Fibrobacter that increased more than 14-fold from 0.04% (CON) to 0.66% (24Bp). In conclusion, feeding molassed sugar beet pulp as partial substitution of corn up to 240 g/kg is a viable alternative that promotes ruminal and hindgut fermentation by supporting physiological pH and bacterial diversity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In asymptomatic women of reproductive-age the vaginal microbiota is comprised of lactic acid-producing bacteria that are primarily responsible for the production of lactic acid present at ~110 mM and acidifying the vaginal milieu to pH ~3.5. In contrast, bacterial vaginosis (BV), a  of the vaginal microbiota, is characterized by decreased lactic acid-producing microbiota and increased diverse anaerobic bacteria accompanied by an elevated pH>4.5. BV is also characterized by a dramatic loss of lactic acid and greater concentrations of mixed SCFAs including , propionate, butyrate, and succinate. Notably women with lactic acid-producing microbiota have more favorable reproductive and sexual health outcomes compared to women with BV. Regarding the latter, BV is associated with increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. In vitro studies demonstrate that lactic acid produced by vaginal microbiota has microbicidal and virucidal activities that may protect against STIs and endogenous opportunistic bacteria as well as immune modulatory properties that require further characterization with regard to their effects on the vaginal mucosa. In contrast, BV-associated SCFAs have far less antimicrobial activity with the potential to contribute to a pro-inflammatory vaginal environment. Here we review the composition of lactic acid and SCFAs in respective states of eubiosis (non-BV) or  (BV), their effects on susceptibility to bacterial/viral STIs and whether they have inherent microbicidal/virucidal and immune modulatory properties. We also explore their potential as biomarkers for the presence and/or increased susceptibility to STIs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446880>Shifts in the Gut Microbiota Composition Due to Depleted Bone Marrow Beta Adrenergic Signaling Are Associated with Suppressed Inflammatory Transcriptional Networks in the Mouse Colon.</a></h2><p>The brain-gut axis plays a critical role in the regulation of different diseases, many of which are characterized by sympathetic dysregulation. However, a direct link between sympathetic dysregulation and gut  remains to be illustrated. Bone marrow (BM)-derived immune cells continuously interact with the gut microbiota to maintain homeostasis in the host. Their function is largely dependent upon the sympathetic nervous system acting via adrenergic receptors present on the BM immune cells. In this study, we utilized a novel chimera mouse that lacks the expression of BM beta1/2 adrenergic receptors (b1/2-ARs) to investigate the role of the sympathetic drive to the BM in gut and microbiota homeostasis. Fecal analyses demonstrated a shift from a dominance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phylum in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera, resulting in a reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in Proteobacteria phylum was determined. No changes in the abundance of -, butyrate-, and lactate-producing bacteria, and colon pathology were observed in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Transcriptomic profiling in colon identified Killer Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D, Member 1 (Klrd1), Membrane-Spanning 4-Domains Subfamily A Member 4A (Ms4a4b), and Casein Kinase 2 Alpha Prime Polypeptide (Csnk2a2) as main transcripts associated with the microbiota shifts in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera. Suppression of leukocyte-related transcriptome networks (i.e., function, differentiation, migration), classical compliment pathway, and networks associated with intestinal function, barrier integrity, and excretion was also observed in the colon of the KO chimera. Moreover, reduced expression of transcriptional networks related to intestinal diseases (i.e., ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory lesions, and stress) was noted. The observed suppressed transcriptome networks were associated with a reduction in NK cells, macrophages, and CD4 T cells in the b1/2-ARs KO chimera colon. Thus, sympathetic regulation of BM-derived immune cells plays a significant role in modifying inflammatory networks in the colon and the gut microbiota composition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a key role of BM b1/2-ARs signaling in host-microbiota interactions, and reveals specific molecular mechanisms that may lead to generation of novel anti-inflammatory treatments for many immune and autonomic diseases as well as gut  across the board.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30831575>Immunomodulatory potential of gut -derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).</a></h2><p>Intestinal  is an element of the bacterial ecosystem in all mammalian organisms. These microorganisms play a very important part in the development, functioning, and modulation of the immune system from the moment of birth. In recent years, owing to the use of modern sequencing techniques, the  composition in healthy people has been identified based on bacterial 16S rRNA analysis. Currently, more and more attention is being given to the influence of microorganisms on the host's cellular metabolism. Analysis of microbial metabolites, among them short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and disruption of intestinal  homeostasis in terms of their effects on molecular regulatory mechanisms of immune reactions will surely improve the understanding of the etiology of many common diseases. SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate, and , occur in specific amounts, and their proportions can change, depending on the diet, age and diseases. The levels of SCFAs are substantially influenced by the ratio of commensal intestinal bacteria, the disturbance of which (dysbiosis) can lead to a disproportion between the SCFAs produced. SCFAs are regarded as mediators in the communication between the intestinal  and the immune system. The signal they produce is transferred, among others, in immune cells via free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It has been also confirmed that SCFAs inhibit the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) - an enzyme involved in post-translational modifications, namely the process of deacetylation and, what is new, the process of histone crotonylation. These properties of SCFAs have an effect on their immunomodulatory potential i.e. maintaining the anti/pro-inflammatory balance. SCFAs act not only locally in the intestines colonized by commensal bacteria, but also influence the intestinal immune cells, and modulate immune response by multi-protein inflammasome complexes. SCFAs have been confirmed to contribute to the maintenance of the immune homeostasis of the urinary system (kidneys), respiratory system (lungs), central nervous system, and the sight organ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238752>Colonic Butyrate-Producing Communities in Humans: an Overview Using Omics Data.</a></h2><p>Given the key role of butyrate for host health, understanding the ecology of intestinal butyrate-producing communities is a top priority for gut microbiota research. To this end, we performed a pooled analysis on 2,387 metagenomic/transcriptomic samples from 15 publicly available data sets that originated from three continents and encompassed eight diseases as well as specific interventions. For analyses, a gene catalogue was constructed from gene-targeted assemblies of all genes from butyrate synthesis pathways of all samples and from an updated reference database derived from genome screenings. We demonstrate that butyrate producers establish themselves within the first year of life and display high abundances (>20% of total bacterial community) in adults regardless of origin. Various bacteria form this functional group, exhibiting a biochemical diversity including different pathways and terminal enzymes, where one carbohydrate-fueled pathway was dominant with butyryl coenzyme A (CoA): CoA transferase as the main terminal enzyme. Subjects displayed a high richness of butyrate producers, and 17 taxa, primarily members of the  and  along with some , were detected in >70% of individuals, encompassing ~85% of the total butyrate-producing potential. Most of these key taxa were also found to express genes for butyrate formation, indicating that butyrate producers occupy various niches in the gut ecosystem, concurrently synthesizing that compound. Furthermore, results from longitudinal analyses propose that diversity supports functional stability during ordinary life disturbances and during interventions such as antibiotic treatment. A reduction of the butyrate-producing potential along with community alterations was detected in various diseases, where patients suffering from cardiometabolic disorders were particularly affected.  Studies focusing on taxonomic compositions of the gut microbiota are plentiful, whereas its functional capabilities are still poorly understood. Specific key functions deserve detailed investigations, as they regulate microbiota-host interactions and promote host health and disease. The production of butyrate is among the top targets since depletion of this microbe-derived metabolite is linked to several emerging noncommunicable diseases and was shown to facilitate establishment of enteric pathogens by disrupting colonization resistance. In this study, we established a workflow to investigate in detail the composition of the polyphyletic butyrate-producing community from omics data extracting its biochemical and taxonomic diversity. By combining information from various publicly available data sets, we identified universal ecological key features of this functional group and shed light on its role in health and disease.

This raises the question whether the increased incidence of allergies, asthma, some autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and others might relate to intake of unhealthy foods, and the decreased intake of dietary fiber. In recent years, new knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underpinning a 'diet-gut microbiota-physiology axis' has emerged to substantiate this idea. Fiber is fermented to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly , butyrate, and propionate. These metabolites bind 'metabolite-sensing' G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A. These receptors play fundamental roles in the promotion of gut homeostasis and the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, these receptors and their metabolites influence Treg biology, epithelial integrity, gut homeostasis, DC biology, and IgA antibody responses. The SCFAs also influence gene transcription in many cells and tissues, through their inhibition of histone deacetylase expression or function. Contained in this mix is the gut microbiome, as commensal bacteria in the gut have the necessary enzymes to digest dietary fiber to SCFAs, and  in the gut may affect the production of SCFAs and their distribution to tissues throughout the body. SCFAs can epigenetically modify DNA, and so may be one mechanism to account for diseases with a 'developmental origin', whereby in utero or post-natal exposure to environmental factors (such as nutrition of the mother) may account for disease later in life. If the nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis does underpin at least some of the Western lifestyle influence on asthma and allergies, then there is tremendous scope to correct this with healthy foodstuffs, probiotics, and prebiotics.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Gut , an imbalance of gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, but its mechanisms are unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main fermentation products of gut microbiota and a link between the gut microbiota and the host's physiology. Here, we investigated a correlation among gut , SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice. We detected enriched levels of Gram-positive bacteria and corresponding decreases in Gram-negative bacteria in 24-wk-old metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice compared with age-matched controls. The abundance of Bacteroidetes species decreased, the abundance of Firmicutes species increased, and nine genera of bacteria were altered in 24-wk-old TSOD mice. The total plasma SCFA level was significantly lower in the TSOD mice than in controls. The major plasma SCFA--decreased in TSOD mice, whereas propionate and butyrate increased. TSOD mice had no minor SCFAs (valerate and hexanoate) but normal mice did. We thus concluded that gut  and consequent disruptions in plasma SCFA profiles occurred in metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice. We also propose that the TSOD mouse is a useful model to study gut , SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889825>Decreased Protein Kinase C-β Type II Associated with the Prominent Endotoxin Exhaustion in the Macrophage of FcGRIIb-/- Lupus Prone Mice is Revealed by Phosphoproteomic Analysis.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of FcGRIIb, the only inhibitory receptor of the FcGR family, is commonly found in the Asian population and is possibly responsible for the extreme endotoxin exhaustion in lupus. Here, the mechanisms of prominent endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- mice were explored on bone marrow-derived macrophages using phosphoproteomic analysis. As such, LPS tolerance decreased several phosphoproteins in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage, including protein kinase C-β type II (PRKCB), which was associated with phagocytosis function. Overexpression of PRKCB attenuated LPS tolerance in RAW264.7 cells, supporting the role of this gene in LPS tolerance. In parallel, LPS tolerance in macrophages and in mice was attenuated by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) administration. This treatment induced several protein kinase C families, including PRKCB. However, PMA attenuated the severity of mice with cecal ligation and puncture on LPS tolerance preconditioning in FcGRIIb-/- but not in wild-type cells. The significant reduction of PRKCB in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage over wild-type cell possibly induced the more severe LPS-exhaustion and increased the infection susceptibility in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PMA induced PRKCB, improved LPS-tolerance, and attenuated sepsis severity, predominantly in FcGRIIb-/- mice.

Gut bacteria are known to produce energy substrates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and . The aim of this study was to determine whether ABA alters the proteome of gut microbiota relevant to ATP and  production.The ABA was developed in male mice and compared with food-restricted and ad libitum-fed conditions. Proteomic analysis of feces was performed using the two-dimentional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The in vitro ATP-producing capacity of proteins extracted from feces was assayed.Increased levels of the phosphoglycerate kinase, an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme, was detected in feces of food-restricted mice and this enzyme was further increased in the ABA group. Starvation also upregulated several other proteins synthetized by order Clostridiales including Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. No significant differences in the in vitro ATP-producing capacity by bacterial proteins from ABA, food-restricted, and ad libitum-fed control mice were found. However, plasma levels of  strongly tended to be increased in the activity groups including ABA mice.The data revealed that starvation in food-restricted and ABA mice induced proteome modification in gut bacteria favoring ATP production mainly by the order Clostridiales. However, this did not result in increased total ATP-production capacity by gut microbiota. These changes can be interpreted as an adaptation of specific gut bacteria to the host malnutrition beneficial for host survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Changes in  ( = -0.18,  = .23) and number of copies of the BCoAT gene ( = -0.12;  = .42) did not correlate with f-calprotectin.  There was an inverse correlation between temporal changes in the relative abundance of , but not overall butyrate producing capacity, and changes in inflammatory activity in ileal Crohn's disease.

Specifically, microglia shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype predisposing them to hyperactivation upon stimulation by peripheral immune signals. It is proposed that certain nutrients can delay brain aging by preventing or reversing microglial hyperactivation. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced primarily by bacterial fermentation of fiber in the colon, has been extensively studied pharmacologically as a histone deacetylase inhibitor and serves as an attractive therapeutic candidate, as butyrate has also been shown to be anti-inflammatory and improve memory in animal models. In this study, we demonstrate that butyrate can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in microglia in aged mice. It is still not fully understood, however, if an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut as a consequence of a diet high in soluble fiber could affect microglial activation during aging. Adult and aged mice were fed either a 1% cellulose (low fiber) or 5% inulin (high fiber) diet for 4 weeks. Findings indicate that mice fed inulin had an altered gut microbiome and increased butyrate, , and total SCFA production. In addition, histological scoring of the distal colon demonstrated that aged animals on the low fiber diet had increased inflammatory infiltrate that was significantly reduced in animals consuming the high fiber diet. Furthermore, gene expression of inflammatory markers, epigenetic regulators, and the microglial sensory apparatus (i.e., the sensome) were altered by both diet and age, with aged animals exhibiting a more anti-inflammatory microglial profile on the high fiber diet. Taken together, high fiber supplementation in aging is a non-invasive strategy to increase butyrate levels, and these data suggest that an increase in butyrate through added soluble fiber such as inulin could counterbalance the age-related microbiota , potentially leading to neurological benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26424567>Early infancy microbial and metabolic alterations affect risk of childhood asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease and affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Recent evidence in mice has identified a "critical window" early in life where gut microbial changes () are most influential in experimental asthma. However, current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or are involved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, and show that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial  during the first 100 days of life. The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterial taxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal  and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these four bacterial taxa ameliorated airway inflammation in their adult progeny, demonstrating a causal role of these bacterial taxa in averting asthma development. These results enhance the potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of probiotics, to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in children.Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618992>Effect of Native and Acetylated Dietary Resistant Starches on Intestinal Fermentative Capacity of Normal and Stunted Children in Southern India.</a></h2><p>The health benefits of dietary amylase resistant starch (RS) arise from intestinal microbial fermentation and generation of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal  and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both  and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180847>Effect of fiber supplementation on the microbiota in critically ill patients.</a></h2><p>To determine tolerance to fiber supplementation of semi-elemental tube feeds in critically ill patients and measure its effect on colonic microbiota and fermentation.Thirteen intensive care unit patients receiving jejunal feeding with a semi-elemental diet for predominantly necrotizing pancreatitis were studied. The study was divided into 2 parts: first, short-term (3-9 d) clinical tolerance and colonic fermentation as assessed by fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations and breath hydrogen and methane was measured in response to progressive fiber supplementation increasing from 4 g tid up to normal requirement levels of 8 g tid; second, 4 patients with diarrhea were studied for 2-5 wk with maximal supplementation to additionally assess its influence on fecal microbiota quantitated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of microbial 16S rRNA genes and Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) microarray analysis. Nearly all patients were receiving antibiotics (10/13) and acid suppressants (11/13) at some stage during the studies.In group 1, tolerance to progressive fiber supplementation was good with breath hydrogen and methane evidence (P = 0.008 and P < 0.0001, respectively) of increased fermentation with no exacerbation of abdominal symptoms and resolution of diarrhea in 2 of 4 patients. In group 2 before supplementation, fecal microbiota mass and their metabolites, SCFA, were dramatically lower in patients compared to healthy volunteers. From qPCR and HITChip analyses we calculated that there was a 97% reduction in the predominant potential butyrate producers and starch degraders. Following 2-5 wk of fiber supplementation there was a significant increase in fecal SCFA ( 28.4 ± 4.1 μmol/g to 42.5 ± 3.1 μmol/g dry weight, P = 0.01; propionate 1.6 ± 0.5 vs 6.22 ± 1.1, P = 0.006 and butyrate 2.5 ± 0.6 vs 5.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.04) and microbial counts of specific butyrate producers, with resolution of diarrhea in 3 of 4 patients.Conventional management of critically ill patients, which includes the use of elemental diets and broad-spectrum antibiotics, was associated with gross suppression of the colonic microbiota and their production of essential colonic fuels, i.e., SCFA.

Diet can also change the profile of gut microbiota and, thereby, behavior. Effects of bacteria on the nervous system cannot be disassociated from effects on the immune system since the two are in constant bidirectional communication. While the composition of the gut microbiota varies greatly among individuals, alterations to the balance and content of common gut microbes may affect the production of molecules such as neurotransmitters, e.g., gamma amino butyric acid, and the products of fermentation, e.g., the short chain fatty acids butyrate, propionate, and . Short chain fatty acids, which are pleomorphic, especially butyrate, positively influence host metabolism by promoting glucose and energy homeostasis, regulating immune responses and epithelial cell growth, and promoting the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the future, the composition, diversity, and function of specific probiotics, coupled with similar, more detailed knowledge about gut microbiota, will potentially help in developing more effective diet- and drug-based therapies.© The Author(s) 2015.

Bacteriological study].</a></h2><p>Bacterial imbalance may be involved in the pathogenesis of diversion colitis, via diminished production of short chain fatty acids. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short chain fatty acids on microbial flora of patients with diversion colitis and to compare this flora to the microbial flora of controls.We prospectively evaluated the effectiveness of short chain fatty acids irrigation on bacterial flora of the excluded colon in 13 patients (8 males, 5 females; mean age: 43.7 years). The causes of diversion were inflammatory bowel disease (n = 4) colonic cancer (n = 2) sigmoid diverticulitis with perforation (n = 3) ischio-rectal abscess (n = 2) and miscellaneous (n = 2). Patients were given, twice a day for 14 days in a double blind manner, a 60 mL enema containing either short chain fatty acids (: 60 mmol/L; propionate: 30 mmol/L; and n-butyrate: 40 mmol/L) (group 1; n = 7) or isotonic NaCl (group 2; n = 6). Bacteriological studies were carried on before starting the trial (D1) and 14 days later (D14).Before and after treatment, there was no difference between group 1 and group 2 concerning bacterial counts and species. Bacterial flora of patients with diversion colitis was characterized by: a) an increase of the count of aerobic bacteria; b) an increase of aerobic and aeroanaerobic species; c) the presence of black pigmented Gram negative anaerobic rods such as Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica which were not found in rectal flora of the control group (16 volunteers, mean age: 27 years).These data suggest that: a) enema with short chain fatty acids does not induce significant changes in the composition of the microbial flora in patients with diversion colitis; b) bacterial  may be involved in pathogenesis of diversion colitis without involving the action of short chain fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315049>Antihypertensive Effects of Probiotics.</a></h2><p>The present review focuses in the hypertension-associated changes in the microbiota and the current insights regarding the impact of probiotics on blood pressure in animal models and in human hypertensive patients.Gut  in hypertension is characterized by (i) the gut microbioma that is less diverse and less rich with an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and (ii) a decrease in - and butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in lactate-producing bacterial populations.

Autologous transplantation of fecal  of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet. Fecal samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr  into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in feces identified a significant reduction in the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice.

Recent studies have focused on the link between these microbes and our health.Diet contributes to shaping the gut microbial structure and influences metabolic functions of the host. Alteration of the microbial structure and function () is associated with the pathogenesis of various disorders. Fermentation is the process by which anaerobic bacteria (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) break down indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; , propionate and butyrate), collaborating with species specialized in oligosaccharide fermentation (e.g. Bifidobacteria). Butyrate and propionate can regulate intestinal physiology and immune function, while  acts as a substrate for lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. The gut microbiota regulates immune homeostasis via the induction of regulatory T cells and Th17 cells. In addition, butyrate has strong anti-inflammatory effects possibly through the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. Metabolic products generated by the gut microbiota, such as SCFAs, GABA, tryptophan, serotonin and catecholamine, transmit a signal to resident cells in the gut.Advances made in the DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics have revolutionized our understanding of the microbes in the gut.© 2016 S.

More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to , propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal  or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial  has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189124>[EFFECT OF PROBIOTIC ENTEROCOCCI AND GLATIRAMER  ON THE SEVERITY OF EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN RATS ].</a></h2><p>Currently intestinal microbiota is considered as a potential target for influence in various pathologies which have inflammation, autoimmunity or neurodegeneration in the genesis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) combines all these processes in the pathogenesis. Furthermore, the balance of the components of intestinal microbiota is disrupted during MS and followed by disbiosis. Different probiotics - bacteria with proven beneficial properties are widely used to correct dysbisis.

However, when the probiotic enterococci administered together with GA the protective effect does not observed.

This study sought to determine whether provision of an initial course of  subsp.  () would lead to persistent colonization of the probiotic organism in breastfed infants. Mothers intending to breastfeed were recruited and provided with lactation support. One group of mothers fed  EVC001 to their infants from day 7 to day 28 of life ( = 34), and the second group did not administer any probiotic ( = 32). Fecal samples were collected during the first 60 postnatal days in both groups.

Fecal milk oligosaccharides were significantly lower in  EVC001-fed infants, demonstrating higher consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by  EVC001. Concentrations of  and lactate were significantly higher and fecal pH was significantly lower in infants fed EVC001, demonstrating alterations in intestinal fermentation. Infants colonized by  at high levels had 4-fold-lower fecal endotoxin levels, consistent with observed lower levels of Gram-negative  and .  The gut microbiome in early life plays an important role for long-term health and is shaped in large part by diet. Probiotics may contribute to improvements in health, but they have not been shown to alter the community composition of the gut microbiome. Here, we found that breastfed infants could be stably colonized at high levels by provision of  EVC001, with significant changes to the overall microbiome composition persisting more than a month later, whether the infants were born vaginally or by caesarean section. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the capacity of this subspecies to utilize human milk glycans as a nutrient and underscores the importance of pairing a probiotic organism with a specific substrate. Colonization by  EVC001 resulted in significant changes to fecal microbiome composition and was associated with improvements in fecal biochemistry.
