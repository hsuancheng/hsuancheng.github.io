This alteration of mitochondria, also known as swelling, is manifested in strong dilatation of their intercristae space. The mitochondrial response of salivary glands to juvenile hormone is restricted to collum cells that are known to be ultrastructurally and functionally different from transitional and corpus cells and may reflect their specialization in  metabolism and water/ion balance. Morphological change of mitochondria and about a fivefold increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity in response to juvenile hormone appear to be a consequence of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. We have noticed no significant difference of the responses in , the juvenile hormone resistant mutant, suggesting that this action of juvenile hormone may be mediated via a mechanism different from that using nuclear transcription factors. The "uncoupling" effect is caused also by juvenile hormone analogues which are considered inactive in producing morphogenetic effects in Drosophila. Mitochondrial response is independent of transcription and translation, as revealed by the use of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors. Given these data together, we reasoned that the protonophoric/uncoupling effect of juvenile hormone is a cell type specific nongenomic response to this lipophilic ligand and contrasts with widely accepted notions about nuclear action of juvenile hormone.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442387>Autonomous regulation of the insect gut by circadian genes acting downstream of juvenile hormone signaling.</a></h1><p>In temperate regions, the shortening day length informs many insect species to prepare for winter by inducing diapause. The adult diapause of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, involves a reproductive arrest accompanied by  storage, reduction of metabolic needs, and preparation to withstand low temperatures. By contrast, nondiapause animals direct nutrient  to muscle activity and reproduction. The photoperiod-dependent switch from diapause to reproduction is systemically transmitted throughout the organism by juvenile hormone (JH). Here, we show that, at the organ-autonomous level of the insect gut, the decision between reproduction and diapause relies on an interaction between JH signaling and circadian clock genes acting independently of the daily cycle. The JH receptor -tolerant and the circadian proteins Clock and Cycle are all required in the gut to activate the Par domain protein 1 gene during reproduction and to simultaneously suppress a mammalian-type cryptochrome 2 gene that promotes the diapause program. A nonperiodic, organ-autonomous feedback between Par domain protein 1 and Cryptochrome 2 then orchestrates expression of downstream genes that mark the diapause vs. reproductive states of the gut. These results show that hormonal signaling through -tolerant and circadian proteins controls gut-specific gene activity that is independent of circadian oscillations but differs between reproductive and diapausing animals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511104>Disruption of hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetics is not a primary mechanism for the toxicity of  - relevance for toxicological assessment.</a></h1><p> (isopropyl(2E,4E)-11-methoxy-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,4-dodecadienoate) is an insect growth regulator generally used to control insect populations by preventing insect maturation. So far, the effects of the insecticide on mitochondrial bioenergetics were not investigated. In the present work, liver mitochondria from Wistar rats were isolated and features of mitochondrial physiology were characterized in the presence of . High concentrations of , in the range of 40-100 nmol/mg of protein could decrease the transmembrane electric potential (Delta Psi) developed by mitochondria and, at the highest concentration,  prevented complete Delta Psi repolarization after ADP addition. The effect was more evident using succinate than with ascorbate+TMPD as substrate. State 3 respiration was approximately 60% inhibited by 80 nmol of /mg of protein, while state 4 respiration, within the same range of  concentrations, showed a slight increase, when both glutamate-malate and succinate were used as substrates. Additionally, FCCP-stimulated respiration was inhibited to an extent comparable to the effect on state 3, which suggests an interaction of  with the respiratory chain, more evident with glutamate/malate as substrate. The activity of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidorreductase) and that of the segment comprehending complexes II and III (succinate-cytochrome c reductase) were decreased in the presence of  (approximately 60% and 85% of inhibition, respectively, with 300 nmol of /mg of protein), while the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase do not seem to be affected. Furthermore, the action of  on the mitochondrial permeability transition was also studied, showing that the insecticide (in the range of 30-80 nmol mg(-1) of protein) decreases the susceptibility of liver mitochondria to the opening of the transition pore, even in non-energized mitochondria. These results lead to the conclusion that  interference with hepatic mitochondrial function occurs only for high concentrations, which implies that the noxious effects of the insecticide reported for a number of non-target organisms are not fully attributable to mitochondrial effects. Therefore, it seems that mitochondrial activity does not represent the primary target for  toxic action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17901960>Differential allocation of protein resources to flight muscles and reproductive organs in the flightless wing-polymorphic bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) (Heteroptera).</a></h1><p>Differences in the growth of dorsolongitudinal flight muscles and gonads in 1-28 days old long-winged (macropterous) and short-winged (brachypterous) adults of the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus L.) and the resource allocation to these organs were studied by means of total protein analysis. We found predominant allocation of food resources to flight muscles compared to reproductive organs in both macropterous males and females during the first 5 days of adult life. Subsequent histolysis of developed flight muscles coincided with increased total protein content in some reproductive organs. Initiation of intensive food intake after starvation or application of higher dose of  on macropterous adults changed the resource allocation in favour of growth of reproductive organs and induced precocious histolysis of flight muscles. It indicates an involvement of juvenile hormone in wing morph-related differential allocation of resources in the bug. Increased total protein contents in the ovaries and accessory glands of starved macropterous females and males treated with , respectively, indicate that proteins derived from the -induced histolysis of the flight muscles are re-utilized for the growth of the reproductive organs. It is the first report of persistence of differential resource allocation to flight muscles and reproductive organs in the wing-polymorphic insects with non-functional macropterism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26927076>Nutritional Signaling Regulates Vitellogenin Synthesis and Egg Development through Juvenile Hormone in Nilaparvata lugens (Stål).</a></h1><p>Insect female reproduction which comprises the synthesis of vitellogenein (Vg) in the fat body and its incorporation into developing oocytes, needs a large amount of  and food resources. Our previous studies found that juvenile hormone (JH) regulates vitellogenesis in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Here, we report on the role of JH in nutrient-regulated Vg synthesis and egg development. We first cloned the genes coding for juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT) which is involved in JH biosynthesis and -tolerant (Met) for JH action. Amino acids (AAs) induced the expression of jmtN, while showing no effects on the expression of met using an artificial diet culture system. Reduction in JH biosynthesis or its action by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of jmtN or met led to a severe inhibition of AAs-induced Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation, together with lower fecundity. Furthermore, exogenous application of JH III partially restored Vg expression levels in jmtN RNAi females. However, JH III application did not rescue Vg synthesis in these met RNAi insects. Our results show that AAs induce Vg synthesis in the fat body and egg development in concert with JH biosynthesis in Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), rather than through JH action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28544235>Absence of juvenile hormone signalling regulates the dynamic expression profiles of nutritional metabolism genes during diapause preparation in the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi.</a></h1><p>Temperate insects have evolved diapause, a period of programmed developmental arrest during specific life stages, to survive unfavourable conditions. During the diapause preparation phase (DPP), diapause-destined individuals generally store large amounts of fat by regulating nutrition distribution for the  requirement during diapause maintenance and postdiapause development. Although nutritional patterns during the DPP have been investigated at physiological and biochemical levels in many insects, it remains largely unknown how nutritional metabolism is regulated during the DPP at molecular levels. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles of adult female cabbage beetles Colaphellus bowringi during the preoviposition phase (POP) and the DPP. Most differentially expressed genes were involved in specific metabolic pathways during the DPP. Genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were clearly highly expressed during the DPP, whereas genes related to protein metabolic pathways were highly expressed during the POP. Hormone challenge and RNA interference experiments revealed that juvenile hormone via its nuclear receptor -tolerant mediated the expression of genes associated with nutritional metabolism during the DPP. This work not only sheds light on the mechanisms of diapause preparation, but also provides new insights into the molecular basis of environmental plasticity in insects.© 2017 The Royal Entomological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425657>Deficiency of Brummer Impaires Lipid Mobilization and JH-Mediated Vitellogenesis in the Brown Planthopper, .</a></h1><p>Provisioning of sufficient lipids and vitellogenin to the oocytes is an indispensable process for fecundity of oviparous insects. Acute mobilization of lipid reserves in insects is controlled by the Brummer (Bmm), an orthologous of human adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). To investigate the functional roles of brummer-mediated lipolysis in the fecundity of the brown planthopper, , RNA interference (RNAi) analyses were performed with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against  in adult females. Knockdown of  expression resulted in obesity and blocked lipid mobilization in the fat body. In addition,  silencing led to retarded ovarian development with immature eggs and less ovarioles, decreased number of laid eggs, prolonged preoviposition period and egg duration. Furthermore, severe reductions of vitellogenin and its receptor abundance were observed upon  knockdown. The transcript levels of  (juvenile hormone esterase) which degrades JH were up-regulated, whereas the expression levels of JH receptors  (-tolerant) and  (Taiman) and their downstream transcription factors  (Krüppel-homolog 1) and  (Broad-Complex) were down-regulated after suppression of . JH-deficient females exhibited impaired vitellogenin expression, whereas JH exposure stimulated vitellogenin biosynthesis. Moreover, JH topical application partially rescued the decrease in vitellogenin expression in the -deficient females. These results demonstrate that brummer-mediated lipolytic system is essential for lipid mobilization and  homeostasis during reproduction in . In addition to the classical view of brummer as a direct lipase with lipolysis activity, we propose here that brummer-mediated lipolysis works through JH signaling pathway to activate vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation that in turn regulates female fecundity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709029>Developmental and hormone-induced changes of mitochondrial electron transport chain enzyme activities during the last instar larval development of maize stem borer, Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae).</a></h1><p>The  demand for structural remodelling in holometabolous insects is met by cellular mitochondria. Developmental and hormone-induced changes in the mitochondrial respiratory activity during insect metamorphosis are not well documented. The present study investigates activities of enzymes of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) namely, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex I, Succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex II, Ubiquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase or complex III, cytochrome c oxidase or complex IV and FFATPase (ATPase), during Chilo partellus development. Further, the effect of juvenile hormone (JH) analog, , and brain and corpora-allata-corpora-cardiaca (CC-CA) homogenates that represent neurohormones, on the ETC enzyme activities was monitored. The enzymatic activities increased from penultimate to last larval stage and thereafter declined during pupal development with an exception of ATPase which showed high enzyme activity during last larval and pupal stages compared to the penultimate stage. JH analog,  differentially modulated ETC enzyme activities. It stimulated complex I and IV enzyme activities, but did not alter the activities of complex II, III and ATPase. On the other hand, brain homogenate declined the ATPase activity while the injected CC-CA homogenate stimulated complex I and IV enzyme activities. Cumulatively, the present study is the first to show that mitochondrial ETC enzyme system is under hormone control, particularly of JH and neurohormones during insect development.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Mating success and survival trade-offs when switching between alternative reproductive tactics.</a></h1><p>Hormones underlie the decision of assuming a territorial or a nonterritorial role, with territorial individuals usually having higher hormonal levels than nonterritorial individuals. As a territorial status is linked to higher mating opportunities, it is unclear why animals do not keep high hormonal levels and one explanation is that this would imply survival costs. We have tested this using males of the territorial damselfly Argia emma in the field. We increased juvenile hormone (JH) levels using  in both territorial and nonterritorial males and predicted that: (i) males will keep (the case of territorial males) or become (the case of nonterritorial males) territorial after hormonal increase, and (ii) there will be an increase in mating success for nonterritorial males only and an impaired survival for both male tactics. Hormonally treated males remained or became territorial but had their survival impaired compared with control groups. Also, hormonally treated, ex-nonterritorial males increased their mating success compared with the other control, nonterritorial males. The reduced survival can be explained proximally by the  devoted either to the enhanced aggression showed during territory defence or immune function (as detected previously in damselflies). Although nonterritorial males may increase their mating success by switching to a territorial tactic, they are possibly unable to do it naturally as JH is dietary dependent and usually nonterritorial animals are in poorer condition than territorial animals.© 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

Metabolism in female mosquitoes is tightly coupled with blood meal-mediated reproduction, which requires an extremely high level of  consumption. Functional analysis has shown that major genes encoding for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (LM) in the mosquito fat bodies are down-regulated at the end of the juvenile hormone (JH)-controlled posteclosion (PE) phase but exhibit significant elevation in their transcript levels during the post-blood meal phase (PBM), which is regulated mainly by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Reductions in the transcript levels of genes encoding triacylglycerol (TAG) catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes were observed to correlate with a dramatic accumulation of lipids in the PE phase; in contrast, these transcripts were elevated significantly and lipid stores were diminished during the PBM phase. The RNAi depletion of -tolerant (Met) and ecdysone receptor (EcR), receptors for JH and 20E, respectively, reversed the LM gene expression and the levels of lipid stores and metabolites, demonstrating the critical roles of these hormones in LM regulation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) RNAi-silenced mosquitoes exhibited down-regulation of the gene transcripts encoding TAG catabolism and β-oxidation enzymes and an inability to use lipids effectively, as manifested by TAG accumulation. The luciferase reporter assay showed direct regulation of LM-related genes by HNF4. Moreover,  gene expression was down-regulated by Met and activated by EcR and Target of rapamycin, providing a link between nutritional and hormonal regulation of LM in female mosquitoes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15180382>Testosterone and  metabolism in the estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Crustacea: Mysidacea) following exposure to endocrine disruptors.</a></h1><p>A diverse set of reference compounds suspected of having an endocrine-disrupting mode of action (i.e., testosterone, flutamide, ethinylestradiol, precocene, nonylphenol, fenoxycarb, and ) were tested for acute toxicity to the estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Crustacea: Mysidacea). Neomysis integer was very sensitive to all tested compounds, with 96-h median lethal concentrations in a narrow range between 0.32 and 1.95 mg/L. The pesticides  and fenoxycarb, both synthetic insect juvenile hormone analogs, were most toxic to N. integer. In addition, the short-term sublethal effects of  and nonylphenol (an estrogen agonist) on the  and steroid metabolism of N. integer were evaluated. Both compounds significantly affected  and testosterone metabolism of N. integer at concentrations below acute toxicity levels.  consumption in - and nonylphenol-exposed mysids was significantly induced at 100 microg/L, resulting in a lower cellular  allocation in these animals. Testosterone phase I metabolism was affected at 10 microg/L, whereas glycosylation was the most important phase II pathway affected in mysids exposed to 100 microg/L of both compounds.  exposure resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the metabolic androgenization ratio. Mysids exposed to nonylphenol at 10 microg/L had a significantly higher metabolic androgenization ratio. The present study indicates that  and testosterone metabolism of mysids, as endpoints, are able to detect endocrine-disruptive activity of chemicals after short-term exposure to environmentally realistic levels of endocrine disruptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216039>Endocrine remodelling of the adult intestine sustains reproduction in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>The production of offspring is energetically costly and relies on incompletely understood mechanisms that generate a positive  balance. In mothers of many species, changes in key -associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult Drosophila females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins -tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output.</p></html>
