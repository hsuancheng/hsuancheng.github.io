The proportions of hepatic MUFAs are generally considered to reflect changes in the activities of  acid modifications (∆9 desaturation and  acid elongation). However, hepatic levels of 16:1n-7 are markedly lower than those of oleic acid (18:1n-9). Nevertheless, no convincing explanation has yet been provided for the low level of 16:1n-7. We hypothesized that  acid degradation plays a key role in maintaining a low 16:1n-7 proportion in the . In order to corroborate the link between β-oxidation and the proportion of 16:1n-7, rats were fed a control diet, fed a fat-free diet to up-regulate  acid modifications, but not β-oxidation, or treated with clofibric acid to up-regulate  acid modifications and β-oxidation. The nutritional manipulation markedly increased the proportions of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and cis- (18:1n-7). Although the pharmacological manipulation enhanced  acid modifications to largely the same extent as the nutritional manipulation and markedly elevated the proportion of 18:1n-9, those of 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-7 remained largely unchanged. The oxidation rates of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and 18:1n-7 in  slices were in the following order: 16:1n-7>18:1n-7≑18:1n-9 in control livers, and were increased by the pharmacological manipulation and decreased by the nutritional manipulation. These results strongly suggest that β-oxidation, in concert with  acid modifications, plays a key role in regulating the MUFA profile and is crucially involved in maintaining low 16:1n-7 levels in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26044769>Oral Absorption and Disposition of alpha-Linolenic, Rumenic and Vaccenic Acids After Administration as a Naturally Enriched Goat Dairy Fat to Rats.</a></h2><p>Although there is extensive information describing the positive biological effects of conjugated linoleic acid and its main isomer rumenic acid (RA; C18:2 cis 9, trans 11), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and  (TVA), data about their bioavailability are not available. In this work, we investigated the oral absorption and disposition of these fatty acids in Wistar rats. A naturally enriched goat dairy fat (EDF) was obtained by supplementing ruminant diets with oils or oilseeds rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The EDF was administered orally (single dose of 3000 mg EDF/kg body weight equivalent to 153 mg TVA/kg body weight, 46 mg RA/kg body weight and 31 mg ALA/kg body weight), and serial blood and liver samples were collected and TVA, RA and ALA concentrations determined by GC/MS. The fatty acids TVA, RA and ALA were rapidly absorbed (t1/2a, 0.36, 0.66 and 0.76 h, respectively, for plasma) and slowly eliminated (t1/2β, 17.04, 18.40 and 16.52 h, respectively, for plasma). The maximum concentration (C max) was detected in liver > plasma > erythrocyte. Our study shows that when orally administered EDF, its components TVA, RA and ALA were rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body by the blood circulation to exert systemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830448>Significant decrease of saturation index in erythrocytes membrane from subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>The lipidomic profiling of erythrocyte membranes is expected to provide a peculiar scenario at molecular level of metabolic and nutritional pathways which may influence the lipid balance and the adaptation and homeostasis of the organism. Considering that lipid accumulation in the cell is important in promoting tissue inflammation, the purpose of this study is to analyze the fatty acid profile in red blood cell membranes of patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), in order to identify and validate membrane profiles possibly associated with the degree of hepatic damage.This work presents data obtained at baseline from 101 subjects that participated to a nutritional trial (registration number: ) enrolling consecutive subjects with NAFLD. Diagnosis of liver steatosis was performed by using vibration-controlled elastography implemented on FibroScan. Fatty acids, extracted from phospholipids of erythrocyte membranes, were quantified by gas chromatography method.The subjects with severe NAFLD showed a significant decrease of the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid (saturation index, SI) compared to controls, 1.281 ± 0.31 vs 1.5 ± 0.29, respectively. Low levels of SI in red blood cell membranes, inversely associated with degree of liver damage, suggest that an impairment of circulating cell membrane structure can reflect modifications that take place in the liver. Subjects with severe NAFLDalso showed higher levels of elongase 5 enzymatic activity, evaluated as  to palmitoleic acid ratio.Starting from these evidences, our findings show the importance of lipidomic approach in the diagnosis and the staging of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133424>Ruminant and industrial trans- acid uptake in the heart.</a></h2><p>Dietary trans-fats are strongly associated with heart disease. However, the capacity for the tissues of the body, and specifically the heart, to take up trans-fats is unknown. It is also unknown if different trans-fats have different uptake capacities in the heart and other tissues of the body. Diets of low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice were supplemented for 14weeks with foods that contained 1.5% of the trans-fat elaidic acid or . Tissues were extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography for  acid content. Isolated cardiomyocytes were also exposed to elaidic or  in cell culture media for 24h. Dietary supplementation with vaccenic or elaidic acid resulted in a 20-fold higher accumulation of these TFAs in fat deposits in the body in comparison to .  tissue accumulated about twice as much per gram tissue as heart. Similar quantities of both elaidic acid and  were taken up by the tissues. Isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited an unusually large uptake of trans-fat, and this was dependent upon both the concentration and duration of exposure to the trans-fats but not upon the type of trans-fat. Expression levels of CD36 and FATP4 were not significantly changed during dietary interventions or exposure of cells to trans-fats. We conclude that fat,  and heart (including cardiomyocytes) are all capable of accumulating trans-fat in response to dietary supplementation without changes in  acid transport protein expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315997>Trans Fatty Acids Suppress TNF-α-Induced Inflammatory Gene Expression in Endothelial (HUVEC) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HepG2) Cells.</a></h2><p>Trans fatty acids (TFA) intake has been linked to cardiovascular diseases and liver diseases; yet the effect of TFA on inflammation remains controversial. Accordingly, the objective of this paper was to determine the in vitro effects of TFA on inflammatory gene expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated for 24 h with either trans- (tVA), trans-palmitoleic acid (tPA) or elaidic acid (EA) at concentrations of 5-150 µM, or with a mixture of tVA and tPA (150/50 µM). All TFA were highly incorporated into cell membranes, as determined by gas chromatography, representing 15-20% of total fatty acids in HUVEC and 3-8% in HepG2 cells. Incorporation of EA, a common industrial TFA, increased the ratio of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), a key enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism. Ruminant TFA, including tVA, tPA and the mixture of tVA and tPA, significantly reduced the TNF-α-induced gene expression of TNF, VCAM-1 and SOD2 in HUVEC, as well as TNF and IL-8 in HepG2 cells. EA also decreased inflammatory gene expression in HUVEC, but not in HepG2 cells. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ did not influence the effects of TFA on gene expression. Overall, physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of TFA, especially tVA and tPA, prevented inflammatory gene expression in vitro. This effect is independent of PPAR-γ activation and may be due to an alteration of fatty acid metabolism in cell membranes caused by the high incorporation of TFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28838557>Fads3 modulates docosahexaenoic acid in liver and brain.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) is the third member of the FADS gene cluster. FADS1 and FADS2 code for enzymes required for highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) biosynthesis, but FADS3 function remains elusive. We generated the first Fads3 knockout (KO) mouse with an aim to characterize its metabolic phenotype and clues to in vivo function. All mice (wild type (WT) and KO) were fed facility rodent chow devoid of HUFA. No differences in overt phenotypes (survival, fertility, growth rate) were observed. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) levels in the brain of postnatal day 1 (P1) KO mice were lower than the WT (P < 0.05). The ratio of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) to DHA in P1 KO liver was higher than in WT suggesting lower desaturase activity. Concomitantly, 20:4n-6 was lower but its elongation product 22:4n-6 was greater in the liver of P1 KO mice. P1 KO liver Fads1 and Fads2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated whereas expression levels of elongation of very long chain 2 (Elovl2) and Elovl5 genes were upregulated compared to age-matched WT. No Δ13-desaturation of  was observed in liver or heart in WT mice expressing FADS3 as was reported in vitro. Taken together, the fatty acid compositional results suggest that Fads3 enhances liver-mediated 22:6n-3 synthesis to support brain 22:6n-3 accretion before and during the brain growth spurt.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The strains were isolated from eight patients: five female, two male and one not specified. No ages were indicated for the patients. The sources were urine (3), leg tissue (2), foot wound, lung tissue and deep . The strains originated from seven different states across the USA [Colorado, Connecticut (2), Indiana, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania]. The strains grew at 10-42 °C, were non-motile, alkalitolerant, slightly halophilic, microaerophilic, and catalase- and oxidase-positive. The DNA G+C content was 47.3-47.6 mol%. The major cellular  acids were tetradecanoic acid (C14 : 0), hexadecanoic acid (C16 : 0) and  (C18 : 1ω7c). Polar lipids detected were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and unknown phospholipids; the only respiratory quinone detected was the ubiquinone Q-9 (100 %). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis produced results with 95.6 % similarity to Pseudomonas caeni DSM 24390T and 95.2 % similarity to Thiopseudomonas denitrificans X2T. The results of the biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analyses between the study strains and some related type strains indicated that these strains represent a novel species of a new genus within the family Pseudomonadaceae, for which the name Oblitimonas alkaliphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is B4199T (=DSM 100830T=CCUG 67636T).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527759>Prospective association of fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of type 2 diabetes: the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>Experimental evidence suggests that hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) affects insulin homeostasis via synthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Few prospective studies have used fatty acid biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic acid (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty acid biomarkers [myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic acid showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic acid (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic acid (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic acid was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses,  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty acid biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were associated with higher diabetes risk, and  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

Considering the effect of interactions between food and age on metabolism, here we depict the lipid framework of 12 tissues isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats fed standard rodent chow over 1 year, an age below which animals are commonly studied. The aim is to define relevant markers of lipid metabolism influenced by age in performing a fatty acid (FA) and dimethylacetal profile from total lipids. First, our results confirm impregnation of adipose and muscular tissues with medium-chain FA derived from maternal milk during early infancy. Secondly, when animals were switched to standard croquettes, tissues were remarkably enriched in n-6 FA and especially 18:2n-6. This impregnation over time was coupled with a decrease of the desaturation index and correlated with lower activities of hepatic Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases. In parallel, we emphasize the singular status of testis, where 22:5n-6, 24:4n-6, and 24:5n-6 were exceptionally accumulated with growth. Thirdly, 18:1n-7, usually found as a discrete FA, greatly accrued over the course of time, mostly in liver and coupled with Δ9-desaturase expression. Fourthly, skeletal muscle was characterized by a surprising enrichment of 22:6n-3 in adults, which tended to decline in older rats. Finally, plasmalogen-derived dimethylacetals were specifically abundant in brain, erythrocytes, lung, and heart. Most notably, a shift in the fatty aldehyde moiety was observed, especially in brain and erythrocytes, implying that red blood cell analysis could be a good indicator of brain plasmalogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262139>Conversion of dietary trans- to trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic acid in the rat lactating mammary gland by  Acid Desaturase 3-catalyzed methyl-end Δ13-desaturation.</a></h2><p>In vitro, the rat  Acid Desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of trans-, producing the trans11,cis13-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer. FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans- in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of  acids and 3.8% of energy intake) or low (0.4% of  acids and 0.2% of energy intake) in trans-. The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total  acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans--enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the . Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This increase may be associated with . It has been suggested that trans-fatty acids (TFAs) play an important role in non-communicable diseases.We examined the link between liver tests, fatty liver index (FLI) and plasma TFAs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of adiposity on this link.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used to obtain the data on TFAs and liver function biomarkers. We took account of complex NHANES data, masked variance and weighting methodology.Of the 4252 participants, 46.4% were men. The mean age was 50.6 years overall; 51.3 years for men and 49.8 years for women (p = 0.206). In a fully adjusted model (demographic and clinical factors), FLI increased as trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans- levels increased; FLI was 38.1 and 42.3 for the first quarter (Q1) of trans-9-hexadecenoic acid and trans-, respectively, reaching 65.1 and 69.3 for the highest quarters (Q4) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Multivariable logistic regression showed for all four studied TFAs, the likelihood of NAFLD (determined by FLI) increased with increasing TFAs levels (quartiles) in a stepwise manner (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Based on moderation analysis, a strong impact of body mass index (BMI) on the link between FLI and TFAs was observed.Our results suggest a direct significant association between plasma TFAs, liver tests and NAFLD (assessed by FLI). Furthermore, BMI was shown to mediate this relationship. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding TFAs consumption in order to minimize cardiometabolic risk.Copyright © 2018.

For now, this specific CLA is suspected to derive exclusively from ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary α-linolenic acid. However, in rodents, the  acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was recently shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of , producing a Δ11,13-CLA with all the structural characteristics of the trans-11,cis-13 isomer, although no commercial standard exists for complete conclusive identification. Because the FADS3 gene has already been reported in bovine animals, we hypothesized in the present study that an alternative direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue may therefore co-exist with α-linolenic acid biohydrogenation to explain the final ruminant milk trans-11,cis-13 CLA presence. Here, we first confirm that the FADS3 gene is present in ruminant mammal genomic sequence databases. Second, we demonstrate that the Δ11,13-CLA found in milk fat and the highly probable trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer produced by rodent FADS3 possess exactly the same structural characteristics. Then, we show that bovine mammary MAC-T and BME-UV epithelial cells express both FADS3 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA and are able to synthesize both the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA and cis-9,trans-11CLA (rumenic acid) isomers when incubated with . Finally, the concomitant presence of the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer with FADS3 mRNA was shown in goat mammary tissue, whereas both were conversely very low or even absent in goat . Therefore, this study provides several lines of evidence that, by analogy with rumenic acid, trans-11,cis-13 CLA may originate both from ruminal biohydrogenation and from direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of , fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962361>Effects of dietary trans-9 octadecenoic acid, trans-11  and cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dietary trans fatty acids in mice.
