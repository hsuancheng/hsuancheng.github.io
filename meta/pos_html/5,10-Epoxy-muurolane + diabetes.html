This study aimed to determine the role of demographic factors, lipid profile, family history (the estimation of genetic association) and anthropometric factors on  onset.Data from the enrolment phase of the Tabari Cohort study was applied for this study and included 10,255 participants aged between 35-70 years. Anthropometric variables were measured by trained staff using standard tools. Blood specimens were collected for lipid profile and blood glucose measurements. Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 24, with univariate and multivariate logistic regression.The prevalence of  was estimated to be 17.2% in the cohort population, 15.6% in men, and 18.3% in women.

For instance, at the cellular level, the viscosity of subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, etc.) is much greater than that of cytoplasm; at the organismal level, compared with normal states of health, blood or lymphatic fluid viscosity will increase to some extent in , hypertension, inflammation, tumors and so on. However, due to the design shortcoming, there is a lack of efficient tool for detecting biomolecules in viscous living systems. Herein, we propose a rational design strategy for constructing ratiometric fluorescent probes with superior response signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in viscous systems based on rigid-fluorophore-molecular rotor platform, and a practical sulfur dioxide (SO2) probe (RFC-MRC) based on conmarin-cyanine dyad was prepared as a proof-of-concept. The probe performs a significant enhancement (71.-fold) of ratiometric response signal stimulated by SO2 in viscous aqueous media. The cationic probe can selectively in mitochondria and was successfully utilized to sense SO2 in living HeLa cells through ratiometric fluorescence imaging. What's more, in the fluorescence imaging experiments of monitoring SO2 in apoptotic cells using probe RFC-MRC, a more obvious superior of S/B ratio was observed in the early apoptotic cells than in the lately apoptotic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669219>Benzimidazole-based dual dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Multiple-targeting compounds might reduce complex polypharmacy of multifactorial diseases, such as , and contribute to the greater therapeutic success. Targeting reactive oxygen species-producing enzymes, as xanthine oxidase (XO), might suppress progression of -associated vascular complications. In this study a small series of benzimidazole derivatives (1-9) was evaluated for inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and XO. One 1,3-disubstituted-benzimidazole-2-imine () and 1,3-thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazolone derivative (8) were shown as effective dual DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, with IC values lower than 200 μM, and predicted binding modes with both target enzymes. Both selected dual inhibitors (compounds  and 8) did not show cytotoxicity to a greater extent on Caco-2 cells even at concentration of 250 μM. These structures represent new non-purine scaffolds bearing two therapeutic functionalities, being DPP-4 and XO inhibitors, more favorable in comparison to DPP-4 inhibitors with DPP-4 as a single target due to pleiotropic effects of XO inhibition.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We examined and compared the predictive value of INR relative to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). We reviewed the American College of Surgeons NSQIP from 2005 to 2016 for adult patients undergoing open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with a preoperative INR were stratified into groups: ≤1, >1 to ≤1., >1. to ≤2, and >2. Thirty day postoperative mortality was the primary outcome. Multivariable logistic regressions controlled for baseline differences. Of 58,177 cholecystectomy patients, 15.2 per cent had INR ≤ 1, 80.4 per cent had INR > 1 to ≤1., 3.7 per cent had INR > 1. to ≤2, and 0.7 per cent had INR > 2. Patients with INR > 2 were older and more likely to have  and hypertension ( < 0.001). Multivariable regression demonstrated a stepwise increase in mortality for INR > 1 to ≤1. (odds ratio (OR) = 1.50 [1.10-2.05]), INR > 1. to ≤2 (OR = 2.96 [1.97-4.45]), and INR > 2 (OR = 3.21 [1.64-6.31]) relative to INR ≤ 1. C-statistic for INR (0.910) and MELD (0.906) models indicated a similar value in predicting mortality. INR groups also faced an incremental, increased risk of bleeding. Although unable to track preoperative correction of INR, this analysis identifies that INR remains an excellent predictor of postoperative mortality and bleeding after both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomies and is comparable to MELD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674936>New European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on ; prediabetes, and cardiovascular diseases - a truly strong base for the major paradigm shift in clinical practice?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675433>Simultaneous angiotensin receptor blockade and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation ameliorate albuminuria in obese insulin-resistant rats.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance increases renal oxidant production by up-regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression contributing to oxidative damage and ultimately albuminuria. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using insulin resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and () OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during insulin resistance, while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675427>Effect of Metabolic Traits on the Risk of Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Cancer in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver condition. Predicting its progression could help clinicians manage and potentially prevent complications. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of metabolic traits on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with NAFLD. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with NAFLD diagnosed at 130 facilities in the Veterans Administration between 1/1/2004 and 12/31/2008 with follow-up through 12/31/2015. We performed competing risk, adjusted cause-specific Cox models to evaluate the effects of metabolic traits (, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) as additive or combined indicators on time to develop cirrhosis or HCC or a composite endpoint of both. Of the 271,906 patients, 22,794 developed cirrhosis, and 253 developed HCC during a mean of 9 years follow up. At baseline, the mean BMI was 31.6 (SD, .6), 28.7% had , 70.3% hypertension, and 62.3% had dyslipidemia with substantial overlap among the these traits. The risk of progression was the lowest in patients with only one or no metabolic trait. There was a stepwise increase in risk with each additional metabolic trait. Compared to patients with no metabolic trait, patients with both hypertension and dyslipidemia had 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis/HCC (hazard ratio (HR) =1.8, 95% CI=1.59-2.06); the risk was 2.6-fold higher in patients with , obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension (HR=2.6, 95% CI=2.3,2.9). These associations were stronger for HCC.  had the strongest association with HCC in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Each additional metabolic trait increased the risk of cirrhosis and HCC in patients with NAFLD.  conferred the highest risk of progression to HCC.

Seventy patients (cases) reached the composite endpoint of cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization, left ventricular assist device, or heart transplantation. From all longitudinal samples, we selected baseline samples in all patients and the last two samples before the event in cases or the last sample available in event-free patients. Herein, we measured plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR). Associations between temporal biomarker patterns during follow-up and the cardiac event were investigated using a joint model. Cases were on average older and showed higher New York Heart Association class than those who remained event-free. They also had lower blood pressures, and were more likely to have , renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. Longitudinally measured PAI-1, uPA, and suPAR were independently associated with adverse cardiac events after correction for clinical characteristics (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) per standard deviation increase of 2.09 (1.28-3.45) for PAI-1, 1.91 (1.18-3.24) for uPA, and 3.96 (2.48-6.63) for suPAR. Serial measurements of tPA were not significantly associated with the event after correction for multiple testing. Longitudinally measured PAI-1, uPA, and suPAR are strongly associated with adverse cardiac events during the course of CHF. If future research confirms our results, these fibrinolytic factors may carry potential for improved, and personalized, heart failure surveillance and treatment monitoring.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and , and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and - to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (> min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and insulin responses in a single female subject with . The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake. Body weight, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, and blood chemistry panel including glucose, insulin, and safety markers were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient.

It is unclear what walking speeds and durations significantly affect plantar tissue viability and risks for foot ulcers in non-diabetics and diabetics.The aim of this study was to establish the normal response of plantar skin blood flow to different speeds and durations of walking exercise in non-diabetics that would be needed to quantify impaired responses in diabetics.Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure plantar skin blood flow of the first metatarsal head in 12 non-diabetics. A 3 × 2 factorial design, including 3 speeds (slow at 3 km/h, moderate at 6 km/h, and fast at 9 km/h) and 2 durations (10 and 20 min), was used in this study. Skin blood flow after walking was expressed as a ratio of skin blood flow before walking. The 3 × 2 two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to examine the main effects of speeds and durations and their interaction.The walking speed significantly affected skin blood flow responses (p < 0.01). Walking at 9 km/h significantly increased plantar skin blood flow (.71 ± 1.89) compared to walking at 6 km/h (2.1 ± 0.29) and 3 km/h (1.16 ± 0.14), especially at 20-minute walking duration (p < 0.01). The walking duration showed a trend of significance on affecting skin blood flow responses (p = 0.06). There was no significant interaction between walking speeds and durations (p > 0.05).Our results provide the first evidence that walking speeds affect plantar skin blood flow and a fast walking speed (9 km/h) significantly increases plantar skin blood flow compared to moderate (6 km/h) and slow (3 km/h) walking speeds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of GoSlo-SR compounds on vascular smooth muscle has not been studied. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GoSlo-SR compounds dilate arteries exclusively by activating BK channels.Experiments were performed on rat Gracilis muscle, saphenous, mesenteric and tail arteries using isobaric and isometric myography, sharp microelectrodes, digital droplet PCR and the patch-clamp technique.GoSlo-SR compounds dilated isobaric and relaxed and hyperpolarized isometric vessel preparations and their effects were abolished after (i) functionally eliminating K channels by pre-constriction with 50 mM KCl or (ii) blocking all K channels known to be expressed in vascular smooth muscle. However, these effects were not blocked when BK channels were inhibited. Surprisingly, the K 7 channel inhibitor XE991 reduced their effects considerably, but neither K 1 nor K 2 channel blockers altered the inhibitory effects of GoSlo-SR. However, the combined blockade of BK and K 7 channels abolished the GoSlo-SR-induced relaxation. GoSlo-SR compounds also activated K 7.4 and K 7. channels expressed in HEK 293 cells.This study shows that GoSlo-SR-compounds are effective relaxants in vascular smooth muscle and mediate their effects by a combined activation of BK and K 7.4/K 7. channels.

Outcomes measured included incident myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure, stroke, and all-cause mortality.Eight hundred nineteen patients were classified as group I, 1036 as group II, and 126 of 1981 (6.4%) as group III or CKD. Subjects in group III were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension, , and MI at baseline. Over a 10.2-year follow-up period, CKD was associated with an increased risk of MI (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.2-3.14; P=.006) and composite cardiovascular outcomes including MI, congestive heart failure, stroke, and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83 ;P=.02). Subjects with NT-proBNP or hs-TnT in the third tertile were at greater risk of cardiovascular events without significant interactions between eGFR and levels of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT.Subjects with CKD had significantly elevated cardiac biomarkers and were at an increased risk of MI and adverse cardiovascular events. This warrants future studies to investigate whether these cardiac biomarkers could identify high-risk CKD patients for aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors.Copyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Microvascular endothelial dysfunction can predict future cardiovascular adverse events, but the predictive value of microvascular endothelial dysfunction for future risk of solid-tumor cancer has not been characterized.A total of 488 patients who underwent microvascular endothelial function assessment using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry were included in this study. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction was defined as a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤2.0.Of 221 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤2.0, 21 patients (9.%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up, whereas of 267 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >2.0, 10 patients (3.7%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up ( = 0.009). Patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤2.0 had lower solid-tumor cancer-free survival compared to patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >2.0 (log-rank  = 0.017) (median follow-up 6.0 (3.0-9.1) years). Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤2.0 predicted the incidence of solid-tumor cancer, with a hazard ratio of 2.52 (95% confidence interval 1.17-.45;  = 0.019) after adjusting for age, sex, and coronary artery disease, 2.83 (95% confidence interval 1.30-6.17;  = 0.009) after adjusting for , hypertension, smoking status, and body mass index >30 kg/m, 2.79 (95% confidence interval 1.21-6.41;  = 0.016) after adjusting for fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, smoking status (current or former), and body mass index, and 2.43 (95% confidence interval 1.10-.34;  = 0.028) after adjusting for Framingham risk score.Microvascular endothelial dysfunction, as defined by a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index ≤2.0, was associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of solid-tumor cancer. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction may be a useful marker to predict the future risk of solid-tumor cancer, in addition to its known ability to predict cardiovascular disease.

This study aims to assess a cross-section of truckers in South Africa to describe their health information.The study took place across three truck-stop rest areas in the South African provinces of Free State and Gauteng.Eligibility criteria included being males aged 18 years and older, full-time employment as a long-distance truck driver. A total of 614 male truck drivers participated; 384 (63%) were Zimbabwean and 325 (55%) completed high-school.The trucker survey explored demographics; working conditions; sexual, eating and sleeping behaviours; mental health status, medical history and cardiac risk-factors. Medical assessments included physical measurements, glucose and lipid measurements, ECG, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cardiac ultrasound.In the previous month, 554 (91%) participants were sexually active; 522 (86%) had sex with a regular partner; 174 (27%) with a casual partner; 87 (14%) with a sex worker. Average time driving was 10 hours/day, 20 days/month, 302 (50%) never worked night shifts and 74 (12%) worked nights approximately four times per week. 112 (18%) experienced daytime sleepiness and 59 (10%) were ever hospitalised from an accident. Forty-seven (8%, 95% CI .3 to 9.) were HIV-positive, with half taking antiretrovirals. Forty-eight (8%) truckers had some moderate depression, while 21 (4%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Reported tuberculosis, myocardial infarction, and  were <3%. Prominent cardiac risk-factors included smoking (n=63, 11%), consuming alcohol (>15 drinks/week) (n=54, 9%), overweight/obesity (n=417, 69%), and hypertension (n=220, 36%,95% CI 32.1 to 39.7). ECG results showed 23 (4.9%) and 29 (.3%) drivers had left ventricular hypertrophy using the Cornell criterion and product, respectively. CIMT measurements indicated nine (4.2%) drivers had a carotid atherosclerotic plaque.This first holistic assessment of health among southern African male truck drivers demonstrates substantial addressable cardiovascular risk factors, mental health issues and sexual risk behaviours.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical and genetic aspects of HeFH patients with T2DM in the dyslipidemia registry of the Spanish Arteriosclerosis Society.HeFH patients were classified according to the presence or absence of T2DM. The clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of the 2 groups were compared.Of the 2301 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia included in the registry, 1724 with a probable or definite diagnosis according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score were finally included. HeFH patients with T2DM had a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (366.9±86.7mg/dL vs 342.0±74.7mg/dL; mean difference 24.894; 95%CI, .840-43.949) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (316.9±87.8mg/dL vs 286.4±75.4mg/dL; mean difference 30.500; 95%CI, 11.211-49.790) levels. No significant differences were found between the groups concerning the specific type of HeFH-causing mutation (P=.720). After adjustment for major risk factors, logistic regression analysis confirmed a relationship between T2DM and the presence of CVD (OR, 2.01; 95%CI, 1.18-3.43; P=.010).HeFH patients with T2DM have a higher rate of CVD and a less favorable lipid profile, regardless of genetic mutation type. In these patients, T2DM is associated with the presence of CVD.Copyright © 2019.

On the basis of free thriiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels patients were classified into one of the following four categories: as euthyroid subjects, as or patients affected by hypothyroidism, low T3 (LT3) syndrome or hyperthyroidism. During follow-up, death for all causes was assessed as primary end-point, whereas time to the first hospitalization for heart failure worsening was the secondary end-point analyzed.Among 762 patients, 190 patients were affected by hypothyroidism (Hypo). LT3 syndrome was diagnosed in 15 patients and 59 patients were affected by hyperthyroidism (Hyper). During a long term follow-up (.1±3.7 years), 303 patients died. Patients with Hypo showed an increased risk of death as well as of hospitalization due to heart failure worsening at univariate regression analysis. At multivariate regression analysis Hypo remained associated with hospitalization after correction for age >75 years, ischemic aetiology, , therapy with ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, therapy with betablockers and with aldosterone antagonists, NYHA class 3, systolic arterial pressure <95 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min, hyponatremia and NT-proBNP>1000 pg/ml. At, multivariate analysis, the independent association with death was significant only for the subgroup of patients with TSH >10 mIU/L. LT3 was independently associated with both heart failure hospitalization and death, whereas Hyper was not associated with any of the two considered end-points.Hypo is associated with a worse prognosis over a long-term follow-up. The association with heart failure hospitalization is not dependent on the baseline TSH levels, whereas the association with death is significant only when TSH >10 mIU/L. Finally, Hyper does not have anly association with a worse prognosis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665233>δ-related Biomarkers Attenuate Multiple AD Conversion Risks and Offer Targets for Intervention.</a></h2><p>We tested certain serum proteins' ability to mediate the effects of demographic variables on prospective 5yr conversion to clinical "Alzheimer's Disease" (AD) from non-demented states [i.e., Normal Control (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)]. The proteins were rationally selected from among previously published mediators of those same variables' associations with the latent variable "δ", a novel omnibus dementia severity metric.Each protein's attenuation of its risk factor's independent association with conversion was confirmed by logistic regression, adjusted for education, ethnicity, self-reported  and hypertension, among N = 772 initially non-demented Mexican-American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants in the Texas Alzheimer`s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC).n = 70 non-demented participants at baseline converted to "AD" (9.1%) after a mean follow-up of .4 yrs. Age >80yrs (OR = 3.1), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS30) > 10/30 (OR = 2.3), female gender (OR = 2.2) and the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele (OR = 2.4) were independently associated with prospective conversion. These effects were fully attenuated by five serum proteins: AGE: Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 2 (IGF-BP2), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1 (EGFR); Depression: Resistin; Gender: Thrombopoeitin (THPO); APOE: C-Reactive Protein (CRP).Clinical dementia arises from the sum of independent δ-related processes.

In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic gluconeogenesis, and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of  and how exercise improves .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657695> is the only independent predictor of both postoperative and long term renal functions in elective laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with limited or overextended warm ischemia.</a></h2><p>To investigate the predictive factors of renal functional change at postoperative period and at last follow-up in patients undergoing elective and clamped laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) with limited (≤20 minutes) and overextended (≥40 minutes) warm ischemia time (WIT).From our prospectively collected LPN database, elective and warm ischemia-applied LPNs were retrospectively analyzed in two groups: limited (n=55, Group 1, WIT≤20 minutes) and overextended (n=28, Group 2, WIT≥40 minutes) WITs. Preoperatively, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m in all patients. Demographic, clinical, perioperative and renal functional parameters were compared between two groups. Age,  (DM), pathological tumor size, preoperative eGFR and WIT were used in multivariable analyses to investigate the independent predictors of de novo Stage 3 or greater CKD (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m) at postoperative period and at the last follow-up.Preoperative (p=0.009) and pathological (p=0.011) tumor size, PADUA (p=0.001) and R.E.N.A.L.

A total of eight online databases were searched to collect studies published up to February 2019. Study quality of each included article was evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted based on the Cochrane systematic review method by using the RevMan .3 software. Traditional Chinese medicine foot bath combined with acupoint massage was the main therapy in experimental group. Interventions in control groups include western medicine, oral traditional Chinese medicine, other symptomatic treatment of western medicine, and blank control. Primary outcomes in this study include sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), total effective rate, and neuropathic syndrome score. Finally, 31 trials involving 3284 participants were included. The results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed that traditional Chinese medicine foot bath combined with acupoint massage was significantly better compared with the control groups in terms of the total effective rate, SNCV, MNCV, and neuropathic syndrome score. No case of adverse effect was reported. These findings show that traditional Chinese medicine foot bath combined with acupoint massage may be safer and more effective for the treatment of DPN.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between leptin, inflammatory markers and VD status in TB patients, stratified for presence or absence of  (DM). Two hundred ninety-nine TB patients were recruited from October 2015 to August 2016. Also, 91 normal controls were included. The information including socio-demographics, dietary intake and living habits was obtained by face-to-face interview. Serum concentrations of leptin and TNF-α, CRP and IL-6 were compared between TB patients with and without severe VDD (SVDD). Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the association between TNF-α, leptin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). A significantly higher prevalence of VDD and SVDD was observed in TB patients compared with normal controls (93.0% vs 70.3%, 65.9% vs 3.3% respectively). Concentration of leptin was significantly lower, while TNF-α higher in TB patients with SVDD compared to those without (p<0.05). After adjustment for confounders, leptin was positively associated with 25(OH)D (r=0.210, p=0.002) with similar correlation in TB patients with DM (r=0.240, p=0.020). A negative association between TNF-α and 25(OH)D was observed (r=-0.197, p=0.003), which was significant only in the subgroup without DM (r=-0.304, p=0.001).

Sixteen samples from  different commercially available IVIg preparations were tested with cell-based assays (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect and characterize common neuronal autoantibodies, and with immunohistochemistry on teased fibers from mouse sciatic nerve and on mouse brain sections to screen for nodal and not yet identified neuronal antigens. In 15/16 IVIg preparations, anti-GAD antibodies were detected in titers ranging from 40 to 1507 IU/mL, as typically seen in type 1 , but not in the range (> 2000 IU/mL) seen in GAD-positive neurological patients. None of the preparations was however positive with anti-GAD CBA. Antibodies to AQP4 were also detected by ELISA in 15/16 IVIg preparations with titers comparable to those seen in AQP4-seropositive NMO patients; with CBA, however, all IVIg samples were AQP4-negative. IVIg preparations contained IgG-anti-MAG antibodies by ELISA at statistically significant higher titers compared to controls. Two of the 16 IVIg samples were positive for human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies. All IVIg preparations were negative for antibodies to MOG, NMDAR, anti-nodal, and other neuronal-specific proteins. IVIg preparations contain antibodies against GAD and AQP4 in titers comparable to those seen in autoimmune patients when tested by ELISA, but not by CBA or tissue immunohistochemistry, suggesting that the autoantibodies within the IVIg are against linear rather than structural epitopes, as part of the natural antibody immune repertoire.

Data was obtained through medical record review, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons data elements, and the National Death Index database.Both MPS and No MPS groups had similar comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, , and peripheral vascular disease; however, those with MPS were sicker on admission with higher rates of acute renal failure (50% . 1%, P<0.0001) and acute paralysis (17% . 0%, P=0.02). Patients with MPS amenable to endovascular reperfusion (n=10) underwent endovascular fenestration/stenting and delayed aortic repair. Those with cerebral or coronary MPS (n=2) and those without MPS (n=70) underwent emergent open aortic repair. Of the ten patients undergoing fenestration/stenting, seven went on to aortic repair, one survived to discharge without aortic repair, one died from aortic rupture on hospital day 34, and one died from organ failure prior to aortic repair. Following endovascular fenestration/stenting or aortic repair, all patients with MPS had higher in-hospital mortality (17% . 0%), P=0.02. Following aortic repair, patients with MPS had more postoperative sepsis and longer postoperative length of stay (all P<0.05). However, both groups had a 0% operative mortality (including in-hospital and 30-day mortality following aortic repair). The -year survival of all ATAAIMH patients was 79%. The 2-year survival was significantly better in the No MPS group (94% . 62%, P=0.006).ATAAIMH with MPS can be effectively managed with upfront endovascular fenestration/stenting followed by delayed aortic repair.2019 Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

Diabetic retinopathy was classified based on fundus examination in medical records as 0) no evidence of retinopathy, 1) mild non-proliferative retinopathy; 2) moderate to severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 3) proliferative retinopathy. Patients were classified according to the eye with a worse retinopathy stage. Follow-up was considered as time between the diagnosis of  and the last funduscopic evaluation.233 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of any DR at less than , 10, 15, 20 and more than 20-years of DM was 1.8%, 10.4%, 34.8%, 54.1% and 71.2% respectively. The overall prevalence of DR was 43.3% (n = 101). At the last observation, 43 patients (18.%) had mild NPDR, 34 patients (14.6%) had moderate to severe NPDR and 24 patients (10.3%) had PDR. The longer the disease duration, the higher the number of patients with DR.The prevalence of DR in our cohort was 34.8% after 15 years of systemic disease and 54.1% after 20 years, which is lower than what has been reported in the literature.

In the first two analyses, logistic regression models were used with dynapenia (grip strength < 26kg in men and < 16kg in women) as outcome and  [ND, UDD, CD and UCD] as exposure. Next, linear regression was performed with grip strength as outcome and the participants classified based on HbA1c level as exposure. The models were adjusted by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics.Compared to ND only UCD was associated with dynapenia (men OR=2.37 95% CI 1.36-4.14; women OR=1.67 95% CI 1.01-2.79). This association was less clear, particularly in women, when CD and UCD groups were merged. HbA1c ≥ 6.% in men and ≥ 8.0% in women were associated with lower NMS.UCD increases the chance of dynapenia in both sexes. The different groupings based on  status modify the association between UCD and dynapenia. The threshold of HbA1c associated with reduced NMS is lower in men compared to women.© The Author(s) 2019.

Various outcomes were analyzed, including changes in serum potassium levels and their impact on treatment.Hyperkalemia (K> .4 mEq/L) was identified in 4.3% (95%CI, 3.7%-.0%) and 8.2% (6.%-10.2%) of patients with chronic and acute heart failure, respectively, and was responsible for 28.9% of all cases of contraindication to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use and for 10.8% of all cases of failure to reach the target dose. Serum potassium levels were not recorded in 291 (10.8%) of the 2693 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. During follow-up, potassium levels increased in 179 of 1431 patients (12.%, 95%CI, 10.8%-14.3%). This increase was directly related to age, , and history of stroke and was inversely related to history of hyperkalemia.This study highlights the magnitude of the problem of hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure in everyday clinical practice and the need to improve monitoring of this factor in these patients due to its interference with the possibility of receiving optimal treatment.Copyright © 2019 Sociedad Española de Cardiología.

Therefore, we rechecked their linkage aiming to obtain a more reliable estimation by performing an updated meta-analysis.We searched electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang to obtain studies updated to October 2019.After carefully screening, we finally incorporated 68 studies with 10,812 cases and 8,745 controls. The genotype frequency of C677T polymorphism was analyzed pooled to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled results presented that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM under homozygous (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.39-1.94), heterozygous (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.20-1.59), recessive (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.23-1.61), dominant (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.27-1.70), and allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.23-1.52) genetic models.

Yet the extent of this improvement and whether it impacts multiple risk factors together is uncertain. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to investigate the effects of text-messaging interventions for CVD prevention.Electronic databases were searched to identify trials investigating a text-messaging intervention focusing on CVD prevention with the potential to modify at least two CVD risk factors in adults. The main outcome was blood pressure (BP). We conducted standard and IPD meta-analysis on pooled data. We accounted for clustering of patients within studies and the primary analysis used random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.Nine trials were included in the systematic review involving 3779 participants and  (n=2612) contributed data to the IPD meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that the weighted mean differences are as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP), -4.13 mm Hg (95% CI -11.07 to 2.81, p<0.0001); diastolic blood pressure (DBP), -1.11 mm Hg (-1.91 to -0.31, p=0.002); and body mass index (BMI), -0.32 (-0.49 to -0.16, p=0.000). In the IPD meta-analysis, the mean difference are as follows: SBP, -1.3 mm Hg (-.4 to 2.7, p=0.5236); DBP, -0.8 mm Hg (-2. to 1.0, p=0.3912); and BMI, -0.2 (-0.8 to 0.4, p=0.5200) in the random-effects model. The impact on other risk factors is described, but there were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses.Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on BP and BMI. Simultaneous but small impacts on multiple risk factors are likely to be clinically relevant and improve outcome, but there are currently insufficient data in pooled analyses to examine the extent to which simultaneous reduction in multiple risk factors occurs.CRD42016033236.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the mechanisms leading to increased platelet aggregability associated with smoking are only partially defined. A potential role has been hypothesized for immature platelets, a younger and potentially more reactive fraction, previously associated to the main determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the aim of our study was to define the impact of smoking on the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and its relationship with prevalence and extent of coronary artery disease.We enrolled a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis >50%, while severe CAD was defined as left main and/or three-vessel disease. IPF was measured at admission by routine blood cells count (A Sysmex XE-2100).We included in our study 2553 patients, that were divided according smoking status (active smokers: 512; non-active smokers: 2041). Smokers were younger, more frequent males, with lower rate of , previous PCI, previous CABG (p<0.001, respectively) and were in treatment less often with ARB, BB, nitrates, statins, ASA, Clopidogrel, CCB, diuretics (p<0.001, respectively) as compared to non-active smokers. Higher percentage of smokers was observed in patients with higher IPF values, and at multivariate analysis active smoking resulted an independent predictor of higher IPF (adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.59[1.03-2.45] P=0.035). Among smokers, higher IPF were associated to lower ejection fraction (p=0.034), percentage of acute coronary syndrome (p=0.002) and platelet count (p<0.001) compared to ones with lower IPF. However, the IPF (according to quartiles values) were not associated to the prevalence and extent of CAD (82.%, 80.4%, 86.1%, 80.9%, from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively,adjusted OR[95%CI]=0.98[0.79-1.23] P=0.89) and severe CAD (31%, 31.1%, 39.1%, 35.2%,from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively, adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.03[0.86-1.23] P=0.76).The present study shows an independent association between active smoking and the levels of immature platelet fraction in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Ascites (coefficient: 0.059, P = 0.006), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (coefficient: -0.008, P = 0.029),  (coefficient: 0.072, P < 0.001) and high albumin-bilirubin grade (albumin-bilirubin grade 2: coefficient: 0.053, P = 0.004; and albumin-bilirubin grade 3: coefficient: 0.103, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with an elevation in serum creatinine levels after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy. The development of acute kidney injury was associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio: 3.18, 95%CI: 1.411-7.171, P = 0.005). Patients with acute kidney injury had a significantly lower survival rate than patients without acute kidney injury (log-rank test; P = 0.034).The incidence of acute kidney injury after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy was consistent with that after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using anthracycline, and the development of acute kidney injury was associated with poor prognosis. Ascites, , low estimated glomerular filtration rate and high albumin-bilirubin grade were risk factors for serum creatinine elevation after platinum-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial infusion chemotherapy.© The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated associations of low bone mineral density (BMD) at various bone sites with five year all-cause and CVD mortality in ESRD patients.In a post hoc analysis of 426 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 62% men) starting dialysis, BMD (whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), body composition, nutritional status (subjective global assessment, SGA), handgrip strength (%HGS), Framingham CVD risk score (FRS) and biochemical biomarkers of nutrition and inflammation were assessed. We used the Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis to assess survival analysis.In multivariate logistic regression analysis, %HGS and intact parathyroid hormone associated with low tertile of: BMD, BMD and BMD, after adjusting for FRS, SGA, %HGS, s-albumin, hsCRP, lean body mass index and year of recruitment. Patients with high FRS had low BMD (p < 0.001). Low tertile of BMD (sHR, 1.53), BMD (sHR 1.54) and BMD (sHR 1.60) associated with increased all-cause mortality whereas no such associations were found for the trabecular bone rich sites BMD arm, leg, trunk, rib or spine. Low tertile of BMD (sHR 1.94), BMD (sHR 1.68), BMD (sHR 2.25) and BMD (sHR 2.45) associated with increased CVD mortality whereas BMD at other sites did not associate with CVD mortality.Low head and pelvis BMD, and low total BMD, as assessed by whole-body DXA, were independent predictors of increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Cortical BMD appeared to have stronger association to survival in ESRD than trabecular BMD.Copyright © 2019.

However, its ability to reveal individual transmission links within clusters is limited. Here, we used a 2-step approach based on Bayesian transmission reconstruction to (1) identify likely index and missing cases, (2) determine risk factors associated with transmitters, and (3) estimate when transmission happened.We developed our transmission reconstruction method using genomic and epidemiological data from a population-based study from Valencia Region, Spain. Tuberculosis (TB) incidence during the study period was 8.4 cases per 100,000 people. While the study is ongoing, the sampling frame for this work includes notified TB cases between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. We identified a total of 21 transmission clusters that fulfilled the criteria for analysis. These contained a total of 117 individuals diagnosed with active TB (109 with epidemiological data). Demographic characteristics of the study population were as follows: 80/109 (73%) individuals were Spanish-born, 76/109 (70%) individuals were men, and the mean age was 42.51 years (SD 18.46). We found that 66/109 (61%) TB patients were sputum positive at diagnosis, and 10/109 (9%) were HIV positive. We used the data to reveal individual transmission links, and to identify index cases, missing cases, likely transmitters, and associated transmission risk factors. Our Bayesian inference approach suggests that at least 60% of index cases are likely misidentified by local public health. Our data also suggest that factors associated with likely transmitters are different to those of simply being in a transmission cluster, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these 2 phenomena. Our data suggest that type 2  is a risk factor associated with being a transmitter (odds ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.02-1.10], p < 0.003). Finally, we used the most likely timing for transmission events to study when TB transmission occurred; we identified that /14 (35.7%) cases likely transmitted TB well before symptom onset, and these were largely sputum negative at diagnosis. Limited within-cluster diversity does not allow us to extrapolate our findings to the whole TB population in Valencia Region.In this study, we found that index cases are often misidentified, with downstream consequences for epidemiological investigations because likely transmitters can be missed. Our findings regarding inferred transmission timing suggest that TB transmission can occur before patient symptom onset, suggesting also that TB transmits during sub-clinical disease. This result has direct implications for diagnosing TB and reducing transmission. Overall, we show that a transition to individual-based genomic epidemiology will likely close some of the knowledge gaps in TB transmission and may redirect efforts towards cost-effective contact investigations for improved TB control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669079>Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy: An Evidence Analysis Center Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Given the high rates of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women and possible effects on offspring health, a systematic review on this topic was conducted to help inform future practice guidelines.To evaluate associations between maternal vitamin D supplementation, maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, and health outcomes.A PubMed literature search was conducted to identify studies that examined the health effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes published from 2000 to 2016. Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational , preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, .2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35. nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1., -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal insulin resistance and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Data from a randomized clinical trial were combined with a subgroup of participants aged 80 years and older from a second clinical trial. The trials were conducted between April 2013 and May 2018. Final follow-up was May 4, 2018.Participants were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine (n = 112; 52 participants from the first trial and 60 from the second trial) or placebo (n = 139; 53 participants from the first trial and 86 from the second trial).Co-primary outcomes were Thyroid-Related Quality of Life Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) questionnaire scores for the domains of hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness at 1 year (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, 9).Of 251 participants (mean age, 85 years; 118 [47%] women), 105 were included from the first clinical trial and 146 were included from the second clinical trial. A total of 212 participants (84%) completed the study. The hypothyroid symptoms score decreased from 21.7 at baseline to 19.3 at 12 months in the levothyroxine group vs from 19.8 at baseline to 17.4 at 12 months in the placebo group (adjusted between-group difference, 1.3 [95% CI, -2.7 to .2]; P = .53).

However, to date, a limited number of scholars have attempted to systematically elucidate the characteristics of KP-PLA. The aim of the present study was to analyze clinical, microbiological, and molecular epidemiological characteristics of KP-PLA patients in Southeastern China.The KP-PLA cases from a tertiary teaching hospital in China from January 2016 to December 2017 were systemically studied and elucidated comprehensively. The virulence factors, resistant spectrum, and clones of  isolates were identified with string test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antimicrobial susceptibility test, and multilocus sequence typing. Moreover, the characteristics in KP-PLA patients with and without other hepatobiliary diseases (OHD) were also been compared.A total of 163 KP-PLA cases were enrolled, in which the majority of those cases were senior males, and often associated with multiple underlying diseases, including  (49.7%). The remaining cases belonged to healthy individuals (50.3%). The clinical symptoms were common but nonspecific, characterized by increased inflammatory parameters and abnormal liver function parameters. The abscess was often right-sided solitary presentation (58.3%). Cephalosporin or carbapenem plus metronidazole combined with percutaneous puncture or catheter drainage were favorable therapeutics. Although low resistance rates of commonly used antimicrobial drugs (< 10%) were observed, twelve strains were identified as multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, and were mainly isolated from the OHD patients. The hypermucoviscosity, as well as K1 and K2 serotypes accounted for 30.7, 40., and 19.0%, respectively. Except for  (24.%) and  (45.4%), the high prevalence of virulence genes (e.g. , , , , , , , , , and ) was identified (68.7-100.0%). Additionally, ST23 was found as a predominant sequence type (ST; 38.7%), and three novel STs (ST3507, ST3508 and ST3509) were noted as well.The present study reported the abundant hvKp strains in KP-PLA, as well as convergence of hypervirulent and MDR  isolates from the KP-PLA patients, particularly those cases with OHD. Given the various clinical manifestations and destructive pathogenicity, determination of the comprehensive characteristics of such isolates is highly essential to effectively carry out for optimal management and treatment of KP-PLA.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672711>Pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial to determine the effectiveness of bridging from emergency to regular contraception: the Bridge-It study protocol.</a></h2><p>Oral emergency contraception (EC) can prevent unintended pregnancy but it is important to start a regular method of contraception. Women in the UK usually access EC from a pharmacy but then need a subsequent appointment with a general practitioner or a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service to access regular contraception. Unintended pregnancies can occur during this time.Bridge-It is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial designed to determine whether pharmacist provision of a bridging supply of a progestogen-only pill (POP) plus rapid access to a local SRH clinic, results in increased uptake of effective contraception and prevents more unintended pregnancies than provision of EC alone. Bridge-It involves 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (London, Lothian and Tayside) aiming to recruit 626-737 women. Pharmacies will give EC (levonorgestrel) according to normal practice and recruit women to both intervention and the control phases of the study. In the intervention phase, pharmacists will provide the POP (desogestrel) and offer rapid access to an SRH clinic. In the control phase, pharmacists will advise women to attend a contraceptive provider for contraception (standard care).Women will be asked 4 months later about contraceptive use. Data linkage to abortion registries will provide abortion rates over 12 months. The sample size is calculated on the primary outcome of effective contraception use at 4 months (yes/no) with 90% power and a % level of significance. Abortion rates will be an exploratory secondary analysis. Process evaluation includes interviews with pharmacists, SRH clinicians and women. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use a healthcare system perspective and be expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.Ethical approval was received from South East Scotland REC June 2017.

Patients in the HDHP cohort (n = 1490) were matched by propensity scores to a non-HDPH control cohort (n = 1490). Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014.Switching from a non-HDHP in 2013 to a full replacement HDHP in 2014 (no non-HDHP option offered) vs staying on a non-HDHP.Difference-in-differences models estimated discontinuation of branded and generic antihyperglycemic medications.Among the 2980 patients included in the analysis (1932 men [64.8%]; mean [SD] age, HDHP cohort: 52.6 [6.9] years; non-HDHP cohort: 52.7 [7.3] years), no difference between the HDHP and non-HDHP cohorts was found in unadjusted follow-up discontinuation rates for all antihyperglycemic medications (255 [22.7%] vs 255 [23.3%]; P = .72); however, among patients using branded medication, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the HDHP group did not refill branded medications (81 of 396 [20.%] vs 61 of 437 [14.0%]; P = .009). Difference-in-differences models were not statistically significant.These findings suggest switching to an HDHP is associated with discontinuation specifically of branded medications.

Clinical studies have isolated fat within bone and muscle using MRI. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that bone marrow adiposity and muscle adiposity are related, and that this relationship is associated with osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women 60-85 years of age were recruited as part of the Appendicular Muscle and Bone Extension Research Study (AMBERS). Participants completed DXA of the hip and spine to diagnose osteoporosis. Muscle adiposity was measured with MRI at the 66% site of the leg. Fat segmentation was achieved using a semi-automated iterative threshold-optimizing algorithm (error<%). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow fat) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±.9yrs, BMI: 29.±.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle fat was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and . Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis. Fat from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and . More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone fat metabolism and mesenchymal cell commitment to fat within patients with osteoporosis.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. This study was designed to investigate the influences of tanshinone IIA, an active compound extracted from Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the proliferation and migration of human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs). cultured in a high glucose medium and the underlying mechanisms related miRNAs. Using a miRNA microarray method, we profiled the miRNA expression signature in human aortic VSMCs (HASMCs) exposed to normal glucose, high glucose with and without Tanshinone IIA. Cell proliferation was measured with -bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. Cell migration was evaluated using transwell migration assay and wound scratch assay. Western blot was used to examine the expression of tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) and miRNA level was quantified by real-time PCR. The results showed that several miRNAs that were highly expressed in the high glucose group were significantly decreased in the high glucose with Tanshinone IIA group compared with the normal glucose group (P < 0.05). Among these miRNAs, miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in the high glucose group and downregulated after Tanshinone IIA treatment (P < 0.05). The depletion of miR-21-5p in HASMCs resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration (P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that Tanshinone ⅡA inhibited proliferation and migration partly through miR-21-5p-mediated TPM1 downregulation (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Tanshinone IIA is able to protect HASMCs from high glucose-induced proliferation and migration through regulating expression of miRNAs.Copyright © 2019.

Helminth infection has both nutritional and immunological impact on their definitive hosts. Thus, a cross-sectional study was performed to see the effects of OV infection on glucose and lipid profiles. For this purpose, 200 each of OV infected and uninfected residents were recruited and their glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) levels and anthropometric measurements, including BMI were examined. Then, as the prospective follow- up study, changes of those metabolic parameters of OV positive subjects (n = 120) before and after Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment were monitored for six months. The results showed that OV infection has a protective effect against hyperglycemia (OR 0.482 and p = .04) and metabolic disease risk group (OR 0.478 and p = .03). OV positive participants had lower HbA1c (.% Vs. 6.01%, p = .001) but higher HDL (54.07 Vs. 49.46 mg/dL, p = .001) than OV negative participants that are statistically significant. After PZQ treatment for OV-positive subjects, their serum levels of HbA1c (p < .05) and HDL (p < .05) significantly rose during the follow up. Apparently, OV infection lowers HbA1c but increases HDL in definitive human hosts.Copyright © 2019.

Yet, these relationships are based on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults with T2D.Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and para-aminohippuric acid (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) (GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean ± SD age 63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m, and HbA 7.4 ± 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 ± 26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 ± 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion of 11.3 mg (interquartile range .8-17.0). Average M value was .6 ± 2.9 mg/kg ⋅ min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR ( = -0.44,  < 0.01) and FF ( = -0.40,  < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, and HbA. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy.© 2019 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672670>Metabolic Syndrome: A Major Risk Factor for Morbidity & Mortality in Severely Injured Trauma Patients.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with poor patient outcomes. We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of , hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16. vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs  days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs .0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2., 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

This study was carried out to determine some of the possible anti diabetic mechanisms of its action using in vitro cell culturing methods.'s effects on glucose uptake were tested using muscle cells (C2Cl2). Expression of glucose 4 transporters was determined by treating cell lines with plant extract. Total RNA was isolated and using RT-PCR, GLUT 4 expression levels were quantified. Translocation of GLUT 4 was assessed using FITC fluorescence measured by flow cytometry.Treatment of cells with plant extract significantly increased glucose uptake in a concentration dependent manner, with the highest concentration (250 µg/ml) giving 28% increased uptake compared to the negative control. The increase in glucose uptake (2. times more than control) was coupled to increase in GLUT 4 mRNA and subsequently GLUT 4 translocation. Wortmannin expunged the  induced increase in GLUT 4 mRNA and glucose uptake.The results suggest that  aqueous extract increases glucose uptake partly through increasing the GLUT 4 mRNA and translocation potentially acting via the PI-3-K pathway.

The  was induced in 6-7 week-old male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. After 70 days the wounds were created on the back of the rats and then, once a day for 21 days, the dressing containing lanolin ointment, 10% of keratin scaffolds and 1mM of AWL3106 or biphalin was applied. The wounds histology were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The orientation and organization of collagen was analyzed by Masson trichome staining. The number of macrophages, blood vessels and fibroblasts were visualized by CD68, CD34 and vimentin immunoreactivity, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the wound area of AWL3106- and biphalin-treated groups was greatly reduced (up to 47% on the 7 day) in comparison with untreated diabetic groups. The immunohistochemical staining of macrophages demonstrated that AWL3106 and biphalin accelerated inflammatory progression and subsequently decreased persistent inflammation. The histological analysis showed that the structure of tissue in the groups under the study was very similar to the one of wound tissue in N-DM group. The H&E and Masson trichome staining demonstrated that the orientation and organization of collagen as well as the number and shape of blood vessels were better in 3106- and BIF-treated group than in DM group. In conclusion, the obtained data suggested that our hybrid peptides enhanced wound healing, particularly by accelerating the inflammatory phase and promoted the wound closure.

We conducted a 2-year study, enrolling 1788 patients with rheumatic diseases who were treated with glucocorticoid for at least 4 weeks at the Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Interferon-release assays (IGRA) were performed with patient blood samples obtained at baseline. Patient data, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration and dosage of glucocorticoid and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (immunosuppressant) treatment and comorbidities (malignancies, , chronic renal failure, silicosis) were collected. Patients were followed for 2 years to detect the emergence of active tuberculosis (TB).  21.8% (349/1600) of the patients tested positive in IGRA, indicating LTBI. 2-year follow-up showed that 18 (.16%) patients with positive IGRA but only 4 (0.35%) patients with negative IGRA developed active TB ( < .05). SLE patients had the highest activation rate of 2.22 per 100 total recruitment cases/year. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that low BMI(<18.), administration of high dose glucocorticoids (>15 mg daily), and comorbidities that included interstitial lung disease and malignant cancers were significantly associated with LTBI activation.  Our results suggest that screening and preventive therapy of LTBI may be advisable for Chinese rheumatic disease and particularly SLE patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy with dosage above 15 mg prednisone equivalent daily for more than 4 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675725>Endoscopic endonasal cyst fenestration into the sphenoid sinus using the mucosa coupling method for symptomatic Rathke's cleft cyst: a novel method for maintaining cyst drainage to prevent recurrence.</a></h2><p>Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC) is a benign cystic lesion with a relatively high incidence of local recurrence that occasionally requires repeat surgery. To prevent recurrence, simple cyst fenestration and drainage of the cyst contents to the sphenoid sinus is recommended, but it occasionally recurs. The authors postulated that obstruction of fenestration is a main cause of recurrence, and they developed a method, named the "mucosa coupling method (MC method)," that maintains persistent drainage. In this method, the RCC epithelium and the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus are connected, which promotes re-epithelialization between the two epithelia, maintaining persistent drainage. The outcome of this method was compared with that of conventional cyst fenestration.In a consecutive series of 40 patients with RCC, the surgical strategy was changed during the study period: from December 2009 to September 2014 (the conventional period), 24 patients were scheduled to be treated using the conventional fenestration method, whereas from September 2014 to September 2017 (the MC period), 16 patients were scheduled to be treated using the MC method. However, because of an intraoperative CSF leak, the fenestration was closed during surgery in 3 patients in the conventional period and 2 in the MC period; therefore, these  patients were excluded from the analysis. Twenty-one patients treated with the conventional fenestration method (conventional group) and 14 patients treated with the MC method (MC group) were analyzed. All patients regularly underwent MRI after surgery to detect reaccumulation of cyst contents. The rate of reaccumulation with and without reoperation, visual outcomes, endocrinological outcomes, and postoperative complications were compared between these two groups.The median follow-up period in all 35 patients was 48.0 months (range 1-96 months), 54.0 months (range 1-96 months) in the conventional group and 35. months (range 12-51 months) in the MC group. No reaccumulation was detected on MRI in the 14 patients in the MC group, whereas it was noted in 9 (42.9%) of 21 patients in the conventional group, and 2 of these 9 patients required repeat surgery. There were no significant differences in visual and endocrinological outcomes and complications between these two groups.The MC method for RCC is effective for preventing obstruction of cyst fenestration, which contributes to preventing cyst reaccumulation. Furthermore, this method is equivalent to the conventional fenestration method in terms of visual and endocrinological outcomes and the complication rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664610>Design, synthesis, molecular docking and in vitro evaluation of benzothiazole derivatives as 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors.</a></h2><p>11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates cortisol levels mainly in adipose, hepatic and brain tissues. There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 , insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)--((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats. The in vitro results showed that C1 was a better inhibitor of human 11β-HSD1 than CLX. The ex vivo assay results demonstrated that C1 was capable of reducing 11β-HSD1 overexpression in mesenteric adipose tissue. Therefore, C1 was able to decrease the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 better than CLX.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665268>Combinations of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Predictors for Prognoses in Patients with Acute Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>In contemporary heart failure (HF) practice, prognostic value for combinations of cardiac and non-cardiac predictors remains poorly understood. We analyzed combinatorial predictors of outcomes in acute HF patients.This longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients admitted for acute decompensated HF between April 2015 and March 2018 in an urban hospital. The main outcomes are HF readmission within 6 months after discharge or all-cause death. A total of 451 patients with 662 admissions were enrolled and the data including frailty and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed by multivariate and matched cohort analyses.The mean age of patients was 76.8 years. We constructed a Multi-frailty Index (MFI) ranging from 0 to 3 points as a composite of non-cardiac comorbidities and biopsychosocial frailty. In matched cohort of patients with EF ≧50% (HFpEF), MFI ≧1, pulmonary hypertension (peak flow velocity of tricuspid regurgitation ≧2.9 m/s by echocardiography), and pancytopenia at discharge were strong predictors of HF readmission (Odds ratios, 4.33, 2., and 2.86; p = 0.02, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively), and MFI ≧2 was the only predictor for all-cause death. For EF < 40%, age, BNP ≧800 pg/ml, increase in estimated GFR during hospitalization, and lymphocytopenia plus anemia predicted HF readmission (Odds ratios, 1.77, 2.72, 0.73, and 2.89; p = 0.001, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively). In contrast,  was the only specific predictor found in patients over 80 years old.These data identified multi-frailty and pulmonary hypertension or mild pancytopenia as synergistic predictors of HF readmission in HFpEF patients.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

To test whether the difference might be explained by rapid tachyphylaxis in response to elevated concentrations of GIP, and whether patients with type 2  and their relatives are more susceptible to tachyphylaxis than healthy subjects.In a two-way crossover design, insulinotropic responses to repeated bolus injection (50 pmol/kg body weight at 30 and 120 min) and continuous infusion of GIP (2 pmol.kg-1.min-1 from 30-180 min) under hyperglycaemic clamp conditions (8. mmol/l) was compared in age- gender- and weight-matched patients with type 2 , first degree relatives of such patients, and healthy subjects.Insulin secretory responses to the first and second GIP bolus were not significantly different in any of the subject groups. Subjects with type 2  had a significant relative impairment versus healthy subjects with continuous (C-peptide, -13.2 %, p < 0.05), but not with repeated bolus administration of GIP (+11.1 %, n.s.). First-degree relatives tended to hyper-secrete insulin with bolus or continuous administrations of GIP.Rapid tachyphylaxis in response to continuous exposure to slightly supraphysiological concentrations of GIP does not explain the reduced insulinotropic response to GIP infusions in patients with type 2  or their first-degree relatives.Copyright © 2019.

Bishkhapra (Trianthema portulacastrum Linn.) is a well-known common weed belonging to the family Aizoaceae. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated from this weed and widely used against several diseases. The present study evaluated the protective and therapeutic efficacies of T. portulacastrum against atherosclerosis in a rat model. The animals were divided into the sham, control (- + atherosclerosis-inducing diet), 100 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum treatment, and positive control groups. Blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and other lipid parameters, as well as the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), were measured. Glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced to near normal levels. The serum levels of fibrinogen, sVCAM-1, and oxidized low density lipoproteins were substantially increased in control rats. Treatment with the T. portulacastrum extract reversed these levels to near normal levels. The mRNA expression of GPR124 was increased by 150% in the control group. However, treatment with T. portulacastrum extract decreased the mRNA expression up to 40% compared with the control group. Rats treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg T. portulacastrum extract showed a decrease in GPR124 protein expression by 9.% and 33.3%, respectively.

The location, size and number of the polyps were recorded during the colonoscopy. Statistically, t-test was conducted for mean comparison for the groups. Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was applied to categorize variables. Five classification methods based on the important clinicopathological characteristics such as age, BMI, , family history of colon cancer was performed to predict the results of colonoscopy.Overall, 693 patients participated in this study. In the present study, 115 and 515 patients were evaluated for adenoma/adenocarcinoma and normal colonoscopy, respectively. The mean age of patients positive for adenoma or adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than the negative groups (p value < 0.001). Incidence of overweight and/or obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2) were significantly higher in adenoma positive patients as compared to controls (49.9 and 0.9% respectively, p value = 0.04).

Primary outcome was disease remission after drug withdrawal or surgery. Secondary outcomes were biochemical control and side effects during dopamine agonist treatment and postoperative complications. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled proportions. Robustness of results was assessed by sensitivity analyses.A total of 1469 articles were screened: 55 (10 low risk of bias) on medical treatment (n=3564 patients) and 25 (12 low risk of bias) on transsphenoidal surgery (n=1836 patients). Long-term disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal was 34% (95%CI 26-46%) and 67% (95% CI 60-74%) after surgery. Subgroup analysis of microprolactinomas showed 36% (95% CI 21-52%) disease remission after dopamine agonist withdrawal and 83% (95% CI 76-90%) after surgery. Biochemical control was achieved in 81% (95% CI 75-87%) of patients during dopamine agonists with side effects in 26% (95%CI 13-41%). Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in 0% mortality, 2% (95% CI 0-%) permanent , and 3% (95% CI 2-%) cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Multiple sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.In the majority of prolactinoma patients disease remission can be achieved through surgery, with low risks of long-term surgical complications, and disease remission is less often achieved with dopamine agonists.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662880>A mHealth Support Program for Australian Young Adults with Type 1 : A Mixed Methods Study.</a></h2><p>Young adulthood is a life stage comprised of many turning points.

This paper presents the findings, according to the STROBE guidelines, on the usability and acceptability of a patient-informed mHealth support program ( YES) that was developed for young adults with T1DM.A total of 34 young adults aged 18-35 years with T1DM participated in the  YES program over 12 weeks. Google analytics was used to tracked website use, while a website usability survey measured ease of use. Facebook analytics was used to measure peer support engagement. Evaluation of the program was completed using Likert scales and open-ended questions.Participants rated the website favourably for its ease of navigation and easy to understand information. Web page visits declined sharply while peer support group engagement through Facebook remained consistent throughout the intervention period. Participants utilised weekly discussion topics to generate conversation within the peer support group. Emotional support from peers was the highest regarded benefit reported by participants. YES is an example of an mHealth support program that was readily accepted by young adults living with T1DM. Feasibility studies are an important formative step in the implementation of mHealth programs within mainstream healthcare. Future work should focus on the adaptability of such programs to fit within larger consumer or healthcare organisations.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659023>Natural human genetic variation determines basal and inducible expression of , an obesity-associated gene.</a></h2><p>PM20D1 is a candidate thermogenic enzyme in mouse fat, with its expression cold-induced and enriched in brown versus white adipocytes. Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2. kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672503>Adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence to guideline recommended medical therapies in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic critical limb ischemia (CCLI).We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1315 admissions performed in our Department, focusing on diabetic foot patients (842 - 64%) of which 603 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients with CCLI (M/F(%): 73/27; age: 70.3±10.4 yrs;  duration: 17.3±13.7 yrs; BMI: 27.7±.3 Kg/m; HbA1c 7.8±1.8%) referred to a third-level Center from 2011 to 2015. We focused on medical therapy of , dyslipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and smoke habits.In total, at admission, 66.6% of patients had HbA1c levels higher than recommended; 65.9% of patients were on statins; 81.4 % on anti-hypertensive treatment and 72.4% on antiplatelet drugs. Concerning smoke habits, 27% of patients were no-smokers; 41% former smokers and 32% active smokers. Among all patients, only 24% were prescribed all five guideline recommended therapies while 32% reached four out of five of these. As for patients treated with anti-hypertensive drugs, we observed higher levels of systolic pressure (138.0±29. vs 107.7±36.6 p<0.02) while no differences were observed in diastolic pressure levels.In conclusion, when it comes to diabetic patients with a severe limb and life threatening clinical condition, we noticed a lower-than-expected application of international guideline-recommended medical therapies. In fact, only one out of four patients was following all the recommended therapies. Nevertheless, these patients did not reach the standard targets requested to prevent cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2019.

However, there are no data available on reverse remodelling after TAVI assessed by CT. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the predictors and the prognostic value of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following TAVI using CT angiography.We investigated 117 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent CT scanning before and after TAVI procedure with a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years after TAVI. We found a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) and LVM indexed to body surface area comparing pre- vs. post-TAVI images: 180. ± 53.0 vs. 137.1 ± 44.8 g and 99.7 ± 25.4 vs. 75.4 ± 19.9 g/m2, respectively, both P < 0.001. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) was detected in 25.6% (30/117) patients. More than 20% reduction in LVM was defined as reverse remodelling and was detected in 62.4% (73/117) of the patients. SLT, change in mean pressure gradient on echocardiography and prior myocardial infarction was independently associated with LV reverse remodelling after adjusting for age, gender, and traditional risk factors (hypertension, body mass index, , and hyperlipidaemia): OR = 0.27, P = 0.022 for SLT and OR = 0.22, P = 0.006 for prior myocardial infarction, OR = 1.51, P = 0.004 for 10 mmHg change in mean pressure gradient. Reverse remodelling was independently associated with favourable outcomes (HR = 0.23; P = 0.019).TAVI resulted in a significant LVM regression on CT. The presence of SLT showed an inverse association with LV reverse remodelling and thus it may hinder the beneficial LV structural changes. Reverse remodelling was associated with improved long-term prognosis.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

Other diabetic end-organ complications include peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy (together termed triopathy). This study determines the prevalence of diabetic complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy) in diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp, assessing the differences between T1DM and T2DM and delayed and normal gastric emptying (GE).Diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp underwent history and physical examination, GE scintigraphy, electrogastrography with water load, autonomic function testing, and questionnaires assessing symptoms and peripheral neuropathy.One hundred thirty-three diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp were studied: 59 with T1DM and 74 with T2DM and 103 with delayed GE and 30 without delayed GE. The presence of retinopathy (37% vs 24%; P = 0.13), nephropathy (19% vs 11%; P = 0.22), and peripheral neuropathy (53% vs 39%; P = 0.16) was not significantly higher in T1DM than in T2DM; however, triopathies (all 3 complications together) were seen in 10% of T1DM and 3% of T2DM (P = 0.04). Diabetic patients with delayed GE had increased prevalence of retinopathy (36% vs 10%; P = 0.006) and number of diabetic complications (1.0 vs 0.; P = 0.009); however, 39% of diabetic patients with delayed GE did not have any diabetic complications.In diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp, delayed GE was associated with the presence of retinopathy and the total number of diabetic complications. Only 10% of patients with T1DM and 3% of those with T2DM had triopathy of complications, and 39% of diabetic patients with Gp did not have any diabetic complications. Thus, the presence of diabetic complications should raise awareness for Gp in either T1DM or T2DM; however, diabetic Gp frequently occurs without other diabetic complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664405>[Potential drug interactions in adults and the elderly in primary health care].</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to characterize the potential drug interactions (PDI), estimating the factors associated to their occurrence in adults and the elderly assisted by the Programa Médico de Família de Niterói, Rio de Janeiro.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has previously been shown to improve transplant eligibility through weight loss.We aimed to examine the role LSG plays in improving patient outcomes postrenal transplantation, including possible impact on new-onset  after transplant (NODAT).University Hospital.A single-center analysis was performed identifying all patients who underwent KT after LSG from 2011 to 2017 (n = 41). Exclusion criteria included type I  and previous pancreas transplantation. NODAT was defined as a new insulin requirement after KT. Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis within the first week after KT. Mean posttransplant follow-up period was 22 months.Forty-one patients underwent KT after LSG after median time of 16 months. Median age of postLSG patients undergoing KT was 56.0 years at time of KT. Average body mass index decreased by 9 from the time of LSG to KT, and no patients regained weight at 1-year follow-up. After LSG, the number of patients with hypertension (85.4% versus 48.%) and the number of antihypertensive medications used decreased significantly (1.6 versus .6) at time of KT (P < .001 each). At 1-year follow-up, the improvement in hypertension persisted (51.2% versus 48.%, P = nonsignificant). The average insulin regimen decreased from 33.0 ± 51.6 to 11.7 ± 21. units at KT (P < .001). This improvement also persisted at 1-year follow-up (11.9 versus 11.7 units, P = nonsignificant). Zero patients suffered NODAT over the follow-up period (versus institutional rate of NODAT at 15.8%). One patient developed delayed graft function (2.4%, versus institutional rate of 13.3%). After 1 year postKT, there was 1 graft loss (2.4%) and no mortality.This is the largest reported series of KT after planned LSG in morbidly obese patients.

Finerenone is a novel, nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that has shown to reduce albuminuria in type 2  (T2D) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) while revealing only a low risk of hyperkalemia. However, the effect of finerenone on CV and renal outcomes has not yet been investigated in long-term trials.The Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important CV and renal outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIGARO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 6 years. FIGARO-DKD randomized 7,437 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.FIGARO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of CV and renal events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.EudraCT number: 2015-000950-39; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .© 2019 S.

However,  stigma has not been studied in low and middle-income countries where clinical practices differ,  awareness is lower, and families face different challenges for supporting children with Type 1  (T1D). This study assessed the relationship between parental depression and  stigma with a child's glycemic control in a clinic-based survey in Nagpur, India. The association between self-reported T1D stigma, depressive symptoms, and child's measured glycemic control (HbA1C) was assessed with data from 165 of the parents of school-aged (aged +) children receiving clinical T1D care at an urban nonprofit organization that provides free clinical care to children with Type-1  (T1D) in India. Parents with moderate/severe depressive symptoms who experience stigma associated with their child's  had children with significantly worse glycemic control than parents with no/mild depressive symptoms who experience the same amount of stigma. Higher reports of stigma were associated with an average of 0.65 points higher HbA1C (β = 0.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.18, 1.13) for parents with moderate/severe than parents with mild/no depressive symptoms.

In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± 2.7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12. ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.2% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Since observational studies indicated that SGTF may also increase symptoms of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the CATS cohort was used to investigate whether treatment of mothers affected their children's behavior.Mothers (N=475) completed 3 questionnaires, strengths and difficulties (SDQ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and social communication (SCQ, used as a screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)), about their children (aged 9. years). Group comparisons of total scores, numbers of children above clinical thresholds and association between high maternal FT4 (>97.5th percentile of the UK cohort, 'over-treated') and child neurodevelopment were reported.There were no differences in total scores between normal-GTF (n=246), treated (n=125) and untreated (n=104) SGTF groups. More children of treated mothers scored above clinical thresholds, particularly the over-treated. Scores were above thresholds in SDQ conduct 22% vs 7%, SCQ total scores 7% vs 1%, and ADHD hyperactivity 17% vs % when comparing over-treated (n=40) and untreated (N=100) respectively. We identified significantly higher mean scores for SDQ conduct (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.021 to 1.431, P=0.040, effect size 0.018) and ADHD hyperactivity (AMD 1.60, CI 0.361 to 2.633, P=0.003, effect size 0.028) comparing over-treated with normal-GTF children.There was no overall association between SGTF and offspring ADHD, ASD or behavior questionnaire scores. However, children of 'over-treated' mothers displayed significantly more ADHD symptoms and behavioral difficulties than normal-GTF.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, several telemedicine projects and studies focused on type 1 and type 2 . Over the last  years, numerous telemedicine projects based on connected objects and new information and communication technologies (ICT) (elements defining telemedicine 2.0) have emerged or are still under development. Two examples are the DIABETe and Telesage telemonitoring project which perfectly fits within the telemedicine 2.0 framework - the first to include artificial intelligence (AI) with MyPredi and Diabeo. Mainly, these projects and studies show that telemonitoring diabetic result in: improvements in control of blood glucose (BG) level and significant reduction in HbA1c (e.g., for Telescot et TELESAGE studies); positive impact on co-morbidities (arterial hypertension, weight, dyslipidemia) (e.g., for Telescot and DIABETe studies); better patient's quality of life (e.g., for DIABETe study); positive impact on appropriation of the disease by patients and/or greater adherence to therapeutic and hygiene-dietary measures (e.g., The Utah Remote Monitoring Project); and at least, good receptiveness by patients and their empowerment. To date, the magnitude of its effects remains debatable, especially with the variation in patients' characteristics (e.g., background, ability for self-management, medical condition), samples selection and approach for the treatment of control groups.

The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International  Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = .83), WHtR (OR = .70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = .65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27.2 kg/m. The weakest predictor of the syndrome was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR. The optimal cut-off points for WHtR equaled 0.56 in men and 0.54 in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670263>The neuroimaging features of Rathke's cleft cysts in children with endocrine-related diseases.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the frequency and neuroimaging features of Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) in children examined for endocrine-related diseases and to determine changes in the neuroimaging features of RCCs during the follow-up of children. We hypothesize that RCCs are being more commonly diagnosed in children with endocrine-related diseases and most of the RCCs show neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).After approval by the local ethics committee, the medical records and contrast-enhanced pituitary MRI of 833 children (boys/girls, 338/495; mean age±SD, 9.4±3.7 years) were retrospectively reviewed between January 2016 and January 2019. The size, location, signal intensities, and postcontrast enhancement pattern of RCCs were assessed by a pediatric radiologist. Same imaging features were also independently reviewed by another radiologist to determine the interobserver agreement by using the kappa statistics (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RCC was evident on MRI in 13.% of the patients (boys/girls, 39/74; mean age±SD, 9.8±3.9 years). The mean size of RCCs was . mm (range, 3.1-8. mm). An RCC frequency higher than expected was found in patients with central precocious puberty, , and hypersecretion of prolactin (P = 0.007). The mean size of RCCs did not show significant differences among the clinical indications for MRI (P ≥ 0.461). All RCCs showed abnormal signal on T2-weighted image and most (89%) showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content (i.e., isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging compared with the normal anterior pituitary gland). Eighty-four patients with RCCs (74%) had follow-up MRI and the mean follow-up was 1. years. In follow-ups, five RCCs disappeared; the mean size of 10 RCCs increased and that of 6 RCCs decreased. These size changes were not statistically significant (P = 0.376). No signal intensity changes of RCCs were seen during the follow-up, except for 4 RCCs, whose protein content increased over time and T1 signals increased on imaging. Interobserver agreements were almost perfect for the MRI findings of RCCs (κ and ICC range, 0.81-1, P < 0.001).RCCs were not uncommon in patients examined for endocrine-related diseases, and nearly 1 in 10 patients had an RCC. The size and signal intensities of RCCs may change over time and the evolution of RCCs is unpredictable. Most RCCs showed neither fluid intensity nor intensity due to high protein content on MRI, and all RCCs had an abnormal signal on T2-weighted imaging, thus eliminating the need to administer a contrast agent at follow-up imaging of the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666549> status affects long-term changes in coronal caries - The SHIP Study.</a></h2><p>We estimated effects of  and metabolic control on long-term change in coronal caries and restorative status using 11-year-follow-up data from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. Data of 3731 participants with baseline and - and 11-year follow-up information were included.  was defined via self-reported physician´s diagnosis or intake of glucose-lowering drugs or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.% or fasting blood glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/l. The  status was defined as no  (HbA1c < 6.% or non-fasting blood glucose <11.1 mmol/l), subjects with known or undetected  and HbA1c ≤ 7% (well-controlled ), and subjects with known or undetected  and HbA1c > 7% (poorly-controlled ). The caries status was clinically assessed using the half-mouth method and the Decayed Missing Filled Surfaces (DMFS) index and its component scores were determined. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed models were evaluated. Rates in change in DMFS were significantly higher in subjects with poorly-controlled  compared to subjects without . Subjects with poorly- and well-controlled  had significantly higher rates in change in Missing Surfaces (MS) compared to subjects without . For the DFS, rates in change were significantly lower for subjects with well-controlled  and higher for subjects with poorly-controlled  as compared to subjects without . Concordantly, all rates in change increased proportional to HbA1c levels. Effects were even more pronounced in subjects with  duration of ≥ years. Subjects with poorly-controlled  are at higher risk for caries progression compared to subjects without , especially in case of longer disease duration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672925>Influence of Educational Level on Psychosocial Correlates and Perceived Environmental Correlates of Physical Activity in Adults at Risk for Type 2 : The Feel4Diabetes-Study.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and physical activity (PA) in adults at risk for type 2  is influenced by educational level.Based on the Finnish  Risk Score questionnaire, this study selected 164 adults (Mage: 38 (.34) y, 13.4% men) at type 2  risk from 11 low socioeconomic neighborhoods in Flanders (Belgium). Participants filled out questionnaires on psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for  consecutive days. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance in SPSS.Educational level significantly influenced the association between perception of body weight and light PA (P = .01) and total PA (P = .03) on weekend days. Educational level did not influence the associations between other psychosocial and perceived environmental factors (ie, perceived social influence; environmental, time and attitudinal barriers, perceived self-efficacy; knowledge and fatalism) and PA.Educational level did not influence the relationship between most psychosocial and perceived environmental factors and PA in this sample of adults at type 2  risk. This suggests that addressing different psychosocial and perceived environmental correlates in lower and higher educated participants might not be necessary. However, more research in this specific population is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665267>Cost-utility analysis of lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2  in women with prior gestational .</a></h2><p>To compare estimated costs and health outcomes of lifestyle interventions for the prevention of type 2  in women who had gestational .An age-specific Markov model was applied comparing costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of three alternatives: 'doing nothing'; an annual reminder system (ARS) with an awareness campaign ('ARS-awareness'); and an ARS with an intensive lifestyle intervention ('ARS-ILS'). A healthcare payer perspective was adopted, the time horizon was 30 years and the setting was Flanders (Belgium). Sensitivity analyses were performed.'ARS-awareness' was extendedly dominated. Per 10 000 participants, 'ARS-ILS' cost €13 210 256 more and gained 496 QALYs compared with 'doing nothing' (26 632 €/QALY), with a 63% probability of being cost effective, given a cost effectiveness threshold of 35 000 €/QALY. A scenario analysis showed that 'ARS-ILS' for 15 years only offered to women with prediabetes (compared with 'doing nothing') has an 89.% likelihood of being dominant.'ARS-ILS' may be the preferred intervention. However, the probability of being cost effective was low. Based on further scenario analyses, we recommend healthcare decision makers to consider the application of a more intensive alternative, focused on the highest risk profiles and with a shorter intervention duration.© The Author(s) 2019.

Using a large data base of patients who underwent coronary angiography for clinical reasons, we evaluated the association between reported degree of coronary calcification with mortality and baseline risk factors.Using angiographic data of 1917 patients from 1993 to 1997, we studied any association between the locations of coronary calcium that were seen during coronary angiography with coronary artery risk factors. Furthermore, we correlated the locations of calcium with all cause mortality.A total of 1917 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization from 1993 to 1997 were studied. Total mortality was 22.9%. There was no association between the classic coronary risk factors (history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking,  and family history) or race (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian) with the occurrence of angiographic visible calcium in any location. Furthermore, we did not find any association between the locations of coronary calcium with all cause mortality. (All cause mortality occurred in 21.8 % of patients with left main calcification vs. 23.3 %, p=0.63, in 24.6% of patients with left anterior descending artery calcification vs. 22.7%, p=0.48, in 25.6% of patients with circumflex calcification vs. 23.1%, p=0.52, in 25.7% of right coronary calcification vs. 22.7%, p=0.47, in 24.6 of any coronary calcification vs. 22.%, p=0.4 ).Race, coronary risk factors, and all cause mortality are not associated with angiographic documented coronary calcification in any location in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671762>Impact of  Perceptions on Medication Adherence in Japan.</a></h2><p>: Patients' perception of  is one of the psychosocial factors influencing diabetic behavior. This patients' perception of the disease is a mental image formed from the experience of patients with type 2  and reportedly reflects the aspect of recuperation. We investigated the relationship between changes in the patients' perception of the disease and medication adherence, as influenced by the active involvement of community pharmacists. : A prospective cohort study that used patient registry based in community pharmacies was conducted in patients with type 2  using oral antidiabetic agents at a pharmacy in Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan. Patients responded to the questionnaire at the time of enrollment and at the end of the one-year intervention period. The pharmacist confirmed the patient's medication status and treatment problems via telephone calls at least once every two weeks for one year. Main outcome measures: Type 2  patients' perception of the disease related to medication adherence. : The study enrolled 113 patients. Among the seven  image factors, "Living an orderly life" and "Feeling of fear" were significantly associated with medication adherence. "Feeling of neglect of health" was significantly associated at the subscale level. : All the three factors related to medication adherence indicated self-care ability. To enhance the self-care ability of the patient, pharmacists should assist in self-care interventions for the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664390>[Alcohol consumption patterns and associated factors among elderly Brazilians: National Health Survey (2013)].</a></h2><p>The scope of this study was to analyze the pattern of alcohol consumption among elderly Brazilians (60 years and over) and their association with sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits and health conditions. This is a cross-sectional study of 10,537 elderly (90.1%) participants from the National Health Survey of 2013. The consumption of alcoholic beverages was classified as non-use, mild / moderate use and risk use. The multinomial regression model was used to study the associated factors. The prevalence for mild / moderate and risk use was 9.4% (95% CI: 8.4- 10.6%) and 4.6% (95%CI: 4.0-.3%), respectively. The two consumption patterns were inversely associated with age and more frequent among men, better schooling, smokers and physical activity practitioners. Mild / moderate consumption was less frequent among non-whites and those with a history of stroke and , whereas risk use was less frequent among the elderly diagnosed for heart disease and more frequent among those suffering from depression. This result identifies profiles of greater vulnerability, with small differences between two patterns of consumption. This information should be considered in the preparation of proposals to promote healthy habits and control of alcohol use among the elderly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668390>Rfx6 promotes the differentiation of peptide-secreting enteroendocrine cells while repressing genetic programs controlling serotonin production.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastro-intestinal tract sense gut luminal factors and release peptide hormones or serotonin (-HT) to coordinate energy uptake and storage. Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley syndrome, characterized by neonatal  and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function; however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.We examined the molecular, cellular, and metabolic consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.Rfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later, it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal -HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, the differentiation programs of which are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1-, or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.These studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley syndrome.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, little is known about the potential combined relationships of time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with indices of cognitive health. We examined the cross-sectional associations of objectively-determined sedentary and physically-active behaviors with an indicator of cognitive function decline (CFD) in older adults.A randomly-recruited sample of 511 Japanese older adults (47% male; aged 65-84 years) wore a tri-axial accelerometer (HJA-750C, Omron) for seven consecutive days in 2017. Cognitive function was assessed by interviewers using the Japanese version of Mini-Mental State Examination, with a score of ≤23 indicating CFD. Associations of sedentary and physically-active behaviors with CFD were examined using a compositional logistic regression analysis based on isometric log-ratio transformations of time use, adjusting for potential confounders.Forty one (9.4%) of the participants had an indication of CFD. Activity compositions differed significantly between CFD and normal cognitive function (NCF); the proportion of time spent in MVPA was 39.1% lower, relatively to the overall mean composition in those with CFD, and was .3% higher in those with NCF. There was a significant beneficial association of having a higher proportion of MVPA relative to other activities with CFD. LPA and SB were not associated with CFD when models were corrected for time spent in all activity behaviors.Larger relative contribution of MVPA was favorably associated with an indicator of CFD in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670535>Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire: Assessing patient perceptions regarding their adherence to medical treatment plans.</a></h2><p>The Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire (TAPQ) is a new, brief self-report instrument for assessing patient perceptions and attitudes regarding their own adherence to medical treatment plans. It includes 3 distinct scales: Perceived Behavior, Perceived Benefit, and Perceived Burden. In contrast with existing measures, the TAPQ was expected to have a clear factor structure; have good discrimination; and assess distinct types of perception, each of which has different patterns of association with interpersonal, personality, motivational, and emotional variables. Foundational work on the TAPQ (with 891 patients) included  quantitative scale development studies and 1 qualitative study. The present report focuses on results from a final validation study using 450 patients recruited via market research panels to complete online questionnaires. This study included a general medical sample and a sample of people with either  or hypertension. A confirmatory factor analysis specifying strict measurement invariance across these groups produced a good fit. Analysis with item-response theory suggested that the scales on the TAPQ provide good discrimination across a wide range of experience levels. The 3 scales on the TAPQ each had distinct patterns of association with criterion variables regarding conscientiousness, health behavior, motivation, affect, type of diagnosis, and interpersonal communication with health-care professionals. These effects could not be explained by another existing measure of adherence or by a measure of response bias.

A total of 6,199,629 subjects not diagnosed with AF who underwent health check-up in 2009 were included from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Risk of AF was compared among subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG), subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), patients with  duration < years (early  [DM]), and patients with  duration ≥ years (late DM). Next, risk of AF stratified by fasting glucose level per 10 mg/dL was assessed. During a mean follow-up of 7.2 years, the risk of AF significantly increased across the time course of type 2  (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.05 for IFG; aHR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.08 for early DM; aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.11 for late DM). The risk of AF was significantly higher in subjects who progressed to type 2  in the IFG group. Risk of AF increased with a 10 mg/dL increment of fasting blood glucose (p-for-trend <0.0001). However, there was a U-shape relationship between fasting blood glucose and risk of AF in those who received antidiabetic medication. In conclusion, the risk of AF increased with the time course of type 2 . However, low blood glucose in antidiabetic medication user was associated with an increased risk of AF.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

CD results from the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic susceptibility is believed to play a prominent role in the pathogenicity of CD, mainly due to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related class II genes. Although CD is well-recognized among Arab populations, there are few studies on the genetic epidemiology and prevalence of CD in the Arab countries. Therefore, in this review, we aim to highlight the importance of studying this disease in the Arab world in the context of a global perspective. Within the few studies published so far, we found that Arab populations have a distinctive susceptibility genetic profile from other ethnic groups with the DQ2. and DQ8 genotypes that are considered the major genotypes that confer susceptibility among Arab patients with CD. Our findings will pave the way to perform further epidemiological studies that will help identify potential therapeutic targets against CD among Arab patients that are diagnosed with CD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661941>New Molecular Insights into the Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 by Natural Cyclic Peptide Oxytocin.</a></h2><p>Protease inhibition has led to treating many diseases and has been successful in producing many commercial drugs by pharmaceutical companies. Among many proteases, serine protease has been attractive in treating metabolic disorder  (DM). Gliptins have been proven to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), a serine protease, and are an emerging therapeutic drug target to reduce blood glucose levels, but until now there is no natural cyclic peptide proven to inhibit serine protease DPP4. This study demonstrates the potential mechanism of natural cyclic peptide oxytocin (OXT) as a DPP4 inhibitor. To achieve this, initially, activity atlas and field-based models of DPP4 inhibitors were utilized to predict the possible features of positive and negative electrostatic, hydrophobic, and activity shapes of DPP4 inhibition. Oxytocin binding mode, flexibility, and interacting residues were studied using molecular docking simulations studies. 3D-RISM calculations studies revealed that the stability of water molecules at the binding site are favorable. Finally, an experimental study using fluorescence assay revealed OXT inhibits DPP4 in a concentration-dependent manner in a significant way ( < 0.05) and possess IC of 110.7 nM. These new findings significantly expand the pharmaceutical application of cyclic peptides, and in specific OXT, and implicate further optimization of OXT inhibition capacity to understand the effect of DPP4 inhibition. This work highlights the development of natural cyclic peptides as future therapeutic peptides to reduce glucose levels and treat .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669312>Follow-up of infants born to mothers with autoinmune thyroid disease. What should not be screened?</a></h2><p>Thyroid dysfunction is a common problem in pregnant women. It is usually of an autoimmune origin, with Hashimotós thyroiditis and Graveś disease being the most common conditions. Although hormonal changes and transplacental antibody transfer may occur, specific neonatal screening has not been shown to be useful.A prospective study of newborns of women with autoimmune thyroid disease born at a level III university hospital (November 2013-December 2016). Neonates were selected during their stay at the maternity. Babies with perinatal asphyxia were excluded. Data were collected from the clinical histories of mothers and newborns.A total of 191 neonates were included. Ninety percent of mothers had been diagnosed with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Only .8% of newborns had some laboratory disorder, consisting of slightly increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, which returned to normal at the age of one month and did not correlate to thyroid peroxidase antibody levels. Transient hyperthyrotropinemia was diagnosed in one newborn and required thyroxin treatment during the first year of life. Among newborns from mothers with Graveś disease, 36.8% had some abnormal laboratory value during the first 7 days of life, but there were no cases of hyperthyroidism and only one of transient hyperthyrotropinemia.Experience at our hospital in screening of newborns from hypothyroid mothers reveals a high number of laboratory controls with a poor diagnostic yield. No relationship was found between thyroid peroxidase antibody levels and thyroid dysfunction. We support the recommendations to continue testing serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and FT4 levels at 48h of life in newborns of mothers with autoimmune hypothyroidism.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED.

Each material has detrimental effects on human health, but a number of experimental and clinical studies have shown a strong impact for fine particulate matter (PM2.). In particular, there is more and more evidence that PM2. exerts adverse effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, contributing substantially -- mainly through mechanisms of atherosclerosis, thrombosis and inflammation -- to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, but also to heart failure, hypertension,  and cardiac arrhythmias. In this review, we summarize knowledge on the mechanisms and magnitude of the cardiovascular adverse effects of short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly for the PM2. size fraction. We also emphasize that very recent data indicate that the global mortality and morbidity burden of cardiovascular disease associated with this air pollutant is dramatically greater than appreciated until now.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656490>An audit of surgical site infection following open prostatectomy in a Nigerian Teaching Hospital.</a></h2><p>Surgical site infections (SSI) are a potential cause of morbidity and increased cost of care after operations such as open prostatectomy.To audit the occurrence of SSI after open prostatectomy at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, Nigeria.A review of all patients who underwent open prostatectomy over a ten-year period (July 2005 to June 2015). Data analysis was done using the statistical package for social sciences version 21. Association between variables was determined using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 247 open prostatectomy surgeries were reviewed, with the patients' ages ranging from 43 - 91 years and a mean age of 67.0 ± 8.8 years. Elective procedures were 98.8% while the remaining 1.2% were emergency cases. There were 24 (9.8%) surgical site infections. The duration of admission of the patients with SSI ranged from 6 - 15 days with a mean of 9. ± 3.2 days, as against 4 - 9 days (mean of .0 ± 2.1days) for those without SSI. All the patients with SSI were successfully managed with no resultant mortality. Risk factors identified for SSI were emergency surgery (p=0.001), obesity (p<0.0001),  (p=0.008), smoking (p<0.0001), pre-operative catheterization (p<0.0001), excessive haemorrhage (p<0.0001) and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage (p<0.0001).SSI is a recognized complication of open prostatectomy. Identified risk factors for its occurrence from this audit are emergency operation, obesity, , smoking, pre-operative catheterization, excessive haemorrhage and post-operative suprapubic bladder drainage. Age, approach to prostatectomy (retropubic vs transvesical), incision type (lower midline vs pfannenstiel), level of the surgeon, catheter type and modality of irrigation were however not significant risk factors for post-prostatectomy SSI in this study.© 2019 Salako et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669066>Validation of a protein biomarker test for predicting renal decline in type 2 : The Fremantle  Study Phase II.</a></h2><p>To validate the prognostic utility of a novel plasma biomarker panel, PromarkerD, for predicting renal decline in an independent cohort of people with type 2 .Models for predicting rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline defined as i) incident diabetic kidney disease (DKD), ii) eGFR decline ≥30% over four years, and iii) annual eGFR decline ≥ mL/min/1.73 m were applied to 447 participants from the longitudinal observational Fremantle  Study Phase II.

Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = ) (Pilot study 1), b) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against obesity and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the effect of GH on the expression of lipolytic regulators in adipose tissue (AT).In a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, nine men were examined after injection of 1) a GH bolus and 2) a GH-receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) followed by four AT biopsies. In a second study, eight men were examined in a 2 × 2 factorial design including GH infusion and 36-h fasting with AT biopsies obtained during a basal period and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Expression of GH-signaling intermediates and lipolytic regulators were studied by PCR and western blotting. In addition, mechanistic experiments in mouse models and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were performed.The GH bolus increased circulating free fatty acids (p < 0.0001) together with phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription  (STAT5) (p < 0.0001) and mRNA expression of the STAT5-dependent genes cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) and IGF-1 in AT. This was accompanied by suppressed mRNA expression of G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) (p = 0.007) and fat specific protein 27 (FSP27) (p = 0.002) and upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA expression (p = 0.03). Suppression of G0S2 was also observed in humans after GH infusion and fasting, as well as in GH transgene mice, and in vitro studies suggested MEK-PPARγ signaling to be involved.GH-induced lipolysis in human subjects in vivo is linked to downregulation of G0S2 and FSP27 and upregulation of PTEN in AT.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between BPA and  is from cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies with single urinary measurements. No prospective study has examined exposure to BPA analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) in relation to incident type 2 .We aimed to investigate whether exposure to BPA and BPS, assessed at up to two time points, was associated with the incidence of type 2 .We performed a case-cohort study on 755 participants without  at baseline and followed-up over 9 y as part of the French prospective cohort Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.). BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G) and BPS-glucuronide (BPS-G) were assessed in fasting spot urine samples collected during the health examinations at baseline and 3 y later. Associations with incident  were examined using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 201 incident cases of type 2  were diagnosed over the follow-up, including 30 in the subcohort. Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 , with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, .65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, .15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively.

Participants were classified as having normoglycemia, borderline glycemia, or  (DM) with prior CAD (CAD+) or without prior CAD (CAD-). Cox regression model identified variables related to the incidence of CAD.Among CAD-, management of traditional risks differed from those with and without subsequent CAD events. On the other hand, such differences were weaker in borderline glycemia and DM CAD+, and the influence of traditional risk factors on subsequent CAD was not observed. Cox regression model showed that borderline glycemia and DM confer approximately 1.2- and 2.8-fold excess risks of CAD, respectively, compared with CAD- with normoglycemia. CAD+ confers approximately a - to 8-fold increased risk. The impacts of DM and prior CAD additively reached a hazard ratio (HR) of 15.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.82-21.00). However, the HR in those with borderline glycemia and CAD+ was 7.20 (95%CI: .01-10.34), which was not different from those with normoglycemia and CAD+.Control status of traditional risk factors and impact on subsequent CAD differ among categories of glycemic status with and without prior CAD.

Initially, CP is managed with endoscopic interventions, long-term analgesia for its associated chronic abdominal pain syndrome and pancreatic enzyme replacement for exocrine dysfunction. As the disease advances, pancreatic drainage procedures and partial resections are considered, but they leave diseased tissue behind and usually result in short-term relief only. Total pancreatectomy alone is widely viewed as a last resort treatment option because it causes brittle . However, total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) can prevent the development of  and cure the chronic pain syndrome. One serious, albeit rare, complication of TPIAT is (partial) portal vein thrombosis. Its incidence is probably about %. To prevent the occurrence of portal vein thrombosis, we propose herein, and have successfully performed, continuous real-time Doppler ultrasonography during the islet infusion to study portal vein and intrahepatic flow patterns, as well as changes in Doppler signals. Flow and signal changes may allow for timely adjustment of the infusion rate, before a marked increase in portal vein pressure is noted and decrease the risk of portal vein thrombosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 , in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed -fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and insulin signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and insulin resistance, which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents with type 1 DM. They were further subdivided into two equal subgroups: group 1 with type 1 DM and normo-albuminuria [urinary albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 hours], and group 2 with type 1 DM and hyper-albuminuria (increased UAE >30 mg/24 hours).

Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity,  status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019.The bariatric surgical procedures (n = 2498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]).The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure.Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52. (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at  years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged  to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures.In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656536>Mechanism associated with aberrant lncRNA MEG3 expression in gestational .</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) is a common metabolic condition during pregnancy. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to seve critical roles in GDM development; however, the role of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in GDM remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and role of MEG3 in GDM, and to further explore the underlying mechanism. The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in the blood and placental villous tissues of pregnant women with GDM was measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the association between lncRNA MEG3 and microRNA (miR)-345-3p. Transfection was subsequently performed on HTR-8/SVneo cells, a human chorionic trophoblast cell line, to assess the role of lncRNA MEG3 in GDM. In particular, cell viability, cellular migratory/invasive ability and cell apoptosis were analyzed using MTT assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with pregnant women without GDM, lncRNA MEG3 levels were significantly elevated in the blood and placental villous tissues of GDM pregnant women. miR-345-3p was identified to be a direct target of lncRNA MEG3 using dual luciferase reporter assay, which was found to be reduced in pregnant women with GDM. Further analysis demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 overexpression significantly inhibited HTR-8/SVneo cell viability, and prevented cell migration and invasion in addition to inducing cell apoptosis. In contrast, lncRNA MEG3 knockdown significantly enhanced HTR-8/SVneo cell viability, promoted cell migration/invasion and reduced cell apoptosis. Inhibiting miR-345-3p expression negated all the observed physiological effects of lncRNA MEG3 knockdown on HTR-8/SVneo cells. In conclusion, lncRNA MEG3 levels were abnormally upregulated in GDM, which participated in the development and progression of GDM by regulating human chorionic trophoblast cell physiology. Therefore, lncRNA MEG3 may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for GDM.Copyright: © Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656244>Personal characteristics effects on validation of self-reported type 2  from a cross-sectional survey among Chinese adults.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effects of personal characteristics on the validation of self-reported type 2  among Chinese adults in urban Shanghai.During 2015 to 2016, 4,322 participants were recruited in this validation study.

We investigated factors associated with T2D remission and relapse after RYGB.Retrospective review of consecutive patients with T2D who underwent RYGB between 1993 and 2017. T2D remission was defined as medications discontinuation and/or HbA1c<6.%; relapse was defined as recurrent medication use and/or HbA1c≥6.%. Independent correlates of T2D remission and relapse were identified using logistic regression.621 patients (aged 46.7±10.6 years; 30% on insulin; BMI 49.8±8.3 kg/m) had at least one-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 4.9 (range 1-23.6) years. Prevalence of T2D remission was 74% at one year, 73% from one to three years, 63% between 3 and 10 years, and 47% beyond 10 years. 93% of remissions occurred within 3 years of RYGB, 25% relapsed. The median (IQR) time to relapse was .3 (3-7.8) years after remission. Higher one-year percentage total body weight (%TBW) loss, lack of preoperative insulin use, and younger age at surgery were independently associated with T2D remission. Preoperative insulin use, lower %TBW loss at one year, and greater %TBW gain after one year were independently associated with T2D relapse.This longitudinal retrospective analysis shows that preoperative insulin use and age, one-year weight loss, and regain after that influence T2D remission and relapse following RYGB. Referring patients at a younger age, before insulin is needed, and optimizing both weight loss and weight maintenance after RYGB may improve the rates and durability of T2D remission.Copyright © 2019.

Additionally, current smoking (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 2.60 to 2.74; =0.01), reduced ejection fraction (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.97; =0.04), severe stenosis (OR: 3.65; 95% CI: 2.55 to .24; =0.01), and  (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.97; =0.04) serve as the independent predictors for new native-vessel occlusion.As to high incidence of postoperative CTO, appropriate revascularization strategies and postoperative management should be taken into careful consideration.Copyright © 2019 Ze Zheng et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672720>Advanced glycation end products and glycosaminoglycans in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.</a></h2><p>In some patients diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes acute endothelial injury and multiorgan failure. Measurement of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) could provide information to help understand the biochemical events associated with poor outcomes in these patients. This study included 37 patients with DKA admitted to an intensive care unit. Blood was collected from these patients during the first day of hospitalization, 24 hours after the first sample, and 72 hours after the first sample when possible. ELISA-based assays were used to measure glucose, hemoglobin A1c, AGE, glycated albumin, and GAG levels in serum. Twenty healthy control subjects with no history of  donated 1 blood sample. Control subjects had a mean age of 36.3±12.1 years; patients with DKA had a mean age of 38.1±18. years. Admission laboratory tests in patients with DKA included glucose 546±296 mg/dL, bicarbonate 10.1±. mEq/L, anion gap 31.8±7.8 mEq/L, and creatinine 1.1±1.0 mg/dL. Patients with DKA had significantly higher level glucose and free glycated hemoglobin. Control subjects had significantly higher levels of AGE and glycated albumin. There were no differences in soluble receptor for AGE levels or GAG levels between the control subjects and patients with DKA. Patients with DKA had lower circulating levels of AGE and glycated albumin than control subjects.

The goal of this study was to evaluate coronary artery calcifications via the coronary calcification score in primary hyperparathyroidism patients, to compare with control subjects, and to identify risk factors for high to intermediate risk coronary calcification scores (coronary calcification score >100).Cross-sectional study of primary hyperparathyroidism patients without a history of coronary artery disease, , or severe, chronic kidney disease. Coronary calcification scores were compared with a cohort of population-based control subjects.The mean coronary calcification score was 120 ± 344 in 130 primary hyperparathyroidism patients. The coronary calcification score was >100 in 27 patients (21%). When compared with control subjects, the percentage of positive coronary calcification scores was similar in primary hyperparathyroidism patients (53% vs 50%); however, positive coronary calcification scores were at the 67 percentile of the control subjects cohort (P < .001). In multivariable regression, patient age (1.1; 1.1-1.2; P < .001), patients in the mild normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism group (.1; 1.1-22.6; P = .037), and the need for antihypertensive medications (6.1; 1.8-20.9; P < .001) remained independent predictors for a coronary calcification score >100.Positive coronary calcification scores were greater in primary hyperparathyroidism patients than in population-based control subjects.

The primary goal of this study was to determine predictors of revascularization.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on data collected from records of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at Al-Arabi Heart Center in Palestine in 2017. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the association of sociodemographic and pre-catheterization clinical predictors with revascularization.A total of 1550 patients were included in the study. The participants mean age was 58 with a SD of 11.7 years, 73.6% were males. 50.2% of patients who underwent an interventional cardiac catheterization tested negative for troponin on presentation. Multivariate logistic regression showed Troponin (RR = 4.), Age (RR = 1.0), Female gender (RR = 0.4) previous catheterization (RR = 2.0), and existence of  as significant predictors for revascularization. The correlation between ECG on presentation and the subsequent need for an interventional cardiac catheterization was significant only in case of ST-Elevation (RR = 1.), and T wave inversion (RR = 1.6). CK-MB, Hypertension and ECG with ST-depression were not significant predictors.This study assessed revascularization predictors in addition to characteristics and outcomes of patients who have undergone cardiac catheterization.

In consideration of the common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, exposure to air pollution may also increase the risk of gestational  (GDM), but the current evidence was inconsistent and has not well been systematically reviewed. Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the association between air pollution exposure and GDM.An extensive literature search was conducted in selected electronic databases for related human epidemiological studies published in English language. Summary effect estimates were calculated using random-effect models for a) risk per unit increase in continuous air pollutant concentration and b) risk of high versus low exposure level in individual study if each exposure that had been examined in ≥2 studies. We evaluated the heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test and quantified it by I statistic. Publication bias was also evaluated through the funnel plot when sufficient number of studies are available.A total of 11 studies evaluating the association between GDM and exposure to air pollution were identified finally. The summary odds ratio (OR) for incidence of GDM following a 10 μg/m increase in PM exposure during the second trimester was 1.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.09) and in NO during the first trimester was 1.03 (95%CI: 1.00, 1.07) per 10 ppb increase, while for high versus low SO exposure during the second trimester was 1.25 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.53). High heterogeneity among study-specific results in majority of the analyses were observed, and attributed to different exposure assessment methods, populations, study locations, and covariates adjustment. Publication bias cannot be excluded because of the inclusion of small number of studies.The present study supports the evidence that air pollution exposure increases the risk the GDM, albeit the existence of high heterogeneity. Further studies are necessary to elaborate the suggestive associations. These results are of public health significance since worsening air pollution in developing countries has been expected to increase the risk of GDM development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This matched cohort study used two large UK databases (1983-2016) to study patients (≥ 40 years old) initiating ICS or long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) for COPD from 1990-2015 in three study cohorts designed to assess the relation between ICS treatment and (1)  onset (N = 17,970), (2)  progression (N = 804), and (3) osteoporosis onset (N = 19,898). Patients had ≥ 1-year baseline and ≥ 2-year outcome data. Matching was via combined direct matching and propensity scores. Conditional proportional hazards regression, adjusting for residual confounding after matching, was used to compare ICS vs. LABD and to model ICS exposures. Median follow-up was 3.7-.6 years/treatment group. For patients prescribed ICS, compared with LABD, the risk of  onset was significantly increased (adjusted hazard ratio 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.50), with overall no increase in risk of  progression (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 0.87-1.25) or osteoporosis onset (adjusted hazard ratio 1.13; 0.93-1.39). However, the risks of  onset,  progression, and osteoporosis onset were all significantly increased, with evident dose-response relationships for all three outcomes, at mean ICS exposures of 500 µg/day or greater (vs. < 250 µg/day, fluticasone propionate-equivalent).

Obesity aggravates symptoms of SLE; however, these symptoms can be improved by weight loss through diet therapy and bariatric surgery. However, there are only a few reports regarding the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in obese patients with SLE. Herein, we discuss the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) performed in an obese patient with SLE while undergoing long-term steroid therapy.A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed  (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again.LSG was safely performed in an obese patient with SLE undergoing long-term steroid therapy. We noted substantial weight loss, improved DM condition, and reduced requirement of SLE therapy after surgery. Hence, surgical risks must be carefully examined before patients undergo bariatric surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Obesity and Obesity-related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h2><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (iDPP-4s) may exert cardioprotective effects through their pleiotropic actions via glucagon-like peptide 1-dependent mechanisms. In this study, the pharmacological profile of a new iDPP-4 (LASSBio-2124) was investigated in rats with cardiac and renal dysfunction induced by T2DM.T2DM was induced in rats by 2 weeks of a high-fat diet followed by intravenous injection of streptozotocin. Metabolic disturbance and cardiac, vascular, and renal dysfunction were analyzed in the experimental groups.Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 administration after T2DM induction reduced elevated glucose levels to 319.8 ± 13.2 and 279.7 ± 17.8 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.05). LASSBio-2124 also lowered the cholesterol and triglyceride levels from 76.8 ± 8.0 to 42.7 ± 3.2 mg/dL and from 229.7 ± 25.4 to 100.7 ± 17.1 mg/dL, in diabetic rats. Sitagliptin and LASSBio-2124 reversed the reduction of the plasma insulin level. LASSBio-2124 recovered the increased urinary flow in diabetic animals and reduced 24-h proteinuria from 23.7 ± 1. to 13.3 ± 2.8 mg (p < 0.05). It also reduced systolic and diastolic left-ventricular dysfunction in hearts from diabetic rats.The effects of LASSBio-2124 were superior to those of sitagliptin in the cardiovascular systems of T2DM rats. This new prototype showed promise for the avoidance of comorbidities in a T2DM experimental model, and thus may constitute an innovative therapeutic agent for the treatment of these conditions in the clinical field in future.Copyright © 2019.

It remains unclear how cTnT levels develop over time in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to prospectively study the association between cTnT and GFR over time in older advanced-stage CKD patients not on dialysis. Methods and Results The EQUAL (European Quality Study) study is an observational prospective cohort study in stage 4 to  CKD patients aged ≥65 years not on dialysis (incident estimated GFR, <20 mL/min/1.73 m²). The EQUAL cohort used for the purpose of this study includes 171 patients followed in Sweden between April 2012 and December 2018. We used linear mixed models, adjusted for important groups of confounders, to investigate the effect of both measured GFR and estimated GFR on high-sensitivity cTnT (hs-cTnT) trajectory over 4 years. Almost all patients had at least 1 hs-cTnT measurement elevated above the 99th percentile of the general reference population (≤14 ng/L). On average, hs-cTnT increased by 16%/year (95% CI, 13-19; <0.0001). Each 15 mL/min/1.73 m lower mean estimated GFR was associated with a 23% (95% CI, 14-31; <0.0001) higher baseline hs-cTnT and 9% (95% CI, -13%; <0.0001) steeper increase in hs-cTnT. The effect of estimated GFR on hs-cTnT trajectory was somewhat lower than a previous myocardial infarction (15%), but higher than presence of  (4%) and male sex (%). Conclusions In CKD patients, hs-cTnT increases over time as renal function decreases. Lower CKD stage (each 15 mL/min/1.73 m lower) is independently associated with a steeper hs-cTnT increase over time in the same range as other established cardiovascular risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673398>Pilot randomized controlled trial of a complex intervention for  self-management supported by volunteers, technology, and interprofessional primary health care teams.</a></h2><p>Most health care for people with  occurs in family practice, yet balancing the time and resources to help these patients can be difficult.

Volunteers ( = 20) met 28 clients in 234 client encounters (home visits, phone calls, electronic messages); 27 reports were sent to the interprofessional team. At 4 months, controlling for baseline, most outcomes were better in the intervention compared to control group; physical activity notably better. The most common goal domains set were physical activity, diet/nutrition, and social connection. Clients felt the biggest impact was motivation toward goal achievement. They struggled with some of the technologies. Several participants perceived that the program was not a good fit, mostly those that felt they were already well-managing their .Health TAPESTRY-HC-DM was feasible; a large-scale randomized controlled trial seems possible. However, further attention needs to be paid to improving recruitment and retention. The intervention was well received, though was a better fit for some participants than others.ClinicalTrials.gov, .

Aim of this study was to identify perioperative risk factors for anastomotic leak and for 60-day morbidity and mortality after ileocolic anastomoses (stapled vs handsewn).This is a STROBE-compliant study. Demographic and surgical data were gathered from patients with an ileocolic anastomosis performed between November 2010 and September 2016 at a tertiary hospital. Anastomoses were performed using standardised techniques. Independent risk factors for anastomotic leak, complications and mortality were assessed.We included 477 patients: 53.7% of the anastomoses were hand sewn and 46.3% stapled. Laterolateral anastomosis was the most common configuration (93.3%). Anastomotic leak was diagnosed in 8.8% of patients and 36 were classified as major anastomotic leak (7.%). In the multivariate analysis, male sex ( = 0.014, odds ratio, OR, 2.9), arterial hypertension ( = 0.048, OR 2.29) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 2.4 per litre) were independent risk factors for major anastomotic leak. The overall 60-day complication rate was 27.3%. Male sex (31.3% vs female 22.3%,  = 0.02, OR 1.7),  ( = 0.03 OR 2.0), smoking habit ( = 0.04, OR 1.8) and perioperative transfusions ( < 0.001, OR 3.3 per litre) were independent risk factors for postoperative morbidity. The 60-day-mortality rate was 3.1% and no significant risk factors were identified.Anastomotic leak after ileocolic anastomosis is a relevant problem. Male sex, arterial hypertension and perioperative transfusions were associated with major anastomotic leak. Conversion to open surgery was more frequently associated with perioperative death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658146>Safety and effectiveness of the self-aPposing, bAlloon-delivered, siRolimus-eluting stent for the Treatment of the coronary Artery disease: SPARTA, a multicenter experience.</a></h2><p>To assess the long-term outcomes of patients treated with sirolimus-eluting Stentys stent in a real-life setting.Few data regarding the safety and effectiveness of self-apposing sirolimus-eluting Stentys stent are available.278 patients (30% stable coronary artery disease, 70% acute coronary syndromes, and 54% on unprotected left main) treated with sirolimus eluting Stentys stent were retrospectively included in the self-aPposing, bAlloon-delivered, siRolimus-eluting stent for the Treatment of the coronary Artery disease multicenter registry. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis) were the primary end-point, single components of MACE were the secondary ones.After 13 months (interquartile range -32), MACE was 14%. Stent thrombosis occurred in 3.9% of the patients (2.% definite stent thrombosis and 1.4% probable stent thrombosis), 66% of them presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at admission. Cardiovascular death, target lesion revascularization and myocardial infarction was 4.7%, 8.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, risk of MACE was increased by  (hazard ratios 4.76; P = 0.002) but was not affected by the indication leading to sirolimus-eluting Stentys stent implantation (marked vessel tapering vs. coronary ecstasies, hazard ratios 0.74, P = 0.71).Sirolimus-eluting Stentys stent may represent a potential solution for specific coronary anatomies such as bifurcation, ectasic, or tapered vessels. Risk of stent thrombosis appears related to clinical presentation with STEMI and to anatomic features, stressing the importance of the use of intracoronary imaging for self-expandable stents implantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660142>Pregnant women have inadequate fiber intake while consuming fiber-rich diets in low-income rural setting: Evidences from Analysis of common "ready-to-eat" stable foods.</a></h2><p>The intake of fiber-rich foods during pregnancy has several health benefits to the pregnant woman including lowering the risks of , preeclampsia, and constipation. However, little is known about the content, daily intake levels, and adequacy of fiber among pregnant women in many low-income settings. We aimed to identify common food items and determine adequacy of dietary fiber intake levels among pregnant women in rural Ethiopia. Dietary data were collected from a subsample ( = 55) of pregnant women enrolled to a larger prospective cohort study ( = 414). Dietary intake level was measured using repeated 24-hr dietary recall method and weighing the total amount of daily food. Fiber content was determined using the Weende method supplemented by other sources.The mean [±] dietary fiber intake level was 25.89 [±.09 mg/g] per day, which declined across pregnancy trimester from 26.01 [±9.18 mg/g] to 22.67 [±9.01 mg/g] and 24.56 [±9.98 mg/g] during the first, to second and third pregnancy trimesters, respectively. Boiled cereals and coffee contributed to nearly two-thirds (63.2%) of the daily fiber intake, while the major bulk of daily food, enjera, contributed to less than a quarter (24.3%) of the fiber intake. Though dietary patterns favor diversified intake for fiber, the mean intake levels below the recommended levels and proportion of women getting adequate to the physiologic stages of pregnancy were inadequate compared to the standard. Mothers, in such community, could benefit from increasing overall intake of existing food to satisfy their fiber needs during pregnancy.© 2019 The Authors.

Preoperative ocular factors (baseline visual acuity [VA], vitreous haemorrhage [VH], tractional retinal detachment [TRD] and retinal photocoagulation), general factors (sex, age,  duration, HbA1c level, hypertension, anti-coagulant medication and estimated glomerular filtration rate), surgical procedures (preoperative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection, internal limiting membrane peeling, combined cataract surgery, retinal break, and tamponade), postoperative complications for revitrectomy and postoperative VA at 6 months were evaluated.In the follow-up period of 6 months, revitrectomy was performed in 56 eyes (26.3%), and postoperative complications for revitrectomy were VH in 31 eyes (15%), TRD in 13 eyes (6.2%) and membrane proliferation in 12 eyes (.2%). The mean LogMAR improvement from baseline to 6 months in revitrectomy group (0.39) was significantly worse than in single vitrectomy group (0.74). Diabetic duration, low baseline VA, less simple VH, TRD and air tamponade were statistical risk factors of revitrectomy, and logistic regression analysis identified low baseline VA and air tamponade also as prognostic factors of revitrectomy.Our results indicated that prognosis of VA was worse in PDR patients with revitrectomy and low baseline VA and air as the tamponade material were the potential prognostic factors of revitrectomy.© 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

However, current guidelines do not include routine assessment of myocardial function. We investigated whether echocardiography provides incremental prognostic information in individuals with type 1  without known heart disease.A prospective cohort of individuals with type 1  without known heart disease was recruited from the outpatient clinic. Follow-up was performed through Danish national registers. The association of echocardiography with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and the incremental prognostic value when added to the clinical Steno T1D Risk Engine were examined.A total of 1093 individuals were included: median (interquartile range) age 50.2 (39.2-60.3) years and HbA 65 (56-74) mmol/mol; 53% men; and mean (SD) BMI 25. (3.9) kg/m and  duration 25.8 (14.6) years. During 7. years of follow-up, 145 (13.3%) experienced MACE. Echocardiography significantly and independently predicted MACE: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% (n = 18) vs ≥45% (n = 1075), HR (95% CI) 3.93 (1.91, 8.08), p < 0.001; impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS), 1.65 (1.17, 2.34) (n = 263), p = 0.005; diastolic mitral early velocity (E)/early diastolic tissue Doppler velocity (e') <8 (n = 723) vs E/e' 8-12 (n = 285), 1.59 (1.04, 2.42), p = 0.031; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12 (n = 85), 2.30 (1.33, 3.97), p = 0.003. In individuals with preserved LVEF (n = 1075), estimates for impaired GLS were 1.49 (1.04, 2.15), p = 0.032; E/e' <8 vs E/e' 8-12, 1.61 (1.04, 2.49), p = 0.033; and E/e' <8 vs E/e' ≥12, 2.49 (1.41, 4.37), p = 0.001.

Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath is non-invasive and appears as a promising tool. However, data on breath VOC profiles in pediatric patients are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study and applied quantitative analysis of exhaled VOCs in children suffering from type 1  (T1DM) (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 60). Both groups were matched for sex and age. For breath gas analysis, a very sensitive direct mass spectrometric technique (PTR-TOF) was applied. The duration of disease, the mode of insulin application (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. multiple daily insulin injection) and long-term metabolic control were considered as classifiers in patients. The concentration of exhaled VOCs differed between T1DM patients and healthy children. In particular, T1DM patients exhaled significantly higher amounts of ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylsulfid, isoprene and pentanal compared to healthy controls (171, 1223, 19.6, 112 and 13. ppbV vs. 82.4, 784, 11.3, 49.6, and .30 ppbV). The most remarkable differences in concentrations were found in patients with poor metabolic control, i.e. those with a mean HbA above 8%. In conclusion, non-invasive breath testing may support the discovery of basic metabolic mechanisms and adaptation early in the progress of T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664708>Dapagliflozin: A Review in Type 1 .</a></h2><p>Oral dapagliflozin (Edistride, Forxiga) is approved in the EU at a dosage of  mg/day as an adjunct to insulin in adults with type 1  (T1D) and a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27 kg/m, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy. As a highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin decreases plasma glucose levels independently of insulin action and enables glycaemic control improvement without increasing the risks associated with intensive insulin therapy. In the phase III DEPICT-1 and -2 trials, dapagliflozin  mg/day as an adjunct to insulin improved glycaemic control and reduced total daily insulin dose and bodyweight relative to placebo in adults with inadequately controlled T1D, including in patients with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, over 24 weeks of treatment. In extensions of these trials, these improvements were maintained up to 52 weeks. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety profile and a hypoglycaemia profile generally similar to placebo. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis with dapagliflozin in patients with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m was less than half that of the overall population who received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved for use in T1D and, while further clinical experience in T1D is required to more definitively establish its efficacy and safety profile, it provides a promising adjunctive treatment option for adults with T1D and a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665403>Evaluation of Systematic Blood Testing at the Time of Recruitment to the Armed Forces: Retrospective Monocentric Study Among 726 French Army Soldiers.</a></h2><p>In the French armed forces, the biological checkup required during the recruitment process comprises a urinalysis (urinary dipstick), a complete blood count (CBC), and measurement of serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine. This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of this biological checkup and to determine the most relevant parameters.We conducted a monocentric retrospective study of all standardized and systematically conducted blood tests (CBC and measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose, and creatinine) over a 15-month period among 726 French Army recruits.The population included mainly young males (85.4%, mean age 21.6 years). More than half (54.1%) of the blood tests had at least one abnormal parameter, most often concerning the CBC. Anemia occurred in .3% of the population and was mostly normocytic. Microcytosis was mostly not associated with anemia (72.3% of cases). Lymphopenia occurred in 20.1% of the population and was mostly mild. Eosinophilia was present in .1% of the population and was never severe. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 0.7% of the population and was never severe. Serum levels of aminotransferases were elevated in 8.1% of the population. Fasting plasma glucose averaged 84 mg/dL (SD: 0.07) ranging from 64 to 123 mg/dL, was abnormal in 0.4% of the population, and one case of  was diagnosed. Serum creatinine concentration was elevated in 0.7% of the population.CBCs gave useful information but iron deficiency was common and insufficiently detected by this single analysis. Assessing aminotransferase levels without screening for viral hepatitis and systematic measurement of fasting plasma glucose levels did not appear to be efficient. In addition, the only interest in systematic measurement of creatinine serum levels was to obtain a reference level for long-term follow-up. In addition to the urinary dipstick, the systematic biological checkup at recruitment could be limited to a CBC with measurement of plasma ferritin levels and Hepatitis B virus serology, providing that any CBC abnormalities, in particular cytopenia, eosinophilia, and microcytosis, are systematically investigated.

The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = 2.05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (2.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669629>Clinical features, biochemistry and HLA-DRB1 status in children and adolescents with  in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>Little information is published on  in young people in Bangladesh.

One hundred subjects aged <22 years at diagnosis were enrolled. Demographic characteristics, clinical information, biochemical parameters (blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, and autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and islet antigen-2 (IA-2A) were measured. High-resolution DNA genotyping was performed for HLA-DRB1.Eighty-four subjects were clinically diagnosed as type 1  (T1D), seven as type 2  (T2D), and nine as fibrocalculous pancreatic disease (FCPD). Of the 84 with T1D, 37 (44%) were males and 47 (56%) females, with median age at diagnosis 13 years (range 1.6-21.7) and peak age at onset 12-15 years. 85% of subjects were assessed within one month of diagnosis and all within eleven months. For subjects diagnosed with T1D, mean C-peptide was 0.46±0.22 nmol/L (1.40±0.59 ng/mL), with 9 (10.7%) IA-2A positive, 22 (26%) GADA positive, and  (6%) positive for both autoantibodies. Analysis of HLA-DRB1 genotypes revealed locus-level T1D association (p=6.0E-05); DRB1*04:01 appeared predisposing (p<3.0E-06), and DRB1*14:01 appeared protective (p=1.7E-02).Atypical forms of T1D appear to be more common in young people in Bangladesh than in European populations.

There are some risk assessment systems, but these have generally not been verified for patients with gynecologic cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of surgery for gynecological oncologic patients and suggest an easy risk assessment model and risk reduction by applying our findings.We retrospectively analyzed 258 gynecologic patients with cancer. Age, diagnosis, staging, performance scale, metoprolol use, heart, renal , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease, , operation type and length, carcinoma antigen 125, ascites, albumin, surgical procedure, hospitalization length, and complications were recorded.Of the 258 patients, 173 patients (67.1%) had no complications, 43 patients (16.7%) had one and 42 patients (16.3%) had two or more complications. The most common complication was the acid-base imbalance (14%), followed by urinary tract infection (9.7%). Parameters associated with complications were performance status, ascites, operating length, metoprolol use, and upper abdominal surgery. In our proposed scoring model with a total score range 0-23, cut-off value points for both the presence and rate of complications was found as >.In gynecological patients with cancer, the addition of metoprolol use and upper abdominal surgery within preoperative risk assessment evaluation parameters are significantly effective in predicting the rate and severity of complications.

The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a -point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney measures and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001), weight (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney measures and hypertension (p > 0.05) or  (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or .

Studies assessing risk factors of NBPP in relation to typically developing comparison individuals were included. Meta-analysis was performed for the five most significant risk factors, on the basis of the PRISMA statement and MOOSE guidelines. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and across-study heterogeneity (I ) were reported. Reporting bias and quality of evidence was rated. In addition, we assessed the incidence of NBPP.Twenty-two observational studies with a total sample size of 29 419 037 live births were selected. Significant risk factors included shoulder dystocia (OR 115.27; 95% CI 81.35-163.35; I =92%), macrosomia (OR 9.75; 95% CI 8.29-11.46; I =70%), (gestational)  (OR .33; 95% CI 3.77-7.55; I =59%), instrumental delivery (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.77-.23; I =77%), and breech delivery (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.67-3.7; I =70%). Caesarean section appeared as a protective factor (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.11-0.16; I =41%). The pooled overall incidence of NBPP was 1.74 per 1000 live births. It has decreased in recent years.The incidence of NBPP is decreasing. Shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal , instrumental delivery, and breech delivery are risk factors for NBPP. Caesarean section appears as a protective factor.The overall incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy is 1.74 per 1000 live births. The incidence has declined significantly. Shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, maternal , instrumental delivery, and breech delivery are the main risk factors. Prevention is difficult owing to unpredictability and often labour-related risk.© 2019 Mac Keith Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661471>Relationship Between  and Cirrhosis Risk in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in Wuhan, China.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND The objective of our research was to assess the possible link between  (DM) and liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals with a diagnosis of both liver cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection (n=257), and CHB-only patients (n=514) were matched 1: 2 by age and sex. Demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical characteristics were reviewed. Univariate and the multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the association between DM and HBV-related liver cirrhosis. RESULTS The prevalence of DM was higher among CHB patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without liver cirrhosis (22.2% vs. 12.8%, P=0.001), yielding an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 2.317 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.528-3.513. Among them, 87.7% of liver cirrhosis patients were diagnosed with DM before liver cirrhosis diagnosis, yielding an AOR (95% CI) of 2.386 (1.533-3.714). In comparison to patients with a DM duration of 2- years, the AOR (95% CI) for those with a DM duration > years was 2.073 (0.701-6.132). In DM treatment, the AOR (95% CI) for those treated with insulin was 4.746 (1.329-16.949). CONCLUSIONS DM was associated with cirrhosis risk in CHB patients in Wuhan, China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h2><p>Although the frequency of metabolic syndrome has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in all three diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases, and to determine the frequency of MetS and insulin resistance in psoriasis and PsA as compared to RA.A total of 155 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Fifty patients who were diagnosed with psoriasis, 55 PsA patients who were diagnosed according to the CASPAR criteria, and 50 seropositive RA patients who were diagnosed according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria were included in this study. MetS was diagnosed by the 2005 criteria of International  Federation. The cardiovascular risk factors and parameters associated with MetS were evaluated.The patients' mean age was significantly higher in the RA. MetS was determined in 33.% of all patients and MetS and insulin resistance showed no significant difference among the three groups (psoriasis: 36%, PsA: 29%, RA: 36%; p: 0.684 and psoriasis: 70%, PsA: 64%, RA: 66%, respectively; p: 0.785). Triglyceride levels were higher in psoriasis and PsA as compared to the RA (psoriasis: 34%, PsA: 32.7%, RA: 16%, respectively; p: 0.045). The frequency of hypertension was 38% in the RA, which was higher than PsA and psoriasis (p: 0.011).In all three groups, the prevalence of MetS was shown to be higher than the general population. The lack of difference between these groups may be due to the small number of patients, the retrospective study design, and the inequality of the population with respect to age and gender.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672380>The characteristics of the patients with radiologically severe cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine: A CT-based multicenter cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is characterized by heterotopic bone formation in the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. We know that the size and distribution of the ossified lesions in patients with OPLL are different in each case. However, the characteristics of the patients with radiologically severe cervical OPLL remain unknown.The participants of our study were symptomatic patients with cervical OPLL who were diagnosed by standard radiographs of the cervical spine. Whole-spine CT data and demographic data such as age and sex were obtained from 20 institutions belonging to the Japanese Multicenter Research Organization for Ossification of the Spinal Ligament. According to the number of the levels involved by OPLL, we stratified the patients into two subgroups: severe group (S-group) and non-severe group (NS-group) to delineate the characteristics of radiologically severe patients with cervical OPLL. We also evaluated the most compressed level and the degree of occupying ratio of cervical spinal canal by OPLL at the most compressed level.A total of 234 patients with a mean age of 65 years were recruited. The S-group consisted of 48 patients (21%, 12 females and 36 males) and the NS-group consisted of 92 patients (79%, 22 females and 70 males). The mean age of males in the S-group (68 years old) was significantly higher than that of males in the NS-group (64 years old); however there was no significant difference in the mean age in females between the S-group (69 years old) and the NS-group (66 years old). No significant difference of body mass index, ossification of the nuchal ligament-positivity and presence of  were found between the S- and the NS-group.It is likely that the manner of extension of cervical OPLL is different between male and female patients.Copyright © 2019.

Oxidative stress played a key role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our aim of this study was to investigate whether high glucose could provoke microvesicles generation from podocytes and its potential mechanism. Mouse podocyte clone  (MPC-) were stimulated by high glucose. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of podocytes were measured by fluorescence microscopy with the probe of CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM. Antioxidants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and alpha lipoic acid (α-LA) were used to treat podocytes after high glucose stimulation. The rate of podocyte apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry. NOX4 expression was examined and siRNA were performed to explore the mechanism of MVs generation. The quantities of MVs from MPC- cells was significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) by 4.6 times after 30 mM glucose stimulation, accompanied with double increased apoptosis. Cellular ROS generation was increased by high glucose at the peak of 48h stimulation. High glucose induced MVs was significantly decreased by 52.9% after pretreatment by antioxidant NAC. Nevertheless, Mitochondrial ROS in podocytes reached a peak at 4h stimulation, but specific antioxidant α-LA had no effect on the production of MVs (P&gt;0.05). Levels of NOX4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly upregulated by high glucose (P&lt;0.05). Podocyte-derived MVs by high glucose were eliminated by NOX4 siRNA. High glucose can provoke MVs generation from glomerular podocytes through ROS/NOX4 pathway, not from mitochondrial pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658144>SWEDEHEART-1-year data show no benefit of newer generation drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents in patients with severe kidney dysfunction following percutaneous coronary intervention.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that the transition from bare-metal stents (BMS) to newer generation drug-eluting stents (n-DES) in clinical practice may have reduced the risk also in patients with kidney dysfunction.Observational study in the national SWEDEHEART registry, that compared the 1-year risk of in-stent restenosis (RS) and stent thrombosis (ST) in all percutaneous coronary intervention treated patients(n = 92 994) during 2007-2013.N-DES patients were younger than BMS, but had more often , previous myocardial infarction, previous revascularization and were more often treated with potent platelet inhibition.

These structural variants are present in 0.% to 1.0% of the population, making 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 the site of the most prevalent known pathogenic copy number variation (CNV). It is unknown to what extent this CNV influences brain structure and affects cognitive abilities.To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance.In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019.The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort.Of 45 756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23 754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 × 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 × 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 × 10-). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (β = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 × 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on  of 7 tasks.These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664108>GPR40 activation initiates store-operated Ca entry and potentiates insulin secretion via the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>The long-chain fatty acid receptor GPR40 plays an important role in potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) from pancreatic β-cells. Previous studies demonstrated that GPR40 activation enhances Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating inositol 1,4,-triphosphate (IP3) receptors. However, it remains unknown how ER Ca release via the IP3 receptor is linked to GIIS potentiation. Recently, stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 was identified as a key regulator of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), but little is known about its contribution in GPR40 signaling. We show that GPR40-mediated potentiation of GIIS is abolished by knockdown of IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), STIM1 or Ca-channel Orai1 in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown significantly impaired SOCE and the increase of intracellular Ca by the GPR40 agonist, fasiglifam. Furthermore, β-cell-specific STIM1 knockout mice showed impaired fasiglifam-mediated GIIS potentiation not only in isolated islets but also in vivo. These results indicate that the IP3R1/STIM1/Orai1 pathway plays an important role in GPR40-mediated SOCE initiation and GIIS potentiation in pancreatic β-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662747>miR-29a Negatively Affects Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion and MIN6 Cell Proliferation via Cdc42/-Catenin Signaling.</a></h2><p> is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Functional impairment of islet  cells can occur to varying degrees. This impairment can initially be compensated for by proliferation and metabolic changes of  cells. Cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) and the microRNA (miRNA) miR-29 have important roles in -cell proliferation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which we further explored using the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6.Upregulation and downregulation of miR-29a and Cdc42 were accomplished using transient transfection. miR-29a and Cdc42 expression was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting. MIN6 proliferation was detected using a cell counting kit assay. GSIS under high-glucose (20.0 mM) or basal-glucose (.0 mM) stimulation was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The miR-29a binding site in the Cdc42 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) was determined using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.miR-29a overexpression inhibited proliferation ( < 0.01) and GSIS under high-glucose stimulation ( < 0.01). Cdc42 overexpression promoted proliferation ( < 0.05) and GSIS under high-glucose stimulation ( < 0.05). miR-29a overexpression decreased Cdc42 expression ( < 0.01), whereas miR-29a downregulation increased Cdc42 expression ( < 0.01). The results showed that the Cdc42 mRNA 3'-UTR is a direct target of miR-29a . Additionally, Cdc42 reversed miR-29a-mediated inhibition of proliferation and GSIS ( < 0.01). Furthermore, miR-29a inhibited -catenin expression ( < 0.01), whereas Cdc42 promoted -catenin expression ( < 0.01).By negatively regulating Cdc42 and the downstream molecule -catenin, miR-29a inhibits MIN6 proliferation and insulin secretion.Copyright © 2019 Jing Duan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670357>A label-free fluorescent sensor based on silicon quantum dots-MnO nanosheets for the detection of α-glucosidase and its inhibitor.</a></h2><p>α-Glucosidase and its inhibitors play a key role in diagnosis and treatment of . In the present work, we established a facile, sensitive and selective fluorescence method based on silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) and MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of α-glucosidase and one of its inhibitors acarbose. The fluorescence of SiQDs was greatly quenched by MnO2 nanosheets due to the inner filter effect. α-Glucosidase could easily catalyze the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic acid-2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl (AAG) to produce ascorbic acid (AA), which could reduce MnO2 nanosheets to Mn2+, resulting in dramatic recovery of the fluorescence of SiQDs. The proposed sensing platform could provide a good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of SiQDs and the concentration of α-glucosidase in the range of 0.02-2. U mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.007 U mL-1. In addition, the sensing platform could be used for α-glucosidase inhibition.

We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination on obesity-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung fibrosis using a murine model. We assigned C57BL/6J mice to five groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD with empagliflozin, dulaglutide, or both. Mice received a 12-week HFD, empagliflozin ( days/week, oral gavage), and dulaglutide (once weekly, intraperitoneally). Both drugs significantly attenuated HFD-induced weight increase, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal serum levels of leptin and insulin, and co-treatment was more effective. Both drugs significantly alleviated HFD-induced AHR, increased macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and co-treatment was more effective on AHR.

In addition, faster aspart provides earlier onset, doubling of initial exposure, and an up to 2.-fold increase in initial glucose-lowering effect within 30 min of subcutaneous injection, as well as earlier offset of exposure and effect. Similar results have been shown using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The improved pharmacological properties of faster aspart versus IAsp are consistent across populations, i.e. in the elderly, children, adolescents and the Japanese. Thus, the faster aspart pharmacological characteristics more closely resemble the mealtime insulin secretion in healthy individuals, giving faster aspart the potential to further improve postprandial glucose control in subjects with . Indeed, change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increment is in favour of faster aspart versus IAsp when used as basal-bolus or CSII treatment in phase III trials in subjects with T1D or T2D. This review summarises the currently published results from clinical pharmacology trials with faster aspart and discusses the potential clinical benefits of faster aspart compared with previous rapid-acting insulin products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663504>Effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy on the Serum Sialic Acid Levels in Diabetic Patients with Periodontitis.</a></h2><p>Sialic acid (SA), a family of acetylated derivatives of neuraminic acid, an acute phase reactant by itself. It usually occurs as a terminal component at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids. SA participates in multiple physiological functions, such as cell-to-cell interactions, cell migration and proliferation.  (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by rise in blood glucose level. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissue, leading to destruction of bone surrounding the tooth and ultimately tooth loss. There is a two way relationship between  and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the sixth complication of  along with retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular disease, and altered wound healing. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced during periodontal inflammation can interfere with the actions of insulin receptors and worsen the glycemic control of diabetic patients. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss, affecting over 300 million people and bacteria associated with periodontitis are also linked with systemic problems like endocarditis, atherosclerosis. Recent work has highlighted a major role for the host sugar sialic acid in the biofilm physiology and host-pathogen interactions of T. forsithya, a key periodontal pathogen. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Serum sialic acids were estimated in Indian population by diphenylamine method and Thiobarbituric acid method. The average values were 68 ± 2.6 mg percent by DPA method and 56 ±  mg percent by TBA (thiobarbituric acid assay) method. Age and sex showed no influence on serum sialic acid level. Objectives of the present study was to compare (TSSA) level in healthy subjects, subjects with (CMP) with and without (NIDDM) and its effect on non-surgical periodontal therapy. In the present study, the participants were divided into three groups: Group A, B and C. Group A consists of systemically healthy subjects, Group B consists of subjects with (CMP) while Group C consists of subjects with (CMP) with (NIDDM) and results of this study indicated that, at baseline, there were significant differences between Group A, B and Group C with respect to all the clinical parameters, including (GI), (OHI-S), (PPD), (CAL), (TSSA) and (HbA1c) levels. Thus (TSSA) level could be considered as novel biomarker in the progression of periodontal disease and diabetic status. Periodontitis could be considered as a potential, modifiable, and independent risk factor for the development of . Early detection of elevated (TSSA) level may help in interpreting the progression of periodontitis, risk of development of  in future and also to prevent complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661475>[Proinflammatory Cytokines and Skin Wound Healing in Mice].</a></h2><p>Skin wound healing is subject to an intricate regulation, involves many cell populations and molecular mediators, and is one of the key mechanisms that ensures the barrier functions of the skin and the maintenance of body homeostasis. The efficiency of this process is largely determined by the balance of proinflammatory and proregenerative signals, which are mediated by cytokines. The review summarizes the latest data on the role of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interferons (IFNs), in skin wound healing, including those obtained with the use of genome editing techniques and methods of reverse genetics to establish relevant animal models. The roles that proinflammatory cytokines play at various stages of skin regeneration are discussed for both normal state and systemic pathologies, such as .

Concerning the progressive growth of use of Internet for educating patients and absence of different studies about education through use of weblogs in patients with  in Iran, the present study was conducted with the aim of determining the effect of self-management education through weblogs on the quality of life of affect the patients.This study was performed as intervention on patients referring to  clinic of Talghani hospital in Kermanshah in winter 2018 and spring 2019. The samples consisted of 98 patients with  chosen through available sampling and randomly assigned into study and control groups. For data collection,  quality of life (DQOL) short form clinical questionnaire, Persian version, was used. The intervention involved training self-management conducted through 60 sessions via a designed weblog. The obtained information was introduced into SPSS 21, and analyzed through Mann-Whitney, t-test, and paired t-test.According to the results of this study, the mean age of the examined patients was 32.1 ± 4.9 years, where the major participants were male (n = 52 in the test group, 52.%). The results showed that after the intervention, the test and control groups were different in terms of anthropometric variables and metabolic indicators; the mean waist circumference in the test and control groups was 98.6 ± 9.8 and 101. ± 7.8, respectively; the mean FBS following the intervention in the test and control groups was 131.08 ± 16.04 and 238.2 ± 40, respectively; and the mean BMI postintervention in the test and control groups was obtained as 27.3 ± 3.4 and 30.1 ± 3.8 respectively, where these differences were significant according to independent t-test (p < 0.05). The mean score of quality of life postintervention in the test and control groups was obtained as 56.1 and 49.9 respectively; according to Mann-Whitney test, the difference between the two groups was significant (p < 0.05).The results of the present study revealed the positive effect of weblog based self-management on the quality of life of patients with  following the intervention. Further, reduced levels of FBS, BMI, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also observed, which could be due to increased awareness of patients about their abilities, its risks, as well as the ways to control and treat it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665015>The management of very low-calorie ketogenic diet in obesity outpatient clinic: a practical guide.</a></h2><p>The epidemic of obesity is growing steadily across the whole world. Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 , cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose metabolism. Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management. Therefore, we will provide a useful guide to be used by nutrition experts taking care of subjects with obesity. In particular, we will report recommendations on the correct use of this therapeutic approach for weight loss and management of side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665997>Association Between Neighborhood Walkability and Predicted 10-Year Cardiovascular Disease Risk: The CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) Cohort.</a></h2><p>Background Individuals living in unwalkable neighborhoods appear to be less physically active and more likely to develop obesity, , and hypertension. It is unclear whether neighborhood walkability is a risk factor for future cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We studied residents living in major urban centers in Ontario, Canada on January 1, 2008, using linked electronic medical record and administrative health data from the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team) cohort. Walkability was assessed using a validated index based on population and residential density, street connectivity, and the number of walkable destinations in each neighborhood, divided into quintiles (Q). The primary outcome was a predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of ≥7.% (recommended threshold for statin use) assessed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equation. Adjusted associations were estimated using logistic regression models. Secondary outcomes included measured systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, prior  diagnosis, and current smoking status. In total, 44 448 individuals were included in our analyses. Fully adjusted analyses found a nonlinear relationship between walkability and predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk (least [Q1] versus most [Q5] walkable neighborhood: odds ratio =1.09, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.22), with the greatest difference between Q3 and Q5 (odds ratio=1.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.45). Dose-response associations were observed for systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and  risk, while an inverse association was observed with smoking status. Conclusions In our setting, adults living in less walkable neighborhoods had a higher predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk than those living in highly walkable areas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669388>Pharmacological potential of novel agonists for FFAR4 on islet and enteroendocrine cell function and glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the metabolic effects of FFAR4-selective agonists on islet and enteroendocrine cell hormone release and the combined therapeutic effectiveness with DPP-IV inhibitors.Insulinotropic activity and specificity of FFAR4 agonists were determined in clonal pancreatic BRIN-BD11 cells. Expression of FFAR4 was assessed by qPCR and western blotting following agonist treatment in BRIN-BD11 cells and by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets. Acute in-vivo effects of agonists was investigated after intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral administration in lean and HFF-obese diabetic mice.GSK137647 (10-10 M) and Compound-A (10-10 M) stimulated insulin secretion at .6mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) and 16.7mM (p<0.05-p<0.001) glucose in BRIN-BD11 cells, with no cytotoxicity effects as assessed by MTT. FFAR4 antagonist (AH-7614) abolished the insulintropic effect of GSK137647 (p<0.05-p<0.001), whilst FFAR1 antagonist (GW1100) had no effect. Incubation of BRIN-BD11 cells with GSK137647 and Compound-A increased FFAR4 (p<0.01) gene expression at 16.7 mM glucose, with a corresponding increase in FFAR4 (p<0.01) protein concentrations. FFAR4 upregulation was attenuated under normoglycaemic conditions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation of FFAR4 and insulin in mouse islets. Orally administered GSK137647 or Compound-A (0.1µmol/kgBW) improved glucose tolerance (p<0.001), increased plasma insulin (p<0.001), GLP-1 (p<0.05), GIP (p<0.05) and induced satiety (p<0.001) in HFF mice, with glucose-lowering effects enhanced in combination with DPP-IV inhibitor (Sitagliptin) (p<0.05).Specific FFAR4 agonism improves glucose tolerance through insulin and incretin secretion, with enhanced DPP-IV inhibition in combination with Sitagliptin.These findings have for the first time demonstrated that selective FFAR4 activation regulates both islet and enteroendocrine hormone function with agonist combinational therapy, presenting a promising strategy for the treatment of type-2-.Copyright © 2019.

OGTT was performed at the 3rd trimester. Women were categorized as non-smokers (A), as those who ceased smoking at pregnancy (B), and as smokers (C).,434 (73.1%) women were group A, 1,191 (16%) group B and 812 (10.9%) group C. The rates of GDM among the groups were: A 33.7%, B 34.2%, C 34.2% (ns). However, the number of individuals requiring insulin treatment was significantly different: A 39.2%, B 47.%, C 50.6% (p<0.001). Regarding OGTT, fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in group C (89+13 vs 86+12mg/dl) compared to A, whereas 3-h glucose values were significantly lower (104+33 vs 112+32mg/dl) (p<0.001). Group B demonstrated intermediate glucose concentrations. Similar findings were observed in women without GDM. In women with GDM, higher 1-h glucose levels were measured in group C (210+31 vs 205+28mg/dl) compared with A (p=0.024). Further, group C sub-analysis found that those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes showed significantly lower 3-h glucose levels (111+31 vs 128+40mg/dl) compared to those who smoked less than 10 (p=0.006).

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of this reform experienced by patients with type 2 . The objective was also to explore if socio-economic status affects this experience.The data were collected by conducting a survey among Finnish adults with type 2  (n = 603). The baseline survey was conducted in November-December 2016. A second follow-up survey was conducted at the end of 2017 where the participants' experience of the reimbursement reform was surveyed with an open-ended question. Free-form inductive content analysis was used to categorize the answers. The association between the participants' characteristics and reporting an effect caused by the reimbursement reform was studied with binomial logistic regression.285 (47.3%) participants reported an effect of some kind caused by the reimbursement reform. The most common reported effects were economic effects (32.7%) and annoyance (12.4%). Having financial difficulties in purchasing antidiabetic medicines (odds ratio (OR) .20, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 2.99-9.06) or not having annual deductible exceeded (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.19-3.95), and use of certain antidiabetic medication groups at baseline were associated with reporting an effect. Socio-economic status was not associated with the likelihood of reporting an effect.Almost half of the participants with type 2  reported an effect, most commonly economic effects, such as increased expenditure or difficulty in purchasing medicines, after the reimbursement reform. It is important to study the effects of reimbursement reforms also from the patients' perspective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667614>Impact of age on morbidity and mortality following bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery is the most effective modality to treat obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. This study sought to utilize the MBASQIP® Data Registry to analyze the impact of age at time of surgery on outcomes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures.The MBSAQIP® Data Registry for patients undergoing SG or RYGB procedures between 2015 and 2016 was reviewed. Patients were divided into 4 age groups [18-44; 45-54; 55-64; > 65 years]. Minimal exclusions for revisional and/or emergency surgery were selected and combination variables created to classify complications as major or minor. A comorbidity index was constructed to include , gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and prior cardiac surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare age stratifications to the young adult (18-45 years) cohort.Of 301,605 cases, 279,419 cases (71.2% SG) remained after applying exclusion criteria (79.2% female, mean BMI 45. ± 8.1 kg/m, 8.9% insulin-dependent diabetics). Mean age was 44.7 ± 12.0 years (51.3% 18-44 years; 26.9% 45-54 years; 16.3% 55-64 years; .% > 65 years). A univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative differences of lower BMI with increasing age concomitant with increasing frequency of RYGB and a higher comorbidity index (p < 0.0001 vs. 18-45 years). At age > 45 years, major complications and 30-day mortality increased independent of procedure type (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis controlling for comorbidity indices demonstrated increasing age (> 45 years) increased risk for major complications and mortality.Overall, bariatric surgery (SG or RYGB) remains a low mortality risk procedure for all age groups. However, all age group classifications > 45 years had higher incidence of major complications and mortality compared to patients 18-45 years (despite older individuals having lower preoperative BMI) indicating delaying surgery is detrimental.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669188>The Avoiding  After Pregnancy Trial in Moms Program: Feasibility of a  Prevention Program for Women With Recent Gestational .</a></h2><p>Our aim in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based  prevention program, delivered by interdisciplinary certified  educators (CDEs), and customized for postpartum women with recent gestational  (GDM).This pilot randomized trial recruited women with GDM from 24 to 40 weeks gestation from 4 centres, and trained 10 CDEs in behaviour coaching, physical activity (PA) and low glycemic index education.

Although a case of possible ceritinib-induced hyperglycemia was reported, the association of ceritinib with hyperglycemia remains to be investigated. Disproportionality analysis was conducted using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, which contains all pharmacovigilance data based on spontaneous reports of adverse events between April 2004 and November 2018 to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) of ceritinib for hyperglycemia was 2.25 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-4.08], while those of crizotinib and alectinib were 0.07 (0.01-0.40) and 0.94 (0.30-2.94), respectively. Among reported events without anti- agent use, the ROR of ceritinib was still 2.54 (1.27-.12).

Low-frequency ultrasound treatment promotes the repair of various injuries and may promote wound healing. The aim of the present study was to determine whether low-frequency ultrasound can accelerate wound healing, as well as investigate its effects on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in diabetic rats. A total of 45 Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with 1% streptozocin following intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. Subsequently an incision wound was created in the skin of back. The area of the wound was recorded to calculate the rate of wound healing. The expression of VEGF and TGF-β1 was determined via immunohistochemical analysis and their mRNA and protein levels were measured via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis. The results revealed that when compared with the control group, low-frequency ultrasound treatment significantly increased wound healing rate in diabetic rats and markedly increased the mRNA and protein levels of VEGF and TGF-β1. US treatment also reduced the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that low-frequency ultrasound promotes the expression of VEGF and TGF-β1, and inhibits the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby promoting wound healing in diabetic rats.Copyright: © Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657338>[Effects of circadian heart rate variation on short-term and long-term mortality in intensive care unit patients: a retrospective cohort study based on MIMIC-II database].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of circadian heart rate variation on short-term and long-term mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.A retrospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 32 536 ICU patients were recorded from 2001 to 2008 published by Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II v2.6) in April 2011. The circadian heart rate variation was defined as the ratio of mean nighttime (23:00 to 07:00) heart rate to mean daytime (07:00 to 23:00) heart rate. The 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality were defined as outcome events. The information such as age, gender, ethnicity, first sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, first simplified acute physiology score I (SAPS I), usage of sedatives and catecholamines within 24 hours admission of ICU, clinical complications [hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),  with or without complications, congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal failure, etc.], and the complete heart rate records within 24 hours after ICU admission were collected. Cox proportional risk regression models were used to investigate the association between circadian heart rate variation and 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality in ICU patients. Besides, subgroup analysis was also performed in patients with different first SOFA scores.Totally 15 382 ICU patients in MIMIC-II database were enrolled, excluding the patients without heart rate records or death records, using pacemaker with arrhythmia, without SOFA or SAPS I score records. Finally, 9 439 patients were enrolled in the study cohort. (1) Cox regression analysis of the whole patient showed that the higher circadian heart rate variation was correlated with the increased 28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.613, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.338-1.943, P < 0.001] and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.573, 95%CI was 1.296-1.908, P < 0.001). After adjustment for demographic factors (age, gender and ethnicity), severity of illness (SOFA and SAPS I scores), clinical complications (hypertension, COPD,  with or without complications, congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal failure, etc.), and influence of medications (sedatives and catecholamines), the night-day heart rate ratio was also correlated with 28-day mortality (HR = 1.256, 95%CI was 1.018-1.549, P = 0.033) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.249, 95%CI was 1.010-1.545, P = 0.040). (2) According to the SOFA score (median value of ), the patients were divided into two subgroups, in which  478 patients with SOFA score ≤  and 3 961 patients with SOFA score > . Cox regression subgroup analysis showed that circadian heart rate variation was related with higher 28-day mortality (HR = 1.430, 95%CI was 1.164-1.756, P = 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.393, 95%CI was 1.123-1.729, P = 0.003) in patients with SOFA score > . After adjustment for covariates, the 28-day mortality (HR = 1.279, 95%CI was 1.032-1.584, P = 0.025) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.255, 95%CI was 1.010-1.558, P = 0.040) also increased with the increasing of night-day heart rate ratio in patients with SOFA score > . However, the relationships did not exist in patients with SOFA score ≤ .In ICU patients, the 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality increase with the higher circadian heart rate variation, which indicates that the circadian heart rate variation in ICU patients is positively correlated with the short-term and long-term mortality, especially in patients with relatively severe illness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663937>Distally Based Sural Adipofascial Turnover Flap for Coverage of Complicated Wound in the Foot and Ankle Region.</a></h2><p>Distally based perforator propeller flap from the lower leg region is a versatile local reconstructive technique for the foot and ankle defects. However, flap venous congestion remains a tough nut to crack. We hypothesize that raising an adipofascial flap with turnover mode of transposition can improve venous drainage and enhance flap safety.Based on the 2 rows of septocutaneous perforators in the posterior distal third of the lower leg, distally based adipofascial flap was raised from medial sural region nourished by 1 perforator bundle from the posterior tibial artery or from the lateral sural region from the peroneal artery. The superficial dissection was performed in subdermal plane and deep in to the subfascial space. The flap was nourished by perforator-plus-adipofascial pedicle and turned over 180 degrees upside down to reach the distal wounds. One week later, a split-skin graft was used to cover the exposed fascial flap. Postoperatively, flap survival, complications, and patient functional recovery were evaluated.Distally based sural turnover adipofascial flaps were used in 12 cases with complicated wounds of the distal third lower leg, foot, and ankle region. All wounds were caused by trauma and experienced fracture implants fixation and  with osteomyelitis. The comorbidities include  in 9 cases and smoking in 7. There were 8 medial ural flaps and 4 lateral sural flaps. The adipofiscial flaps measured from 6.0 cm × .0 cm to 17.0 cm × 6.0 cm (mean, 61.3 cm). Postoperatively, all flaps survived uneventfully without any complication such as flap ischemia and/or necrosis. Two minor donor site complications were encountered, one was postoperative hematoma, and another was hyperproliferative scar. After a mean of 14.6 months of follow-up, the adipofascial flap plus skin graft showed a durable esthetic coverage, with normal shoe wearing and walking.Distally based sural adipofascial turnover flap is a simple and reliable wound coverage technique. It avoids venous congestion as usually seen in distally based fasciocutaneous flaps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 : a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2  at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without . Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term ( weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2  affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for  weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2  with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an existing app-based intervention to improve physical activity, diet, and sleep quality in a shift-worker population, (2) estimate intervention effect in a four-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ACTRN12618001785291). Shift-workers (18-65 years old) were randomized to intervention ( = 20) or wait-list ( = 20) groups. Outcomes included recruitment, engagement, attrition, usefulness ratings, System Usability Scale (SUS), qualitative interviews, and estimation of treatment effect (minutes of physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality) using mixed model analysis. Recruitment took one week. App-use at week four was 55% (11/20), 85% (34/40) completed the four-week follow-up questionnaire, and 20% (4/20) of the intervention group completed the qualitative interview. The intervention was rated as slightly to moderately useful by 76.9% (10/13) of participants on a five-point scale. The SUS score was 62.7 (12.7) out of 100. Diet quality improved for the intervention (4. points; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.1, 8.9;  = 0.047) vs. the wait-list group, but not physical activity or sleep quality. Qualitative interviews found that a more tailored intervention, more accessible information, and interactive features were desired. The intervention was feasible in terms of recruitment, but modifications to increase engagement are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672783>Ergothioneine is associated with reduced mortality and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>We recently identified a health conscious food pattern (HCFP) associated with reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease. However, the molecular events linking the healthy food pattern to reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease are unknown. Our aim was to identify plasma metabolites associated with the HCFP and test if such metabolites predict cardiometabolic disease and mortality.Using liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry, 112 plasma metabolites were measured in 3236 participants without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and  from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer study. Metabolites associated with the HCFP were identified using multivariable adjusted linear regressions followed by Bonferroni correction. The healthy dietary biomarkers were subsequently related to risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality during long-term follow-up with multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.During a median follow-up time of 21.4 years, 603 participants developed CVD, 362 developed  and 843 participants died. Five healthy dietary biomarkers were associated with the HCFP at baseline (p<0.0004) and four predicted at least one of the studied end points (p<0.05). Ergothioneine was the metabolite most strongly connected to the HCFP and was associated with a lower risk of coronary disease (HR per 1 SD increment of ergothioneine, HR=0.85, p=0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.79, p=0.002) and overall mortality (HR=0.86, p=4e-).We identified that higher ergothioneine was an independent marker of lower risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality, which potentially can be induced by a specific healthy dietary intake.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Four previous studies in U.S have found that higher DD scores were associated with worse psychological outcomes, lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased risk of T2DM complications. In this study, we aimed to firstly compare DD scores in Indonesian T2DM outpatients treated in primary care versus those in tertiary care. Subsequently, we investigated whether socio-demographic characteristics and clinical conditions explain potential differences in DD score across healthcare settings.A cross-sectional study was conducted on Java island in three primary care (n = 108) and four tertiary care (n = 524) facilities. The participants completed the Bahasa Indonesia version of the  Distress Scale questionnaire (DDS17 Bahasa Indonesia). Ordinal regression analysis was conducted with the quartile of the summation of the DD score as the dependent variable to investigate how the association between the level of healthcare facilities and DD altered when adding different variables in the model.The final adjusted model showed that the level of healthcare facilities was strongly associated with DD (p < .001), with participants in primary care having a 3.68 times (95% CI 2.46-.55) higher likelihood of being more distressed than the participants in tertiary care. This association was detected after including the socio-demographic characteristics and clinical conditions as model confounders.This is the first study in Indonesia to compare DD scores within different healthcare facilities. We recommend a regular DD assessment, possibly closely aligned with health-literacy partner programs, especially for T2DM patients in primary care settings.</p></html>
