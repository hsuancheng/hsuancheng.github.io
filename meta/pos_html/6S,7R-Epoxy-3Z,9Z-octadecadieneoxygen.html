This complex is formed following the equilibrium reaction Pt(CN)(4)(2-) + Tl(dmso)(6)(3+) ⇆ (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) + dmso. The stability constant of the Pt-Tl bonded species, as determined using (13)C NMR spectroscopy, amounts to log K = 2.9 ± 0.2. The (NC)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) species constitutes the first example of a Pt-Tl bonded cyanide complex in which the sixth coordination position around Pt (in trans with respect to the Tl atom) is not occupied. The spectral parameters confirm the formation of the metal-metal bond, but differ substantially from those measured earlier in aqueous solution for complexes (CN)(5)Pt-Tl(CN)(n)(H(2)O)(x)(n-) (n = 0-3). The (205) Tl NMR chemical shift, δ = 75 ppm, is at extraordinary high field, while spin-spin coupling constant, (1)J(Pt-Tl) = 93 kHz, is the largest measured to date for a Pt-Tl bond in the absence of supporting bridging ligands. The absorption spectrum is dominated by two strong absorption bands in the UV region that are assigned to MMCT (Pt → Tl) and LMCT (dmso → Tl) bands, respectively, on the basis of MO and TDDFT calculations. The solution of the complex has a bright yellow color as a result of a shoulder present on the low energy side of the band at 355 nm. The geometry of the (CN)(4)Pt-Tl core can be elucidated from NMR data, but the particular stoichiometry and structure involving the dmso ligands are established by using Tl and Pt L(III)-edge EXAFS measurements. The Pt-Tl bond distance is 2.67(1) Å, the Tl-O bond distance is 2.282(6) Å, and the Pt-C-N entity is linear with Pt-C and Pt···N distances amounting to 1.969(6) and 3.096(6) Å, respectively. Geometry optimizations on the (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) system by using DFT calculations (B3LYP model) provide bond distances in excellent agreement with the EXAFS data. The four cyanide ligands are located in a square around the Pt atom, while the Tl atom is coordinated in a distorted octahedral fashion with the metal being located 0.40 Å above the equatorial plane described by four  atoms of dmso ligands. The four equatorial Tl-O bonds and the four cyano ligands around the Pt atom are arranged in an alternate geometry. The coordination environment around Pt may be considered as being square pyramidal, where the apical position is occupied by the Tl atom. The optimized geometry of (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) is asymmetrical (C(1) point group). This low symmetry might be responsible for the unusually large NMR linewidths observed due to intramolecular chemical exchange processes. The nature of the Pt-Tl bond has been studied by MO analysis. The metal-metal bond formation in (CN)(4)Pt-Tl(dmso)(5)(+) can be simply interpreted as the result of a Pt(5d(z(2)))(2) → Tl()(0) donation. This bonding scheme may rationalize the smaller thermodynamic stability of this adduct compared to the related complexes with (CN)(5)Pt-Tl entity, where the linear C-Pt-Tl unit constitutes a very stable bonding system.© 2011 American Chemical Society</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16026035> uptake kinetics and time to exhaustion in cycling and running: a comparison between trained and untrained subjects.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present study was to compare pulmonary gas exchange kinetics (VO2 kinetics) and time to exhaustion (Tlim) between trained and untrained individuals during severe exercise performed on a cycle ergometer and treadmill. Eleven untrained males in running (UR) and cycling (UC), nine endurance cyclists (EC), and seven endurance runners (ER) were submitted to the following tests on separate days: (i) incremental test for determination of maximal  uptake (VO2max) and the intensity associated with the achievement of VO2max (IVO2max) on a mechanical braked cycle ergometer (EC and UC) and on a treadmill (ER and UR); (ii) all-out exercise bout performed at IVO2max to determine the time to exhaustion at IVO2max (Tlim) and the time constant of  uptake kinetics (tau). The tau was significantly faster in trained group, both in cycling (EC = 28.2 +/- 4.7s; UC = 63.8 +/- 25.0s) and in running (ER = 28.5 +/- 8.5s; UR = 59.3 +/- 12.0s). Tlim of untrained was significantly lower in cycling (EC = 384.4 +/- 66. vs. UC; 311.1 +/- 105.7 s) and higher in running (ER = 309.2 +/- 176.6 s vs. UR = 439.8 +/- 104.2 s). We conclude that the VO2 kinetic response at the onset of severe exercise, carried out at the same relative intensity is sensitive to endurance training, irrespective of the exercise type. The endurance training seems to differently influence Tlim during exercise at IVO2max in running and cycling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15326522>Barriers to internal rotation around the C-N bond in 3-(o-aryl)-5-methyl-rhodanines using NMR spectroscopy and computational studies. Electron density topological analysis of the transition states.</a></h1><p>We have investigated the pairs of rotational isomers for six 3-(o-aryl)-5-methyl-rhodanines (Z = H, F, Cl, Br, OH, and CH3) using NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electron density topological and NBO analysis has demonstrated the importance of non-covalent interactions, characterised by (3, -1) bond critical points (BCPs), between the  and sulfur atoms on the thiazolidine ring with the aryl substitutents in stabilizing the transition states. The energetic activation barriers to rotation have also been determined using computational results; rotational barriers for 3-(o-chlorophenyl)-5-methyl-rhodanine (3S) and 3-(o-tolyl)-5-methyl-rhodanine () were determined experimentally based on NMR separation of the diastereoisomeric pairs, and the first-order rate constants used to derive the value of the rotational barrier from the Eyring equation.Copyright 2004 The Royal Society of Chemistry</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15063207>Stereoselective synthesis of chirally deuterated (S)-D-(6-(2)H(1))glucose.</a></h1><p>Chirally deuterated (S)-D-(6-(2)H(1))glucose has been prepared in good overall yield from d-(6,6'-(2)H(2))glucose by a short, five-step synthesis from D-(6,6-(2)H(2))glucose utilizing (R)-(+)-Alpine-Borane [(R)-9-[(6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl)methyl]-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane].

SPase functions to release proteins that have been translocated into the inner membrane from the cell interior, by cleaving off their signal peptides. We report here the X-ray crystal structure of a catalytically active soluble fragment of E. coli SPase (SPase delta2-75). We have determined this structure at 1.9 A resolution in a complex with an inhibitor, a beta-lactam (5S, penem), which is covalently bound as an acyl-enzyme intermediate to the gamma- of a serine residue at position 90, demonstrating that this residue acts as the nucleophile in the hydrolytic mechanism of signal-peptide cleavage. The structure is consistent with the use by SPase of Lys 145 as a general base in the activation of the nucleophilic Ser90, explains the specificity requirement at the signal-peptide cleavage site, and reveals a large exposed hydrophobic surface which could be a site for an intimate association with the membrane. As enzymes that are essential for cell viability, bacterial SPases present a feasible antibacterial target: our determination of the SPase structure therefore provides a template for the rational design of antibiotic compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11540056>Investigation of the proton-assisted pathway to formation of the catalytically active, ferryl species of P450s by molecular dynamics studies of P450eryF.</a></h1><p>The recently determined crystal structure of cytochrome P450eryF (6-deoxyerythronolide B hydroxylase; CYP107A1) in its ferric heme substrate-bound form has been used to address one of the most fundamental unresolved aspects of the mechanism of oxidation common to this ubiquitous family of metabolizing heme proteins, the pathway from the twice reduced dioxygen species to the putative catalytically active ferryl  species. Both of these species are too transient to have been characterized experimentally, and the transformation from one to the other has been only partially characterized. The observed requirement of two protons and the formation of water in this transformation suggests a proton-assisted dioxygen bond cleavage as a plausible pathway. However, this pathway is difficult to establish by experiment alone, and the source of the protons in the largely hydrophobic binding pocket of the P450s remains unclear. In this work we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the twice reduced dioxygen substrate-bound form of this isozyme in order to (i) determine the plausibility of the proposed pathway to compound I formation, a proton-assisted cleavage of the dioxygen bond, and (ii) investigate the possible source of these protons. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories of this species does indeed provide further evidence for this pathway and points to a source of protons. Specifically, two dynamically stable hydrogen bonds to the distal  atom of the dioxygen ligand, one by the substrate and the other by a bound water, are found, consistent with the proposed proton-assisted cleavage of the bond and formation of water. In addition, an extensive dynamically stable hydrogen bond network is formed that connects the distal  to Glu 360, a well-conserved residue in a channel accessible to solvent that could be the ultimate source of protons. The simulations were done for both a protonated and unprotonated Glu and led to a proposed mechanism of proton transfer by it to the distal  atom. In order to validate the procedures used for the simulation of this transient twice-reduced species, we have used these same procedures to perform molecular dynamics simulations of two other forms of P450eryF, the ferric and ferryl substrate-bound species, and compared the results with experiment. The results for the ferric substrate-bound species were assessed by comparisons to the experimentally determined X-ray structure and fluctuations, and good agreement was found. The simulations performed for the ferryl substrate-bound species led to the correct prediction of the observed regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation of its natural substrate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB) at the  position. The results of these two additional studies lend credibility to the important mechanistic inferences from the simulations of the transient twice reduced dioxygen species: further evidence for a proton-assisted pathway from it to the catalytically active ferryl species and a possible source of the protons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23901790>Design of medium band gap Ag-Bi-Nb-O and Ag-Bi-Ta-O semiconductors for driving direct water splitting with visible light.</a></h1><p>Two new metal oxide semiconductors belonging to the Ag-Bi-M-O (M = Nb, Ta) chemical systems have been synthesized as candidate compounds for driving overall water splitting with visible light on the basis of cosubstitution of Ag and Bi on the A-site position of known Ca2M2O7 pyrochlores. The low-valence band edge energies of typical oxide semiconductors prevents direct water splitting in compounds with band gaps below 3.0 eV, a limitation which these compounds are designed to overcome through the incorporation of low-lying Ag 4d(10) and Bi (2) states into compounds of nominal composition "AgBiM2O7". It was found that the "AgBiTa2O7" pyrochlores are in fact a solid solution with an approximate range of Ag(x)Bi(5/6)Ta2O(6.25+x/2) with 0.5 < x < 1. The structure of Ag4/5Bi5/6Ta2O6.65 was determined from the refinement of time-of-flight neutron diffraction data and was found to be a cubic pyrochlore with a = 10.52268(2) Å and a volume of 1165.143(6) Å(3). The closely related compound, AgBiNb2O7, appears to have an integer stoichiometry and to adopt an orthorhombically distorted pyrochlore-related structure with a subcell of a = 7.50102(8) Å, b = 7.44739(7) Å, c = 10.5788(1) Å, and V = 590.93(2) Å(3). Density functional theory-based calculations predict this distortion should result from A-site cation ordering. Fits to UV-vis diffuse reflectance data suggest that AgBiNb2O7 and "AgBiTa2O7" are both visible-light-absorbing semiconductors with the onset of strong direct absorption at 2.72 and 2.96 eV, respectively. Electronic structure calculations for an ordered AgBiNb2O7 structure show that the band gap reduction and the elevation of the valence band primarily result from hybridized Ag d(10)-O 2p orbitals that lie at higher energy than the normal O 2p states in typical pyrochlore oxides. While the minimum energy gap is direct in the band structure, the lowest energy dipole allowed optical transitions start about 0.2 eV higher in energy than the minimum energy transition and involve different bands. This suggests that the minimum electronic band gap in these materials is slightly smaller than the onset energy for strong absorption in the optical measurements. The elevated valence band energies of the niobate and tantalate compounds are experimentally confirmed by the ability of these compounds to reduce 2 H(+) to H2 gas when illuminated after functionalization with a Pt cocatalyst.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884935>Effects of chronic episodic hypoxia on monoamine metabolism and motor activity.</a></h1><p>Chronic episodic hypoxia produces a wide array of cardiovascular dysfunctions in rats, including increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity. The action of episodic hypoxia might be related to low  itself (hypoxemia) and/or combined with low CO2 (hypocapnia) resulting from hyperventilation. It is unknown whether or not the cardiovascular abnormalities are related to alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) that may be manifested as neurotransmitter and/or behavioral changes. In this study, we investigated effects of episodic eucapnic and hypocapnic hypoxia on monoamine metabolism in both CNS and adrenal glands, and on motor behavioral activity. Thirty-five male rats were divided into 3 groups. Experimental rats were exposed 8 h daily to varying fractional concentrations of inspired  (FiO2) and carbon dioxide (FiCO2) for 35 days. These consisted of brief exposures (3-) of episodic (twice every min) eucapnic (3.5% FiO2 and 10% FiCO2, n = 6) or hypocapnic (3.5% FiO2 and 0% FiCO2, n = 14) hypoxia, or room air (21% FiO2 and 0.03% FiCO2, n = 15). Norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and adrenal glands were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Spontaneous behavioral activity was assessed for 30 min by automated activity monitors. Episodic hypocapnic hypoxia produced a decrease in dopamine turnover and eucapnic hypoxia increased norepinephrine levels in the hypothalamus. Animals exposed to hypocapnic hypoxia also exhibited a consistent increase in horizontal (walking) and vertical (rearing) activity, as well as in total activity time. From these results, it is concluded that episodic eucapnic and hypocapnic hypoxia may affect metabolism of different neurotransmitters in the CNS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29229534>A novel compound DT-010 protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish and H9c2 cells by inhibiting reactive  species-mediated apoptotic and autophagic pathways.</a></h1><p>Doxorubicin (Dox) is an effective anti-cancer agent but limited by its cardiotoxicity, thus the search for pharmacological agents for enhancing anti-cancer activities and protecting against cardiotoxicity has been a subject of great interest. We have previously reported the synergistic anti-cancer effects of a novel compound DT-010. In the present study, we further investigated the cardioprotective effects of DT-010 in zebrafish embryos in vivo and the molecular underlying mechanisms in H9c2 cardiomyocytes in vitro. We showed that DT-010 prevented the Dox-induced morphological distortions in the zebrafish heart and the associated cardiac impairments, and especially improved ventricular functions. By using H9c2 cells model, we showed that DT-010 directly inhibited the generation of reactive  species by Dox and protected cell death and cellular damage. We further observed that DT-010 protected against Dox-induced myocardiopathy via inhibiting downstream molecular pathways in response to oxidative stress, including reactive  species-mediated MAPK signaling pathways ERK and JNK, and apoptotic pathways involving the activation of caspase 3, caspase 7, and PARP signaling. Recent studies also suggest the importance of alterations in cardiac autophagy in Dox cardiotoxicity. We further showed that DT-010 could inhibit the induction of autophagosomes formation by Dox via regulating the upstream Akt/AMPK/mTOR signaling. Since Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is multifactorial, our results suggest that multi-functional agent such as DT-010 might be an effective therapeutic agent for combating cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapeutic agents such as Dox.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ordinary LTE behavior with good thermal stability is identified for the Mn sample, whereas unusual LTE with a preferably expanded interplanar distance of (040) is revealed for Co and Ni samples. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction patterns ( T-XRD), Raman spectra ( T-Raman), and specific heat capacities ( T- C) consistently indicate that a rare isostructural displacive phase transition (IDPT) with a second-order phase transition nature is predominant near the critical temperature. Refinements of neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and in situ T-XRD data present temperature-sensitive bond parameters which are relevant to planar oxygen O1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) further confirm the Jahn-Teller (J-T) activated Co (HS) or Ni (HS/LS) cations at the B-site sublattice. This unusual LTE behavior could be understood by the cooperative J-T effect contributed by a Pb ion and Co/Ni ion from A- and B-site sublattices, respectively. The importance of (Pb)-2p(O)-3d(Co/Ni) extended orbital hybridization on affecting thermal expansion behavior is highlighted on the basis of temperature-induced phonon mode softening. This study presents a microscopic description of connection between anisotropic thermal expansion and a cooperative J-T effect, which inspired exploration of thermal-mechanical coupled functional materials based on LaPbMSbO double perovskites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20879796>DFT study of the structure and reactivity of the terminal Pt(IV)-oxo complex bearing no electron-withdrawing ligands.</a></h1><p>The recently published [(PCN)Pt═O](+) complex is interesting as a unique example of a stable d(6) terminal transition metal oxo complex not stabilized by electron withdrawing ligands and as a model of oxo complexes frequently implicated as key intermediates in various processes of  transfer. In the present work, we report an extensive DFT study of its geometric and electronic structure, composition in solution, and reactivity. The thermodynamic data and calculated (195)Pt NMR chemical shifts reveal that one solvent molecule is weakly coordinated to the complex in acetone solution. This ancillary ligand is responsible for the diamagnetic state of the complex, retards intramolecular  transfer, and facilitates CO oxidation. Chemical transformations of the coordinated acetone molecule, coordination of other ancillary ligands present in the reaction mixture, and protonation of the Pt-oxo group in nonacidic media are excluded based on thermodynamic or kinetic considerations. Bonding of the terminal oxo ligand with strong electrophiles presents the key interaction in the mechanisms of intramolecular  insertion into the Pt-P bond, in CO oxidation and in water activation mediated by microsolvation. Low affinity of the terminal oxo ligand toward "soft" covalent interactions brings about intermediate formation of agostic hydrido and hydroxo complexes along the reaction pathway of dihydrogen oxidation. Stabilization of the Pt-oxo bonding is attributed to bending of the terminal oxo ligand out of the plane of the complex and to significant transfer of electron density from compact low lying Pt 5d orbitals to more diffuse  and 6p orbitals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27388522>Syntheses of Highly -functionalized Derivatives of Dihydrodihydroxyphthalic Acid in Enantiomerically Enriched Forms.</a></h1><p>Starting from dihydrodihydroxyphthalic acid (DDP), (1R, 2S, 5R, )-(-)-3,4-bis(benzyloxymethyl)-5-hydroxy-8,8-dimethyl-6,8-dioxabicyclo[4.3.0]non-3-en-2-yl chloroacetate (>95%e.e.), a highly -functionalized derivative, was prepared by a combination of chemical and enzymatic reactions.

Xe atoms are desorbed from the oxidized Si(100) surface by the irradiation of photons in the range 1.16-6.43 eV. Two velocity components with average kinetic energy 0.85 and 0.25 eV are observed in the time-of-flight distributions. The fast component appears only if the photon energy exceeds approximately 3 eV, but the slow component is present over the entire photon energy range. By analogy with the photochemistry of methane on metal surfaces, the excitation mechanism responsible for the fast component is postulated to be a transition from the 5p state of Xe to the excited state originating from strong hybridization between the  state of Xe and the dangling bond at a surface silicon atom bonded to  inserted in the dimer bond. In this scheme an excited electron is transferred from the adsorbate to the substrate, which is the reverse direction to the substrate-mediated excitation frequently assumed in surface photochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6117320>Kinetic properties of tyrosine hydroxylase with natural tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor.</a></h1><p>A reproducible purification procedure of native tyrosine hydroxylase (L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine :  oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.16.2) from the soluble fraction of the bovine adrenal medulla has been established. This procedure accomplished a 90-fold purification with a recovery of 30% of the activity. This purified enzyme served for studying the kinetic properties of tyrosine hydroxylase using (6R)-L-erythro-1',2'-dihydroxypropyltetrahydropterin [(6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin] as cofactor, which is supposed to be a natural cofactor. Two different Km values for tyrosine,  and natural (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin itself were obtained depending on the concentration of the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor. In contrast, when unnatural ()-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin was used as cofactor, a single Km value for each tyrosine,  and the cofactor was obtained independent of the cofactor concentration. The lower Km value for (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin was close to the tetrahydrobiopterin concentration in tissue, indicating a high affinity of the enzyme to the natural cofactor under the in vivo conditions. Tyrosine was inhibitory at 100 microM with (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor, and the inhibition by tyrosine was dependent on the concentrations of both pterin cofactor and .  at concentrations higher than 4.8% was also inhibitory with (6R)-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21453796>The effect of pedal rate on pulmonary O2 uptake kinetics during very heavy intensity exercise in trained and untrained teenage boys.</a></h1><p>This study tested the hypothesis that the VO2 kinetic response would be slowed in untrained (UT) but not trained (T) teenage participants whilst cycling at 115 rev min(-1) compared to 50 rev min(-1). Eight UT and seven T boys completed two square-wave transitions to very heavy-intensity exercise pedalling at 50 rev min(-1) and 115 rev min(-1). In UT at the higher pedal rate, the phase II VO2 was significantly (P < 0.01) slower (50 rev min(-1): 32 ± 5 vs. 115 rev min(-1): 42 ± 11 s) and the relative VO2 slow component was significantly (P < 0.01) elevated (50 rev min(-1): 10 ± 3 vs. 115 rev min(-1): 16 ± 5%). The phase II VO2 (50 rev min(-1): 26 ± 4 vs. 115 rev min(-1): 22 ± ) and relative VO2 slow component (50 rev min(-1): 14 ± 5 vs. 115 rev min(-1): 17 ± 3%) were unaltered by pedal rate in T (P > 0.05). These data are consistent with the notion that VO2 kinetics are influenced by muscle fibre recruitment in youth but this effect is attenuated in endurance trained teenage boys.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial demonstrated that in patients who survived >2 years, there was a significant advantage to infrainguinal bypass compared with endovascular intervention, which increased with time. Validated survival models for patients with CLTI are lacking.The Vascular Quality Initiative was interrogated for patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass or endovascular intervention for CLTI (January 2003-February 2017). Cox survival models were generated using only preoperative variables. Survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years was modeled separately. Patients were defined as low risk (30-day survival >97% and 2-year survival >70%), medium risk (30-day survival 95%-97% or 2-year survival 50%-70%), and high-risk (30-day survival <95% or 2-year survival <50%).Among 38,470 unique CLTI patients, 63% (n = 24,214) underwent endovascular intervention and 37% (n = 14,256) underwent infrainguinal bypass. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years were 98%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. The proportion of patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups was 84%, 10%, and 6.5%, respectively. Patients in the low-risk group were significantly less likely to undergo endovascular intervention compared with those in the high-risk group (low risk, 59% endovascular; high risk, 75% endovascular; P < .0001). Independent predictors of death were similar in all three models, with greatest magnitude of effect associated with age >80 years, -dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and bedbound status. The C index for the 30-day model, 2-year model, and 5-year model was 0.76, 0.72, and 0.71, respectively. Procedure type (open or endovascular) was not significant in any models and did not have an impact on C indices.These survival prediction models, derived from a large U.S. cohort of patients who underwent revascularization for CLTI, demonstrated good performance and should be validated. Most CLTI patients considered candidates for limb salvage were of average perioperative risk and were predicted to survive beyond 2 years. These models can differentiate patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups to facilitate evidence-based revascularization recommendations that are consistent with current treatment guidelines.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery.

This study resulted in the identification of 3 new sesquineolignans, named euryalins A-C (1-3), and 16 known compounds, which were all first isolated from this plant apart from 5,7,4-trihydroxy-flavanone. The antioxidant potential of the partial isolates was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging assay and mesangial cellular assay. Compounds 2, rel-(2α,3β)-7-O-methylcedrusin (4), syringylglycerol-8-O-4-(sinapyl alcohol) ether (5), and (+)-syringaresinol (7) were found to be most active on DPPH assay, whereas compounds 2, 4, 7, (1R,2R,5R,)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, and buddlenol E could significantly inhibit high glucose-stimulated reactive  species production in mesangial cells.

For this isotypic series, B = P is pyromorphite, B = As is mimetite and B = V is vanadinite. The ionic radius for As (0.355 Å) is similar to that of V (0.335 Å), and this is twice as large as that for P (0.170 Å). However, the c unit-cell parameter for mimetite is surprisingly different from that of vanadinite, although their unit-cell volumes, V, are almost equal to each other. No explanation was available for this peculiar c-axis value for mimetite. Structural parameters such as average 〈B-O〉 [4], 〈Pb1-O〉 [9] and 〈Pb2-OCl〉 [8] distances increase linearly with V (the coordination numbers for the cations are given in square brackets). Mimetite has a short Pb2-O1 distance, so the O1  atom interacts with the  lone-pair electrons of the Pb cation that causes the Cl-Cl distance (= c/2) to increase to the largest value in the series because of repulsion, which causes the c-axis to increase anomalously. Although Pb apatite minerals occur naturally in ore deposits, they are also formed as scaly deposits in lead water pipes that give rise to lead in tap water, as was found recently in Flint, Michigan, USA. It is important to identify Pb-containing phases in water-pipe deposits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411141>Properties of a novel linear sulfur response mode in a multiple flame photometric detector.</a></h1><p>A new linear sulfur response mode was established in the multiple flame photometric detector (mFPD) by monitoring HSO* emission in the red spectral region above 600nm. Optimal conditions for this mode were found by using a 750nm interference filter and  flows to the worker flames of this device that were about 10mL/min larger than those used for monitoring quadratic S2* emission. By employing these parameters, this mode provided a linear response over about 4 orders of magnitude, with a detection limit near 5.8×10(-11)gS/s and a selectivity of sulfur over carbon of about 3.5×10(3). Specifically, the minimum detectable masses for 10 different sulfur analytes investigated ranged from 0.4 to 3.6ng for peak half-widths spanning 4-. The response toward ten different sulfur compounds was examined and produced an average reproducibility of 1.7% RSD (n=10) and an average equimolarity value of 1.0±0.1. In contrast to this, a conventional single flame S2* mode comparatively yielded respective values of 6.7% RSD (n=10) and 1.1±0.4. HSO* emission in the mFPD was also found to be relatively much less affected by response quenching due to hydrocarbons compared to a conventional single flame S2* emission mode. Results indicate that this new alternative linear mFPD response mode could be beneficial for sulfur monitoring applications.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Daily total time, daily number and accumulated time from bouts (30s-5min,30s-10min,30s-15min,30s 30min,>5min,>10min,>15min, >30min) as well as daily number of sit-to-stand transitions were determined. Waist circumference (cm) was measured in standardized way. Participants' mean age was 52 years (SD 12.2). Mean waist circumference was 97cm (SD 12.3) in men and 87cm (SD 12.7) in women. According to multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, sit-to-stand transitions [standardised regression coefficient (β)= -0.14, 95%CI -0.20 to -0.09], standing bouts of 30s-5min (β= -0.21, 95%CI -0.26 to -0.15) and number of 30s-30min SB bouts (β=0.12, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.17) were most strongly associated with waist circumference.

J. (1978) 175, 887-897]. Above neutrality, exchange rates increased with increasing pH. Detailed studies were made on the desulpho enzyme under a variety of conditions, and exchange rate constants at 22 degrees C ranged from 0.16s -1 at pH 6.6 to 1. -1 at pH 11.3. The mechanism of proton exchange in the enzyme is discussed. The interpretation by the above workers that the strongly coupled proton of the active enzyme is on sulphur and that of the desulpho enzyme is on  remains valid (and is in agreement with other work), as do their proposals for the structures of the protonated and deprotonated species. However, pK values cannot be calculated from the exchange data. It is likely that the relatively low rates of exchange observed are due to the difference of structure between the protonated and the deprotonated forms. In the case of the desulpho enzyme, an exchange mechanism, which involves the proton exchanging both as such and along with  in the form of a hydroxyl ion, is discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9919683>18O exchange in suspensions of red blood cells: determination of parameters of mass spectrometer inlet system.</a></h1><p>A membrane inlet system to a mass spectrometer (MIMS) allows us to monitor the abundance of 18O in CO2 during the exchange of 18O between HCO3-, dissolved CO2 and H2O that occurs after dissolving 18O-labelled NaHCO3 in aqueous solution.

Here, the photocatalytic CO reduction behavior of defect-laden indium oxide (InO (OH)  ) is greatly enhanced through isomorphous substitution of In with Bi, providing fundamental insights into the catalytically active surface FLPs (i.e., In-OH···In) and the experimentally observed "volcano" relationship between the CO production rate and Bi substitution level. According to density functional theory calculations at the optimal Bi substitution level, the  electron pair of Bi hybridizes with the  in the neighboring In-OH Lewis base site, leading to mildly increased Lewis basicity without influencing the Lewis acidity of the nearby In Lewis acid site. Meanwhile, Bi can act as an extra acid site, serving to maximize the heterolytic splitting of reactant H, and results in a more hydridic hydride for more efficient CO reduction. This study demonstrates that isomorphous substitution can effectively optimize the reactivity of surface catalytic active sites in addition to influencing optoelectronic properties, affording a better understanding of the photocatalytic CO reduction mechanism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408328>Total Synthesis and Structure Revision of (-)-Illisimonin A, a Neuroprotective Sesquiterpenoid from the Fruits of .</a></h1><p>Illisimonin A was isolated from  and has a previously unreported tricyclic carbon framework.

Peripheral microcirculation was estimated by transcutaneous  pressure measurement (including reoxygenation potential after blood flow occlusion) and erythrocyte flow/velocity by a non-contact laser speckle method. All the measured parameters showed significant differences between diabetic and control subjects in the mean follow-up time of 49 (simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation) and 43 (solitary kidney transplantation) months. The data from patients after simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation revealed an improvement of transcutaneous  pressure measurement (rise from 46 +/- 2 mm Hg to 63 +/- 3 mmHg), reoxygenation time (fall from 224 +/- 12s to 114 +/- ) and laser speckle measurement (rise from 4.2 +/- 1.7 to 5.6 +/- 1.8 relative units). The control group with solitary kidney transplantation did not show a positive evaluation. Data from patients after simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation revealed an improvement in transcutaneous  pressure measurement, reoxygenation time and laser speckle measurement whereas the control group with solitary kidney transplantation did not show a positive evaluation.

The calculations included density functional theory, second-order perturbation theory, coupled cluster theory, and complete active space self-consistent field methods. The adiabatic ionization energy of the molecule and vibrational frequencies of the molecule and its cation were measured accurately for the first time from the MATI spectrum. Numerous ionization processes of lanthanum dioxide, peroxide, and superoxide were considered; the (3)B(2) ← (4)B(2) electronic transition of the dioxide was assigned upon comparison with the observed spectrum. The ionization energy and O-La-O bending frequency of the (4)B(2) neutral state are 4.9760 (6) eV and 92 cm(-1), respectively. The La-O stretching and O-La-O bending frequencies of the (3)B(2) cationic state are 656 and 122 cm(-1), respectively.

Unfortunately, there remain physiological barriers that prevent achieving this resolution in practice. BOLD contrast relies on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity, whose associated cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) changes may spread over several millimeters and last several seconds. Recent reports have suggested that significant improvements may be possible with cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI, which highlights the CBV changes rather than the BOLD changes associated with the hemodynamic response. Nevertheless, quantitative comparisons between CBV and BOLD are sparse, in particular regarding their temporal characteristics in human brain. To address this, we studied a cohort of subjects that received injection of ferumoxytol, an intravascular iron-oxide based contrast agent that introduces strong CBV contrast. An event-related visual stimulus paradigm was used to compare the impulse response (IR) for CBV and BOLD contrast, obtained with and without ferumoxytol, respectively. Experiments performed at 7 T (n = 5) at 1.2-1.5 mm spatial and 1 s temporal resolution showed that the onset time and time-to-peak of the CBV IR averaged 0.8 and 3.5 s respectively, both 0.6 s shorter than the BOLD IR. While significant, these improvements are relatively small and not expected to lead to practical advantages for the extraction of temporal information about neural activity. Nonlinearities in the observed IR were also compared and found to be similar between the CBV and BOLD, indicating that these are likely not caused by a 'ceiling' effect in the CBO response, but rather support a previously proposed model of vascular compliance, in which changes in vascular tone elicited by a preceding stimulus affect the IR.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30439786>Two-Day Residence at 2500 m to 4300 m Does Not Affect Subsequent Exercise Performance at 4300 m.</a></h1><p>To determine the efficacy residing for 2 d at various altitudes while sedentary (S) or active (A; ~90 min hiking 2 d) on exercise performance at 4300 m.Sea-level (SL) resident men (n = 45) and women (n = 21) (mean ± SD; 23 ± 5 yr; 173 ± 9 cm; 73 ± 12 kg; V˙O2peak = 49 ± 7 mL·kg·min) were randomly assigned to a residence group and, S or A within each group: 2500 m (n = 11S, 8A), 3000 m (n = , 12A), 3500 m (n = , 8A), or 4300 m (n = 7S, 8A). Exercise assessments occurred at SL and 4300 m after 2-d residence and consisted of 20 min of steady-state (SS) treadmill walking (45% ± 3% SL V˙O2peak) and a 5-mile, self-paced running time trial (TT).

Its stereo-isomer -5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (-BH4) and structurally similar pterin 6R,S-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-D-neopterin (NH4) are also antioxidants but have no cofactor function. When endothelial nitric oxide synthase is 6R-BH4-deplete, it synthesizes superoxide rather than nitric oxide. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability by interaction with reactive  species is implicated in endothelial dysfunction (ED). 6R-BH4 corrects ED in animal models of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and in patients with cardiovascular risks. It is uncertain whether the effect of exogenous 6R-BH4 on ED is through its cofactor or antioxidant action.In healthy volunteers, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial infusion of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine, or the endothelium-independent vasodilator glyceryl trinitrate, before and after IRI. IRI reduced plasma total antioxidant status (P=0.03) and impaired vasodilatation to acetylcholine (P=0.01), but not to glyceryl trinitrate (P=0.3). Intra-arterial infusion of 6R-BH4, -BH4 and NH4 at approximately equimolar concentrations prevented IRI.IRI causes ED associated with increased oxidative stress that is prevented by 6R-BH4, -BH4, and NH4, an effect mediated perhaps by an antioxidant rather than cofactor function. Regardless of mechanism, 6R-BH4, -BH4, or NH4 may reduce tissue injury during clinical IRI syndromes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28328671>Hemorrhagic blood failure:  debt, coagulopathy, and endothelial damage.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20609257>Effect of 28 days of creatine ingestion on muscle metabolism and performance of a simulated cycling road race.</a></h1><p>The effects of creatine supplementation on muscle metabolism and exercise performance during a simulated endurance road race was investigated.Twelve adult male (27.3 +/- 1.0 yr, 178.6 +/- 1.4 cm, 78.0 +/- 2.5 kg, 8.9 +/- 1.1 %fat) endurance-trained (53.3 +/- 2.0 ml* kg-1* min-1, cycling ~160 km/wk) cyclists completed a simulated road race on a cycle ergometer (Lode), consisting of a two-hour cycling bout at 60% of peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak) with three 10-second sprints performed at 110% VO2 peak every 15 minutes. Cyclists completed the 2-hr cycling bout before and after dietary creatine monohydrate or placebo supplementation (3 g/day for 28 days). Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and five minutes before the end of the two-hour ride.There was a 24.5 +/- 10.0% increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 +/- 23.9% increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group (P < 0.05). Plasma glucose, blood lactate, and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride, as well as VO2 peak, were not affected by creatine supplementation. Submaximal  consumption near the end of the two-hour ride was decreased by approximately 10% by creatine supplementation (P < 0.05). Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post-supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group (+14.0 +/- 6.3%) than the placebo group (-10.4 +/- 4.4%; P < 0.05) at 90 minutes of exercise. The time of the final sprint to exhaustion at the end of the 2-hour cycling bout was not affected by creatine supplementation (creatine pre, 64.4 +/- 13.5s; creatine post, 88.8 +/- 24.; placebo pre, 69.0 +/- 24.8s; placebo post 92.8 +/- 31.2s: creatine vs. placebo not significant). Power output for the final sprint was increased by ~33% in both groups (creatine vs. placebo not significant).It can be concluded that although creatine supplementation may increase resting muscle total creatine, muscle creatine phosphate, and plasma volume, and may lead to a reduction in  consumption during submaximal exercise, creatine supplementation does not improve sprint performance at the end of endurance cycling exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17827042>Attenuated adrenergic responses to exercise in women with fibromyalgia--a controlled study.</a></h1><p>The pathogenesis of widespread pain and fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown. Altered responses from the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic nervous system and muscular system have been suggested as being of importance. The present study was undertaken to determine: (i) whether the sympathoadrenal response to repetitive isometric contractions until exhaustion is altered in patients with FM, and (ii) whether sympathoadrenal responses are associated with muscle fatigue and pain during exercise. Nineteen women with FM, and 19 healthy women matched for age, smoking and self-reported physical activity, participated. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), repetitive isometric contractions ( contraction and 4s resting phases) were performed with both quadriceps muscles at 30% of MVC until exhaustion. Muscle activity was recorded from the quadriceps muscles by surface electromyography (EMG). Plasma adrenalin (Adr), noradrenalin (NAdr) and cortisol were measured and perceived exertion and pain reported during exercise. Attenuated Adr responses (p<0.001) with normal plasma NAdr and cortisol (p>0.19) responses were found during exercise in the FM group compared with the control group. Significantly higher EMG amplitude (%EMG(max)) during the contraction phases (p=0.001) was found in the FM than in the control group. Perceived exertion and pain responses to exercise were higher in the FM group than in the controls (p<0.001), without relationship to the sympathoadrenal responses. In conclusion; the exercise was perceived as being more painful and strenuous in the FM group. Muscle performance was altered with increased muscle activity during the exercise. Women with FM showed an attenuated Adr response to repetitive isometric exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29177350>Chalcogenide substitution in the [2Fe] cluster of [FeFe]-hydrogenases conserves high enzymatic activity.</a></h1><p>[FeFe]-Hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the uptake and evolution of H due to the presence of an inorganic [6Fe-]-cofactor (H-cluster). This cofactor is comprised of a [4Fe-4S] cluster coupled to a unique [2Fe] cluster where the catalytic turnover of H/H takes place. We herein report on the synthesis of a selenium substituted [2Fe] cluster [Fe{μ(SeCH)NH}(CO)(CN)] (ADSe) and its successful in vitro integration into the native protein scaffold of [FeFe]-hydrogenases HydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum yielding fully active enzymes (HydA1-ADSe and CpI-ADSe). FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray structure analysis confirmed the presence of structurally intact ADSe at the active site. Electrochemical assays reveal that the selenium containing enzymes are more biased towards hydrogen production than their native counterparts. In contrast to previous chalcogenide exchange studies, the S to Se exchange herein is not based on a simple reconstitution approach using ionic cluster constituents but on the in vitro maturation with a pre-synthesized selenium-containing [2Fe] mimic.

Here, three-dimensional SnS nanoflower structures assembled with thin nanosheets were synthesized via a facile solvothermal process. When applied to detect 100ppm NH at 200°C, the SnS based sensor exhibited high response value of 7.4, short response/recovery time of 40./624s. Moreover, the sensor demonstrated a low detection limit of 0.5ppm NH and superb selectivity to NH against CO, CH, H, ethanol and acetone. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique thin layers assembled flower-like nanoarchitecture, which facilitates both the carrier charge transfer process and the adsorption/desorption reaction. More importantly, it was found that the sensor response enhanced with increasing  content in background and was improved by 3.57 times with  content increasing from 0 to 40%. The increased response is owing to the enhanced binding energies between SnS and NH moleculers.

First, compared with other intracellular haemoglobins, it is extremely large, with a mol.wt. of 430000 and an s(20,w) of 13.. A minor component (mol.wt.=220000; s(20,w)=9.7S) is also present as a probable dissociation product of the major component. Secondly, this haemoglobin has an unusual subunit structure. It contains 1mol of haem per 16000g of protein, in common with most other haemoglobins. However, the smallest polypeptide that could be obtained after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate or 6m-guanidine with reducing agent has a mol.wt. of 32000-37000. Digestion of the haemoglobin with the proteinase subtilisin produces both 57000- and 30000-mol.wt. aggregates that contain 1mol of haem per 16000g of protein and that can be dissociated into 16500-mol.wt. polypeptides by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate. The intact polymer shows slight co-operativity (h=1.7), lacks a Bohr effect between pH7 and 8, and has a low  affinity [P(50)=4.8kPa (36mmHg) at 20 degrees C] relative to other haemoglobins. The 30000-mol.wt. aggregate obtained by digestion of the polymer binds  reversibly with an affinity greater than that of the polymer, but with some co-operativity (h=1.7). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the subunits of this unusually large intracellular haemoglobin are 32000-mol.wt. polypeptides that in turn are composed of two covalently linked haem-containing -binding domains. This is the first report of an intracellular haemoglobin with such a structure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27383588>Transient Oxygen/Glucose Deprivation Causes a Delayed Loss of Mitochondria and Increases Spontaneous Calcium Signaling in Astrocytic Processes.</a></h1><p>Recently, mitochondria have been localized to astrocytic processes where they shape Ca(2+) signaling; this relationship has not been examined in models of ischemia/reperfusion. We biolistically transfected astrocytes in rat hippocampal slice cultures to facilitate fluorescent confocal microscopy, and subjected these slices to transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) that causes delayed excitotoxic death of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This insult caused a delayed loss of mitochondria from astrocytic processes and increased colocalization of mitochondria with the autophagosome marker LC3B. The losses of neurons in area CA1 and mitochondria in astrocytic processes were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists, tetrodotoxin, ziconotide (Ca(2+) channel blocker), two inhibitors of reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (KB-R7943, YM-244769), or two inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporin-A, FK506). The effects of OGD were mimicked by NMDA. The glutamate uptake inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-l-aspartate increased neuronal loss after OGD or NMDA, and blocked the loss of astrocytic mitochondria. Exogenous glutamate in the presence of iGluR antagonists caused a loss of mitochondria without a decrease in neurons in area CA1. Using the genetic Ca(2+) indicator Lck-GCaMP-, we observed two types of Ca(2+) signals: (1) in the cytoplasm surrounding mitochondria (mitochondrially centered) and (2) traversing the space between mitochondria (extramitochondrial). The spatial spread, kinetics, and frequency of these events were different. The amplitude of both types was doubled and the spread of both types changed by ∼2-fold 24 h after OGD. Together, these data suggest that pathologic activation of glutamate transport and increased astrocytic Ca(2+) through reversed Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange triggers mitochondrial loss and dramatic increases in Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytic processes.Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, are vital integrators of signaling and . Each astrocyte consists of many long, thin branches, called processes, which ensheathe vasculature and thousands of synapses. Mitochondria occupy the majority of each process. This occupancy is decreased by ∼50% 24 h after an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, due to delayed fragmentation and mitophagy. The mechanism appears to be independent of neuropathology, instead involving an extended period of high glutamate uptake into astrocytes. Our data suggest that mitochondria serve as spatial buffers, and possibly even as a source of calcium signals in astrocytic processes. Loss of mitochondria resulted in drastically altered calcium signaling that could disrupt neurovascular coupling and gliotransmission.Copyright © 2016 the authors 0270-6474/16/367110-19$15.00/0.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12881821>Blood flow response to electrically induced twitch and tetanic lower-limb muscle contractions.</a></h1><p>To compare the effect of electric stimulation (ES)-induced twitch with tetanic leg muscle contractions on blood flow responses and to assess blood flow responses in the contralateral inactive leg.Intervention with within-subject comparisons.University research laboratory.A volunteer sample of 12 healthy men (mean age, 25.1+/-3.0y).ES was applied at 1 and 3Hz to induce twitch contractions and at 35Hz to induce tetanic contractions of the lower- and upper-leg muscles. Exercise periods consisted of ES/rest cycles (/20s) for 5 minutes.Blood flow velocity changes measured by echo Doppler ultrasonography at rest and during the first 2 subsequent ES cycles.Blood flow significantly increased from resting values for the tetanic 2-leg, tetanic 1-leg, and 3-Hz conditions, but not for the 1-Hz twitch condition or in the inactive leg.Both tetanic and 3-Hz twitch contractions, but not 1-Hz twitch contractions, increased leg blood flow in humans. Because blood flow elevations induced by the 3-Hz contractions did not differ statistically from those induced by the tetanic contractions but were realized with less discomfort, this mode is preferable for therapeutic interventions. Because stimulation of the ipsilateral leg muscles did not change blood flow in the contralateral inactive leg, the muscles in the area of desired effect must be stimulated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2826163>Omega-oxidation of cysteine-containing leukotrienes by rat-liver microsomes. Isolation and characterization of omega-hydroxy and omega-carboxy metabolites of leukotriene E4 and N-acetylleukotriene E4.</a></h1><p>Leukotriene E4 was metabolized to two polar products by rat liver microsomes. These products were characterized by physico-chemical and chemical techniques. The chemical structures, (5S, 6R)-5,20-dihydroxy--cysteinyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-icosatetraenoic acid (omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4) and (5S, 6R)-5-hydroxy--cysteinyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-icosatetraen-1,20-d ioic acid (omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4) suggested that leukotriene E4 was transformed by an omega-hydroxylase and omega-hydroxyleukotriene E dehydrogenase in sequence. N-Acetyl-leukotriene E4 was also transformed by these enzymes, but at a rate six times lower than leukotriene E4. The products formed from N-acetylleukotriene E4 were characterized as being N-acetyl-omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4. Other substrates were 11-trans-leukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-11-trans-leukotriene E4. In contrast, leukotrienes C4 and D4 were not converted into omega-oxidized metabolites. The leukotriene E omega-hydroxylase reaction required NADPH and molecular  as cofactors, and was most rapidly catalyzed by liver microsomes. Liver cytosol, fortified with NAD+, converted omega-hydroxyleukotriene E4 and N-acetyl-omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 into omega-carboxy metabolites. Microsomes contained at least 18 times less omega-hydroxy-leukotriene E dehydrogenase activity than did cytosol. Liver microsomes supplemented with acetyl-coenzyme A converted omega-hydroxy and omega-carboxy-leukotriene E4 into the corresponding N-acetyl derivatives. The novel enzyme, leukotriene E omega-hydroxylase, which is described here is distinct from a previously described leukotriene B omega-hydroxylase based on substrate competition and kinetic data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29613950>Immediate effects of blood donation on physical and cognitive performance-A randomized controlled double-blinded trial.</a></h1><p>The success of implementing damage control resuscitation principles pre-hospital has been at the expense of several logistic burdens including the requirements for resupply, and the question of donor safety during the development of whole blood programs. Previous studies have reported effects on physical performance after blood donation; however, none have investigated the effects of blood donation on cognitive performance.We describe a prospective double-blinded, randomized, controlled study comprised of a battery of tests: three cognitive tests, and VO2max testing on a cycle ergometer. Testing was performed 7 days before blinded donation (baseline day), immediately after donation (Day 0), and 7 days (Day 7) after donation. The inclusion criteria included being active blood donors at the Haukeland University Hospital blood bank, where eligibility requirements were met on the testing days, and providing informed consent. Participants were randomized to either the experimental (n = 26) or control group (n = 31). Control group participants underwent a 'mock donation" in which a phlebotomy needle was placed but blood was not withdrawn.In the experimental group, mean ± SEM VO2max declined 6% from 41.35 ± 1.7 mLO2/(min·kg) at baseline to 39.0 ± 1.6 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 0 and increased to 40.51 ± 1.5 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 7. Comparable values in the control group were 42.1 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg) at baseline, 41.6 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg)) on Day 1 (1% decline from baseline), and 41.8 ± 1.8 mLO2/(min·kg) on Day 7.Comparing scores of all three cognitive tests on Day 0 and Day 7 showed no significant differences (p > 0.05).Our main findings are that executive cognitive and physical performances were well maintained after whole blood donation in healthy blood donors. The findings inform postdonation guidance on when donors may be required to return to duty.Randomized, controlled, double-blinded prospective trial study, level 1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10956653>Studies with substrate and cofactor analogues provide evidence for a radical mechanism in the chorismate synthase reaction.</a></h1><p>Chorismate synthase catalyzes the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) to chorismate. The strict requirement for a reduced FMN cofactor and a trans-1,4-elimination are unusual. (6R)-6-Fluoro-EPSP was shown to be converted to chorismate stoichiometrically with enzyme-active sites in the presence of dithionite. This conversion was associated with the oxidation of FMN to give a stable flavin semiquinone. The IC(50) of the fluorinated substrate analogue was 0.5 and 250 microm with the Escherichia coli enzyme, depending on whether it was preincubated with the enzyme or not. The lack of dissociation of the flavin semiquinone and chorismate from the enzyme appears to be the basis of the essentially irreversible inhibition by this analogue. A dithionite-dependent transient formation of flavin semiquinone during turnover of ()-6-fluoro-EPSP has been observed. These reactions are best rationalized by radical chemistry that is strongly supportive of a radical mechanism occurring during normal turnover. The lack of activity with 5-deaza-FMN provides additional evidence for the role of flavin in catalysis by the E. coli enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215182>Ultrafast dynamics of neutral superexcited : a direct measurement of the competition between autoionization and predissociation.</a></h1><p>Using ultrafast extreme ultraviolet pulses, we performed a direct measurement of the relaxation dynamics of neutral superexcited states corresponding to the nlσ(g)(c(4)Σ(u)(-)) Rydberg series of O(2). An extreme ultraviolet attosecond pulse train was used to create a temporally localized Rydberg wave packet and the ensuing electronic and nuclear dynamics were probed using a time delayed femtosecond near-infrared pulse. We investigated the competing predissociation and autoionization mechanisms in superexcited  molecules and found that autoionization is dominant for the low n Rydberg states. We measured an autoionization lifetime of 92±6 fs and 180±10 fs for the (5s,4d)σ(g) and (,5d)σ(g) Rydberg state groups, respectively. We also determine that the disputed neutral dissociation lifetime for the ν=0 vibrational level of the Rydberg series is 1100±100 fs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18801114>KNS-760704 [(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2, 6-benzothiazole-diamine dihydrochloride monohydrate] for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h1><p>Developing effective treatments for chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has proven extremely difficult. ALS is universally fatal, characterized by progressive weakness due to the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, and leads eventually to respiratory failure which is the usual cause of death. Only a single treatment has been approved, the modestly effective nonspecific neuroprotectant Rilutek (riluzole; 2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy)benzothiazole). KNS-760704 [(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine dihydrochloride, RPPX], a synthetic amino-benzothiazole with demonstrated activity in maintaining mitochondrial function, is being developed as a treatment for ALS. It has proven to be effective in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays of neuroprotection, including the G93A-SOD1 mutant mouse model; however, its specific mechanism of action remains unknown. The potential of KNS-760604 as a treatment for ALS was first suggested by studies showing that its optical enantiomer, Mirapex[()-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine; pramipexole dihydrochloride; PPX], a high-affinity agonist at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, exhibits important neuroprotective properties independent of its dopamine receptor agonism. In cell-based assays, both RPPX and PPX reduce the production of reactive  species (ROS), attenuate the activation of apoptotic pathways, and increase cell survival in response to a variety of neurotoxins. However, PPX has limited utility as a clinical neuroprotective agent because the drug concentrations required for neuroprotection would likely produce unacceptable dopaminergic side effects. RPPX, on the other hand, while possessing the same neuroprotective potential as PPX, is a much lower-affinity dopamine receptor agonist and may therefore be more useful in the treatment of ALS. This review will examine the data supporting the hypothesis that the RPPX may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS. In addition, we will briefly review recent preclinical data in support of RPPX, and discuss the current status of its clinical development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220731>Early haemodynamic changes observed in patients with epilepsy, in a visual experiment and in simulations.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate whether previously reported early blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in epilepsy could occur as a result of the modelling techniques rather than physiological changes.EEG-fMRI data were analysed from seven patients with focal epilepsy, six control subjects undergoing a visual experiment, in addition to simulations. In six separate analyses the event timing was shifted by either -9,-6,-3,+3,+6 or +9 s relative to the onset of the interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) or stimulus.The visual dataset and simulations demonstrated an overlap between modelled haemodynamic response function (HRF) at event onset and at ± 3 s relative to onset, which diminished at ± . Pre-spike analysis at - improved concordance with the assumed IED generating lobe relative to the standard HRF in 43% of patients.The visual and simulated dataset findings indicate a form of "temporal bleeding", an overlap between the modelled HRF at time 0 and at ± 3s which attenuated at ± . Pre-spike analysis at - may improve concordance.This form of analysis should be performed at  prior to onset of IED to minimise temporal bleeding effect.

Using ab initio electronic structure and slave rotor theory calculations, we show that such systems exhibit a breathing phonon driven A-site to  hybridization-wave instability which conspires with strong correlations on the B-site transition metal ion (Ni or Cr) to trigger a Mott insulating state.

Acute traumatic coagulopathy has historically been defined by a prolonged prothrombin time, although newer, more informative measurements of hemostatic function have been used to improve diagnosis and support clinical decision making. The underlying biochemical mechanisms of and best practice therapeutics for ATC remain under active investigation because of its significant correlation to poor outcomes. The wide range of hypothesized mechanisms for ATC results from the large number of symptoms, phenotypes, and altered states in these patients as observed by multiple research groups. Much like the ancient fable of blind men describing an elephant from their limited perspectives, the limited nature of clinical and laboratory tools used to diagnose coagulopathy or evaluate hemostatic function has made finding causation difficult. The prolonged prothrombin time, degree of fibrinolysis, depletion of coagulation factors and inhibitors, and general failure of the blood have all been identified as being primary indicators for ATC. Therapeutic interventions including recombinant coagulation factors, antifibrinolytics, and blood products have been used with varying degrees of success as they are used to address specific symptoms. To truly understand the causes of ATC, research efforts must recognize the complexity of the hemostatic system and get to the heart of the matter by answering the question: "Is ATC a pathological condition that develops from the observed deficiencies in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and autoregulation, or is ATC an adaptive response generated as the body attempts to restore perfusion and avoid massive organ failure?" Because patient management must proceed without definitive answers regarding the entire causative chain, the current therapeutic focus should be on using what knowledge has been gained to the patient's advantage: control hemorrhage, maintain appropriate homeostatic balances of coagulation proteins, and restore  perfusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24070894>Forearm muscle oxygenation responses during and following arterial occlusion in patients with mitochondrial myopathy.</a></h1><p>The aim was to study whether mitochondrial myopathy induces different oxygenation (deoxy[Hb+Mb] and oxy[Hb+Mb]) responses during and following arterial occlusion. In 10 mitochondrial myopathy patients (MMpatients) (age: 29±7 years; body mass: 59.9±15.7kg; heigth: 166.2±11.4cm) and age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (age: 28±9 years; body mass: 72.7±16.9kg; height: 174.4±8.7cm) arterial occlusion was performed by inflating a cuff to 240mmHg. Deoxy[Hb+Mb] and oxy[Hb+Mb] were registered during (AOoxy and AOdeoxy) and following (POdeoxy and POoxy) arterial occlusion. Amplitude of AOdeoxy did not differ (p=0.47) between MMpatients (44.9±28.0μM) and healthy subjects (38.6±22.8μM), The time constant of the exponential model was greater in MMpatients (263.4±49.1s vs. 200.3±73.7s, p=0.03). Following cuff release, in both populations a transient increase in total[Hb+Mb] was observed induced by different kinetics of POoxy and POdeoxy. The increase in POoxy (TD=6.6±2.2s and 11.9±3.5s; τ=3.8±1.4s and 6.4±2.9s for MMpatients and healthy subjects, respectively) was faster (p<0.001 for TD and τ) compared to the decrease in POdeoxy (TD=13.2±3. and 26.5±4.; τ=-6.2±2.2s and -9.6±2.4s for MMpatients and healthy subjects, respectively). POoxy and POdeoxy showed faster kinetics (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for TD and τ, respectively) in MMpatients compared to healthy subjects.

In this paper, the boron-doped carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) were used in amperometric biosensors. It has been found that the electrocatalytic activity of the BCNTs modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode toward the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide is much higher than that of the un-doped CNTs modified electrode due to the large amount of edge sites and -rich groups located at the defective sites induced by boron doping. Glucose oxidase (GOD) was selected as the model enzyme and immobilized on the BCNTs modified glassy carbon electrode by entrapping GOD into poly(o-aminophenol) film. The performance of the sensor was investigated by electrochemical methods. At an optimum potential of +0.60 V and pH 7.0, the biosensor exhibits good characteristics, such as high sensitivity (171.2 nA mM(-1)), low detection limit (3.6 microM), short response time (within ), satisfactory anti-interference ability and good stability.

With exemption and waiver of consent granted from the Institutional Review Board, monitoring data were downloaded from bedside monitors of postoperative patients. Alarm notification data and response times were recorded from the continuous capture of institutional surveillance data. Paging notifications were coded as clinically relevant (i.e., true  desaturation with SpO2<89 for >15s) or irrelevant (i.e., artifact, inappropriate alarm threshold, or failure to delay page). Linear mixed models, and correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between unit staffing, shift, paging burden and response time. Means and [95% confidence intervals] are presented.1616 monitoring hours in 103 patients yielded 342 desaturation events (duration 23. [20.99, 26.1]) and 710 notification pages, 36% of which were for clinically relevant desaturation. Nursing response time was 52.1s [46.4, 57.7], which was longer at night (63.8 [51.2, 76.35]; p=0.035), but not related to unit staffing. Missed alarm events (i.e., no notification page transmitted) occurred for 26% of the clinically relevant events, and were associated with higher paging burden (p=0.04), lower SpO2 values (81.8 [80.5, 83.0] vs. 83.2 [82.6, 83.8]; p=0.026), and higher odds of intervention (OR 3.5 [1.38, 8.9]). 65% of patients with desaturation events received interventions which correlated with the number of pages (rho=0.422; p<0.01) and events (rho=0.57; p<0.01), desaturation duration (rho=0.505; p<0.01), and SpO2 (rho=-0.324; p<0.01).One-third of pulse oximetry alarm notifications were for clinically relevant  desaturation, facilitating timely nursing response and intervention for most patients. Unit staffing and false alarm frequency were not associated with response time, suggesting a high level of attention on this unit. The nature and degree of missed alarm events suggests patient safety concerns posed by hospital-level transmission systems warranting further strategies to ensure monitoring safety.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We have used Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy together with (57)Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) to probe the structure of NifB-co while bound to the NifX protein from Azotobacter vinelandii. The spectra have been interpreted in part by comparison with data for the completed FeMo-co attached to the NafY carrier protein: the NafY:FeMo-co complex. EXAFS analysis of the NifX:NifB-co complex yields an average Fe-S distance of 2.26 A and average Fe-Fe distances of 2.66 and 3.74 A. Search profile analyses reveal the presence of a single Fe-X (X = C, N, or O) interaction at 2.04 A, compared to a 2.00 A Fe-X interaction found in the NafY:FeMo-co EXAFS. This suggests that the interstitial light atom (X) proposed to be present in FeMo-co has already inserted at the NifB-co stage of biosynthesis. The NRVS exhibits strong bands from Fe-S stretching modes peaking around 270, 315, 385, and 408 cm(-1). Additional intensity at approximately 185-200 cm(-1) is interpreted as a set of cluster "breathing" modes similar to those seen for the FeMo-cofactor. The strength and location of these modes also suggest that the FeMo-co interstitial light atom seen in the crystal structure is already in place in NifB-co. Both the EXAFS and NRVS data for NifX:NifB-co are best simulated using a Fe  9X trigonal prism structure analogous to the 6Fe core of FeMo-co, although a 7Fe structure made by capping one trigonal 3S terminus with Fe cannot be ruled out. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the interstitial light atom is already present at an early stage in FeMo-co biosynthesis prior to the incorporation of Mo and R-homocitrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21226482>Coordination chemistry study of hydrated and solvated lead(II) ions in solution and solid state.</a></h1><p>The coordination chemistry of lead(II) in the  donor solvents water, dimethylsulfoxide (dmso, Me(2)SO), N,N-dimethylformamide (dmf), N,N-dimethylacetamide (dma), N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (dmpu), and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylurea (tmu), as well as in the sulfur donor solvent N,N-dimethylthioformamide (dmtf), has been investigated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and/or large angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) in solution, and by single crystal X-ray diffraction and/or EXAFS of solid hydrates and solvates. Lead(II) may either form hemidirected complexes with large bond distance distribution and an apparent gap for excess electron density, or holodirected ones with a symmetric coordination sphere with normal bond distance distribution, depending on the strength of antibonding lead /ligand np molecular orbital interactions and ligand-ligand interactions. The crystallographic data show that the solid lead(II) perchlorate and trifluoromethanesulfonate hydrate structures are hemidirected, while the solid lead(II) solvates of dma and dmpu have regular octahedral configuration with holodirected geometry and mean Pb-O bond distances in the range 2.50-2.52 Å. EXAFS data on the hydrated lead(II) ion in aqueous solution show broad bond distance distribution and a lack of inner-core multiple scattering contributions strongly indicating a hemidirected structure. The Pb-O bond distances found both by EXAFS and LAXS, 2.54(1) Å, point to a six-coordinate hydrated lead(II) ion in hemidirected fashion with an unevenly distributed electron density. The results obtained for the dmso solvated lead(II) ion in solution are ambiguous, but for the most part support a six-coordinate hemidirected complex. The mean Pb-O bond distances determined in dmf and dma solution by LAXS, 2.55(1) and 2.48(1) Å, respectively, indicate that in both solvate complexes lead(II) binds six solvent molecules with the former complex being hemidirected whereas the latter is holodirected. The dmpu and tmu solvated lead(II) ions have a regular holodirected octahedral configuration, as expected given their space-demanding characteristics and ligand-ligand intermolecular interactions. The dmtf solvated lead(II) ion in solution is most likely five-coordinate in a hemidirected configuration, with a mean Pb-S bond distance of 2.908(4) Å. New and improved ionic radii for the lead(II) ion in 4-8-coordination in hemi and holodirected configurations are proposed using crystallographic data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12226719>An improved stereoselective reduction of a bicyclic diketone by Saccharomyces cerevisiae combining process optimization and strain engineering.</a></h1><p>The stereoselective reduction of the bicyclic diketone bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2,6-dione, to the ketoalcohol (1R,4S,)-6-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-one, was used as a model reduction to optimize parameters involved in NADPH-dependent reductions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with glucose as co-substrate. The co-substrate yield (ketoalcohol formed/glucose consumed) was affected by the initial concentration of bicyclic diketone, the ratio of yeast to glucose, the medium composition, and the pH. The reduction of 5 g l(-1) bicyclic diketone was completed in less than 20 h in complex medium (pH 5.5) under  limitation with an initial concentration of 200 g l(-1) glucose and 5 g l(-1) yeast. The co-substrate yield was further enhanced by genetically engineered strains with reduced phosphoglucose isomerase activity and with the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase deleted. Co-substrate yields were increased 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively, in these strains.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882401>Electron transfer study on graphene modified glassy carbon substrate via electrochemical reduction and the application for tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) electrochemiluminescence sensor fabrication.</a></h1><p>In this study, electron transfer behavior of the graphene nanosheets attachment on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) via direct electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) is investigated for the first time. The graphene modified electrode was achieved by simply dipping the GCE in GO suspension, followed by cyclic voltammetric scanning in the potential window from 0V to -1.5V. Tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)3(2+)] was immobilized on the graphene modified electrode and used as the redox probe to evaluate the electron transfer behavior. The electron transfer rate constant (Ks) was calculated to be 61.9±5.8s(-1), which is much faster than that of tiled graphene modified GCE (7.1±0.(-1)). The enhanced electron transfer property observed with the GCE modified by reductively deposited graphene is probably due to its standing configuration, which is beneficial to the electron transfer comparing with the tiled one. Because the abundant -containing groups are mainly located at the edges of GO, which should be much easier for the reduction to start from, the reduced GO should tend to stand on the electrode surface as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. In addition, due to the favored electron transfer and standing configuration, the Ru(bpy)3(2+) electrochemiluminescence sensor fabricated with standing graphene modified GCE provided much higher and more stable efficiency than that fabricated with tiled graphene.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This was achieved using mixed-mode cation- and anion-exchange SPE (Oasis MCX and MAX) in series. Analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/QTOF-MS). A fast separation was achieved, with all compounds eluting within 6min, narrow chromatographic peaks, with a peak base width of  on average, and a high mass accuracy of quantified wastewater sample ions, with average mass errors in absolute value of 0.7mDa or 2.7ppm. The recovery of the SPE method in the analysis of sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent wastewater was on average 80% and the ion suppression 30%. For less demanding samples Oasis MCX used alone may be an alternative method, although for STP influent waters containing high loads of organic compounds the clean-up achieved using only Oasis MCX was insufficient, leading to unreliable quantitation. Furthermore, serial SPE separation according to molecular charge added an additional degree of analyte confirmation. For quantitation, an approach combining external standard calibration curves, isotopically labelled surrogate standards and single-point standard addition was used. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in the analysis of influent and effluent wastewater from an STP, using small sample volumes (25-50mL). The effluent wastewater had been subjected to three different treatments; activated sludge, activated sludge followed by ozonation, and a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Ozone treatment proved superior in removal of the analysed pharmaceuticals, while the MBR provided higher removal efficiencies than the activated sludge process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7764630>Biotransformation of (+)-camphor by cultured cells of Eucalyptus perriniana.</a></h1><p>Seven new biotransformation products were isolated from a jar fermentor culture of Eucalyptus perriniana following administration of (+)-camphor.

The aim of the present study was to detect microcirculatory alterations in healthy non-smokers after passive exposure to cigarette smoke, utilizing the Near Infrared Spectroscopy method combined with the vascular occlusion technique.Sixteen (9 females, age: 34 ± 9 years) non-smoking, healthy volunteers were exposed to passive smoking for 30 min in a temperature-controlled environment. Smoke concentration was monitored with a real-time particle counter. The following microcirculatory parameters were estimated: baseline tissue  saturation (StO); StO decrement after vascular occlusion (indicating the  consumption rate); StOincremental response after vascular occlusion release (reperfusion rate); the time period where the StO signal returns to the baseline values after the hyperemic response.Baseline StO (79.6 ± 6.4 vs. 79 ± 8%, p = 0.53) as well as the time needed for StO to return to baseline levels (138.2 ± 26.5 vs. 142.1 ± 34.6 s, p = 0.64) did not significantly differ before vs. after passive smoking exposure.  consumption rate decreased after 30 min exposure to passive smoking (from 12.8 ± 4.2 to 11.3 ± 2.8%/min, p = 0.04); Reperfusion rate also significantly decreased (from 5.6 ± 1.8 to 5 ± 1.7%/s, p = 0.04).Our results suggest that acute exposure to passive smoking delays peripheral tissue  consumption and adversely affects microcirculatory responsiveness after stagnant ischemia in healthy non-smokers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Epoxides were characterized by ultraviolet, mass, and circular dichroism spectral and chiral stationary phase HPLC analyses. Each of the metabolically formed epoxides was hydrated by rat liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase to a trans-dihydrodiol. The metabolically formed chrysene 5,6-epoxides were determined by chiral stationary phase HPLC and were found to contain (5S,6R):(5R,) enantiomer ratios of 68:32 (control), 71:29 (phenobarbital), and 5:95 (3-methylcholanthrene), respectively. The enantiomers of chrysene 1,2-epoxide and 3,4-epoxide were also resolved by chiral stationary phase HPLC. However, the enantiomeric compositions of the metabolically formed chrysene 1,2- and 3,4-epoxides, which racemized rapidly at room temperature, could not be directly determined. By using molecular -18 in the in vitro incubation of chrysene and by mass spectral analyses of the resulting -18-containing dihydrodiol metabolites and their acid-catalyzed dehydration (phenolic) products, both 1,2-epoxide and 3,4-epoxide were found to be converted by microsomal epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed water attack at predominantly (greater than or equal to 97%) the allylic carbons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25466096>Pilot-scale production of cloudy juice from low-quality pear fruit under low-oxygen conditions.</a></h1><p>In this study, a process for the production of premium quality yellowish, cloudy pear juice from low-quality fruit under low-oxygen conditions was developed. The production process consisted of (1) shredding, (2) pressing with spiral-filter technology including a vacuumised extraction cell, (3) holding in an inert gas buffer tank, (4) pasteurisation, (5) and refrigerated storage. First, the system parameters of a spiral-filter press were optimised with the aim of producing a yellowish, cloudy pear juice with the highest possible juice yield. A maximum juice yield of 78% could be obtained. Enzymatic  during juice extraction could be suppressed as a result of the fast processing and the low air (oxygen) levels in the extraction chamber of the spiral-filter press.

X-ray analysis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structures and absolute configuration of semisynthetic derivatives 4, 5, and 6. The phytotoxic activity of the three isolated natural products and the coriloxine derivatives is reported. Germination of the seed, root growth, and oxygen uptake of the seedlings of Trifolium pratense, Medicago sativa, Panicum miliaceum, and Amaranthus hypochondriacus were significantly inhibited by all of the tested compounds.

Thus, in the case of the non-basic reactant [Na3(H2O)4]2-[Al3Si3O12]2 an overexchange occurs with respect to the number of nonframework cationic charges. Rietveld structure refinement of the lead hydro sodalite based on powder X-ray diffraction data (cubic, a = 9.070 A, room temperature, space group P43n) revealed that the two lead cations within each polyhedral sodalite cage form an orientationally disordered dinuclear [Pb2(micro-OH)(micro-H2O)(H2O)2]3+ complex. Due to additional lead framework  bonds the coordination environment of each metal cation (CN 3+3) is approximately spherical, and clearly the lead  electron lone pair is stereochemically inactive. This is also suggested by the absence of a small peak at 13.025 keV, attributed in other Pb2+-O compounds to an electronic 2p- transition, in the PbL3 edge XANES spectrum. 1H MAS NMR and FTIR spectra show that the hydrogen atoms of the aqua hydroxo complex (which could not be determined in the Rietveld analysis) are involved in hydrogen bonds of various strengths.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20379490>Active sites of stoichiometric cerium oxide cations (CemO2m+) probed by reactions with carbon monoxide and small hydrocarbon molecules.</a></h1><p>Cerium oxide cluster cations (Ce(m)O(n)(+), m = 2-16; n = 2m, 2m +/- 1 and 2m +/- 2) are prepared by laser ablation and reacted with carbon monoxide (CO) and small hydrocarbon molecules (CH(4), C(2)H(4), and C(2)H(6)) in a fast flow reactor. A time of flight mass spectrometer is used to detect the cluster distribution before and after the reactions. The observation of  reduction and hydrogen pickup of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters strongly suggests the following reactions: (1) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + C(2)H(4) --> Ce(m)O(2m-1)(+) + C(2)H(4)O (m = 2-6); (2) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + CO --> Ce(m)O(2m-1)(+) + CO(2) (m = 4-6); and (3) Ce(m)O(2m)(+) + CH(4)/C(2)H(6) --> Ce(m)O(2m)H(+) + CH(3)/C(2)H(5) (m = 2-4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to study reaction mechanisms of Ce(2)O(4)(+) + X (X = CO, CH(4), C(2)H(4), and C(2)H(6)). The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The structural and bonding properties of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) (m = 2-5) clusters are also investigated by the DFT calculations. The unpaired electron in each of the clusters is mainly distributed over one Ce atom (4f and 5p orbitals) and two O atoms (2p orbital) in a CeO(2) moiety, which can be considered as the active site in the cluster. To further understand the nature of the active sites in Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters, the fast flow reaction experiments are also carried out on zirconium oxide clusters Zr(m)O(n)(+), because both Zr ([Kr]4d(2)5s(2)) and Ce ([Xe]4f(1)5d(1)(2)) have the same number of valence electrons while the latter has one more f and one less d electrons. In addition to the  transfer reactions such as Zr(m)O(2m)(+) + C(2)H(4) --> Zr(m)O(2m-1)(+) + C(2)H(4)O (m = 1-4) reported in the literature, hydrogen abstraction reactions Zr(m)O(2m)(+) + CH(4)/C(2)H(6) --> Zr(m)O(2m)H(+) + CH(3)/C(2)H(5) are also identified. The rate constants of CO oxidation as well as hydrogen abstraction by Ce(m)O(2m)(+) and Zr(m)O(2m)(+) are very different. The reactivity and selectivity of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) versus Zr(m)O(2m)(+) can be well rationalized based on the DFT calculations. The  transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions studied in this work are of widespread importance. The nature of the active sites of Ce(m)O(2m)(+) clusters is unique and may be considered in the use and design of cerium oxide based catalysts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463398>Quel pourrait être le futur de la prise en charge de l’anémie dans l’insuffisance rénale chronique ?</a></h1><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) plays an essential role in the regulation of erythropoiesis.

Conventional OxFlow (Conv-OxFlow) entails four interleaves incorporated in a single pulse sequence - two for phase-contrast based measurement of tCBF in the supplying arteries of the neck, and two to measure the intra- to extravascular phase difference in the superior sagittal sinus to derive Y [Jain et al., JCBFM 2010]. However, this approach limits achievable temporal resolution thus precluding capture of rapid changes of brain  states such as the response to apneic stimuli. Here, we developed a time-efficient, multiplexed OxFlow method and evaluated its potential for measuring dynamic alterations in global CMRO during a breath-hold challenge. Two different implementations of multiplexed OxFlow were investigated: 1) simultaneous-echo-refocusing based OxFlow (SER-OxFlow) and 2) simultaneous-multi-slice imaging-based dual-band OxFlow (DB-OxFlow). The two sequences were implemented on 3T scanners (Siemens TIM Trio and Prisma) and their performance was evaluated in comparison to Conv-OxFlow in ten healthy subjects for baseline CMRO quantification. Comparison of measured parameters (Y, tCBF, CMRO) revealed no significant bias of SER-OxFlow and DB-OxFlow, with respect to the reference Conv-OxFlow while improving temporal resolution two-fold (12.5 versus 25s). Further acceleration shortened scan time to 8 and  for SER and DB-OxFlow, respectively, for time-resolved CMRO measurement. The two sequences were able of capturing smooth transitions of Y, tCBF, and CMRO over the time course consisting of 30s of normal breathing, 30s of volitional apnea, and 90s of recovery. While both SER- and DB-OxFlow techniques provide significantly improved temporal resolution (by a factor of 3 - 4 relative to Conv-OxFlow), DB-OxFlow was found to be superior for the study of short physiologic stimuli.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Four different models based on either the crystal or the aqueous solution structure of ubiquitin were used to describe H-bonding for selected residue pairs of ubiquitin. Calculated and measured 3hJ(NC') coupling constants differ depending on the model used, which is due to the fact that the geometry of ubiquitin is different in the solid state and in aqueous solution. Also, conformational averaging leads to a decrease of the magnitude of the measured 3hJ(NC') constants, which varies locally (larger for -sheets, smaller for -helix). Two different spin-spin coupling mechanisms were identified. While mechanism I transmits spin polarization via an electric field effect, mechanism II involves also electron delocalization from the lone pair of the carbonyl  to the antibonding orbital of the N-H bond. Mechanism I is more important in the crystal structure of ubiquitin, while in aqueous solution, mechanism II plays a larger role. It is possible to set up simple relationships between the spin-spin coupling constants associated with the H bond in proteins and the geometrical features of these bonds. The importance of the 3hJ(NC') and 1J(N-H) constants as descriptors for the H-bond is emphasized.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1643265>Heavy metal binding to heparin disaccharides.

First evidence for zinc chelation.</a></h1><p>To map out the heavy metal binding sites of iduronic acid containing oligosaccharides isolated from human kidneys, we studied Zn(II) binding by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular modeling to two disaccharides isolated after nitrous acid depolymerization of heparin and two synthetic disaccharides representative of the heparin structure, namely, IdopA2S (alpha 1,4)AnManOH, 1 alpha, IdopA2S (alpha 1,4)AnManOH6S, 1b, IdopA2S-(alpha 1,4)GlcNS alpha Me, 2a, and IdopA2S (alpha 1,4)GlcNS6S alpha Me, 2b (see previous article in this series). A conformational analysis of the metal free and metal bound solutions was made by comparing calculated [(NOE)]s, [T1]s, and [J]s to experimental values. The 1C4, 4C1, and 2S0 conformations of the L-idopyranosiduronate ring and the 4E and 4T3 of the anhydro-D-mannitol ring are evaluated as are rotations about the C5-C6 hydroxymethylene of the AnManOH() or GlcNS () residues. The NOE between IdopA2S H1 and H3 and the known NOE between H2 and H5, as well as the T1 of IdopA2S H3, are introduced as NMR observables sensitive to the IdopA2S ring conformation. Similarly, a NOE between IdopA2S H5 and AnManOH() or GlcNS() H3 was observed that directly restricts the allowed interglycosidic conformational space. For all disaccharides, the Zn(II) bound spectral data are consistent with models in which these motions are partially "frozen" such that the 1C4 conformation of the IdopA2S is stabilized along with the 4T3 conformation of the AnManOH() ring. The interglycosidic conformation is also stabilized in one of two minima. Electrostatic potential energy calculations gave the best overall agreement with experiment and suggest metal binding conformations with the carboxylate and ring  of the IdopA2S residues (1C4 conformation) and either O3 of the GlcNS() residues or the sulfate oxygens of the 6-sulphate for 2b providing additional chelating sites. These chelation models concur with the observation of marked 13C and 1H NMR chemical shifts for the IdopA2S resonances and of GlcNS H3 for 2 alpha and GlcNS6S C6 for 2b.

Physiological concentrations of tetrahydrobiopterin, the natural and endogenous cofactor for the hydroxylase, significantly enhance the inactivation of the enzyme caused by each of these nitric oxide generators. The substrate tryptophan does not have this effect. The chemically reduced (tetrahydro-) form of the pterin is required for the enhancement, because neither biopterin nor dihydrobiopterin is effective. The -isomer of tetrahydrobiopterin, which has little cofactor efficacy for tryptophan hydroxylase, does not enhance enzyme inactivation as does the natural 6R-isomer. A number of synthetic, reduced pterins share with tetrahydrobiopterin the ability to enhance nitric oxide-induced inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase. The tetrahydrobiopterin effect is not prevented by agents known to scavenge hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, peroxynitrite anions, hydroxyl radicals, or singlet . On the other hand, cysteine partially protects the enzyme from both the nitric oxide-induced inactivation and the combined pterin/nitric oxide-induced inactivation. These results suggest that the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor enhances the nitric oxide-induced inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase via a mechanism that involves attack on free protein sulfhydryls. Potential in vivo correlates of a tetrahydrobiopterin participation in the inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase can be drawn to the neurotoxic amphetamines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609603>Loss of Specific Active-Site Iron Atoms in -Exposed [FeFe]-Hydrogenase Determined by Detailed X-ray Structure Analyses.</a></h1><p>The [FeFe]-hydrogenases catalyze the uptake and evolution of hydrogen with unmatched speed at low overpotential. However,  induces the degradation of the unique [6Fe-] cofactor within the active site, termed the H-cluster. We used X-ray structural analyses to determine possible modes of irreversible -driven inactivation. To this end, we exposed crystals of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase CpI from  to  and quantitatively investigated the effects on the H-cluster structure over several time points using multiple data sets, while correlating it to decreases in enzyme activity. Our results reveal the loss of specific Fe atoms from both the diiron (2Fe) and the [4Fe-4S] subcluster (4Fe) of the H-cluster. Within the 2Fe, the Fe atom more distal to the 4Fe is strikingly more affected than the more proximal Fe atom. The 4Fe interconverts to a [2Fe-2S] cluster in parts of the population of active CpI, but not in crystals of the inactive apoCpI initially lacking the 2Fe. We thus propose two parallel processes: dissociation of the distal Fe atom and 4Fe interconversion.

RWJ 29009 (0.1-2 micrograms/kg intravenously, i.v.) dose-relatedly increased coronary blood flow (CBF) and decreased arterial pressure in anesthetized dogs. Total peripheral resistance and coronary vascular resistance were concurrently reduced without significant changes in heart rate (HR) or cardiac output (CO). Left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax and myocardial contractile force were decreased only at the highest dose of 10 micrograms/kg. Cromakalim (3-100 micrograms/kg), although much less potent, had a qualitatively similar profile. Glyburide pretreatment (5 mg/kg i.v.) shifted the dose response of RWJ 29009 for increasing CBF and decreasing arterial pressure to the right. The dose responses of cromakalim were similarly shifted to the right, whereas the effects of nifedipine on CBF and arterial pressure were not affected by glyburide. RWJ 29009 (0.3 and 1 microgram/kg) had no effect on myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2) except for a transient increase immediately after administration of 1 microgram/kg. MVO2 returned to control 15 min after dosing, although CBF remained significantly increased. In conscious dogs, RWJ 29009 (0.3-10 micrograms/kg, i.v. and orally, p.o.) produced dose-related increases in CBF and decreases in arterial pressure similar to those produced in anesthetized dogs, except that HR was increased concurrently. The i.v. and p.o. potency of RWJ 29009 were comparable, indicating high oral bioavailability. Thus, RWJ 29009 is an extremely potent coronary and peripheral vasodilator with a cardiovascular profile similar to that of other potassium channel activators. Like those of other potassium channel activators, its mechanism of action appears to involve activation of ATP-regulated potassium channels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14733519>Abscisic acid related compounds and lignans in prunes (Prunus domestica L.) and their  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC).</a></h1><p>Four new abscisic acid related compounds (1-4), together with (+)-abscisic acid (5), (+)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate (6), (,9R)-roseoside (7), and two lignan glucosides ((+)-pinoresinol mono-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8) and 3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-2- (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-(2R,3S)-dihydrobenzofuran (9)) were isolated from the antioxidative ethanol extract of prunes (Prunus domestica L.).

The antioxidant activities of these isolated compounds were evaluated on the basis of  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The ORAC values of abscisic acid related compounds (1-7) were very low.

P450eryF is a bacterial P450 that catalyzes the hydroxylation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B at the  position, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of erythromycin. The lack of a conserved threonine residue in the I-helix, in contrast to other P450s, makes P450eryF unable to oxidize other substrates. A recent study [Xiang et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35999-36006] has shown that the substitution of Ala-245 by threonine confers on P450eryF significant testosterone hydroxylase activity. Therefore, we investigated various known fluorescent P450 substrates with P450eryF wild-type as well as two mutants, A245S and A245T. Among the various fluorescent compounds tested, 7-benzyloxyquinoline (7-BQ) was found to be the most suitable probe for P450eryF A245T, with rates of oxidation being lower for A245S and wild-type enzyme. The steady-state kinetics of 7-BQ oxidation by A245T are sigmoidal (V(max) = 0.71 nmol/min/nmol, n = 2.18, and S(50) = 132 microM). alpha-Naphthoflavone (alpha-NF), a well-known activator of CYP3A4, did not stimulate 7-BQ oxidation by A245T, although the S(50) value for alpha-NF binding to wild-type P450eryF was similar to P450 3A4. Interestingly, spectral binding studies of wild-type P450eryF and A245T with ketoconazole and miconazole showed differential binding behaviors. Titration of wild-type with ketoconazole and miconazole and of A245T with miconazole showed the expected type-II binding. However, titration of A245T with ketoconazole produced a spectrum similar to type-I. Inhibition studies showed that both ketoconazole and miconazole are able to inhibit 7-BQ oxidation by A245T, although miconazole showed a slightly higher potency. In brief, the present study reports the discovery of 7-BQ as the first fluorescent and only the second unnatural substrate, and of miconazole as an effective P450eryF inhibitor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375092>The effect of absolute configuration on activity, subtype selectivity (M3/M2) of 3α-acyloxy-6β-acetoxyltropane derivatives as muscarinic M3 receptor antagonists.</a></h1><p>Both enantiomers of 3α-acyloxy-6β-acetoxyltropane derivatives 1-4 were prepared respectively and underwent functional studies and radioreceptor binding assays.  Enantiomers showed obvious muscarinic M3, M2 antagonistic activity, while the 6R ones elicited little muscarinic activity by functional studies. Besides, the affinity of  enantiomers to muscarinic M3 receptors of rat submandibulary gland, M2 receptors of rat left atria was much larger than that of corresponding 6R enantiomers. All these pharmalogical results indicated  configuration was favorable for 3α-acyloxy-6β-acetoxyltropane derivatives to bind with muscarinic M3 or M2 receptors and elicited antagonistic activity. Furthermore, the muscarinic M3 activity and subtype selectivity (M3/M2) of  enantiomers could be improved by increasing the electron density of carbonyl  or introducing methylene group between the carbonyl and phenyl ring in C-3α position. Understanding the effect of absolute configuration on activity, subtype selectivity (M3/M2) of 3α-acyloxy-6β-acetoxyltropane derivatives will provide the clues for designing muscarinic M3 antagonists with high activity and low side effects or toxicity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

BiVO4 films were prepared by the metal-organic decomposition method, and particles were 90-150 nm in diameter. Under visible-light irradiation, H2 and O2 evolved in a stoichiometric ratio (H2/O2 = 2) from an aqueous solution of Na2SO4 with an external bias. The photocurrent increased with addition of methanol. The band structure of BiVO4 was investigated by open-circuit potential, flat-band potential, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and calculations based on density functional theory. The top of the valence-band potential of BiVO4 was shifted negatively compared to the potentials of the conventional oxide semiconductors without Bi. We surmise that hybridization between the O-2p and Bi- orbitals might contribute to the negative shift of the BiVO4 valence band. Treatment with an aqueous solution of AgNO3 improved the photocurrent of the BiVO4 electrode significantly. The maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency at 420 nm was 44%. This value was the highest among mixed-oxide semiconductor electrodes under visible light irradiation. AgNO3 treatment also improved the stability of the photocurrent.

In Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevesiae and mice, Tg is preferentially excised by endonuclease III (Endo III) and endonuclease VIII (Endo VIII), yNTG1 and yNTG2, and mNTH and mNEIL1, respectively. We have explored the ability of these DNA glycosylases to discriminate between Tg stereoisomers. Oligonucleotides containing a single, chromatographically pure (5S,6R) or (5R,) stereoisomer of Tg were prepared by oxidation with osmium tetroxide. Steady-state kinetic analyses of the excision process revealed that Endo III, Endo VIII, yNTG1, mNTH and mNEIL1, but not yNTG2, excise Tg isomers from DNA in a stereoselective manner, as reflected in the parameter of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). When DNA glycosylases occur as complementary pairs, failure of one or both enzymes to excise their cognate Tg stereoisomer from oxidatively damaged DNA could have deleterious consequences for the cell.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18342581>'Priming' exercise and O2 uptake kinetics during treadmill running.</a></h1><p>We tested the hypothesis that priming exercise would speed V(O2) kinetics during treadmill running. Eight subjects completed a square-wave protocol, involving two bouts of treadmill running at 70% of the difference between the running speeds at lactate threshold (LT) and V(O2) max, separated by 6-min of walking at 4 km h(-1), on two occasions.  uptake was measured breath-by-breath and subsequently modelled using non-linear regression techniques. Heart rate and blood lactate concentration were significantly elevated prior to the second exercise bout compared to the first. However, V(O2) kinetics was not significantly different between the first and second exercise bouts (mean+/-S.D., phase II time constant, Bout 1: 16+/-3s vs. Bout 2: 16+/-4s; V(O2) slow component amplitude, Bout 1: 0.24+/-0.10 L min(-1)vs. Bout 2: 0.20+/-0.12 L min(-1); mean response time, Bout 1: 34+/-4s vs. Bout 2: 34+/-; P>0.05 for all comparisons). These results indicate that, contrary to previous findings with other exercise modalities, priming exercise does not alter V(O2) kinetics during high-intensity treadmill running, at least in physically active young subjects. We speculate that the relatively fast V(O2) kinetics and the relatively small V(O2) slow component in the control ('un-primed') condition negated any enhancement of V(O2) kinetics by priming exercise in this exercise modality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30829211>Cardioprotective effect of 6-shogaol against hyperglycemia-induced toxicity in H9c2 cardiomyocytes via suppressing of NF-κB pathway.</a></h1><p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) is a serious complication of diabetes. Apoptosis, inflammatory and ROS production are among the factors that are involved in the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. 6-shogaol is reported to inhibit apoptosis and reduce inflammatory and ROS production. This study aimed to study the effect of 6-shogaol () on the progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro. To develop DC model, H9c2 cell line was exposed to high glucose (HG) level (33 M glucose) for 24 h and used as a model for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Another set of H9c2 cell lines were 1 h pretreated with different conc. of 6-shogaol (5-20 μM). Cell viability, apoptosis, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-alpha and NF-κB were estimated in these cell lines treated with HG level or pretreated with 6-shgoal before HG. Exposing cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells to HG produced dramatic changes in cell biology and chemistry. There is a significant reduction in cell viability and enhancement in cell apoptosis as compared with control. In addition, ROS production, IL-6, TNF-α levels were increased in H9c2 line treated with HG. Also, there is overexpression of NF-κB in cells treated with HG levels alone. On the other hand, pretreatment of cardiomyocytes H9c2 cells with 6-shogaol (5-20μM) significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis, in addition,  at a dose of 10 μM abrogated the deleterious effects of HG on oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters via modulation of NF-κB pathway.

Most incidental AAAs are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection; however, there is no evidence that commonly used cardiovascular drugs have clinical beneficial effects on AAA progression. Therefore, in addition to current cardiovascular risk-reducing treatments, an adjunctive medical therapy targeting the regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism is still required in the clinical setting. Fucoidan is an extract of brown seaweed and a sulfated polysaccharide. Emerging evidence suggests that fucoidan has potential cardiovascular applications. Numerous investigations of fucoidan in diseases of the cardiovascular system have mainly focused on its pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically, fucoidan has been shown to have matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-reducing effects in several studies. We aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of fucoidan on aneurysmal growth in a murine model of aortic aneurysm and further provide a rationale for using fucoidan as a medical adjunctive therapy.A murine model of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA was used to assess the therapeutic effects of fucoidan on AAA growth in vivo. The characteristics and quantification of AAAs were determined in situ. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used for studying the involved pathways in vitro. Western blotting was used to detect the involved signaling pathways both in vivo and in vitro.Treatment with fucoidan significantly reduced the incidence of AAA formation. Administration of fucoidan significantly attenuated Ang II-induced aortic expansion from 1.56 ± 0.76 mm to 1.09 ± 0.30 mm. Administration of fucoidan significantly suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and reduced the grade of elastin degradation in vivo. In vitro, we found that fucoidan could ameliorate the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB p65, and it further reduced MMP and reactive  species production.Fucoidan inhibits the progression of experimental AAA growth through the attenuation of proinflammatory nuclear factor κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation.

Six skinfold thicknesses (sigma ) and maximal  uptake (VO2 max) were measured in 348 Caucasian subjects (149 women and 199 men). Fiber type proportions (type I, type IIA, and type IIB) and activity levels of marker enzymes for the Krebs cycle (malate dehydrogenase, MDH) and for the fatty acid oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HADH) pathways were determined in vastus lateralis muscle samples. No significant correlation was found between fiber type proportions and sigma . Significant and negative correlations were, however, obtained in both genders between the sigma  and MDH enzyme activity (r = -0.23; p < 0.01), but not between the sigma  and HADH enzyme activity. When individuals with low and high amount of subcutaneous fat but paired for VO2max were compared, vastus lateralis of fat men exhibited the same proportion of type I fiber (38.6 +/- 10.3 vs 38.5 +/- 13.4%) and HADH activity level (3.43 +/- 1.05 vs. 3.34 +/- 0.81 U/g), but had about 20% less MDH enzyme activity than vastus lateralis of leaner men (158 +/- 35 vs. 198 +/- 43 U/g;p < 0.05). No difference was found in any of these muscle phenotypes when comparisons were made between women with low and high amount of subcutaneous fat but also paired for VO2max.

The computations reveal significant differences in the underlying electronic structures that are responsible for the varied crystal chemistry of the lone pair cations. The filled 5s orbitals of the Sn2+ ion interact strongly with the 2p orbitals of , which leads to a significant destabilization of symmetric structures (scheelite and zircon) favored by electrostatic forces. The destabilizing effect of this interaction can be significantly reduced by lowering the symmetry of the Sn2+ site to enable the antibonding Sn 5s-O 2p states to mix with the unfilled Sn 5p orbitals. This interaction produces a localized, nonbonding state at the top of the valence band that corresponds closely with the classical notion of a stereoactive electron lone pair. In compounds containing Pb2+ and Bi3+ the relativistic contraction of the  orbital reduces its interaction with , effectively diminishing its role in shaping the crystal chemical preferences of these ions. In PbWO4 this leads to a stabilization of the symmetric scheelite structure. In the case of BiVO4 the energy of the Bi  orbital is further stabilized. Despite this stabilization, the driving force for a stereoactive lone pair distortion appears to be enhanced. The energies of structures exhibiting distorted Bi3+ environments are competitive with structures that possess symmetric Bi3+ environments. Nevertheless, the "lone pair" that results associated with a distorted Bi3+ environment in BiVO4 is more diffuse than the Sn2+ lone pair in beta-SnWO4. Furthermore, the distortion has a much smaller impact on the electronic structure near the Fermi level.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12968866>Conformational analysis of sulfur-containing 6-deoxy-l-hexose derivatives by molecular modeling and NMR spectroscopy.

Hydrogel composites were fabricated from Type I collagen, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and a thermosensitive and degradable hydrogel copolymer based on N-isopropylacrylamide, acrylic acid, N-acryloxysuccinimide and a macromer poly(trimethylene carbonate)-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The hydrogel copolymer was gellable at body temperature before degradation and soluble at body temperature after degradation. Hydrogel composites exhibited LCSTs around room temperature. They could easily be injected through a 26-gauge needle at 4 degrees C, and were capable of gelling within  at 37 degrees C to form highly flexible gels with moduli matching those of the rat and human myocardium. The hydrogel composites showed good  permeability; the  pressure within the hydrogel composites was similar to that in the air. The effects of collagen and CS contents on LCST, gelation time, injectability, mechanical properties and degradation properties were investigated. IGF-1 was loaded into the hydrogel composites for enhanced cell survival/growth. The released IGF-1 remained bioactive during a 2-week release period. Small fraction of CS in the hydrogel composites significantly decreased IGF-1 release rate. The release kinetics appeared to be controlled mainly by hydrogel composite water content, degradation and interaction with IGF-1. Human MSC adhesion on the hydrogel composites was comparable to that on the tissue culture plate. MSCs were encapsulated in the hydrogel composites and were found to grow inside during a 7-day culture period. IGF-1 loading significantly accelerated MSC growth. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MSCs maintained their multipotent differentiation potential in hydrogel composites with and without IGF-1. These injectable and rapid gelling hydrogel composites demonstrated attractive properties for serving as growth factor and cell carriers for cardiovascular tissue engineering applications.Copyright  2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

The reaction involves the 1,4-elimination of phosphate and the C-(6proR) hydrogen of the substrate with unusual anti stereochemistry and requires a reduced flavin cofactor. This paper describes the kinetics of the formation and decay of a flavin intermediate, EPSP consumption, chorismate and phosphate formation, and phosphate dissociation during single and multiple turnover experiments, determined using rapid reaction techniques. The kinetics of phosphate dissociation using the substrate analogues (6R)-[6-2H]EPSP and ()-6-fluoro-EPSP have also been determined. The observations are consistent with a nonconcerted chorismate synthase reaction. The flavin intermediate is not simply associated with the conversion of substrate to product because it forms before the substrate is consumed. The transient spectral changes must be associated primarily with events such as protonation of the reduced flavin, a charge transfer complex between reduced flavin and an aromatic amino acid, or a conformational change in the protein. This does not rule out the direct role of flavin in catalysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/381947>The action of the dihydro derivatives of prostacyclin--(6R)-PGI1 and ()-PGI1 on the heart and the coronary vasculature.</a></h1><p>The action of the dihydro prostacyclins, (6R)-PGI1 and ()-PGI1, was studied on the isolated guinea pig heart and bovine coronary artery strips. PGE2 and PGI2 were used as standards. In the isolated guinea pig heart ()-PGI1 decreased the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), myocardial force of contraction (MFC) and  consumption (QO2). (6R)-PGI1 did not produce a significant change in these parameters. The ED50 (50% o maximum coronary dilation) was approximately 20 times higher for ()-PGI1 than for PGI2 or PGE2. Treatment of the hearts with reserpine + tyramine abolished the ()-PGI1-induced decrease in MFC but not the decrease in the CPP. The same pattern of responses was seen with PGE2. Bovine coronary artery strips were contracted by both ()-PGI1 and (6R)-PGI1, the ED50 (50% of maximum increase in tension) being 5 and 10 times higher than that for PGE2. The ()-PGI1-induced contraction was preceeded by a small relaxation, which, however, was much less than that seen after PGI2. It is concluded that the hydration of the 5,6 double bound in the PGI2 molecule results in an almost complete loss of PGI2-like activity and generates PGE-like activity. The same biological activity of both dihydro prostacyclins in the isolated coronary artery strip but not in the intact coronary vascular bed leads to suggest that the sites of action in these systems are different.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3098305>The shikimate pathway.

The concerns with such contact lenses have been their higher elastomeric and hydrophobic characteristics associated with the incorporation of silicone type monomers. The use of silicone hydrogel has most recently been suggested for daily wear to eliminate all hypoxic related problems. The primary aim of the investigation was to test in vivo wetting performance and subjective acceptance of the first silicone hydrogel contact lens developed for daily wear, ACUVUE ADVANCE with HYDRACLEAR (galyfilcon A), compared to a conventional hydrogel contact lens for the same application SofLens 66 (alphafilcon A). The investigation was a randomised, subject masked bilateral cross over investigation testing of the two contact lens materials over their approved replacement periods (galyfilcon A 2 weeks and alphafilcon A 2 weeks (USA) and 4 weeks (Europe)). In all cases ReNu Multiplus lens care system was used. The investigation carried out on 24 contact lens wearers showed that: (i) in vivo wettability was superior for galyfilcon A which had a thicker lipid layer (thin layer incidence: galyfilcon A 54%; alphafilcon A 70-86%, p<0.05), a thicker aqueous layer (thick layer incidence: galyfilcon A 88%; alphafilcon A 35-64%, p<0.05) and a more stable tear film (galyfilcon A 7.8s; alphafilcon A 2 weeks 5., p=0.022; 4 weeks 7.4s, p=0.276); (ii) for the intended replacement period, comfort was better with galyfilcon A (2 weeks) compared to alphafilcon A (4 weeks) at insertion (p=0.001) and, throughout the day (daytime and evening p=0.008). Contact lenses made from galyfilcon A and replaced two weekly achieved better in vivo wettability than contact lenses made from alphafilcon A and replaced either two and four weekly; the better wettability was associated with an overall better comfort for galyfilcon A.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21226529>Ce and La single- and double-substitutional defects in yttrium aluminum garnet: first-principles study.</a></h1><p>The atomistic structure, energetics, and electronic structure of single-substitutional Ce and La defects and double-substitutional Ce-La defects in Ce,La-codoped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) Y(3)Al(5)O(12) have been studied by means of first-principles periodic boundary conditions density functional theory calculations. Single substitution of Y by Ce or by La produces atomistic expansions around the impurities, which are significantly smaller than the ionic radii mismatches and the overall lattice distortions are found to be confined within their second coordination spheres. In double-substitutional defects, the impurities tend to be as close as possible. La-codoping Ce:YAG provokes an anisotropic expansion around Ce defects. The Ce impurity introduces 4f occupied states in the 5.0 eV computed gap of YAG, peaking 0.25 eV above the top of the valence band, and empty 4f, 5d, and  states starting at 3.8 eV in the gap and spreading over the conduction band. La-codoping produces very small effects on the electronic structure of Ce:YAG, the most visible one being the decrease in covalent bonding with one of the  atoms, which shifts 0.05 Å away from Ce and gets 0.04 Å closer to La in the most stable Ce-La double-substitutional defect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005810>[Comparison of King Vision video laryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial].</a></h1><p>We compared the efficiency of the King Vision video laryngoscope and the Macintosh laryngoscope, when used by experienced anesthesiologists on adult patients with varying intubating conditions, in a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.A total of 388 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II, scheduled for general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Each patient was intubated with both laryngoscopes successively, in a randomized order. Intubation success rate, time to best glottic view, time to intubation, time to ventilation, Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy grades, and complications related to the laryngoscopy and intubation were analyzed.First pass intubation success rates were similar for the King Vision and the Macintosh (96.6% vs. 94.3%, respectively, p>0.05). King Vision resulted in a longer average time to glottic view (95% CI 0.5-1.4s, p<0.001), and time to intubation (95% CI 3-4., p<0.001). The difference in time to intubation was similar when unsuccessful intubation attempts were excluded (95% CI 2.8-4.4s, p<0.001). Based on the modified Mallampati class at the preoperative visit, the King Vision improved the glottic view in significantly more patients (220 patients, 56.7%) compared with the Macintosh (180 patients, 46.4%) (p<0.001). None of the patients had peripheral  desaturation below 94%. Experienced anesthesiologists may obtain similar rates of first pass intubation success and airway trauma with both laryngoscopes. King Vision requires longer times to visualize the glottis and to intubate the trachea, but does not cause additional desaturation.Copyright © 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia.

Direct electron transfer of Mn-TPAA is realized with a formal redox potential (E°') falling in the range of the E°' values of the redox couples O(2)/O(2)(-) and O(2)(-)/H(2)O(2). This suggests that Mn-TPAA on TiO(2) films is electrochemically active and capable of thermodynamically mediating both the oxidation of O(2)(-) to O(2) and the reduction of O(2)(-) to H(2)O(2). Therefore, Mn-TPAA immobilized on the TiO(2) films can be used electrochemically for determination of O(2)(-) due to its electrochemical activities and biomimetic catalytic activities like superoxide dismutase (SOD) toward O(2)(-). The present biomimetic O(2)(-) sensor shows high selectivity at the low working potential of 0V vs. Ag|AgCl, a wide linear range from 10(-7)M to 10(-4)M and a quick response time within . By taking advantage of the developed method and the properties of biomimetic SOD themselves, we have realized the real-time monitoring of O(2)(-) concentration released from living cells and investigated the relationship between the concentration changes of O(2)(-) and intracelluar Ca(2+), which may gain additional insights on the reactive  species (ROS) signal transduction and other physiological and pathological events.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

DFT Analysis of Structure and Spin⁻Spin Coupling Constants.</a></h1><p>Density functional theory (DFT) has provided detailed information on the molecular structure and spin⁻spin coupling constants of heparin tetrasaccharide (GlcNS,-IdoA2S-GlcNS,-IdoA2S-OMe) representing the predominant heparin repeating-sequence. The fully optimised molecular structures of two tetrasaccharide conformations (differing from each other in the conformational form of the sulphated iduronic acid residue⁻one ¹₄ and the other ²₀) were obtained using the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory and applying explicit water molecules to simulate the presence of a solvent. The theoretical data provided insight into variations of the bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles, formations of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. Optimised molecular structures indicated the formation of a complex hydrogen bond network, including interresidue and intraresidue bonds. The ionic interactions strongly influence the first hydration shell and, together with hydrogen bonds, play an important role in shaping the 3D tetrasaccharide structure. DFT-derived indirect three⁻bond proton⁻proton coupling constants (³) showed that the best agreement with experiment was obtained with a weighted average of 67:33 (¹₄:²₀) of the IdoA2S forms. Detailed analysis of Fermi-contact contributions to ³ showed that important contributions arise from the  lone pairs of neighbouring  atoms. The analysis also showed that the magnitude of diamagnetic spin⁻orbit contributions are sufficiently large to determine the magnitude of some proton⁻proton coupling constants.

The X-ray structure revealed that the Pb(II) atom is coordinated by one oxygen and three nitrogen atoms from two qcnh ligands and five oxygen atoms from three nitrate ligands in an 8+1 fashion with a PbNO donor set. One of the PdN distances in the vicinity of the central atom is a bit longer (Pb1N1=2.939(4) Å), which shows the effect of the  lone electron pair localized within the valence shell of the lead(II) atom.

Effects of stereochemistry, chain length, and chain substitution.</a></h1><p>A series of 6-substituted decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids were prepared as excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor antagonists. These compounds are antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (AMPA) subclasses of ligand gated ion channel (ionotropic) EAA receptors. (3S,4aR, 6R,8aR)-6-(2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl)- 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (9) is a potent, selective and systemically active AMPA antagonist. Other analogs from this series, including (3S,4aR,,8aR)-6-((1H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl)- 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (32) and (3S,4aR,,8aR)-6- (phosphonomethyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-ca rboxylic acid (61) are potent, selective, and systemically active NMDA antagonists. This and the subsequent publication look at the AMPA antagonist aspects of this SAR. Herein we report the effects of varying stereochemistry around the hydroisoquinoline ring; of tetrahydro-versus decahydroisoquinoline; of having the carboxylic acid at C-1 versus C-3; of varying the length of the carbon chain connecting a tetrazole to the bicyclic nucleus; and of holding the connecting chain constant at two atoms, the effect of heteroatom substitution in the position adjacent to the bicyclic nucleus and substitution with methyl or phenyl on the chain. Compounds were evaluated on rat cortical tissue for their ability to inhibit the binding of radioligands selective for AMPA ([3H]AMPA), NMDA ([3H]CGS 19755), and kainic acid ([3H]-kainic acid) receptors and for their ability to inhibit depolarizations induced by AMPA (40 microM), NMDA (40 microM), and kainic acid (10 microM). Our findings revealed that the optimal stereochemical array was the same for both NMDA (32 and 61) and AMPA (9) antagonists identified in this series and that the tetrahydroisoquinoline (25) and the C-1 carboxy (30) analogs of 9 are inactive. With a tetrazole in the distal acid position, an ethylene spacer (9) is optimal; substitution with  or nitrogen on the chain in the position adjacent to the bicyclic nucleus significantly reduced activity, while substitution with a methyl or phenyl group on the chain was well tolerated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11672035>Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of [3R,5S,]-3-Benzyloxy-5- methoxy-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane and [3R,5S,]-3-Methoxy-5-benzyloxy-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane.</a></h1><p>The synthesis of spiroacetals [3R,5S,]-3-benzyloxy-5-methoxy-1,7-dioaxaspiro[5.5]undecane 3 and [3R,5S,]-3-methoxy-5-benzyloxy-1,7-dioaxaspiro[5.5]undecane4, where the substituents on the spiroacetal assembly are in a 1,3-diaxial orientation, is described. Epoxidation of unsaturated spiroacetal 5 using dimethyldioxirane showed greater preference for the alpha-epoxide 11 over the beta-epoxide 12. Treatment of the alpha-epoxide 11 with lithium diethylamide in tetrahydrofuran afforded both the allylic alcohol 7 and the homoallylic alcohol 13 in approximately equal amounts. Use of a nonpolar solvent (hexane) suppressed the isomerization of the allylic alcohol 7 to the homoallylic alcohol 13, affording a 21:1 ratio of 7:13. Coordination of an  lone pair with the electron-deficient lithium center of the reagent sets up a transition state in which abstraction of a syn-proton and opening of the epoxide leads to stereoselective formation of allylic alcohol 7 with a pseudoaxial hydroxyl group at C-5. The hydroxyl group liberated in the epoxide rearrangement step was then used to direct a second epoxidation to the lower face of the alkene. Thus, treatment of alcohol 7 with m-CPBA buffered with sodium acetate afforded alpha-syn-epoxy alcohol 9. Subsequent epoxide opening using lithium aluminum hydride proceeded smoothly, affording syn-3,5-diaxial diol 10 and 4,5-diol 22. Epoxy alcohol 9 was then treated with sodium hydride and methyl iodide or benzyl bromide, affording methyl ether 23 or benzyl ether 24, respectively. Reduction of methoxy epoxide 23 with lithium aluminum hydride then afforded alcohol 25 together with the regioisomeric alcohol 27. Benzyloxy epoxide 24 afforded alcohols 29 and 31. Finally benzylation of alcohol 25 afforded bis-ether 3 whereas methylation of alcohol 29 afforded bis-ether 4.

Nevertheless, relative  consumption was reduced the FO group during the cycling time trial (Control: -23 ± 26; FO: -154 ± 59ml O2/min/100W p < .05) suggesting improved economy of cycling.

The patients were ventilated with 100%  until obtaining a reduction of 95% or more in the adductor pollicis response amplitude, with subsequent laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Neuromuscular function was monitored by acceleromyograhpy. We evaluated the onset of action of cisatracurium, tracheal intubation conditions, and hemodynamic repercussions.The mean time and standard deviations of cisatracurium onset were: GI (86.6±14.3s) and GII (116.9±11.), with a significant difference (p<0, 0001). Intubation conditions were acceptable in 100% of GI and 53.3% of GII patients (p<0.0001).Induction of neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium was faster, with better intubation conditions in patients receiving propofol compared to those receiving etomidate, without hemodynamic repercussions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

We have examined and analyzed the effects of systematic molybdenum ions intercalation on lead-borate glasses and glass ceramics with interesting results. The observations present in these mechanisms show the lead ions bonded ionic have a strong affinity towards [BO₃] units containing non-bridging oxygens and [MoO₄]²⁻ molybdate units. The pronounced affinity towards molybdate anions yields the formation of the PbMoO₄ crystalline phase. Then, the excess of  can be supported into the glass network by the formation of [MoO₆] and [Mo₂O₇] structural units. Pb²(+) ions with ² configuration show strong absorption in the ultraviolet due to parity allowed s²-sp transition and yield an absorption band centered at about 310 nm. The changes in the features of the absorption bands centered at about 310 nm can be explained as a consequence of the appearance of additional absorption shoulder due to photoinduced color centers in the glass such as the formation of borate-molybdate and lead-molybdate paramagnetic defect centers in the glasses. The concentration of molybdenum ions influences the shape and width of the EPR signals located at g ∼ 1.86, 1.91 and 5.19. The microenvironment of molybdenum ions in glasses is expected to have mainly sixfold coordination.

The charge ordering is accompanied by breathing distortion of the BiO6 octahedra (extension and contraction of the Bi-O bond lengths). Standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations fail to obtain the crystal structure instability caused by the pure breathing distortions. Combining effects of the breathing distortions and tilting of the BiO6 octahedra allows DFT to reproduce qualitatively an experimentally observed insulator with monoclinic crystal structure but strongly underestimates the breathing distortion parameter and energy gap values. In the present work we reexamine the BaBiO3 problem within the GGA + U method using a Wannier function basis set for the Bi -band. Due to the high oxidation state of bismuth in this material, the Bi -symmetry Wannier function is predominantly extended spatially on surrounding  ions and hence differs strongly from a pure atomic -orbital. That is in sharp contrast to transition metal oxides (with exclusion of high oxidation state compounds) where the major part of the d-band Wannier function is concentrated on the metal ion and a pure atomic d-orbital can serve as a good approximation. The GGA + U calculation results agree well with experimental data, in particular with experimental crystal structure parameters and energy gap values. Moreover, the GGA + U method allows one to reproduce the crystal structure instability due to the pure breathing distortions without octahedra tilting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012851>Dynamic MR Spectroscopy of brain  using a non-conventional spectral averaging scheme.</a></h1><p>MRS acquisition based on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism was implemented at 3T to investigate the impact of a non-conventional spectral averaging scheme (determined by the number of RF excitations, NEX) on the dynamics of cerebral  during neuroactivation. Using NEX=2, water and metabolite BOLD responses were compared to previous results from standard experiments.Spectra were recorded from the visual cortex of five healthy volunteers during single and block visual stimulations. The height, width and area of the spectral peaks were calculated (using SAGE v7) in order to estimate their percentage changes from baseline (representing the BOLD change) following visual stimulation. BOLD changes were statistically significant at a significance level of p<0.05 by paired t-test.Significantly greater BOLD changes in all spectra were observed in the single than block stimulation (p<0.05). The water resonance showed significant (p<0.01) BOLD changes in all peak parameters in both paradigms. All metabolites showed significant increase in spectral height (p<0.01) in the single paradigm, but none of them (except the height of Cho) showed significant BOLD response in the block paradigm. BOLD changes observed in the block paradigm were generally lower than reported changes.The time interval of  offered by NEX=2 during which each line of spectral data is recorded by the scanner is rather long, leading to some BOLD data loss particularly in a block experimental design.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary  in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the -, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation,  dysregulation, or inflammation and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal  alteration, fat accumulation, inflammation and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease. These results suggest that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7251868>Comparison of acute alterations in left ventricular relaxation and diastolic chamber stiffness induced by hypoxia and ischemia. Role of myocardial  supply-demand imbalance.</a></h1><p>To clarify conflicting reports concerning the effects of ischemia on left ventricular chamber stiffness, we compared the effects of hypoxia at constant coronary perfusion with those of global ischemia on left ventricular diastolic chamber stiffness using isolated, perfused rabbit hearts in which the left ventricle was contracting isovolumically. Since chamber volume was held constant, increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) reflected increases in chamber stiffness. At a control coronary flow rate (30 ml/min), 2 min of hypoxia and pacing tachycardia (4.0 Hz) produced major increases in postpacing LVEDP (10+/-1 to 24+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and the relaxation time constant, T, (40+/-4 to 224+/-37 ms, P < 0.001), while percent lactate extraction ratio became negative (+ 18+/-2 to -48+/-15%, P < 0.001). Coronary perfusion pressure decreased (72+/-5 to 52+/-3 mm Hg, P < 0.01), and since coronary flow was held constant, the fall in coronary perfusion pressure reflected coronary dilation and a decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Following an average of 71+/- reoxygenation and initial heart rate (2.0 Hz), LVEDP and relaxation time constant T returned to control. Hypoxia alone (without pacing tachycardia) produced similar although less marked changes (LVEDP, 10+/-1 to 20+/-3 mm Hg; and T, 32+/-3 to 119+/-22 ms; P < 0.01 for both) and there was a strong correlation between LVEDP and T (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). When a similar degree of coronary vasodilatation was induced with adenosine, no change in LVEDP occurred, indicating that the increase in end diastolic pressure observed during hypoxia was not secondary to vascular engorgement, but due to an acute effect of hypoxia on the diastolic behavior of the ventricular myocardium. In contrast, global ischemia produced by low coronary flow (12-15 ml/min) resulted in a decrease in LVEDP, as well as a marked fall in left ventricular systolic pressure. In 14 global ischemia experiments, pacing tachycardia led to a further decline in left ventricular systolic pressure, and no increase was noted in postpacing LVEDP. Changes in lactate extraction ratio were much smaller in magnitude than with hypoxia and constant coronary perfusion. In two experiments (one at normal coronary flow and one at 15 ml/min), left ventricular systolic pressure did not change markedly from control when tachycardia was superimposed, and postpacing LVEDP showed a marked rise (to > 25 mm Hg), which gradually recovered over 1-2 min at the control heart rate. From these results, we conclude that left ventricular chamber stiffness increases when myocardial O(2) demand exceeds supply. This change is usually masked in ischemic (reduced coronary flow) preparations, perhaps because of reduced turgor of the coronary vascular bed, marked reductions in systolic work (and therefore myocardial O(2) requirements), and local accumulation of hydrogen ion and metabolites following acute severe reduction of coronary flow. The increased chamber stiffness during hypoxia is accompanied by marked slowing of relaxation, with increased diastolic pressure relative to volume persisting throughout diastole.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11969424>Oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyldihydrofolate by complex IV of rat mitochondria.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that the unanticipated bioactivity of orally administered unnatural carbon-6 isomers, (6R)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-HCO-THF) and ()-5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH-THF), in humans [Baggott, J. E., and Tamura, T. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1472, 323-32] is explained by the rapid oxidation of ()-10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-HCO-THF), which is produced by in vivo chemical processes from the above folates. An oxidation of 10-HCO-THF produces 10-formyldihydrofolate (10-HCO-DHF), which no longer has the asymmetric center at carbon-6 and is metabolized by aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) transformylase forming bioactive dihydrofolate. Since cytochrome c (Fe(3+)) rapidly oxidizes both (6R)- and ()-10-HCO-THF [Baggott et al. (2001) Biochem. J. 354, 115-22], we investigated the metabolism of 10-HCO-THF by isolated rat liver mitochondria. We found that 10-HCO-THF supported the respiration of mitochondria without uncoupling ATP synthesis. The site of electron donation was identified as complex IV, which contains cytochrome c; the folate product was 10-HCO-DHF, and the reaction was saturable with respect to 10-HCO-THF. Both ()- (unnatural) and (6R)-10-HCO-THF supported the respiration of mitochondria, whereas ()-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-HCO-THF) was inactive. To our knowledge, this cytochrome c oxidation of 10-HCO-THF to 10-HCO-DHF in the mitochondrial intermembrane space represents a possible folate metabolic pathway previously unidentified and would explain the bioactivity of unnatural carbon-6 isomers, (6R)-5-HCO-THF and ()-5,10-CH-THF, in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22107234>Microscopic origin of the giant ferroelectric polarization in tetragonal-like BiFeO(3).</a></h1><p>We report direct experimental evidence for a room-temperature, ∼130  μC/cm(2) ferroelectric polarization from the tetragonal-like BiFeO(3) phase. The physical origin of this remarkable enhancement of ferroelectric polarization has been investigated by a combination of x-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and first principles calculations.

The similarity of the EXAFS spectra features of Ba(1-x)K(x)BiO(3) and La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) allowed us to propose a similar model for Cu-based superconducting oxides. The model, in a common approach, explains the antiferromagnetic state, metal-insulator phase transition and the appearance of superconductivity at Sr(2+) doping of La(2)CuO(4), and eliminates discrepancy between the neutron-scattering and EXAFS data.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306627>Favourable Outcomes of Endovascular Total Aortic Arch Repair Via Needle Based In Situ Fenestration at a Mean Follow-Up of 5.4 Months.</a></h1><p>Endovascular repair of aortic arch pathologies remains challenging. Recently, needle based in situ fenestration (ISF) has shown great potential in endovascular total aortic arch repair (ETAAR). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of ETAAR via needle based ISF, and to present initial experience with this technique.Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study. The supra-arch branches were manually punctured in a retrograde manner using liver biopsy needles (18 gauge/30 cm) in the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and brachiocephalic trunk (BCT), and endo-puncture system or aspiration biopsy needles (21-gauge) in the left subclavian artery (LSA). All the branches were revascularised with bridge stents. Routine follow-up occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post surgery.Ten patients with arch pathologies underwent ETAAR. Revascularisation of three branches was successfully performed in eight patients, but attempts to create ISF in LSA were unsuccessful in two patients because of tortuosity and sharp angle. The time taken to establish ISF in LCCA and BCT was 100.4s and 489., respectively. Bilateral regional cerebral  saturation (RCOS) decreased after the arch endograft deployment (both, p < .001) and recovered to the pre-operative level once both carotid arteries were reconstructed (left, p = .0856; right, p = .6). The right RCOS was higher with the beneficial effect of extracorporeal circulation (after cTAGs deployment, p < .001; after LCCA revascularised, p = .0148) during the ischaemic period. In one case, the left iliac artery ruptured, but no ISF related or neurological complications occurred. An early follow-up (mean 5.44 months) CTA and ultrasound confirmed patency of all the branch grafts without any endoleak or migration CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ETAAR via needle based ISF, making full use of off the shelf devices and techniques, can be successfully performed in aortic arch pathologies with a favourable early outcome.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

On reduction, the zirconium system forms two pyrochlore phases, Ce2Zr2O7 (pyrochlore-I) and Ce2Zr2O6.2 (pyrochlore-II), while the hafnium system forms only a disordered fluorite phase with the composition Ce0.5Hf0.5O1.77, under the same experimental conditions. The crystal structures of the reduction products have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, and their electronic structures have been investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy and electrical conductivity measurements. Pyrochlore-I (a = 10.6727(4) A) is a semiconductor, while pyrochlore-II (a = 10.6463(8) A) is a good conductor (with a nearly temperature independent resistivity of approximately 2.5 ohm.cm in the 400-1000 K range). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows an admixture of Ce(5d,) with Zr(4d) and O(2p) and a significant density of states near EF in the highly reduced pyrochlore-II phase.

The aim of this observational study was to describe the variability in  administration as well as the association between partial pressure of arterial  (PaO2 ) and mortality.We extracted data from two Scandinavian clinical trials of ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. We calculated average PaO2 and fraction of inspired  (FiO2 ) from trial inclusion and the following 5 days, and assessed the association between PaO2 and 90-day mortality.The median PaO2 was 9.8 kPa [5-95% range 6.4-19.9] and FiO2 was 0.51 [5-95% range 0.27-1.00], respectively. Eight hundred and five of 1,770 patients (45%) died. The relative risk of mortality was 1.43 [95% CI: 1.19-1.65] in patients with average PaO2 < 8 kPa and 1.29 [95% CI: 0.84-1.68] in patients with average PaO2 ≥ 16 kPa, as compared to patients with average PaO2 10-12 kPa. The relative risk of mortality was 1.38 [95% CI: 1.17-1.58] in patients with an average FiO2 0.60-0.80 and 2.10 [95% CI: 1.88-2.23] in patients with an average FiO2  ≥ 0.80 as compared to patients with an average FiO2  ≤ 0.40.Administration of  in patients with severe sepsis resulted in a wide range of PaO2 . Significantly higher mortality was observed in patients with an average PaO2 < 8 kPa and FiO2 ≥ 0.60.

For the activation of methane, the TSR (two-state reactivity) mechanism has been certified through the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) calculation and the Landau-Zener-type model. In the vicinity of the minimum energy crossing point (MECP), SOC equals 900.23 cm(-1) and the probability of intersystem crossing is approximately 0.62. Spin inversion makes the activation barrier decline from 1.63 to 0.57 eV. NBO analysis demonstrates that empty  and 5d orbitals of the Hf atom play the major role for the activation of C-H bonds. Finally, CH4 dehydrogenates to produce Hf-CH2(2+). For oxidation of CO by N2O catalyzed by HfO(2+) or TaO(2+), the covalent bonds between transition metal atoms and the  atom restrict the freedom of valence electrons. Therefore, they are all SSR (single-state reactivity). The  atom is directly extracted during the course of  transfer, and its microscopic essence has been discussed. The detailed kinetic information of two catalytic cycles has been calculated by referencing the "energetic span (δE)" model.

This represents the first investigation of nitrate supplementation and swimming time-trial (TT) performance. In a randomized double-blind repeated-measures crossover study, ten (5 male, 5 female) trained swimmers ingested 140ml nitrate-rich (~12.5mmol nitrate) or nitrate-depleted (~0.01mmol nitrate) beetroot juice. Three hours later, subjects completed a maximal effort swim TT comprising 168m (8 × 21m lengths) backstroke. Preexercise fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration was significantly elevated with nitrate compared with placebo, Mean (SD): 17 (9) vs. 7 (3)p.p.b., p = .008. Nitrate supplementation had a likely trivial effect on overall swim TT performance (mean difference 1.22s; 90% CI -0.18-2.; 0.93%; p = .144; d = 0.13; unlikely beneficial (22.6%), likely trivial (77.2%), most unlikely negative (0.2%)). The effects of nitrate supplementation during the first half of the TT were trivial (mean difference 0.29s; 90% CI -0.94-1.5s; 0.46%; p = .678; d = 0.05), but there was a possible beneficial effect of nitrate supplementation during the second half of the TT (mean difference 0.93s; 90% CI 0.13-1.70s; 1.36%; p = .062; d = 0.24; possibly beneficial (63.5%), possibly trivial (36.3%), most unlikely negative (0.2%)). The duration and speed of underwater swimming within the performance did not differ between nitrate and placebo (both p > .30). Nitrate supplementation increased nitric oxide bioavailability but did not benefit short-distance swimming performance or the underwater phases of the TT. Further investigation into the effects of nitrate supplementation during the second half of performance tests may be warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23744518>Effects of  vacancy on the electronic structure and multiferroics in sol-gel derived Pb(0.8)Co(0.2)TiO3 thin films.</a></h1><p>The single phase Pb(0.8)Co(0.2)TiO3 thin films were synthesized on a Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate by the sol-gel route. The present films exhibited homogeneous microstructure with low porosity. O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the amount of  vacancies. The ferroelectric measurements showed that the ferroelectricity deteriorates with the increase in the number of  vacancies. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and XPS were used to study the electronic structure. The results indicated that the decreased ferroelectricity might be ascribed to the weakened hybridization between O 2p and Pb  and Ti 3d orbitals. The ferromagnetic behaviors were also observed in the thin films and saturated magnetization raised monotonously with the  vacancy rising due to the enhanced F-center exchange interaction. Magnetoelectric coupling of the films weakened with  vacancy increase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9754325>Tyrosine hydroxylase: mechanisms of  radical formation.</a></h1><p>A new mechanism of  radical formation in dopaminergic neurons is proposed, based on the oxidative mechanism of tyrosine hydroxylase. The cofactor (6R,)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin can rearrange in solution which allows an autoxidation reaction producing O2.-, H2O2 and HO.. The combination of tyrosine hydroxylase and the cofactor produces more  radicals than does the autoxidation of the cofactor. This production of  radicals could be damaging to dopaminergic neurons. In the presence of tyrosine, the enzyme produces less radicals than it does in the absence of tyrosine. Mechanisms are proposed for the generation of reactive  species during the autoxidation of the cofactor and during enzymatic catalysis. The generation, by tyrosine hydroxylase, of very small amounts of  radicals over the period of 65 years could contribute to the oxidative stress that causes Parkinson's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11123999>Synthesis, SARs, and pharmacological characterization of 2-amino-3 or 6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivatives as potent, selective, and orally active group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists.</a></h1><p>(+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (4, LY354740), a highly selective and orally active group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, has increased interest in the study of group II mGluRs. Our interest focused on a conformationally constrained form of compound 4, because it appeared that the rigid form resulted in not only selectivity for group II mGluR but was orally active. Therefore, we introduced a fluorine atom to compound 4, based on the molecular size (close resemblance to hydrogen atom) and electronegativity (effects on the electron distribution in the molecule) of this atom and carbon-fluorine bond energy. Compound (+)-7 (MGS0008), the best compound among 3-fluoro derivatives 7-10, retained the agonist activity of compound 4 for mGluR2 and mGluR3 ((+)-7: EC(50) = 29.4 +/- 3.3 nM and 45.4 +/- 8.4 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively; 4: EC(50) = 18.3 +/- 1.6 nM and 62.8 +/- 12 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively) and increased the oral activity of compound 4 ((+)-7: ED(50) = 5.1 mg/kg and 0.26 mg/kg for phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperactivity and PCP-induced head-weaving behavior, respectively; 4: ED(50) = >100 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg for PCP-induced hyperactivity and PCP-induced head-weaving behavior, respectively).

On the basis of a successful result of compound 7, we focused on the introduction of a fluorine atom on the C6 position of compound 4. (1R,2S,5R, 6R)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid ((-)-11) exhibited a high degree of agonist activity for group II mGluRs equal to that of compound 4 or 7 ((-)-11: K(i) = 16.6 +/- 5.6 and 80.9 +/- 31 nM for mGluR2 and mGluR3, respectively). Our interest shifted to modification on CH(2) at C4 position of compound 11, since replacement of the CH(2) group with either an  atom or sulfur atom yielded compound 5 or 6, resulting in increased agonist activity. We selected a carbonyl group instead of CH(2) at the C4 position of compound 11. The carbonyl group might slightly change the relative conformation of three functional groups, the amino group and two carboxylic acids, which have important roles in mediating the interaction between group II mGluRs and their ligand, compared with the CH(2) group of 4,  atom of 5, and sulfur atom of 6. (1R,2S,5S,)-2-Amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo[3.1. 0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid monohydrate ((+)-14, MGS0028) exhibited a remarkably high degree of agonist activity for mGluR2 (K(i) = 0.570 +/- 0.10 nM) and mGluR3 (K(i) = 2.07 +/- 0.40 nM) expressed in CHO cells but not mGluR4, 6, 7, 1a, or 5 expressed in CHO cells (K(i) = >100 000 nM). Furthermore, compound (+)-14 strongly inhibited phencyclidine (PCP)-induced head-weaving behavior (ED(50) = 0.090 microg/kg) and hyperactivity (ED(50) = 0.30 mg/kg) in rats. Thus, (+)-7 and (+)-14 are potent, selective, and orally active group II mGluR agonists and might be useful not only for exploring the functions of mGluRs but in the treatment of schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2831016>Neutrophil-mediated mucosal injury. Role of reactive  metabolites.</a></h1><p>Reactive  metabolites (ROMs) are partially reduced  species that include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypohalous acids. Formation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide may be injurious to tissue directly; however, it is thought that the primary mediators of tissue damage are the secondarily derived oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and hypohalous acid. The gastrointestinal tract is particularly well endowed with the enzymatic machinery necessary to form large amounts of ROMs. Sources of ROMs in the gastrointestinal tract include mucosal oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, amine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase as well as the NADPH oxidase found in the resident phagocytic leukocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) of the lamina propria. We have demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic small intestine results in substantial mucosal injury that is mediated by oxy radicals generated from xanthine oxidase and inflammatory leukocytes. The final mediator of toxicity appears to be the hydroxyl radical derived from the iron-catalyzed interaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Data from our laboratories as well as other laboratories suggest that reactive  metabolites may play an important role in mediating mucosal injury during active episodes of ulcerative colitis. We present a working hypothesis which states that transient ischemic episodes in the bowel initiate a cascade of self-perpetuating cycles of ROM formation, inflammation and, ultimately, mucosal injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1408799>Synthesis of the diastereomers of thymidine glycol, determination of concentrations and rates of interconversion of their cis-trans epimers at equilibrium and demonstration of differential alkali lability within DNA.</a></h1><p>5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine (thymidine glycol) is a major product of the reaction of thymidine with reactive  species, including those generated by ionizing radiation. Thymidine glycol exists as 2 diastereomeric pairs by virtue of the chirality of the C(5) and C(6) atoms. A simple procedure is described for synthesizing and purifying each of the diastereomeric pairs separately. After brominating thymidine, the two trans 5-bromo-6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine (thymidine bromohydrin) C(5) diastereomers were easily separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Each thymidine bromohydrin was quantitatively converted to the corresponding diastereomeric thymidine glycol pair by reflux in aqueous solution. The concentrations at equilibrium of the cis (5S,6R),(5R,) and trans (5S,),(5R,6R) forms of the thymidine glycol diastereomers were determined and were 80% cis and 20% trans for the 5S pair and 87% cis and 13% trans for the 5R pair. At equilibrium, the rate of cis-trans epimerization of the two sets of diastereomers was essentially identical. The 5S diastereomeric pair was significantly more alkali labile than the 5R pair due to the higher concentration of the 5S trans epimer at equilibrium. This differential alkali lability was also manifest when the thymine glycol moiety was present in chemically oxidized poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) indicating that the chemical differences between the diastereomeric pairs are preserved in DNA. These chemical differences may affect the biological properties of this important oxidative derivative of thymine in DNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619675>Recovery dynamics of skeletal muscle  uptake during the exercise off-transient.</a></h1><p>The time course of muscle .V(O2) recovery from contractions (i.e., muscle .V(O2) off-kinetics), measured directly at the site of O(2) exchange, i.e., in the microcirculation, is unknown.

Physiol.] was associated with a slowed muscle .V(O2) recovery compared with that seen at the onset of contractions (time constant, tau approximately 23s, Behnke et al., 2002. Resp. Physiol.), i.e., on-off asymmetry.Measurements of capillary red blood cell flux and microvascular pressure of O(2) (P(O2) mv) were combined to resolve the temporal profile of muscle .V(O2) across the moderate intensity contractions-to-rest transition.Muscle .V(O2) decreased from an end-contracting value of 7.7+/-0.2 ml/100 g/min to 1.7+/-0.1 ml/100g/min at the end of the 3 min recovery period, which was not different from pre-stimulation .V(O2). Contrary to our hypothesis, muscle .V(O2) in recovery began to decrease immediately (i.e., time delay <2s) and demonstrated rapid first-order kinetics (tau, 25.5+/-2.) not different (i.e., symmetrical to) to those during the on-transient. This resulted in a systematic increase in microvascular P(O2) during the recovery from contractions.The slowed Qm kinetics in recovery serves to elevate the Qm/.V(O2) ratio and thus microvascular P(O2) . Whether this Qm response is obligatory to the rapid muscle .V(O2) kinetics and hence speeds the repletion of high-energy phosphates by maximizing conductive and diffusive O(2) flux is an important question that awaits resolution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706732>Kinetics of deamination and Cu(II)/H2O2/Ascorbate-induced formation of 5-methylcytosine glycol at CpG sites in duplex DNA.</a></h1><p>Mutation in p53 tumor suppressor gene is a hallmark of human cancers. Six major mutational hotspots in p53 contain methylated CpG (mCpG) sites, and C -->T transition is the most common mutation at these sites. It was hypothesized that the formation of 5-methylcytosine glycol induced by reactive  species, its spontaneous deamination to thymine glycol and the miscoding property of the latter may account, in part, for the ubiquitous C -->T mutation at CpG site. Here, we assessed the kinetics of deamination for two diastereomers of 5-methylcytosine glycol in duplex DNA. Our results revealed that the half-lives for the deamination of the (5S,) and (5R,6R) diastereomers of 5-methylcytosine glycol in duplex DNA at 37 degrees C were 37.4 +/- 1.6 and 27.4 +/- 1.0 h, respectively. The deamination rates were only slightly lower than those for the two diastereomers in mononucleosides. Next, we assessed the formation of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine glycol in the form of its deaminated product, namely, thymidine glycol (Tg), in methyl-CpG-bearing duplex DNA treated with Cu(II)/H(2)O(2)/ascorbate. LC-MS/MS quantification results showed that the yield of Tg is similar as that of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxycytidine. Together, our data support that the formation and deamination of 5-methylcytosine glycol may contribute significantly to the C -->T transition mutation at mCpG dinucleotide site.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26588274>RM1 Model for the Prediction of Geometries of Complexes of the Trications of Eu, Gd, and Tb.</a></h1><p>All versions of our previous Sparkle Model were very accurate in predicting lanthanide-lanthanide distances in complexes where the two lanthanide ions directly face each other, and mainly lanthanide-, and lanthanide-nitrogen distances, which are by far the most common ones in lanthanide complexes. In this article, we are advancing for the first time the RM1 model for lanthanides. Designed to be a much more general NDDO model, the RM1 model for lanthanides is capable of predicting geometries of lanthanide complexes for the cases when the central lanthanide trication is directly coordinated to any other atoms, not only  or nitrogen. The RM1 model for lanthanides is defined by three important attributes: (a) the orbitals, the lanthanide ion has now three electrons and a NDDO basis set made of 5d, , and 6p functions; (b) the parametrization, via cluster analysis and an adequate sampling; and (c), the statistical validation of the parameters to make sure the errors behave as random around a mean. All three aspects are described in detail in the article. Results indicate that the RM1 model does extend the accuracy of the previous Sparkle Models to types of coordinating bonds other than Ln-O and Ln-N; the most common ones for Eu, Gd, and Tb, being Ln-C, Ln-S, Ln-Cl, and Ln-Br. Overall, these other coordinating bonds are now predicted within 0.06 Å of their correct values. Therefore, the RM1 model here presented is capable of predicting geometries of lanthanide complexes, materials, metal-organic frameworks, etc., with useful accuracy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6141794>Inactivation of tyrosine hydroxylase by reduced pterins.</a></h1><p>Tyrosine hydroxylase [E.C. 1.14.16.2] is inactivated by incubation with its reduced pterin cofactors L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. Each of the two diastereoisomers of L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin inactivates tyrosine hydroxylase but the natural (6R) form is much more potent than the unnatural () form at equimolar concentrations. The pterin analog 6-methyl-5-deazatetrahydropterin, which has no cofactor activity, also inactivates the enzyme whereas the oxidized pterins 7,8 dihydrobiopterin and biopterin do not. The inactivation process is both temperature and time dependent and results in a reduction of the Vmax for both tetrahydrobiopterin and tyrosine.

We compared the two methods in determining CBV changes during multi-frequency visual stimulation (4 and 8 Hz). Specifically, we aimed to assess the impact of repetition time (TR) on CBV changes determination using VASO. With additional measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the flow-volume coupling relationship (α value) and cerebral metabolic rate of  were further determined. The results showed that i) using VASO, short TR (2s) caused overestimation of CBV changes, while long TR () generated consistent CBV results, by comparison to the GD-DTPA method; ii) overestimation of CBV changes caused underestimated CMRO(2) changes, but did not alter the frequency-related pattern, i.e., CMRO(2) changes at 4 Hz were greater than those at 8 Hz regardless of the TR; and iii) the tasked-induced CBF-CBV coupling was stimulus frequency-dependent, i.e., α = 0.35-0.38 at 4 Hz and α = 0.51-0.53 at 8 Hz. Our data demonstrated that, with carefully chosen TRs, CBV measurements can be achieved non-invasively with VASO techniques.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29866980>Medical Device Integrated Vital Signs Monitoring Application with Real-Time Clinical Decision Support.</a></h1><p>This research involves the design and development of a novel Android smartphone application for real-time vital signs monitoring and decision support.

This surface contained  vacancies in subsurface position within the topmost O-Ce-O trilayer [Pan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013, 111, 206101.]. The present work builds upon these findings and discusses additional results obtained using PBE+U and hybrid functionals. These approaches do not predict the same relative stabilities for the various adsorption sites of a single Au adatom at an O-defect concentration of a ¼ ML or 1.984 nm. We attribute this discrepancy to a different alignment within the O 2p-Ce 4f gap, i.e. a different order by energy of partially occupied Ce 4f and Au  orbitals. The energy offset of these orbitals matters, because the adsorption of Au() atop Ce(4f) or atop a subsurface  atom in the first coordination shell of a Ce(4f) involves creation of Au() and Ce(4f) ions. The electron transfer to Au is coupled to stabilizing ionic relaxation in the lattice, commonly known as polaronic distortion, reinforcing the Au-Ce bond. The order of 4f and  orbitals depends on the density functional approximation and is also strongly influenced by the  defect concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148906>Ginger compound [6]-shogaol and its cysteine-conjugated metabolite (M2) activate Nrf2 in colon epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.</a></h1><p>In this study, we identified Nrf2 as a molecular target of [6]-shogaol (), a bioactive compound isolated from ginger, in colon epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Following  treatment of HCT-116 cells, the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio was initially diminished but was then elevated above the basal level. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) correlated inversely with the GSH/GSSG ratio. Further analysis using gene microarray showed that  upregulated the expression of Nrf2 target genes (AKR1B10, FTL, GGTLA4, and HMOX1) in HCT-116 cells. Western blotting confirmed upregulation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein followed by Keap1 decrease and upregulation of Nrf2 target genes (AKR1B10, FTL, GGTLA4, HMOX1, and MT1) and glutathione synthesis genes (GCLC and GCLM).

Zeiss Airyscan 880 ″super-resolution" or "high-resolution" imaging was done with very low levels of illumination (0.009% laser power). In cellular areas imaged every 9 s (ROI or regions of interest), transient depolarizations of variable amplitudes occurred at increasing rates for the first 30 min. The time to first depolarization events was 8.4 min (±1.1 SEM n = 21 cells). At longer times, essentially permanent and irreversible depolarizations occurred at an increasing fraction of all events. In other cellular areas surrounding the ROI,  were rarely illuminated (once per 5 min) and virtually no permanent depolarization events occurred for over 1 h of imaging. These findings suggest that photon stress due to the imaging itself plays an important role in the generation of both the transient mPTP opening events as well as the permanent mPTP opening events. Consistent with the evidence that photon "stress" in  loaded with virtually any photon absorbing substance, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1-5], we show that cyclosporine-A (CsA, 10 μM) and the antioxidant n-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 10 mM), reduced the number of events by 80% and 93% respectively. Furthermore, CsA and NAC treatment led to the virtual disappearance of permanent depolarization events. Nevertheless, all transient depolarization events in any condition (control, CsA and NAC) appeared to repolarize with a similar half-time of 30 ± 6 s (n = 478) at 37 °C. Further experiments showed quantitatively similar results in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, using a different confocal system, and different photon absorbing reagent (TMRE; tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester). In these experiments, using modest power (1% laser power) transient depolarization events were seen in only 8 out of 23 cells while with higher power (8%), all cells showed transient events, which align with the level of photon stress being the driver of the effect. Together, our findings suggest that photon-induced ROS is sufficient to cause depolarization events of individual  in quiescent cells; without electrical or mechanical activity to stimulates mitochondrial metabolism, and without raising the mitochondrial matrix Ca. In a broad context, these findings neither support nor deny the relevance or occurrence of ΔΨ depolarization events in specific putatively physiologic mitochondrial behaviors such as MitoFlashes [6,7] or MitoWinks [8]. Instead, our findings raise a caution with regards to the physiological and pathophysiological functions attributed to singular ΔΨ depolarization events when those functions are investigated using photon absorbing substances. Nevertheless, using photon stress as a tool ("Optical Stress-Probe"), we can extract information on the activation, reversibility, permanency and kinetics of mitochondrial depolarization. These data may provide new information on mPTP, help identify the mPTP protein complex, and establish the physiological function of the mPTP protein complex and their links to MitoFlashes and MitoWinks.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The training groups were matched for work:rest ratio and total sprint time per session, and completed 6 training sessions over a 2-week period. Before and after the 2 week training period, participants completed a VO test and a 10km time trial on a cycle ergometer.Time trial performance increased significantly by 5.1% in  (630±115s to 598±92s; p<0.05) and 6.2% in 30s (579±68s to 543±85s; p<0.05) from baseline testing, but there was no significant change in the control group (p>0.05), and no significant difference between exercise groups (p>0.05).

The [Bi(DO3A)] case.</a></h1><p>We report a detailed study of the structure of the [Bi(DO3A)] complex both in the solid state and in solution. The X-ray crystal structure of [Bi(DO3A)] evidences the octa-coordination of the Bi(iii) ion, which is directly coordinated to the four nitrogen atoms of the cyclen unit and three  atoms of the carboxylate groups. The octa-coordination is completed by an  atom of a neighboring carboxylate group, which bridges Bi(iii) ions thanks to μ2-η1:η1 coordination, resulting in the formation of a coordination polymer. The Bi(iii) ion presents a twisted-square antiprismatic (TSAP) coordination geometry associated with the Δ(δδδδ)/Λ(λλλλ) enantiomeric pair. A computational DFT study indicates that the 6s2 lone pair of Bi(iii) is stereochemically active in [Bi(DO3A)] and most of the cyclen-based complexes reported in the literature. Depending on the spatial arrangement of the donor atoms of the ligand the lone pair points in different directions, so that Bi(iii) can easily accommodate different coordination environments. In solution the [Bi(DO3A)] complex exists as a monomeric complex, as demonstrated by DOSY measurements. The stability constant of the [Bi(DO3A)] complex, determined by using batch spectrophotometric titrations, was found to be rather high (log K = 26.85(5)). The complex presents characteristic absorption in the UV spectrum at 299 nm (ε = 8770 M-1 cm-1) that was attributed to the Bi(iii)-centered 6p ←  band on the basis of TDDFT calculations. Spectrophotometric titrations reveal weak binding of different anions to the [Bi(DO3A)] complex, with association constants of K11 = 3.55(8), 3.09(7), 6.2(1) and 2.19(5) for Cl-, Br-, I- and N3-, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486437>Small synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides afford neuroprotection in brain ischemia-related models.</a></h1><p>High molecular weight (HMW) glycosaminoglycanes of the extracellular matrix have been implicated in tissue repair.

Rat hippocampal slices subjected to  and glucose deprivation and a photothrombotic stroke model in mice were used. The three hyaluran disaccharides, incubated during the  and glucose deprivation (15min) and re-oxygenation periods (120min), reduced cell death of hippocampal slices measured as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, being the most potent di4,; in contrast, high molecular hyaluronan was ineffective. The protective actions of di4, against  and glucose deprivation were related to activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, reduction of p65 translocation to the nucleus, inhibition of inducible nitric oxide oxidase induction and reactive  species production, and to an increase in glutathione levels. Administered 1h post-stroke, di4, reduced cerebral infarct size and improved motor activity in the beam walk test. In conclusion, di4, affords neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic neuronal damage. Our results suggest that its neuroprotective effect could be exerted through its capability to reduce oxidative stress during ischemia. Its small molecular size makes it a more potential druggable drug to target the brain as compared with its HMW parent compound hyaluronan.Copyright © 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, visible micro channel methods [micro channel array flow analyzer (MC-FAN)] have been developed to clinically evaluate blood rheology. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to clarify the factors important for impairment of blood rheology in obese subjects using MC-FAN.One hundred and fifty-nine obese subjects and 100 non-obese subjects with no history of cardiovascular diseases were enrolled. Blood passage time (BPT) was measured using MC-FAN and relationships between BPT and various clinical parameters were examined.BPT was significantly higher in obese subjects than in non-obese subjects (obesity vs. non-obesity: 62.8 ± 17.9s vs. 54.1 ± 14., p<0.001); however, there were no significant relationships between BPT and body mass index or waist circumference in obese subjects. BPT was significantly related to systolic blood pressure levels (r=0.21; p<0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations (r=0.37; p<0.001), a marker of inflammation, and derivatives of reactive  metabolites test (r=0.38; p<0.001), a marker of oxidative stress, smoking, and exercise habits in obese subjects. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that derivatives of reactive  metabolites test (t=5.2; p<0.001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (t=3.6; p<0.01), smoking (t=3.2; p<0.001), and exercise habits (t=-2.4; p<0.05) were independent variables for BPT.Data indicate that inflammation, oxidative stress, and lifestyle choices are more important factors for impairment of blood rheology, which is evaluated by MC-FAN, than the degree of adiposity in obese subjects.Copyright © 2012 Japanese College of Cardiology.

In this regard, oxyfluorides appear unsuitable because of the higher electronegativity of fluorine. Here we show an exceptional case, an anion-ordered pyrochlore oxyfluoride PbTiOF that has a small band gap (ca. 2.4 eV). With suitable modification of PbTiOF by promoters such as platinum nanoparticles and a binuclear ruthenium(II) complex, PbTiOF worked as a stable photocatalyst for visible-light-driven H evolution and CO reduction. Density functional theory calculations have revealed that the unprecedented visible-light-response of PbTiOF arises from strong interaction between Pb- and O-2p orbitals, which is enabled by a short Pb-O bond in the pyrochlore lattice due to the fluorine substitution.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554612>Wearing compression socks during exercise aids subsequent performance.</a></h1><p>To assess the effect of wearing compression socks on immediate and subsequent 5km running time trials, with particular attention to the influences on physiological, perceptual and performance-based parameters.Counter-balanced cross-over experiment.Twelve male runners (mean±SD 5km run time 19:29±1:18min:s) each completed two experimental sessions. Sessions consisted of a standardised running warm-up, followed by a 5km time trial (TT1), a one hour recovery period, then a repeat of the warm-up and 5km time trial (TT2). One session required the use of sports compression socks during the first warm-up and time trial (COMP), while the other did not (CON).The decline in run performance in CON from TT1 to TT2 was moderate and significantly greater than that experienced by runners in COMP (9., d=0.67, p<0.01).

The HR-V O(2) relationship during GT was high (r(2)=0.96, p<0.001) but estimated V O(2) from HR was lower to that measured (p=0.03) in handball, whereas there was no difference in IE. 4-a-side handball game can be used as a specific alternative to IE for enhancing aerobic fitness in handball players. Nevertheless, the accuracy of HR measures for estimating V O(2) during handball is poor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137066>Transcriptional response of Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315 sessile cells to treatments with high doses of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite.</a></h1><p>Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria are opportunistic pathogens, which can cause severe respiratory tract infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). As treatment of infected CF patients is problematic, multiple preventive measures are taken to reduce the infection risk. Besides a stringent segregation policy to prevent patient-to-patient transmission, clinicians also advise patients to clean and disinfect their respiratory equipment on a regular basis. However, problems regarding the efficacy of several disinfection procedures for the removal and/or killing of B. cepacia complex bacteria have been reported. In order to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of biofilm-grown Burkholderia cenocepacia cells against high concentrations of reactive  species (ROS), the present study focussed on the transcriptional response in sessile B. cenocepacia J2315 cells following exposure to high levels of H2O2 or NaOCl.The exposure to H2O2 and NaOCl resulted in an upregulation of the transcription of 315 (4.4%) and 386 (5.4%) genes, respectively. Transcription of 185 (2.6%) and 331 (4.6%) genes was decreased in response to the respective treatments. Many of the upregulated genes in the NaOCl- and H2O2-treated biofilms are involved in oxidative stress as well as general stress response, emphasizing the importance of the efficient neutralization and scavenging of ROS. In addition, multiple upregulated genes encode proteins that are necessary to repair ROS-induced cellular damage. Unexpectedly, a prolonged treatment with H2O2 also resulted in an increased transcription of multiple phage-related genes. A closer inspection of hybridisation signals obtained with probes targeting intergenic regions led to the identification of a putative  RNA.Our results reveal that the transcription of a large fraction of B. cenocepacia J2315 genes is altered upon exposure of sessile cells to ROS. These observations have highlighted that B. cenocepacia may alter several pathways in response to exposure to ROS and they have led to the identification of many genes not previously implicated in the stress response of this pathogen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16542015>Methods for the synthesis of polyhydroxylated piperidines by diastereoselective dihydroxylation: exploitation in the two-directional synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide derivatives.</a></h1><p>Many polyhydroxylated piperidines are inhibitors of the oligosaccharide processing enzymes, glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. Aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics are compounds in which saturated polyhydroxylated nitrogen and  heterocycles are linked by an all-carbon tether. The saturated  heterocycle has the potential to mimic the departing sugar in a glycosidase-catalysed reaction and aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics may, therefore, be more potent inhibitors of these enzymes.The scope, limitations and diastereoselectivity of the dihydroxylation of stereoisomeric 2-butyl-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridin-3-ols is discussed. In the absence of a 6-substituent on the piperidine ring, the Upjohn (cat. OsO4, NMO, acetone-water) and Donohoe (OsO4, TMEDA, CH2Cl2) conditions allow complementary diastereoselective functionalisation of the alkene of the (2R*,3R*) diastereoisomer. However, in the presence of a 6-substituent, the reaction is largely controlled by steric effects with both reagents. The most synthetically useful protocols were exploited in the two-directional synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues. A two-directional oxidative ring expansion was used to prepare bis-enones such as (2R,,2'S)-6-methoxy-2-(6-methoxy-3-oxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,6-dihydro-2H-pyridin-3-one from the corresponding difuran. Selective substitution of its N,O acetal was possible. The stereochemical outcome of a two-directional Luche reduction step was different in the two heterocyclic rings, and depended on the conformation of the ring. Finally, two-directional diastereoselective dihydroxylation yielded seven different aza-C-linked disaccharide analogues.A two-directional approach may be exploited in the synthesis of aza-C-linked disaccharide mimetics. Unlike previous approaches to similar molecules, neither of the heterocyclic rings is directly derived from a sugar, allowing mimetics with unusual configurations to be prepared. The work demonstrates that highly unsymmetrical molecules may be prepared using a two directional approach. The deprotected compounds may have potential as inhibitors of oligosaccharide-processing enzymes and as tools in chemical genetic investigations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159978>Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia.</a></h1><p>Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is associated with mortality, amputation, and impaired quality of life. These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric ) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI. The importance of multidisciplinary teams and centers of excellence for amputation prevention is stressed as a key health system initiative.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery.

The hexacoordinate heme (Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemochrome form of holoShp (hemoShp) is stable in air in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, binds to apoHtsA with a K(d) of 120 +/- 18 microm, and transfers its heme to apoHtsA with a rate constant of 28 +/- (-1) at 25 degrees C, pH 8.0. The hemoHtsA product then autoxidizes to the hexacoordinate hemin (Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX) or hemichrome form (hemiHtsA) with an apparent rate constant of 0.017 +/- 0.002 s(-1). HemiShp also rapidly transfers hemin to apoHtsA through a hemiShp.apoHtsA complex (K(d) = 48 +/- 7 microM) at a rate approximately 40,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from hemiShp into solvent (k(transfer) = 43 +/- 3s(-1) versus k(-hemin) = 0.0003 +/- 0.00006 s(-1)). The rate constants for hemin binding to and dissociation from HtsA (k'(hemin) approximately 80 microm(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0026 +/- 0.0002 s(-1)) are 50- and 10-fold greater than the corresponding rate constants for Shp (k(hemin) approximately 1.6 microM(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0003 s(-1)), which implies that HtsA has a more accessible active site. However, the affinity of apoHtsA for hemin (k(hemin) approximately 31,000 microm(-1)) is roughly 5-fold greater than that of apoShp (k(hemin) approximately 5,300 microM(-1)), accounting for the net transfer from Shp to HstA. These results support a direct, rapid, and affinity-driven mechanism of heme and hemin transfer from the cell surface receptor Shp to the ATP-binding cassette transporter system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12236362>ESI-MS/MS for the differentiation of diastereomeric pyrimidine glycols in mononucleosides.</a></h1><p>Pyrimidine glycols, or 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimidines, are primary lesions in DNA induced by reactive  species. In this article, we report the preparation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) characterization of the two cis diastereomers of the glycol lesions of 2'-deoxyuridine, 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, and thymidine. Our results show that collisional activation of the [M + Na]+ ions of all the three pairs of cis isomers and that of the [M + H]+ ions of the 2'-deoxyuridine glycols and 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine glycols give a facile loss of a water molecule. Interestingly, the water loss occurs more readily for the  isomer than for the 6R isomer. Likewise, product ion spectra of the [M - H]- ions of the two cis isomers of the 2'-deoxyuridine glycols and thymidine glycols show more facile loss of water for the  isomer than for the 6R isomer. MS/MS acquired at different collisional energies gave similar results, which establishes the reproducibility of spectra.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705021>Functional characterization of recombinant hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase from Atropa belladonna.</a></h1><p>(-)-Hyoscyamine, the enantiomerically pure form of atropine, and its derivative scopolamine are tropane alkaloids that are extensively used in medicine. Hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H, EC 1.14.11.11), a monomeric α-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, converts (-)-hyoscyamine to its 6,7-epoxy derivative, scopolamine, in two sequential steps. In this study, H6H of Atropa belladonna (AbH6H) was cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. The catalytic efficiency of AbH6H, especially for the second oxidation, was found to be low, and this may be one of the reasons why Atropa belladonna produces less scopolamine than other species in the same family. 6,7-Dehydrohyoscyamine, a potential precursor for the last step of epoxidation, was shown not to be an obligatory intermediate in the biosynthesis of scopolamine using purified AbH6H with an in vitro (18)O labeling experiment. Moreover, the nitrogen atom in the tropane ring of (-)-hyoscyamine was found to play an important role in substrate recognition.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This stratification is needed to customize the choice of hemodynamic support that is best adapted to the patient's level of risk, integrating the use of the least invasive procedures. The macro-circulatory hemodynamic approach aims to maintain a balance between  supply (DO) and  demand (VO). Volume replacement plays a crucial role based on the titration of fluid boluses according to their effect on measured stroke volume or indices of preload dependency. Good function of the microcirculatory system is the best guarantee to achieve this goal. An assessment of the DO/VO ratio is needed for guidance in critical situations where tissue hypoxia may occur. Overall, all of these strategies are based on objective criteria to guide vascular replacement and/or tissue oxygenation in order to improve the patient's post-operative course by decreasing morbidity and hospital stay.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To tube, or not to tube, that is the question!</a></h1><p>Many standard trauma management guidelines advocate the early use of endotracheal intubation (ETI) and positive pressure ventilation as key treatment interventions in hemorrhagic shock. The evidence for using these airway and ventilation strategies to manage a circulation problem is unclear. The potentially harmful effects of drug-assisted intubation and positive pressure ventilation include reduced cardiac output, apnea, hypoxia, hypocapnea (due to inadvertent hyperventilation), and unnecessarily prolonged on-scene times. Conversely, the beneficial effects of spontaneous negative pressure ventilation on cardiac output are well described. Few studies, however, have attempted to explore the potential advantages of a strategy of delayed intubation and ventilation (together with a policy of aggressive volume replacement) in shocked trauma patients. Given the lack of evidence, the decision making around how, when, and where to subject shocked trauma patients to intubation and positive pressure ventilation remains complex. If providers choose to delay intubation, they must have the appropriate skills to safely manage the airway and recognize the need for subsequent intervention. If they decide to perform intubation and positive pressure ventilation, they must understand the potential risks and how best to minimize them. We suggest that for patients with hemorrhagic shock who do not have a compromised airway and who are able to maintain adequate  saturation (or mentation if monitoring is unreliable), a strategy of delayed intubation should be strongly encouraged.Review article, level IV.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554064>Mild training program in metabolic syndrome improves the efficiency of the  pathway.</a></h1><p>In sedentary patients suffering of metabolic syndrome, we evaluated the effects of mild exercise program (EP) on the efficiency of the  delivery system. The prescription of exercise (40 min/session, 3 times/week) was tailored at workload corresponding to ∼90% individual anaerobic threshold (AT). EP improved significantly by ∼10% peak values of  consumption (VO2) and heart rate (HR). Furthermore, in response to steady state workload at 90% AT, EP shortened the time constant of VO2, HR and the ratio VO2/HR (reflecting arterio-venous O2 concentration difference) by ∼. EP also decreased the elastic respiratory work due to a change in breathing pattern implying a larger contribution of respiratory rate, at the expense of tidal volume during exercise hyperventilation. In all subjects the perceived fatigue (Borg) decreased after training. This study supports a positive effect of a mild EP for the adaptive response of the  chain to face metabolic needs compatible with daily life in patients affected by metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the extent to which this altered P(O)(2)mv during contractions is associated with prolongated muscle metabolic recovery is not known. We tested the hypothesis that the aging-induced speeding of the P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics would presage slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics. The spinotrapezius muscle was exposed in six young (6-8 months) and seven old (26-28 months) male Fischer 344xBrown Norway F1-hybrid rats. The P(O)(2)mv kinetic profile was measured via phosphorescence quenching at rest, during electrically stimulated contractions (1Hz, 7-9V, 2ms pulse duration, 180s), and throughout recovery (180s). Aged rats which evidenced faster P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics (reduced mean response time (MRTon), young: 27.3+/-3., old: 19.2+/-1.; P<0.05) exhibited markedly slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics (increased MRToff, young: 46.5+/-5.9s, old: 84.8+/-7.9s; P<0.05). Accordingly, a greater degree of P(O)(2)mv on-off asymmetry (MRToff-MRTon) in the aged muscle was observed (young: 19.1+/-4.5s, old: 65.6+/-8.; P<0.01). We conclude that aging-induced speeding of the P(O)(2)mv on-kinetics does indeed presage a slowed P(O)(2)mv off-kinetics, which likely compromises muscle metabolic recovery and may reduce subsequent contractile performance. Moreover, the greater degree of P(O)(2)mv on-off asymmetry in the aged muscle suggests a mechanistic link between impaired microvascular oxygenation and altered muscle metabolic responses during exercise transitions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681438>Interconversion of the cis-5R,- and trans-5R,6R-thymine glycol lesions in duplex DNA.</a></h1><p>Thymine glycol (Tg), 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine, is formed in DNA by the reaction of thymine with reactive  species.

The Tg-modified oligodeoxynucleotide was annealed with either 5'-d(A(13)C(14)A(15)A(16)A(17)C(18)A(19)C(20)G(21)C(22)A(23)C(24))-3', forming the Tg(6) x A(19) base pair, corresponding to the oxidative damage of thymine in DNA, or 5'-d(A(13)C(14)A(15)A(16)A(17)C(18)G(19)C(20)G(21)C(22)A(23)C(24))-3', forming the mismatched Tg(6) x G(19) base pair, corresponding to the formation of Tg following oxidative damage and deamination of 5-methylcytosine in DNA. At 30 degrees C, the equilibrium ratio of cis-5R,:trans-5R,6R epimers was 7:3 for the duplex containing the Tg(6) x A (19) base pair. In contrast, for the duplex containing the Tg(6) x G(19) base pair, the cis-5R,:trans-5R,6R equilibrium favored the cis-5R, epimer; the level of the trans-5R,6R epimer remained below the level of detection by NMR. The data suggested that Tg disrupted hydrogen bonding interactions, either when placed opposite to A(19) or G(19). Thermodynamic measurements indicated a 13 degrees C reduction of T(m) regardless of whether Tg was placed opposite dG or dA in the complementary strand. Although both pairings increased the free energy of melting by 3 kcal/mol, the melting of the Tg x G pair was more enthalpically favored than was the melting of the Tg x A pair. The observation that the position of the equilibrium between the cis-5R, and trans-5R,6R thymine glycol epimers in duplex DNA was affected by the identity of the complementary base extends upon observations that this equilibrium modulates the base excision repair of Tg [Ocampo-Hafalla, M.

Implications for the enzyme mechanism and the antimicrobial action of ()-6-fluoroshikimate.</a></h1><p>Chorismate synthase catalyzes the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate to chorismate. It is the seventh enzyme of the shikimate pathway, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic metabolites from glucose. The chorismate synthase reaction involves a 1,4-elimination with unusual anti-stereochemistry and requires a reduced flavin cofactor. The substrate analogue ()-6-fluoro-5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of Neurospora crassa chorismate synthase (Balasubramanian, S., Davies, G. M., Coggins, J. R., and Abell, C. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 8945-8946). We have shown that this analogue is converted to 6-fluorochorismate by Escherichia coli chorismate synthase at a rate 2 orders of magnitude slower than the normal substrate. The decreased rate of reaction is consistent with the destabilization of an allylic cationic intermediate. The formation of chorismate and 6-fluorochorismate involves a common protein-bound flavin intermediate although the fluoro substituent does influence the spectral characteristics of this intermediate. The fluoro substituent also decreased the rate of decay of the flavin intermediate by 280 times. These results are consistent with the antimicrobial activity of ()-6-fluoroshikimate not being mediated by the inhibition of chorismate synthase but by the inhibition of 4-aminobenzoic acid synthesis as previously proposed (Davies, G.

The fast Fourier transformation with continuous cyclic voltammetry (FFTCV) in a flowing solution as a detection system was applied for the prompt morphine monitoring. Here it should be stressed that this technique is simple, precise, accurate, time saving and economical. This research includes the observation of the effects of various parameters on the sensitivity of the detection system. Eventually, it was concluded that the best condition was obtained within the pH value of 2, scan rate value of 40 V s(-1), accumulation potential of 400 mV and accumulation time of 0.. In detail, the noteworthy advantages which this method illustrates in comparison with other reported methods are the following; no necessity for the  removal from the test solution, a sub-nano molar detection limit and the fast determination of any such compound in a wide variety of chromatographic methods. The method proved to be linear over the concentration range of 285-305,300 pg mL(-1) (r=0.999) with a detection limit and a quantitation limit of 95.5 and 285 pg mL(-1), respectively.

The sensitivity of the optical  sensor is quantified in terms of the ratio I(0)/I(100), where I(0) and I(100) represent the detected fluorescence intensities in pure nitrogen and pure  environments, respectively. The experimental results show that the  sensor has a sensitivity (I(0)/I(100)) of 166. The response time was 1.3s when switching from pure nitrogen to pure , and 18. when switching in the reverse direction. The experimental results show that compared to  sensors based on PtTFPP, PtOEP, or Ru(dpp)(3)(2+) dyes, the proposed optical fiber  sensor has the highest sensitivity. In addition to the increased surface area per unit mass of the sensing surface, the dye entrapped in the core of silica nanoparticles also increases the sensitivity because a substantial number of aerial  molecules penetrate the porous silica shell. The dye entrapped core-shell nanoparticles is more prone to  quenching.Copyright  2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
