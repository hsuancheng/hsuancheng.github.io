These organisms have been well described to cause chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection, and urethritis, and to a lesser degree surgical site infection and infection in transplant recipients. Outside of these settings, invasive  infections are rare. We describe the case of a young woman receiving rituximab for multiple sclerosis who presented with fever and bilateral renal abscesses due to  spp., which was successfully treated with oral doxycycline. We searched the literature for cases of invasive  infection and found a patient population that predominates with humoral immunodeficiency, either congenital or iatrogenic. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are discussed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Herein we review advances in the field and highlight therapeutic implications.Pre-clinical and translational human trials have elucidated complement-dependent mechanisms of post-transplant ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Immune cell-derived, and intracellular, complement activation are newly linked to proinflammatory T cell  relevant to allograft rejection. Complement-induced immune regulation, including C5a ligation of C5a receptor 2 on T cells, C5a/C5a receptor 1 interactions on regulatory myeloid cells, and C1q binding to CD8 T cells can inhibit proinflammatory T cells and/or prolong murine allograft survival. Pilot trials of complement inhibition to treat/prevent human I/R- or antibody-initiated allograft injury show promise.The complement system participates in allograft injury through multiple context- dependent mechanisms involving various components and receptors. These new insights along with development and implementation of individualized complement inhibitory strategies have potential to improve transplant outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662748>Gastric Cancer in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Blockade.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most important malignancies worldwide because of its high incidence and mortality. The very low survival rates are mainly related to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. GC is the final clinical outcome of a stepwise process that starts with a chronic and sustained inflammatory reaction mounted in response to  infection. The bacterium modulates innate and adaptive  presumably as part of the strategies to survive, which favors the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that ultimately facilitates GC progression. T-cell exhaustion, which is characterized by elevated expression of immune checkpoint (IC) proteins, is one of the most salient manifestations of immunosuppressive microenvironments. It has been consistently demonstrated that the tumor-immune microenvironment(TIME)-exhausted phenotype can be reverted by blocking ICs with monoclonal antibodies. Although these therapies are associated with long-lasting response rates, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit, which varies according to tumor site. The search for biomarkers to predict the response to IC inhibition is a matter of intense investigation as this may contribute to maximize disease control, reduce side effects, and minimize cost. The approval of pembrolizumab for its use in GC has rocketed immuno-oncology research in this cancer type. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge centered around the immune contexture and recent findings in connection with IC inhibition in GC.Copyright © 2019 Lucía Figueroa-Protti et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665027>Flipping the dogma - phosphatidylserine in non-apoptotic cell death.</a></h2><p>The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer plasma membrane has long been considered a unique feature of apoptotic cells. Together with other "eat me" signals, it enables the recognition and phagocytosis of dying cells (efferocytosis), helping to explain the immunologically-silent nature of apoptosis. Recently, however, PS exposure has also been reported in non-apoptotic forms of regulated inflammatory cell death, such as necroptosis, challenging previous dogma. In this review, we outline the evidence for PS exposure in non-apoptotic cells and extracellular vesicles (EVs), and discuss possible mechanisms based on our knowledge of apoptotic-PS exposure. In addition, we examine the outcomes of non-apoptotic PS exposure, including the reversibility of cell death, efferocytosis, and consequent inflammation. By examining PS biology, we challenge the established approach of distinguishing apoptosis from other cell death pathways by AnnexinV staining of PS externalization. Finally, we re-evaluate how PS exposure is thought to define apoptosis as an immunologically silent process distinct from other non-apoptotic and inflammatory cell death pathways. Ultimately, we suggest that a complete understanding of how regulated cell death processes affect the immune system is far from being fully elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661527>Factors associated with pneumococcal carriage and density in infants and young children in Laos PDR.</a></h2><p>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged 5-8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12-23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged 5-8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39-2.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99-2.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12-23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.97-3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined).

Here, we generated TAM molecular signatures from K14cre;Cdh1;Trp53 (KEP) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT) transgenic mice that resemble human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and HER2 tumors, respectively. Determination of TAM-specific signatures requires comparison with healthy mammary tissue macrophages to avoid overestimation of gene expression differences. TAMs from the two models feature a distinct transcriptomic profile, suggesting that the cancer subtype dictates their phenotype. The KEP-derived signature reliably correlates with poor overall survival in ILC but not in triple-negative breast cancer patients, indicating that translation of murine TAM signatures to patients is cancer subtype dependent. Collectively, we show that a transgenic mouse tumor model can yield a TAM signature relevant for human breast cancer outcome prognosis and provide a generalizable strategy for determining and applying immune cell signatures provided the murine model reflects the human disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized inflammation without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate  regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene.Patients with unclassified and/or unexplained autoinflammatory syndromes present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and collectively form a substantial part of every cohort of patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to acquire their full genomic profile through whole exome and/or genome sequencing and present their cases to a broader audience, to facilitate characterization of similar patients. A critical mass of well-characterized cases will lead to improved diagnosis and informed treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659127>PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A-B'γ controls Botrytis cinerea resistance and developmental leaf senescence.</a></h2><p>Plants optimize their growth and survival through highly integrated regulatory networks that coordinate defensive measures and developmental transitions in response to environmental cues. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key signaling component that controls stress reactions and growth at different stages of plant development, and the PP2A regulatory subunit PP2A-B'γ is required for negative regulation of pathogenesis responses and for maintenance of cell homeostasis in short day conditions. Here, we report molecular mechanisms by which PP2A-B'γ regulates Botrytis cinerea resistance and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We extend the molecular functionality of PP2A-B'γ to a protein kinase-phosphatase interaction with the defense-associated calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK1 and present indications this interaction may function to control CPK1 activity. In pre-senescent leaf tissues, PP2A-B'γ is also required to negatively control the expression of salicylic acid-related defense genes, which have recently proven vital in plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. In addition, we find the premature leaf yellowing of pp2a-b'γ depends on salicylic acid biosynthesis via SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 and bears the hallmarks of developmental leaf senescence. We propose PP2A-B'γ age-dependently controls salicylic acid-related signaling in plant  and developmental leaf senescence.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

According to various estimates, 10-20% of all human cancers are caused by viruses. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus were implicated in initiating tumors. At the same time, the long period between viral infection and the manifestation of cancer significantly complicates the search for a causal relationship between the presence of a virus in the human organism and the malignant transformation. For this reason, the role of certain viruses in the initiation of neoplastic processes in humans remains an unresolved issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673056>Jagged1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling activates HSF1/Snail and controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation in liver inflammatory injury.</a></h2><p>Notch signaling plays important roles in the regulation of immune cell functioning during the inflammatory response. Activation of the innate immune signaling receptor NLRP3 promotes inflammation in injured tissue. However, it remains unknown whether Jagged1 (JAG1)-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates NLRP3 function in acute liver injury. Here, we report that myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates the NLRP3-driven inflammatory response in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced liver injury. In a mouse model of liver IR injury, Notch1-proficient (Notch1) mice receiving recombinant JAG1 showed a reduction in IR-induced liver injury and increased Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) expression, whereas myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout (Notch1) aggravated hepatocellular damage even with concomitant JAG1 treatment. Compared to JAG1-treated Notch1 controls, Notch1 mice showed diminished HSF1 and Snail activity but augmented NLRP3/caspase-1 activity in ischemic liver. The disruption of HSF1 reduced Snail activation and enhanced NLRP3 activation, while the adoptive transfer of HSF1-expressing macrophages to Notch1 mice augmented Snail activation and mitigated IR-triggered liver inflammation. Moreover, the knockdown of Snail in JAG1-treated Notch1 livers worsened hepatocellular functioning, reduced TRX1 expression and increased TXNIP/NLRP3 expression. Ablation of myeloid Notch1 or Snail increased ASK1 activation and hepatocellular apoptosis, whereas the activation of Snail increased TRX1 expression and reduced TXNIP, NLRP3/caspase-1, and ROS production. Our findings demonstrated that JAG1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling promotes HSF1 and Snail activation, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 function and hepatocellular apoptosis leading to the alleviation of IR-induced liver injury. Hence, the Notch1/HSF1/Snail signaling axis represents a novel regulator of and a potential therapeutic target for liver inflammatory injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659244>Immunological memory: ILC1s come into view.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668931>Japanese flounder pol-miR-3p-2 suppresses Edwardsiella tarda infection by regulation of autophagy via p53.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that play vital roles in diverse physiological processes including . In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism and function of a novel Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) miRNA, pol-miR-3p-2. pol-miR-3p-2 was responsive in expression to the infection of the bacterial pathogen Edwardsiella tarda. pol-miR-3p-2 negatively regulated the expression of p53 through interaction with the 3'UTR of p53. Overexpression of pol-miR-3p-2 promoted autophagy, resulting in augmented production of LC3-II, while knockdown of p53 increased the level of beclin, a key factor of autophagy. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that E. tarda infection induced autophagy in flounder, and pol-miR-3p-2 inhibited the infectivity of E. tarda. Together these results indicate that pol-miR-3p-2 regulates autophagy through the target gene p53, thus revealing a regulatory link between p53 and autophagy in teleost, and that pol-miR-3p-2 plays an important role in the immune defense against E. tarda.Copyright © 2019.

However, few studies have focused on the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cell-mediated humoral  or on interactions between CD8+ T cells and B cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that the frequency of IL-21-producing CD8+CXCR5+ T cells was higher in HCC tumor tissue than in peritumoral tissue or peripheral blood from the same patients or in blood from healthy donors. Moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells migrated in response to supernatants from primary HCC (HCC-SN) cells, and HCC-SN cells also powerfully induced CXCR5 expression in CD8+ T cells and IL-21 expression in CD8+CXCR5+ T cells. CD8+CXCR5+ T cells from HCC patients, but not those from healthy individuals, stimulated CD19+ B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts. These findings reveal that CD8+CXCR5+ T cells strongly infiltrate HCC tumors, and their infiltration is predictive of a better prognosis. Surprisingly, moreover, CD8+CXCR5+ T cells produced IL-21, which induced B cells to differentiate into IgG-producing plasmablasts and to play a key role in humoral  in HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662039>Measles  in the China-Myanmar border region, Lincang city, Yunnan province, 2017.</a></h2><p>: A recent measles importation-related outbreak in the China-Myanmar border region required outbreak response immunization to stop the outbreak, raising the question of measles  in the area.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and immunotherapy. Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell . Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot. These findings are relevant for genotoxic and immune therapies for cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, few studies have been performed to characterize the IL-1β in lower vertebrates. Herein, we distinguished the Scophthalmus maximus IL-1β (SmIL-1β) from three IL-1β like sequences and found that SmIL-1β was cleaved by S. maximus caspase at a non-conserved Asp, then targeted to the plasma membrane. Moreover, during the immersion infection of Edwardsiella piscicida, we found that E. piscicida were mainly colonized in gills at early time points and invaded to systemic sites after 5 days post infection, which was consistent with the dynamic up-regulated transcription of SmIL-1β. Furthermore, knockdown of SmIL-1β promotes the bacterial colonization in gills at early time points and result into systemic colonization, while overexpression of SmIL-1β hampers the bacterial colonization in both spleen and kidney.

Key challenges for the identification of a predictive immune signature include the high dimensionality of data produced by high-throughput technologies and the limitation of standard statistical tests in accounting for synergetic interactions between immune responses to multiple targets. In this study, using samples collected from young children in Ghana at multiple time points during a longitudinal study, we adapted a predictive modelling framework which combines feature selection and machine learning techniques to identify an antigen signature of clinical  to malaria. Our results show that an individual's immune status can be accurately predicted by measuring antibody responses to a small defined set of 15 target antigens. We further demonstrate that the identified immune signature is highly versatile and capable of providing precise and accurate estimates of clinical protection from malaria in an independent geographic community. Our findings pave the way for the development of a robust point-of-care test to identify individuals at high risk of disease and which could be applied to monitor the impact of vaccinations and other interventions.

We employed RNA sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile gene expression in blood and the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants born at <29 weeks gestational age and diagnosed with BPD in comparison to those of preterm infants that were not diagnosed with BPD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, performed longitudinally on 255 fecal samples collected from 50 infants in the first months of life, identified significant differences in the relative levels of abundance of , and  in the BPD infants in a manner that was birth mode dependent. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed that more than 400 genes were upregulated in infants with BPD. Genes upregulated in BPD infants were significantly enriched for functions related to red blood cell development and oxygen transport, while several immune-related pathways were downregulated. We also identified a gene expression signature consistent with an enrichment of immunosuppressive CD71 early erythroid cells in infants with BPD. Intriguingly, genes that were correlated in their expression with the relative abundances of specific taxa in the microbiota were significantly enriched for roles in the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota might influence immune gene expression systemically. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a serious inflammatory condition of the lung and is the most common complication associated with preterm birth. A large body of evidence now suggests that the gut microbiota can influence  and inflammation systemically; however, the role of the gut microbiota in BPD has not been evaluated to date. Here, we report that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota of infants born at <29 weeks gestation and subsequently diagnosed with BPD, which are particularly pronounced when infants are stratified by birth mode. We also show that erythroid and immune gene expression levels are significantly altered in BPD infants. Interestingly, we identified an association between the composition of the microbiota and immune gene expression in blood in early life.

We examined disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services between migrant and non-migrant people recently diagnosed with HIV living in the Netherlands, taken into account sexual orientation. Also, we examined differences in experiences in living with HIV between these groups.We used a questionnaire and clinical data collected between July 2013 and June 2015 among migrant and non-migrant participants of the European cross-sectional aMASE (Advancing Migrant Access to health Services in Europe) study in the Netherlands. Using univariable logistic regression analyses, we compared outcomes on between migrants and non-migrants, stratified by sexual orientation (with non-migrant men having sex with men [MSM] as the reference group).We included 77 migrant MSM, 115 non-migrant MSM, 21 migrant heterosexual men, 14 non-migrant heterosexual men and 20 migrant women. In univariable analyses, all heterosexual groups were less likely to ever have had an HIV-negative test before their diagnosis and were more likely to be diagnosed late than non-migrant MSM. All migrant groups were more likely to have experienced difficulties accessing general healthcare in the Netherlands and were less likely to have heard of post-exposure prophylaxis than non-migrant MSM. Migrants frequently reported uncertainty about their rights to healthcare and language barriers. Most (93%) participants visited a healthcare facility in the 2 years before HIV diagnosis but only in 41% an HIV test was discussed during that visit (no statistical difference between groups). Migrant heterosexuals were more likely to have missed appointments at their HIV clinic due to the travel costs than non-migrant MSM. Migrant MSM and women were more likely to have experienced HIV discrimination in the Netherlands than non-migrant MSM.Disparities in access to and use of HIV-related health services and experiences exist by migrant status but also by sexual orientation.

Our study was performed on two cohorts of infants from southern Benin (525 and 250 individuals used as discovery and replication cohorts, respectively) closely followed from birth to 18-24 months of age, with an assessment of a space- and time-dependent environmental risk of exposure.

Two members of the IFIT protein family: IFIT1 and IFIT5 are capable of binding the very terminal 5' end of mRNA. In eukaryotes these mRNA termini contain a cap structure (m7GpppN, cap 0) that is often subjected to further modifications. Here, we performed a thorough examination of IFIT1 and IFIT5 binding to a wide spectrum of differently capped as well as fully uncapped mRNAs. The kinetic analysis of IFIT1 and IFIT5 interactions with mRNA ligands indicates that the cap structure modifications considerably influence the stability of IFIT1/RNA complexes. The most stable complexes were formed between IFIT1 and GpppG/A- and m7GpppG/A-RNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that NAD+- and NADH-capped RNAs associate with IFIT5 with kinetic parameters comparable to pppG-RNA. Finally, we measured interactions of IFIT1 with mRNAs bearing modified synthetic cap analogs that start to become the important tools in biotechnological and medicinal research. We found that incorporation of modified cap analogs to the RNA protects the latter, to a certain degree, from the translational inhibition caused by IFIT1 protein.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658987>A  missense variant causes flagella destabilization and asthenozoospermia.</a></h2><p>Asthenozoospermia is a common cause of male infertility, but its etiology remains incompletely understood.

Extrinsic factors such as diet and host  are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of microbiome composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut microbiome contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut microbiome. These clusters encode arrays of  genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted  factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by AID systems helps to shape human gut microbiome ecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658944>Modeling the dynamics of  gametocytes in humans during malaria infection.</a></h2><p>Renewed efforts to eliminate malaria have highlighted the potential to interrupt human-to-mosquito transmission - a process mediated by gametocyte kinetics in human hosts.

Such a method is still used to measure potency of live Oral Poliovirus Vaccine during vaccine development and production and in some clinical trials. However, the conventional method is not suited to identify and titrate virus in the large numbers of fecal samples generated during clinical trials. Determining titers of each of the three Sabin strains co-existing in Oral Poliovirus Vaccine presents an additional challenge.A new assay using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction as an endpoint instead of cytopathic effect was developed to overcome these limitations. In the multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay, cell cultures were infected with serial dilutions of test samples, lysed after two-day incubation, and subjected to a quantitative multiplex one-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All three serotypes of poliovirus were identified in single samples and titers calculated. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was reproducible, robust and sensitive. Its lower limits of titration for three Sabin strains were 1-5 cell culture 50% infectious doses per ml. We prepared different combinations of three Sabin strains and compared titers obtained with conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assays. Results of the two assays correlated well and showed similar results and sensitivity. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was completed in two to 3 days instead of 10 days for the conventional assay.The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration (MPBT) is the first quantitative assay that identifies and titrates each of several different infectious viruses simultaneously in a mixture. It is suitable to identify and titrate polioviruses rapidly during the vaccine manufacturing process as a quality control test, in large clinical trials of vaccines, and for environmental surveillance of polioviruses. The MPBT assay can be automated for high-throughput implementation and applied for other viruses including those with no cytopathic effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665637>STING-Mediated IFI16 Degradation Negatively Controls Type I Interferon Production.</a></h2><p>γ-interferon-inducible protein-16 (IFI16), a key DNA sensor, triggers downstream STING-dependent type I interferon (IFN-I) production and antiviral . However, it is still unclear how to negatively regulate IFI16 to avoid excessive IFN-I production and autoimmunity. Here, we find that STING directly interacts with IFI16 and facilitates IFI16 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by recruiting the E3 ligase TRIM21. The 1-pyrin region of IFI16 is responsible for the IFI16-STING interaction, and the first three lysines in the N-terminal region of IFI16 are the key sites that lead to STING-mediated IFI16 ubiquitination and degradation. Compared to wild-type IFI16, a higher level of viral DNA triggered IFN-β and antiviral IFN-stimulated gene expression, and thus less HSV-1 infection, was observed in the cells transfected with IFI16-K3/4/6R, an IFI16 mutant that is resistant to degradation. STING-mediated negative feedback regulation of IFI16 restricts IFN-I overproduction during antiviral  to avoid autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2019 Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine.

In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin-which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection-is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell  against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this -rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs-causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1). Mice with natural  against MmuPV1 after colonization and acquired  through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8 T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8 T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting  against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661051>To TRIM or not to TRIM: the balance of host-virus interactions mediated by the ubiquitin system.</a></h2><p>The innate immune system responds rapidly to protect against viral infections, but an overactive response can cause harmful damage. To avoid this, the response is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The ubiquitin system represents a powerful PTM machinery that allows for the reversible linkage of ubiquitin to activate and deactivate a target's function. A precise enzymatic cascade of ubiquitin-activating, conjugating and ligating enzymes facilitates ubiquitination. Viruses have evolved to take advantage of the ubiquitin pathway either by targeting factors to dampen the antiviral response or by hijacking the system to enhance their replication. The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases has garnered attention as a major contributor to innate . Many TRIM family members limit viruses either indirectly as components in innate immune signalling, or directly by targeting viral proteins for degradation. In spite of this, TRIMs and other ubiquitin ligases can be appropriated by viruses and repurposed as valuable tools in viral replication. This duality of function suggests a new frontier of research for TRIMs and raises new challenges for discerning the subtleties of these pro-viral mechanisms. Here, we review current findings regarding the involvement of TRIMs in host-virus interactions. We examine ongoing developments in the field, including novel roles for unanchored ubiquitin in innate , the direct involvement of ubiquitin ligases in promoting viral replication, recent controversies on the role of ubiquitin and TRIM25 in activation of the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, and we discuss the implications these studies have on future research directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666931>T-helper 1-type cytokines induce apoptosis and loss of HER-family oncodriver expression in murine and human breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>A recent neoadjuvant vaccine trial for early breast cancer induced strong Th1  against the HER-2 oncodriver, complete pathologic responses in 18% of subjects, and for many individuals, dramatically reduced HER-2 expression on residual disease. To explain these observations, we investigated actions of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) on murine and human breast cancer cell lines that varied in the surface expression of HER-family receptor tyrosine kinases. Breast cancer lines were broadly sensitive to the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α, as evidenced by lower metabolic activity, lower proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, and in some cases a reversible inhibition of surface expression of HER proteins. Apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the pharmacologic caspase-3 activator PAC-1 mimicked both the killing effects and HER-2-suppressive activities of Th1 cytokines, while a caspase 3/7 inhibitor could prevent cytokine-induced HER-2 loss. These studies demonstrate that many  effects of vaccination (apparent tumor cell death and loss of HER-2 expression) could be replicated  using only the principle Th1 cytokines. These results are consistent with the notion that IFN-γ and TNF-α work in concert to mediate many biological effects of therapeutic vaccination through the induction of a caspase 3-associated cellular death mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662000>Chicken toll-like receptors and their significance in immune response and disease resistance.</a></h2><p>Infectious diseases are a major challenge for the poultry industry that causes widespread production losses. Thus, management and control of poultry health and diseases are essential for the viability of the industry. Toll-like receptors are best characterized as membrane-bound receptors that perform a central role in immune homeostasis and disease resistance by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In response to pathogen recognition, TLRs initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses which may help to develop immunomodulatory therapeutics for TLR associated diseases. Vaccination produces specific  in the animal's body towards pathogens. However, due to certain disadvantages of vaccines, (inactivation of attenuated pathogens into the virulent strains and weak immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines) there is a crucial need to develop the safe and effective therapeutic intervention. TLR ligands have been classified as a potential adjuvant against the infectious diseases in farm animals. TLR adjuvants induce both specific and nonspecific immune responses in chickens to combat several bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review was to explore the chicken TLR4 and their role in immune responses and disease resistance to develop disease resistance poultry breeds in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661509>APOL1-G0 protects podocytes in a mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy.</a></h2><p>African polymorphisms in the gene for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) confer a survival advantage against lethal trypanosomiasis but also an increased risk for several chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674070>Natural variation in the contribution of microbial density to inducible immune dynamics.</a></h2><p>Immune responses evolve to balance the benefits of microbial killing against the costs of autoimmunity and energetic resource use. Models that explore the evolution of optimal immune responses generally include a term for constitutive , or the level of immunological investment prior to microbial exposure, and for inducible , or investment in immune function after microbial challenge. However, studies rarely consider the functional form of inducible immune responses with respect to microbial density, despite the theoretical dependence of immune system evolution on microbe- versus immune-mediated damage to the host. In this study, we analyze antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression from seven wild-caught flour beetle populations (Tribolium spp.) during acute infection with the virulent bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and Photorhabdus luminescens (P.lum) to demonstrate that inducible immune responses mediated by the humoral IMD pathway exhibit natural variation in both microbe density-dependent and independent temporal dynamics. Beetle populations that exhibited greater AMP expression sensitivity to Bt density were also more likely to die from infection, while populations that exhibited higher microbe density-independent AMP expression were more likely to survive P. luminescens infection. Reduction in pathway signaling efficiency through RNAi-mediated knockdown of the imd gene reduced the magnitude of both microbe-independent and dependent responses and reduced host resistance to Bt growth, but had no net effect on host survival. This study provides a framework for understanding natural variation in the flexibility of investment in inducible immune responses and should inform theory on the contribution of non-equilibrium host-microbe dynamics to immune system evolution.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665431>PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3) modulates  in Arabidopsis thaliana.</a></h2><p>Small post-translationally modified peptides are important signalling components of plant defence responses against phytopathogens, acting both as positive and negative modulators.

Treatment with synthetic PIP peptides led to similar transcriptome reprogramming, indicating an effect on innate -related processes and phytohormones, including jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling. PIP3 overexpressing (OX) plants showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to flg22 exposure. In addition, flg22-induced production of reactive oxygen species and callose deposition were significantly reduced in PIP3-OX plants. Interestingly, PIP3-OX plants showed increased susceptibility both toward Botrytis cinerea and the biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Expression of both JA and salicylic acid biosynthesis and signalling genes was more induced during B. cinerea infection in PIP3-OX plants compared with wild-type plants. Promoter and ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the transcription factors WRKY18, WRKY33 and WRKY40 cooperatively act as repressors for PIP3.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious immunotherapy of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660979>Effects of VEGF blockade on the dynamics of the inflammatory landscape in glioblastoma-bearing mice.</a></h2><p>Targeting angiogenesis has been and continues to be an attractive therapeutic modality in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. However, GBM rapidly becomes refractory to anti-VEGF therapies. Myeloid cell infiltration is an important determinant of tumor progression. Given that VEGF is a modulator of the innate immune response we sought to analyze the dynamics of this response in a mouse model of GBM undergoing anti-VEGF therapy.We grafted GL261-DsRed cells in transgenic Thy1-CFP//LysM-EGFP//CD11c-EYFP reporter mice. We combined recurrent spectral two-photon imaging with multiparametric cytometry, immunostaining, and brain clearing to characterize at two critical stages of tumor development (day 21 and day 28 after tumor grafting) the nature and spatial distribution of the innate response in control and bevacizumab-treated mice.We report that at an early stage (21 day), VEGF blockade has a detectable effect on the number of microglial cells but only a mild effect on the number of infiltrating myeloid cells. At a later stage (day 28), the treatment resulted in a specific adjustment of dendritic cell subsets. In treated mice, the number of monocytes and their monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) progeny was increased by approximately twofold compared to untreated mice. In agreement, by in vivo quantitative imaging, we observed that treatment increased the number of LysM-EGFP cells traveling in tumor blood vessels and doubled the densities of both infiltrated LysM-EGFP monocytes and double-labeled EGFP/EYFP moDC. The treatment also led to an increased density of conventional cDCs2 subset together with a decrease of cDCs1 subset, necessary for the development of anti-tumor . Finally, we describe differential spatial cell distributions and two immune cell-traveling routes into the brain. LysM-EGFP cells distributed as a gradient from the meninges towards the tumor whereas CD11c-EYFP/MHCII cells were located in the basal area of the tumor. Brain clearing also revealed a flow of CD11c-EYFP cells following the corpus callosum.We uncovered new features in the dynamics of innate immune cells in GBM-bearing mice and deciphered precisely the key populations, i.e., DC subsets controlling immune responses, that are affected by VEGF blockade. Since despite differences, human pathogenesis presents similarities with our mouse model, the data provide new insights into the effect of bevacizumab at the cellular level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659068>Europium Nanoparticle-Based Sialyl-Tn Monoclonal Antibody Discriminates Epithelial Ovarian Cancer-Associated CA125 from Benign Sources.</a></h2><p>The Sialyl-Thomsen-nouveau antigen (STn) is abundantly produced on many types of human epithelial cancers including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We previously developed an EOC-specific lectin sandwich immunoassay (CA125) using a human macrophage galactose-binding lectin coated on fluorescent europium nanoparticles (Eu-NPs) as a tracer and an anti-CA125-specific mAb for capture. Here we have identified a novel STn-mAb that efficiently recognizes the EOC-associated STn antigen on CA125 when coated on Eu-NPs.CA125 from the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3, placental homogenate, and ascites fluid from patients with liver cirrhosis was captured by anti-CA125 antibody immobilized on microtitration wells and traced with anti-STn-mAb-Eu-NPs. Samples from EOC or patients with endometriosis with marginally increased conventional CA125 immunoassay (CA125; 35-200 U/mL) and healthy controls were analyzed.An analytically sensitive CA125 assay that specifically recognized the CA125 isoform produced by OVCAR-3 was achieved. Serum CA125 concentration was significantly higher in EOC patients than in those with endometriosis ( < 0.001). Furthermore, the sensitivity for detection of EOC with CA125 assay was 73.3% when 95% of endometriosis cases were undetectable.Our findings suggest that Eu-NPs-based CA125 assay could help reduce the false-positive rates of CA125 to improve differential diagnosis. The results encourage studying further the potential use of CA125 to detect EOC at earlier clinical stages.

Cord blood samples were retrieved at birth and infants were actively followed for the first 6 months of life. Nasal swabs were collected and tested for influenza A and B by RT-PCR whenever an illness episode was identified. Cord blood samples were tested by the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to viruses that circulated during the follow-up period.1162 infants were born to 1140 recruited women: 1092 (94%) infants completed 6 months of follow-up. Proportions of cord blood with HAI antibodies titers ≥40 against A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Victoria and B/Yamagata were 31%, 24%, 31% and 54%, respectively. Only 4% of women had maternal influenza vaccination. Cord blood antigen-specific HAI titers ≥40 were found to correlate with protection from infection only for influenza B/Yamagata.

Furthermore, in clinical trials, AMG 510 demonstrated anti-tumour activity in the first dosing cohorts and represents a potentially transformative therapy for patients for whom effective treatments are lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670188>Virus-induced natural killer cell lysis of T cell subsets.</a></h2><p>In addition to direct anti-viral activity, NK cells regulate viral pathogenesis by virtue of their cytolytic attack on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells. To gain insight into which differentiated T cell subsets are preferred NK targets, transgenic T cells were differentiated in vitro into Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tc1, and Tc2 effector cells and then tested for lysis by enriched populations of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-induced activated NK cells. There was a distinct hierarchy of cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, with Treg, Th17, and Th2 cells being more sensitive and Th0 and Th1 cells more resistant. Some distinctions between in vitro vs in vivo generated T cells were explainable by type 1 interferon induction of class 1 histocompatibility antigens on the effector T cell subsets. NK receptor (NKR)-deficient mice and anti-NKR antibody studies identified no one essential NKR for killing, though there could be redundancies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is not clear whether they are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 862 cases with HCC and 1120 controls, was conducted to assess the effects of 258 SNPs in the coding regions of ADAMTS4 on HCC risk and prognosis. We found that six SNPs in ADAMTS4 were differential distribution between cases and controls via the primary screening analyses; however, only rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were further identified to modify the risk of HCC (odds ratio: 2.73 and 2.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.28-3.29 and 2.43-3.58; P-value, 5.73 × 10 and 1.36 × 10 , respectively). Significant interaction between these two SNPs and two known causes of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin B1 were also observed. Furthermore, rs538321148 and rs1014509103 polymorphisms were associated not only with clinicopathological features of tumor such as tumor stage and grade, microvessel density, and vessel metastasis, but with poor overall survival. Additionally, these SNPs significantly downregulated ADATMS4 expression in tumor tissues. These data suggest that SNPs in the coding region of ADAMTS4, such as rs538321148 and rs1014509103, may be potential biomarkers for predicting HCC risk and prognosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Functional activation of infected DCs and NK cell-mediated IFN-γ secretion essentially contributes to the protective  against  How DCs and NK cells cooperate during the anti-chlamydial response is not fully understood. Therefore, in our present study, we investigated the functional interplay between -infected DCs and NK cells. Our biochemical and cell biological experiments show that -infected dendritic cells (DCs) display enhanced exosome release. We find that such extracellular vesicles (referred to as dexosomes) do not contain infectious bacterial material but strongly induce IFN-γ production by NK cells. This directly affects  growth in infected target cells. Furthermore, NK cell-released IFN-γ in cooperation with TNF-α and/or dexosomes augments apoptosis of non-infected as well as infected epithelial cells. Thus, the combined effect of dexosomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines restricts  growth and attenuates bacterial subversion of apoptotic host cell death. In conclusion, this provides new insights into the functional cooperation between DCs, dexosomes and NK cells in the early steps of anti-chlamydial defense.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669220>Impact of the host environment on the antitubercular action of pyrazinamide.</a></h2><p>Pyrazinamide remains the only drug in the tuberculosis pharmacopeia to drastically shorten first-line therapy from nine to six months. Due to its unparalleled ability to sterilize non-replicating bacilli and reduce relapse rates, PZA is expected to be irreplaceable in future therapies against tuberculosis. While the molecular target of PZA is unclear, recent pharmacokinetic studies using small animal models and patient samples have highlighted the importance of host metabolism and immune responses in PZA efficacy. Delineating which host factors are important for PZA action will be integral to the design of next-generation therapies to shorten current TB drug regimens as well as to overcome treatment limitations in some patients. In this review, we discuss evidence for influence of the host environment on PZA activity, targets for PZA mechanism of action, recent studies in PZA pharmacokinetics, PZA antagonism and synergy with other first-line anti-TB drugs, and implications for future research.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Oncoproteins are up-regulated under various stress conditions and promote cell survival. Oncoproteins and their immunogenic domains could serve well as tumour vaccines and prime the hosts' active anti-tumour .Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify potential tumour associated antigens (TAAs). Then, peptides derived from CD151 were designed and synthesized according to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I binding and immunogenicity. Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging were performed to assess the active anti-tumour  triggered by CD151 peptides in H22 primary hepatoma and experimental 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis models.CD151 was identified as an ideal TAA based on proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. CD151 peptides as tumour vaccines triggered active anti-tumour  against H22 hepatoma and the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer in two mouse models through the activation of CD8IFNγ lymphocytes and the subsequent targeted cytotoxicity. Further, the peptides suppressed the negative regulators, myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Survival was prolonged for mice with lung metastases from CD151 peptide-immunised groups.The up-regulated oncoproteins in 8 Gy-irradiated tumour cells are good candidates for designing immunogenic peptides as tumour vaccines. Anti-tumour active  primed by peptides from CD151 may be an effective and safe approach to suppress cancer progression.Copyright © 2019.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) induces the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, involved in antigen presentation in reactive astrocytes. The pathway for MHCII delivery to the astrocyte plasma membrane, where MHCII present antigens, is unknown. Rat astrocytes in culture and in organotypic slices were exposed to IFNγ to induce reactive astrogliosis. Astrocytes were probed with optophysiologic tools to investigate subcellular localization of immunolabeled MHCII, and with electrophysiology to characterize interactions of single vesicles with the plasmalemma. In culture and in organotypic slices, IFNγ augmented the astrocytic expression of MHCII, which prominently co-localized with lysosomal marker LAMP1-EGFP, modestly co-localized with Rab7, and did not co-localize with endosomal markers Rab4A, EEA1, and TPC1. MHCII lysosomal localization was corroborated by treatment with the lysosomolytic agent glycyl-L-phenylalanine-β-naphthylamide, which reduced the number of MHCII-positive vesicles. The surface presence of MHCII was revealed by immunolabeling of live non-permeabilized cells. In IFNγ-treated astrocytes, an increased fraction of large-diameter exocytotic vesicles (lysosome-like vesicles) with prolonged fusion pore dwell time and larger pore conductance was recorded, whereas the rate of endocytosis was decreased. Stimulation with ATP, which triggers cytosolic calcium signaling, increased the frequency of exocytotic events, whereas the frequency of full endocytosis was further reduced. In IFNγ-treated astrocytes, MHCII-linked antigen surface presentation is mediated by increased lysosomal exocytosis, whereas surface retention of antigens is prolonged by concomitant inhibition of endocytosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663080>An Antimicrobial Dental Light Curable Bioadhesive Hydrogel for Treatment of Peri-Implant Diseases.</a></h2><p>Dental implants constitute the standard of care to replace the missing teeth, which has led to an increase in the number of patients affected by peri-implant diseases (PIDs). Here, we report the development of an antimicrobial bioadhesive, GelAMP, for the treatment of PIDs. The hydrogel is based on a visible light-activated naturally-derived polymer (gelatin) and an antimicrobial peptide (AMP).

New lessons have been learnt with regard to the clinical management of severe YF as a result of the Brazilian outbreak. With increasing YF cases in travelers, travel medicine providers need to familiarize themselves with the diagnosis and clinical management of severe YF. Prevention remains the mainstay, and all efforts need to be taken that travelers do not circumvent the International Health Regulations.

Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in IBD is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in IBD. Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution.

However, there is a paucity of data on severe typhoid fever and its associated acute and chronic host immune response and carriage. The Severe Typhoid Fever in Africa (SETA) program, a multicountry surveillance study, aimed to address these research gaps and contribute to the control and prevention of invasive salmonellosis.A prospective healthcare facility-based surveillance with active screening of enteric fever and clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with complications was performed using a standardized protocol across the study sites in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, and Nigeria. Defined inclusion criteria were used for screening of eligible patients for enrollment into the study. Enrolled patients with confirmed invasive salmonellosis by blood culture or patients with clinically suspected severe typhoid fever with perforation were eligible for clinical follow-up. Asymptomatic neighborhood controls and immediate household contacts of each case were enrolled as a comparison group to assess the level of Salmonella-specific antibodies and shedding patterns. Healthcare utilization surveys were performed to permit adjustment of incidence estimations. Postmortem questionnaires were conducted in medically underserved areas to assess death attributed to invasive Salmonella infections in selected sites.Research data generated through SETA aimed to address scientific knowledge gaps concerning the severe typhoid fever and mortality, long-term host immune responses, and bacterial shedding and carriage associated with natural infection by invasive salmonellae.SETA supports public health policy on typhoid immunization strategy in Africa.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that our original s17 syn+ stock was a mixed population from which we have isolated a minor variant that, unlike other strains in the laboratory, fails to be efficiently released from infected cells and spreads predominantly by direct cell-to-cell transmission. Analysis of other s17-derived viruses that had been isolated elsewhere revealed a number with the same release phenotype. Second-generation sequencing of 8 plaque-purified s17-derived viruses revealed sequences that vary by 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including approximately 10 coding SNPs. This compared to interstrain variations of around 800 SNPs in strain Sc16, of which a quarter were coding changes. Amongst the variations found within s17, we identified 13 variants of glycoprotein C within the original stock of virus that were predominantly a consequence of altered homopolymeric runs of C residues. Characterization of seven isolates coding for different forms of gC indicated that all were expressed, despite six of them lacking a transmembrane domain. While the release phenotype did not correlate directly with any of these identified gC variations, further demonstration that nine clinical isolates of HSV1 also fail to spread through extracellular release raises the possibility that propagation in tissue culture had altered the HSV1 s17 transmission phenotype. Hence, the s17 intrastrain variation identified here offers an excellent model for understanding both HSV1 transmission and tissue culture adaptation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663136>Prognostic role of the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio for clinical outcomes of patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated by sorafenib.</a></h2><p>The lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) reflects the status of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and host . The LMR has been reported as a prognostic marker in various cancers. The present study evaluated the role of the LMR as a prognostic marker in patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).Retrospective cohort study PATIENTS: Forty patients with progressive RAIR DTC who were treated by sorafenib with available baseline complete blood cell count data.We assessed the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).The patients were divided into low and high LMR groups based on their baseline LMRs (<4, n = 22, 55% and ≥ 4, n = 18, 45%, respectively). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. The OS curves differed significantly based on the LMR. The median OS of the low LMR group was 24.3 months and that of the high LMR group was not reached until the end of observation period (P = 0.015). The PFS curves and median PFS also differed significantly based on the LMR values (P = 0.019). In multivariate analysis, low LMR was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with progressive RAIR DTC (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-6.72, P = 0.041).A low LMR was associated with poor response rate, PFS, and OS in patients with progressive RAIR DTC treated with sorafenib.

Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer immunotherapy, respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665078>Inflammatory cytokines and organ dysfunction associate with the aberrant DNA methylome of monocytes in sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated systemic immune response to infection, associates with reduced responsiveness to subsequent infections. How such tolerance is acquired is not well understood but is known to involve epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation.Bead arrays were used to compare global DNA methylation changes in patients with sepsis, non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and healthy controls. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to dissect functional reprogramming and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of these specific DNA methylation alterations. Finally, in vitro experiments using human monocytes were performed to test the induction of similar DNA methylation reprogramming.Here, we focused on DNA methylation changes associated with sepsis, given their potential role in stabilizing altered phenotypes. Tolerized monocytes from patients with sepsis display changes in their DNA methylomes with respect to those from healthy controls, affecting critical monocyte-related genes. DNA methylation profiles correlate with IL-10 and IL-6 levels, significantly increased in monocytes in sepsis, as well as with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; the observed changes associate with TFs and pathways downstream to toll-like receptors and inflammatory cytokines. In fact, in vitro stimulation of toll-like receptors in monocytes results in similar gains and losses of methylation together with the acquisition of tolerance.We have identified a DNA methylation signature associated with sepsis that is downstream to the response of monocytes to inflammatory signals associated with the acquisition of a tolerized phenotype and organic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671151>Endothelial nitric oxide synthase limits host  to control disseminated Candida albicans infections in mice.</a></h2><p>Three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) occur in mammals. High levels of NO produced by NOS2/iNOS can protect against bacterial and parasitic infections, but the role of NOS in fungal innate  is less clear. Compared to wild type mice, Nos3-/- mice showed significantly higher survival of candidemia caused by Candida albicans SC5314. NOS3/eNOS is expressed by endothelial cells in the kidney, and colonization of this organ was decreased during the sub-acute stage of disseminated candidiasis. Nos3-/- mice more rapidly eliminated Candida from the renal cortex and exhibited more balanced local inflammatory reactions, with similar macrophage but less neutrophil infiltration than in infected wild type. Levels of the serum cytokines IL-9, IL-12, IL-17 and chemokines GM-CSF, MIP1α, and MIP1β were significantly elevated, and IL-15 was significantly lower in infected Nos3-/- mice. Spleens of infected Nos3-/- mice had significantly more Th2 and Th9 but not other CD4+ T cells compared with wild type. Inflammatory genes associated with leukocyte chemotaxis, IL-1 signaling, TLR signaling and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways were significantly overexpressed in infected Nos3-/- kidneys, with Nos2 being the most strongly induced. Conversely, the general NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased virulence in the mouse candidemia model, suggesting that iNOS contributes to the protective mechanism in infected Nos3-/- mice. By moderating neutrophil infiltration, the absence of eNOS may reduce the collateral damage to kidney cortex, and Th-9 CD4+ cells may enhance clearance of the infection. These data suggest that selective eNOS inhibition could mitigate candidemia by a combination of systemic and local responses that promote a more effective host immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669534>Effects of regulatory T cells on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase vaccine efficacy against Schistosoma japonicum.</a></h2><p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a candidate subunit vaccine that induces protective  and elicits partial resistance to Schistosoma japonicum upon mouse and livestock vaccination. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which were defined as CD4CD25Foxp3 cells, on the efficacy of a GAPDH vaccine against S. japonicum. BALB/c female mice were randomly divided into five groups as follows: normal, infected control, anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD25 mAb), GAPDH group, and co-treated with anti-CD25 mAb and GAPDH group. The worm reduction and liver egg reduction rates in the GAPDH group were 32.46% and 35.43%, respectively, which increased to 60.09% and 58.78%, respectively, after anti-CD25 mAb administration. Compared with those in the infected control group, the percentage of Tregs in the spleen decreased significantly when GAPDH and anti-CD25 mAb were used either alone or in combination. Furthermore, secretions associated with the Th1 response increased in splenocytes of the anti-CD25 mAb group, whereas the Th1 and Th2 responses increased in splenocytes of the GAPDH and co-treated groups. Compared to that in the infected control group, granuloma diameter in the GAPDH and co-treated groups increased slightly, but there were no significant differences among the groups. Our results indicate that the protective effect of the GAPDH vaccines can be improved by decreasing Tregs and enhancing the Th1- and Th2-type immune responses. Therefore, anti-CD25 mAb and GAPDH might exert synergistic effects to clear parasites by decreasing the frequency of Tregs and increasing the Th1- and Th2-type immune responses.Copyright © 2019.

BRD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in all classes of cattle but particularly young beef and dairy calves. Passive antibodies not only help protect the calf against infection, but may interfere with the immune responses following vaccination. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an adjuvanted modified live virus (MLV) vaccine in the presence of well-defined maternal passive . Calves were vaccinated at approximately 1 month of age and challenged ~90 days later when BRSV systemic antibodies were ≤1:4. Body temperature was lower at 6 and 7 days post challenge and other clinical signs were also lower in the vaccinates. Nasal viral shed was 3-4 times lower in the vaccinated animals as measured by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and peaked 5 days post challenge compared to the controls (who peaked at days 6 and 7). On day 8 following challenge, animals were necropsied, and lung lobes were scored and tested for virus by PCR and indirect fluorescent assay (IFA). There was a 25-fold reduction in PCR virus detection in vaccinates and two of the vaccinated calves' lungs were PCR negative. Only 29.4% of vaccinated calves were BRSV positive on IFA testing at necropsy, while 87.5% of control calves were BRSV positive. Vaccinated calves developed a mucosal BRSV IgA response with over 50% of the vaccinated calves having IgA prior to challenge and all vaccinated calves were positive following challenge. Additionally, vaccination stimulated the production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in mononuclear cells to prime the immune system.

Using genome sequencing and repeat-primed PCR, we identify another site of this repeat expansion, in MARCH6 (FAME3) in four European families. Analysis of single DNA molecules with nanopore sequencing and molecular combing show that expansions range from 3.3 to 14 kb on average. However, we observe considerable variability in expansion length and structure, supporting the existence of multiple expansion configurations in blood cells and fibroblasts of the same individual. Moreover, the largest expansions are associated with micro-rearrangements occurring near the expansion in 20% of cells.

The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Fiji, indigenous iTaukei have higher prevalence of pneumococcal carriage compared with Fijians of Indian Descent (FID). We hypothesised that contact differences may contribute to ethnic differences in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and density.In 2015, young infants (5-8 weeks), toddlers (12-23 months), children (2-6 years), and caregivers from Suva and surrounding areas, participated in a cross-sectional survey (n = 2014), three years post pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. Demographic and contact data, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. Pneumococci were detected, and quantified using quantitative real-time PCR, with molecular serotyping by microarray. Associations between ethnicity, contact, and pneumococcal carriage and density were estimated using multivariable generalised estimating equation regression models.iTaukei participants had larger household sizes, higher pneumococcal carriage rates, more contacts, and more frequent contacts of longer duration, compared with FID. The odds of vaccine-type carriage increased by 28% (95% CI 8-53%) P < 0.01 in association with physical contact with 7-14 year old children. iTaukei ethnicity was associated with vaccine-type carriage (aOR) 1.73; 95% CI 1.06-2.82, P = 0.03) and non-vaccine type carriage (aOR 5.98; 95% CI 4.47-8.00, P < 0.01). Ethnicity and contact were not associated with pneumococcal density.iTaukei had greater frequency and intensity of contact compared with FID. Physical contact was associated with pneumococcal carriage. Observed differences in pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence between iTaukei and FID were not explained by differences in social contact patterns by ethnicity.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

However, the regulation of neutrophil activation, infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we revealed that OX40 was expressed by neutrophils, its expression in neutrophils was time-dependently upregulated following HIRI, and Ox40 knockout markedly alleviated liver injury. Compared with wild-type neutrophils, the adoptive transfer of Ox40-/- neutrophils decreased HIRI in neutrophil-depleted Rag2/Il2rg-/- or Ox40-/- mice. Moreover, consistently, the in vitro experiments showed that Ox40 not only prolonged neutrophil survival but also promoted proinflammatory cytokines, ROS production, and even neutrophil chemotaxis. Further investigation demonstrated that the knockout of Ox40 in neutrophils inhibited NF-κB signaling via the TRAF1/2/4 and IKKα/IKKβ/IκBα pathways. OX40L and OX86 stimulation could enhance neutrophil activation and survival in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study provides a new understanding of OX40, which is expressed not only in adaptive immune cells but also in innate immune cells, i.e., neutrophils, contributing to the activation and survival of neutrophils. These findings provide a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention of HIRI during liver transplantation or hepatic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661784>Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of the Interaction between  and Apple Fruit ( Mill.) during Early Stages of Infection.</a></h2><p>Blue mold, caused by , is an important postharvest disease of apple, and can result in significant economic losses.

Active clinical and environmental surveillance systems with meticulous laboratory investigations provide insights into poliovirus transmission patterns and genomic diversity to inform decisions for strategic operations required to achieve eradication.We analyzed epidemiological and virological data at molecular level to comprehend the current epidemiological status of WPV1 in Pakistan during 2015-2017. Stool specimens of AFP patients and sewage samples collected from 60 active environmental sites. Viral culturing, intratypic differentiation by real time-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing of VP1 region of poliovirus genome to determine the genetic relatedness among WPV1 strains were applied. The phylogenetic analysis were done using BEAST v2.3.0 [1] .Poliovirus isolates were grouped into eleven distinct clusters which had ≥95% nucleotide homology in VP1 coding region. Most burden of poliovirus was shared by three major reservoirs i.e. Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta block (64.2% in 2015; 75.4% in 2016 and 76.7% in 2017).Environmental surveillance reveals importations and pockets of unimmunized children which dictate intensive target mop-up campaigns in such areas to contain poliovirus transmission. Decrease in number of orphan isolates reflects effective combination of AFP and ES surveillance working in Pakistan. The genetic data reflects sustained transmission within reservoir areas, further expanded by periodic importations to areas of high  reflected by immediate termination of imported viruses. However, it is suggestive that Pakistan is at-risk unless the entire country including Afghanistan attain a polio-free status. Improved immunization coverage with high quality surveillance is vital for global certification.© The Author(s) 2019.

Upon binding of the target DNA, Cas12a induces a nick in each of the target DNA strands, yielding a double-stranded DNA break. In addition to inducing cis-cleavage of the targeted DNA, target DNA binding induces trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. As such, Cas12a-RNA guide complexes can provide sequence-specific  against invading nucleic acids such as bacteriophages and plasmids. Akin to CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been repurposed as a genetic tool for programmable genome editing and transcriptional control in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In addition, its trans-cleavage activity has been applied for high-sensitivity nucleic acid detection. Despite the demonstrated value of Cas12a for these applications, the exact molecular mechanisms of both cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA were not completely understood. Recent studies have revealed mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediates DNA cleavage: base pairing of the RNA guide and the target DNA induces major conformational changes in Cas12a. These conformational changes render Cas12a in a catalytically activated state in which it acts as deoxyribonuclease. This deoxyribonuclease activity mediates cis-cleavage of the displaced target DNA strand first, and the RNA guide-bound target DNA strand second. As Cas12a remains in the catalytically activated state after cis-cleavage, it subsequently demonstrates trans-cleavage of non-target DNA. Here, I review the mechanistic details of Cas12a-mediated cis- and trans-cleavage of DNA. In addition, I discuss how bacteriophage-derived anti-CRISPR proteins can inhibit Cas12a activity.© 2019 The Author(s).

Residual papaya could be re-utilized to culture Tilapia mossambica as dietary supplement. Therefore, a novel integrated system of the improvement of yield, antioxidant and nonspecific  of Tilapia mossambica by dietary residual papaya was proposed and investigated. Tilapia mossambica could grow well in all supplement residual papaya groups. Survival rate, yield, whole fish body composition under 15-45% groups were increased compared with control group (CK). Bioactive substances (polyphenols and vitamin) in residual papaya enhanced ALP, ACP, phagocytic, SOD, CAT activities through up-regulating ALP, ACP, SOD, CAT genes expression levels. Theoretical analysis showed bioactive substances regulated these genes expressions and enzyme activities as stimulus signal, component, active center. Moreover, residual papaya improved mTOR and NF-kB signaling pathway. Furthermore, residual papaya inhibited Aeromonas hydrophila that increased resistance to diseases.

Correlation with disease severity expressed by EDSS, MSSS, progression index and Herbert´s scale severity grade.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune demyelinating disease of the brain and spinal cord. Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory and anti-Th1, Th17 activities, activates the function of regulatory T cells, shifts the immune response towards Th2, so it might be favorable for downregulation of the disease pathogenesis, and if inflammation and Th1 and Th17  are hyperactivated. The aim of our study was to highlight the role of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.We investigated 178 patients with multiple sclerosis. Plasma levels of 25(OH)D and HMGB1 were investigated.Despite a regular use of VD by patients, the plasma levels of 25(0H)D were significantly decreased in 57% of them, 14.1% had VD deficiency (level of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and more than 6 % of patients had VD severe deficiency with the plasma level of 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL. The level of 25(OH)D negatively correlated with the severity of the disease (EDSS, index of progression, duration of the disease) and negative association was found also with Herbert´s six severity grades. HMGB1 levels were higher in patients (p < 0.0001).Our result showed that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. We believe that administration of vitamin D to patients at a sufficient dose providing a physiological level of vitamin D could have a positive effect on the course of the disease. However, regular monitoring of vitamin D levels is required, which should be at least within 30-75 ng/mL, and even more, but below the toxicity limit (Tab. 6, Ref. 66).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672704>Expression of the checkpoint receptors LAG-3, TIM-3 and VISTA in peripheral T cell lymphomas.</a></h2><p>Peripheral T cell lymphomas represent approximately 10%-15% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and are characterised by an aggressive clinical courses and poor outcomes. Ligands provided by constituents of the tumour microenvironment engage receptors expressed by malignant T cells, promoting tumour growth and chemotherapy resistance. In addition to stimulatory receptors that promote the growth and survival of malignant T cells, recent studies suggest that homologous inhibitory receptors may have an opposing effect and function as tumour suppressors. For example, recent data suggest that programmed cell death 1 blockade may lead to increased lymphoma growth. Therefore, the identification of alternative checkpoint receptors in T cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms is an important and clinically relevant question.The checkpoint receptors T cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3), V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) play fundamental roles in peripheral tolerance, and their ligands are exploited by many solid tumours to evade host . However, their expression in T cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms has not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the expression of TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 in a cohort of peripheral T cell lymphomas cases by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis.Our results demonstrate that TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 expression is rarely identified within a large cohort of T cell lymphomas and its tumour microenvironment.Our data suggest that immune-regulatory roles for TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 may be predominant in lymphomas subsets different than the ones analysed in the current study. However, a potential role for these checkpoint receptors as tumour suppressors in T cell lymphomas remains to be elucidated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral  to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral  to the microbiota in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier  and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health. Promoting Trm and their interaction with dendritic cells rather than immunosuppression may reinforce tissue , improve barrier function and prevent B-cell dysfunction in microbiota-associated disease and IBD etiology.© European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673191>Triangulation of measles vaccination data in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</a></h2><p>To illustrate how data triangulation involving routine data sources can optimize data usage and provide insights into vaccine programme effectiveness by considering measles vaccination and disease incidence data in England.We obtained data on measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage in birth cohorts from 1985 to 2016 from child health records and adjusted for under-ascertainment and catch-up campaigns. We assumed that the population had no natural  and that vaccine effectiveness was 95% for one dose and 99.75% for two doses. Vaccinations done outside the routine schedule and in people who entered England after the age of immunization were identified from primary care records. Measles susceptibility was defined as the percentage of individuals who were not immune despite all vaccination activities. We triangulated measles susceptibility and incidence data.Median susceptibility was 4.6% (range: 1.2-9.2). Among cohorts eligible for two MMR vaccine doses, those born between 1998 and 2004 were most susceptible. Measles incidence was highest in these cohorts. Data from primary care and child health records were comparable for cohorts after 2000, suggesting that little supplementary vaccination took place. For cohorts before 2000, primary care data quality was insufficient for accurately estimating coverage.Triangulating routine data on measles vaccination coverage and disease surveillance provided new insights into population  and helped identify vulnerable groups, which was useful for prioritizing public health actions to close gaps in .

In the present study, a p38 MAPK gene (MpP38) was identified from the clam Meretrix petechialis. The full-length cDNA of MpP38 measures 1,720 bp, consisting of a 134-bp 5'-UTR, a 1,095-bp ORF and a 491-bp 3'-UTR. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of MpP38 increased after Vibrio challenge, implying that MpP38 is involved in clam . Based on our previous study, a transcription factor activated by p38 MAPK, i.e. microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), participated in clam  by regulating the expression of phenoloxidase (PO). Coupled with other related reports, the mechanism underlying the involvement of MpP38 in clam  is most likely that pathogen stimuli induce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and thus activate MITF to regulate the expression of the immune-related gene PO. The results obtained in this study support this mechanism. First, we found that the MpP38 phosphorylation level increased in response to Vibrio challenge. Second, as revealed by a yeast two-hybrid assay, there was a direct interaction between MpP38 and MITF. Meanwhile, inhibiting the phosphorylation of MpP38 decreased the phosphorylation level of MpMITF, implying that MpP38 phosphorylation is required for MpMITF activation. Additionally, our results showed that there was a regulatory relationship between MpP38 phosphorylation level and PO expression level. With increased MpP38 phosphorylation level, the PO expression level was also increased after Vibrio challenge; when MpP38 phosphorylation was inhibited, the PO expression level was significantly decreased. This study describes the immune function of p38 MAPK in the clam for the first time and analyses its potential underlying mechanism, which will help to elucidate the immune mechanism in the clam M. petechialis.Copyright © 2019.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients. Thus, XCL1-GPC3 might be a promising cancer vaccine to compensate for the deficiency of the checkpoint blockades in HCC immunotherapy.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674166>Tumor Immune Response and Immunotherapy in Gastric Cancer.</a></h2><p>The remarkable development of immuno-oncology has changed the landscape of gastric cancer (GC) treatment.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling pathways in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino acids (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS, lipid A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and lipid A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

Through contraction of a long sheath, the T6SS ejects a few copies of effectors accompanied by hundreds of structural carrier proteins per delivery. The few ejected effectors, however, dictate T6SS functions. It remains elusive how the T6SS ensures effector loading and avoids futile ejection. Here, by systemically mutating the active sites of 3  effectors, TseL, VasX, and VgrG3, we show that the physical presence but not their activities is crucial for T6SS assembly. We constructed catalytic mutants of TseL and VgrG3 and truncated VasX mutants. These mutations abolished the killing of the effector-cognate  mutants. We determined that the VasX-mediated antimicrobial activity is solely dependent on the C-terminal colicin domain. Removal of the colicin domain abolished VasX secretion and reduced T6SS assembly, while deletion of the colicin internal loop abolished its toxicity but had little effect on secretion and assembly. The triple effector-inactive mutant maintains an active T6SS that is capable of delivering chimeric VgrG, PAAR, and TseL proteins fused with a cargo nuclease, indicating effector activities are not required for T6SS assembly or penetration into the cytosol of recipient cells. Therefore, by recruiting effectors as critical components for T6SS assembly, it represents an effective onboard checking mechanism that ensures effectors are loaded in place to prevent futile secretion. Our study also demonstrates a detoxified secretion platform by inactivating native effector activities that could translocate engineered cargo proteins via multiple routes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673757>Resolution of acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease.</a></h2><p>Allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (allo-HCT) represents an increasingly employed therapeutic approach to potentially cure patients suffering from life-threatening malignant and autoimmune disorders. Despite its lifesaving potential, immune-mediated allo-reactivity inherent to the allogeneic transplantation can be observed within up to 50% of all allo-HCT patients regularly resulting in the manifestation of acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Mechanistically, especially donor T cells are assumed to chiefly drive inflammation that can occur in virtually all organs, with the skin, liver, and gut representing as the most frequently affected anatomic sites. Especially in the presence of intestinal manifestations of GvHD, the risk that the disease takes a life-threatening, potentially fatal course is significantly increased. In the light of a rapid gain of knowledge in respect to decode innate and adaptive  related mechanisms as, e.g., cytokine networks, intracellular signaling pathways or environmental triggers as, e.g., the intestinal microbiota and the development of novel therapeutic approaches, detailed insight into endogenous mechanisms seeking to counterbalance the proinflammatory machinery or to proactively foster signals promoting the resolution of allo-driven intestinal inflammation is emerging. Here, we seek to highlight the key aspects of those mechanisms involved in and contributing to the resolution of GvHD-associated intestinal inflammation. Concomitantly, we would like to briefly outline and discuss promising future experimental targets suitable to be therapeutically employed to directionally deflect the tissue response from a proinflammatory to an inflammation-resolving type of intestinal GvHD after allo-HCT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662128>Effect of early shearing during gestation on the productive and reproductive behavior of female sheep offspring in their first 18 months of age.</a></h2><p>The research has shown the interesting contributions of shearing in mid-gestation on the performance of lambs from birth to weaning. Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live weight at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (PS, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to PS ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to PS ewes (n = 15) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live weight on dry basis. Body weight, body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1.0 and 562 ± 1.0 day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = 0.03) and heavier ( P = 0.02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = 0.0 7) and the Famacha index ( P = 0.02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669096>IgG Fc glycosylation as an axis of humoral  in childhood.</a></h2><p>IgG Fc glycans were characterized in 225 healthy children and 40 children with unexplained recurrent respiratory infections, revealing age-dependent variation and suggesting a role for IgG glycosylation in immunocompetence.Copyright © 2019.

After 28 days, the expression levels of antioxidant-related genes Nrf2 and Keap1 in the liver and spleen were significantly up-regulated, and the expression of immune-related gene IgM was notably increased in the liver, kidney, head-kidney, and spleen. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene expression was up-regulated in the spleen, and TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) gene were up-regulated in the kidney. The survival rate of grass carp was significantly improved after pathogen infection. Whole-genome analysis of N1-32 showed that the strain harbored related genes, capability for producing substances that enhance the  of grass carp and inhibit pathogens. A total of 22 gene clusters were identified in the genome, including 5 terpene gene clusters, 4 nonribosomal peptide-synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters and 2 lantipeptide gene clusters. In summary, these results showed that strain N1-32 as a feed additive could regulate grass carp  and enhance the resistance of grass carp against fish pathogens.Copyright © 2019.

However, CF is a multi-organ disease and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance as many of these studies provide proof-of-concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extra-pulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction. In this concise review of the literature, we summarize the results of key publications that have evaluated the effects of CFTR modulators on weight and growth, pancreatic function, the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems, sinus disease, bone disease, exercise tolerance, fertility, mental health, and . While many of these studies have reported beneficial extra-pulmonary effects related to the use of ivacaftor (IVA) in CF patients with at least one gating mutation, most of the evidence is low or very low quality given the limited number of patients evaluated and the lack of a control group. Based on an even smaller number of studies evaluating the extra-pulmonary effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), the benefits are less clear. While limited, these studies may provide the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate CFTR modulators on the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659752>Vaccine innovations for emerging infectious diseases-a symposium report.</a></h2><p>Vaccines have been incredibly successful at stemming the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases worldwide. However, there are still no effective vaccines for many serious and potentially preventable infectious diseases. Advances in vaccine technology, including new delivery methods and adjuvants, as well as progress in systems biology and an increased understanding of the human immune system, hold the potential to address these issues. In addition, maternal immunization has opened an avenue to address infectious diseases in neonates and very young infants.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs. More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic immunotherapy. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs ( < 0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS ( < 0.0001) and a combination of free drugs ( < 0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A is capable of reactivating antitumor  by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Such a combination of Q and A with synergistic effects entrapped in a simple and safe nanodelivery system may provide the potential for scale-up manufacturing and clinical applications as immunotherapeutic agents for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659236>Immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.</a></h2><p>Influenza vaccination is recommended for children following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), however there is limited evidence regarding its benefit. A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls. For the HSCT group, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were 81.4% and 60.5% for H3N2, 41.9% and 32.6% for H1N1, and 44.2% and 39.5% for B strain respectively. There was a significant geometric mean fold increase to the H3N2 (GMFI 5.80, 95% CI 3.68-9.14, p < 0.001) and B (GMFI 3.44, 95% CI 2.36-5.00, p = 0.048) strains. Serological response was superior in age-matched controls to all vaccine strains. There were no serious adverse events following vaccination. For children who underwent HSCT, incidence of laboratory-proven influenza infection was 2.3%. Overall, this study provides evidence to support annual inactivated influenza vaccine administration to children following HSCT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665242>Decreased microglial Wnt/β-catenin signalling drives microglial pro-inflammatory activation in the developing brain.</a></h2><p>Microglia of the developing brain have unique functional properties but how their activation states are regulated is poorly understood. Inflammatory activation of microglia in the still-developing brain of preterm-born infants is associated with permanent neurological sequelae in 9 million infants every year. Investigating the regulators of microglial activation in the developing brain across models of neuroinflammation-mediated injury (mouse, zebrafish) and primary human and mouse microglia we found using analysis of genes and proteins that a reduction in Wnt/β-catenin signalling is necessary and sufficient to drive a microglial phenotype causing hypomyelination. We validated in a cohort of preterm-born infants that genomic variation in the Wnt pathway is associated with the levels of connectivity found in their brains. Using a Wnt agonist delivered by a blood-brain barrier penetrant microglia-specific targeting nanocarrier we prevented in our animal model the pro-inflammatory microglial activation, white matter injury and behavioural deficits. Collectively, these data validate that the Wnt pathway regulates microglial activation, is critical in the evolution of an important form of human brain injury and is a viable therapeutic target.© The Author(s) (2019).

Calves were randomised to receive meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo subcutaneously at birth. Calf blood samples were collected between one and seven days of age to determine serum immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration. Colostrum intake, treatment for disease, mortality, and weaning weights were recorded. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of meloxicam and to identify risk factors.There was no effect of meloxicam on serum IgG concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), or risk of inadequate TPI (serum IgG concentration <24 g/l), treatment for disease, or mortality (P>0.05). Bottle or tube feeding calves were associated with decreased serum IgG concentrations (P=0.01) compared with nursing. Calves with an incomplete tongue withdrawal reflex had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with those with complete withdrawal (P=0.009). Being born meconium-stained and having decreased serum IgG concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality (P=0.03). Being born of a mature cow, having a higher birth weight, and increased serum IgG concentrations were associated with greater ADG to weaning (P<0.05).Vigour assessment at birth along with good colostrum management may be important to improve TPI and health in high-risk calves such as those assisted at birth.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

However, the negative impact of ZnO-NPs on the immune system, especially in relation to host defense against pathogenic infection and its underlying regulatory mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of early-life long-term ZnO-NPs exposure (from L1 larvae to adults) on innate  and its underlying mechanisms using a host-pathogen Caenorhabditis elegans model, and this was compared with the effect of ionic Zn. The results showed that the ZnO-NPs taken up by C. elegans primarily accumulated in the intestine and that early-life long-term ZnO-NPs exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations (50 and 500 μg/L) decreased the survival of wild-type C. elegans when faced with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 infection. Early-life long-term ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) exposure significantly increased (by about 3-fold) the accumulation of live P. aeruginosa PA14 colonies in the intestine of C. elegans. In addition, ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) inhibited the intestinal nuclear translocation of SKN-1 and also downregulated gcs-1 gene expression, which is an SKN-1 target gene. Further evidence revealed that early-life long-term exposure to ZnO-NPs (500 μg/L) did not increase susceptibility to mutation among the genes (pmk-1, sek-1, and nsy-1) encoding the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in response to P. aeruginosa PA14 infection, though ZnO-NPs significantly decreased the mRNA levels of pmk-1, sek-1, and nsy-1. This study provides regulatory insight based on evidence that ZnO-NPs suppress the innate  of C. elegans and highlights the potential health risks of certain environmental nanomaterials, including ZnO-NPs, in terms of their immunotoxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

According to Dickson's conceptual model, the lung microbiota (LMt) is a dynamic ecosystem, whose composition, in healthy lungs, is likely to reflect microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. However, which microbial genera constitutes a "healthy microbiome" per se remains hotly debated. It is now widely accepted that a bi-directional gut-lung axis connects the intestinal with the pulmonary microbiota and that the diet could have a role in modulating both microbiotas as in health as in pathological status. The LMt is altered in numerous respiratory disorders such as obstructive airway diseases, interstitial lung diseases, infections, and lung cancer. Some authors hypothesize that the use of specific bacterial strains, termed "probiotics," with positive effects on the host  and/or against pathogens, could have beneficial effects in the treatment of intestinal disorders and pulmonary diseases. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the literature available on the LMt to delineate and discuss the potential relationship between composition alterations of LMt and lung diseases. Finally, we have reported some meaningful clinical studies that used integrated probiotics' treatments to contrast some lung-correlated disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659824>Proteomics Profiling of Swine Serum Following Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.</a></h2><p>There are no approved animal drugs for management of inflammation in swine due to lack of validated animal models. To assess efficacy, it was essential to develop proteomics approaches to identify suitable biomarkers of inflammation as presented in this study.Serum samples were collected from a group of 4 pigs prior to (baseline), and 24 and 48 h following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to reveal proteomic changes during inflammation. Two other pigs served as untreated controls. Proteins were separated by either 1D SDS-PAGE or 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) prior to analysis by nano flow liquid chromatography (nLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.We identified 165 proteins using SDS-PAGE, of which 47 proteins were also detected by 2DE prior to nLC-MS/MS. More than half (72%) of all characterized proteins were modulated as a result of LPS stimulation, many of which are known to be involved with innate and adaptive . Pig serum samples obtained 24 h after LPS initiation of inflammation showed protein modulations of serum albumin, serotransferrin, light and heavy immunoglobulin chains (IGs), and major acute phase proteins including haptoglobin (HPT), serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), C-reactive protein (CRP), β-2-glycoprotein 1 (B-2GP1), alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (A2HS), α-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and α-1-acid glycoprotein (A1AG). SAA2 was distinguished from the other SAA isoforms by the unique peptide sequence of SAA2.The results provided proteomic analysis of swine serum due to LPS stimulation and indicated the importance of SAA2, which appears to be unique and may be regarded as a potential clinical diagnostic biomarker of inflammation.This article is protected by copyright.

DEX infusion during the perioperative period inhibited release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol; decreased blood glucose, interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein; and increased interleukin-10 in surgical patients. In addition, the numbers of natural killer cells, B cells, and CD4 T cells, and the ratios of CD4:CD8 and Th1:Th2 were significantly increased; CD8 T-cells were decreased in the DEX group when compared with the control group.DEX, an anaesthesia adjuvant, can attenuate perioperative stress and inflammation, and protect the immune function of surgical patients, all of which may contribute to decreased postoperative complications and improved clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

About half of patients with IBD develop rheumatic ailments and microscopic intestinal inflammation is present in up to half of CRD patients. IBD and CRD patients also share a common therapeutic armamentarium. Disequilibrium in the complex realm of microbes (known as dysbiosis) that closely interact with the gut mucosal immune system has been associated with both IBD and CRD (spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). Whether dysbiosis represents an epiphenomenon or a prodromal feature remains to be determined.In an attempt to further investigate whether specific gut dysbiosis may be the missing link between IBD and CRD in patients developing both diseases, we performed here a systematic literature review focusing on studies looking at bacterial microbiota in CRD and/or IBD patients.We included 80 studies, with a total of 3799 IBD patients without arthritis, 1084 CRD patients without IBD, 132 IBD patients with arthropathy manifestations and 12 spondyloarthritis patients with IBD history. Overall, this systematic review indicates that an increase in s,  and  genera, as well as a decrease in  genera and species belonging to Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria phyla are common features in IBD and CRD patients, whereas dozens of bacterial species are specific features of CRD and IBD.Further work is needed to understand the functions of bacteria and of their metabolites but also to characterize fungi and viruses that are commonly found in these patients.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661607>Investigation of the molecular epizootiological characteristics and tracking of the geographical origins of Brucella canis strains in China.</a></h2><p>Brucellosis is a global pandemic infectious zoonosis. Brucella canis is a rare source of human brucellosis in China, and its public health significance remains under debate. Moreover, data pertaining to the epizootiological characteristics and geographical origin of B. canis on a nationwide scale are limited, and the risk to public safety posed by B. canis infections is unknown. The MLVA (multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis) assay can be helpful to analyze epidemiological correlations among Brucella isolates and to track their geographic origins. To accomplish this task, MLVA-16 was used to analyze the epidemiological links of 63 isolates obtained from dogs and humans. Sixty-three B. canis strains were sorted into three large clusters (A, B, and C) and 50 different genotypes (GT1-50), and 43 unique genotypes were represented by single isolates, suggesting that these strains had no obvious epidemiological links and that canine brucellosis is predominantly sporadic in China. The other seven shared genotypes (among a total of 20 isolates) were each represented by two to eight isolates, indicating that strains from each shared genotype were epidemiologically correlated. Five of the shared genotypes were from 16 strains obtained from Beijing, indicating that canine brucellosis in Beijing originates from multipoint outbreaks with multiple sources of infection. Based on comprehensive case analysis of clinical B. canis infection, we preliminarily suggest that human B. canis infections are associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that results in decreased patient . B. canis may have limited epidemiological significance for the healthy population, but it remains a significant threat to the canine breeding industry and to humans who come into close contact with dogs. Based on MLVA-11 data, B. canis strains were clustered into 16 genotypes and divided into five evolutionary branches; these data confirm that this population covers an extensive geographic area and exhibits characteristics of the origin and evolution of co-existing introduced and locally native lineages. We believe this study will contribute to strengthening efforts to prevent and control canine brucellosis and to improve public understanding of the health risks posed by B. canis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660257>Antibacterial immune functions of subadults and adults in a semelparous spider.</a></h2><p>Although capacity to mount an efficient immune response plays a critical role in individuals' survival, its dynamics across ontogenetic stages is still largely unexplored. Life stage-dependent variation in the encountered diversity and prevalence of parasites were proposed to contribute to stage-dependent changes in , but differences in life history objectives between developmental stages may also lead to stage-specific changes in efficiency of given immune mechanisms. The reason for this is that juveniles and subadults are unable to reproduce, therefore they invest resources mainly into survival, while adults have to partition their resources between survival and reproduction. The general trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproductive effort is expected to impair immune function. Especially so in semelparous organisms that only reproduce once throughout their lifetime, hence they do not face the trade-off between current and future reproduction. We hypothesised that in a semelparous species individuals would be characterised by decreased investment into somatic maintenance after maturation, in order to maximise their reproductive output. Accordingly, we predicted that (1) elements of somatic maintenance, such as , should be relatively weaker in adults in comparison to subadults, and (2) increased reproductive investment in adults should be associated with lower immune efficiency. We quantified two markers of  in subadult and adult individuals of the semelparous wolf spider  (Westring, 1861), namely bacterial growth inhibition power and bacterial cell wall lytic activity. We found that subadults showed significantly higher cell wall lytic activity than adults, but the two life stages did not differ in their capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. Also, we found weaker immune measures in mated females compared to virgins. Furthermore, in mated females bacterial growth inhibition power was negatively associated with fecundity.© 2019 Rádai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662454>Type VII Secretion Substrates of Pathogenic Mycobacteria Are Processed by a Surface Protease.</a></h2><p>Tuberculosis, one of the world's most severe infectious diseases, is caused by  A major weapon of this pathogen is a unique cell wall that protects the pathogen from eradication by the immune system. Mycobacteria have specialized secretion systems, e.g., type VII secretion or ESX systems, to transport substrates across this cell wall. The largest group of proteins that are secreted by these ESX systems are the PE proteins. Previously, it was shown that the N-terminal PE domain of about 100 amino acids is required for secretion. Here, we describe the identification of an aspartic protease, designated PecA, that removes (part of) this PE domain at the cell surface. Nearly all of the observed PE_PGRS proteins are processed by PecA. Interestingly, the protease itself is also a secreted PE protein and subject to self-cleavage. Furthermore, a defect in surface processing has no effect on the activity of the PE lipase protein LipY but does seem to affect the functioning of other virulence factors, as a  mutant strain of  shows moderate attenuation in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, our results reveal the presence of a functional aspartic acid protease in  that cleaves LipY, itself as well as other members of the PE_PGRS family.

The objective of this study was to evaluate post-vaccine antibody titers and circulating cellular memory development in heifers fed OG and administered a commercially available modified-live bovine respiratory disease (BRD) vaccine. Twenty-four Holstein heifers were assigned to one of two diets for 170 days: Control TMR (CON; n = 11), or TMR plus OG (TRT; 9 g/100 kg BW/day; n = 13). Samples for hematology, serology, and cellular assays were collected on D-110, 0, 21, 42, and 60 of the trial. Heifers were administered two priming doses of a modified-live BRD vaccine, with a third dose given on D0. There were no significant differences in total WBC and absolute number or the percentage of circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, RBC, or platelets on D-110 through D21. On D42 and D60, CON had significantly higher numbers of lymphocytes. On D0, mean serum neutralizing (SN) titer to BHV-1 was significantly higher for CON compared to TRT. SN titers were not significantly different between CON and TRT at any other time point for BHV-1, BVDV type 1, or BVDV type 2. TRT mounted a significantly stronger recall proliferative response to 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of BHV-1, BVDV type 1 and BVDV type 2 on D42 and D60; 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 on D21 and D42; and 0.25 MOI BVDV type 2 on D42 compared to CON. IL-4 production induced by 0.5 and 1.0 MOI BHV-1 (D42 and D60); 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 (D21); and 0.25 and 0.5 MOI of BVDV type 2 (D60) were significantly higher for TRT than CON. IL-17 production induced by 0.25 MOI of BVDV type 1 was significantly higher on D60 for TRT compared to CON. IFN-gamma and IL-10 were not significantly different between treatments.

Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and immune system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor immunotherapy hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T cell-mediated antitumor  was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for immune checkpoint therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The role of this metabolic pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine metabolism by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a metabolic pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the metabolism of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668622>Zombie-Ant Fungi Emerged from Non-manipulating, Beetle-Infecting Ancestors.</a></h2><p>The manipulation of animal behavior by parasitic organisms is one of the most complex adaptations to have arisen via natural selection. Among the most impressive examples of behavioral manipulation are the zombie-ant fungi [1]. In this association, ants are controlled to leave the colony and perform a stereotyped death grip behavior, where they bite onto vegetation over foraging trails, before being killed for the post mortem fungal growth. Manipulation functions to provide a platform outside the nest, from which fungal parasites actively shoot out spores, targeting foraging ants because within colony transmission is prevented by strong social  exhibited by social insect societies [2, 3]. It is not clear how such complex examples of host manipulation arose. To address this, we performed a broad-scale phylogenetic reconstruction of the order Hypocreales, to which the zombie-ant fungi, Ophiocordyceps, belong. In order to understand the patterns of host association and host switching along the evolution of Ophiocordyceps, we performed ancestral character state reconstruction analysis. We found that zombie-ant fungi likely arose from an ancestor that infected beetle larvae residing in soil or decaying wood, similar to extant beetle-infecting Ophiocordyceps species. Surprisingly, the jump led to an extensive species radiation observed after the development of behavioral manipulation. We suggest that the jump from solitary beetle larva to ants within a colony exposed the fungus to the robust social  of ant societies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

PEM hydrogels induced the recruitment and M2-polarization of macrophages, promoted the differentiation of MSCs into endothelial-like cells, HUVEC tube formation, osteogenic differentiation of primary calvarial osteoblasts and MSCs, and mineralization after being immersed in simulated body fluid. The dynamic and multiphase effects of the hydrogels were evaluated using a rat critical-sized calvarial defect model in vivo. During the early phase of repair, PEM hydrogels facilitated the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages. As bone repair progressed, PEM hydrogels promoted blood vessel migration, the development of relative larger blood vessels, and functional vascularization. These effects were also verified in a subcutaneous embedding model. Eventually, PEM hydrogels promoted mature bone formation in large bone defects to a greater extent than collagen I hydrogels. These biological effects coordinated well with the natural process of bone regeneration. Thus, PEM hydrogels may serve as promising biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Macrophages are broadly classified into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, and M2 macrophages, which have selective anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic activities and are able to induce immunotolerance and angiogenesis. Based on these elements, the aim of our study was to evaluate CD14CD68CD197CD80 M1 and CD14CD68CD163CD206 M2 macrophages in tissue samples from ovarian endometriomas of women affected by endometriosis at different stages of the disease. For each patient, we collected a biological sample of the cyst (ovarian endometriomas for cases and ovarian functional cyst for controls) during laparoscopy. We found that the number of both M1 and M2 macrophages was significantly higher in endometriosis group than controls, regardless of stage ( < .0001 for each stage versus controls). Moreover, our data analysis shows a trend in progressive decrease of M1 macrophages from stage I to stage IV; on the contrary, M2 macrophages show a specular trend compared to M1 macrophages, with a progressive increase from stage I to stage IV. This may contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the early stages of the disease, and to the pro-fibrotic activity of the advanced stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660450>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Expression in the Olive Flounder () against Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) Challenge.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the inflammatory response through the activation of neutrophil cells. The expression of IL-8 was investigated in early developmental stages of the olive flounder and in tissues of 8-month-old individuals.

In addition, IL-8 expression after infection by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus significantly increased in the fin, gill, muscles, and spleen.

In this study, we showed that Lachnum polysaccharide (LEP) could work as an immunomodulator to reset TAMs from pro-tumor M2 to anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, LEP promoted Th1 polarization and the secretion of IFN-γ, which played a key role in M1 phenotype polarization. In parallel, LEP might directly activate M1 macrophages via TLR4 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, LEP also resulted in the accumulation of anti-tumor immune cells and decrease the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Treg cells, thereby potentiating anti-tumor . In summary, these results revealed a novel mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of LEP and provided a potential new avenue targeting TAMs and cancer immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

Common allergic diseases include asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic dermatitis (AD). Recently, studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-37, a novel cytokine in the IL-1 family, exhibits broad protective properties in various diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. IL-37 displays its anti-inflammatory effect on diseases by curbing innate and acquired  as well as inﬂammatory reactions. IL-37 functions by forming a complex with IL-18Rα and IL-1R8 extracellularly and can be translocated to the nucleus upon forming a complex with mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) intracellularly, thereby affecting gene transcription and signaling pathway activation. In addition, increasing evidence confirms that IL-37 expression is aberrant in asthma, AR and AD, which indicates that IL-37 may also play essential roles in allergic diseases. Furthermore, accumulating data obtained from recombinant IL-37 (rIL-37)-treated mice and from IL-37 transgenic (IL-37tg) mice suggest a protective role for IL-37. This review will detail the role of IL-37 in the occurrence and development of allergic diseases and discuss the potential of IL-37 as a therapeutic target in allergic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Th2  involves a shift of the CD4 T-cell population from type-0 to type-2 (Th2) with increased abundance of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. This study sought to investigate if existing gut-restricted intestinal helminth infections impact bacterial-induced acute airway neutrophil recruitment. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: uninfected; helminth-Heligmosomoides polygyrus infected; Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected; and coinfected. Mice infected with H. polygyrus were incubated for 2 weeks, followed by P. aeruginosa intranasal inoculation. Bronchial alveolar lavage, blood, and lung samples were analyzed. Interestingly, infection with gut-restricted helminths resulted in immunological and structural changes in the lung. These changes include increased lung CD4 T cells, increased Th2 cytokine expression, and airway goblet cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, coinfected mice exhibited significantly more airspace neutrophil infiltration at 6 hours following P. aeruginosa infection and exhibited an improved rate of survival compared with bacterial infected alone. These results suggest that chronic helminth infection of the intestines can influence and enhance acute airway neutrophil responses to P. aeruginosa infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673770>Mice expressing the variant rs1143679 allele of ITGAM (CD11b) show impaired DC-mediated T cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional genomic analyses have implicated several ITGAM (CD11b) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the development of SLE and other disorders. ITGAM encodes the α chain of the β integrin Mac-1, a receptor that plays important roles in myeloid cell functions. The ITGAM SNP rs1143679, which results in an arginine to histidine change at amino acid position 77 of the CD11b protein, has been shown to reduce binding to several ligands and to alter Mac-1-mediated cellular response in vitro. Importantly, however, the potential contribution of this SNP variant to the initiation and/or progression of immune and inflammatory processes in vivo remains unexplored. Herein, we describe for the first time the generation and characterization of a mouse line expressing the 77His variant of CD11b. Surprisingly, we found that 77His did not significantly affect Mac-1-mediated leukocyte migration and activation as assessed using thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and LPS/TNF-α-induced dermal inflammation models. In contrast, expression of this variant did alter T cell , as evidenced by significantly reduced proliferation of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific transgenic T cells in 77His mice immunized with OVA. Reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation was also observed when either 77His splenic dendritic cells (DCs) or bone marrow-derived DCs were used as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Although more work is necessary to determine how this alteration might influence the development of SLE or other diseases, these in vivo findings suggest that the 77His variant of CD11b can compromise the ability of DCs to induce antigen-driven T cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544158>UKMenCar4: A cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic meningococcal carriage amongst UK adolescents at a period of low invasive meningococcal disease incidence.</a></h2><p>Carriage of , the meningococcus, is a prerequisite for invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), a potentially devastating infection that disproportionately afflicts infants and children. Humans are the sole known reservoir for the meningococcus, and it is carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of ~10% of the population. Rates of carriage are dependent on age of the host and social and behavioural factors. In the UK, meningococcal carriage has been studied through large, multi-centre carriage surveys of adolescents in 1999, 2000, and 2001, demonstrating carriage can be affected by immunisation with the capsular group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine, inducing population  against carriage. Fifteen years after these surveys were carried out, invasive meningococcal disease incidence had declined from a peak in 1999.  The UKMenCar4 study was conducted in 2014/15 to investigate rates of carriage amongst the adolescent population during a period of low disease incidence.

Named after the conserved proline (P) and glutamic acid (E) residues in their N-terminal domains, these proteins are postulated to perform wide-ranging roles in virulence and immune modulation. However, technical challenges in studying these proteins and their encoding genes have hampered the elucidation of molecular mechanisms and leave many open questions regarding the biological functions mediated by these proteins.

The goal of this MicroReview is to summarize and structure existing information on this gene family into a simplified framework of thinking about PE/PPE proteins and genes. Thereby, I hope to provide helpful starting points in studying these genes and proteins for researchers with different backgrounds.

The molecular mechanism of flavivirus assembly is not well understood. Here, we show that Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2A protein recruits genomic RNA, the structural protein prM/E complex, and the NS2B/NS3 protease complex to the virion assembly site and orchestrates virus morphogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZIKV NS2A binds to prM, E, NS2B, and NS3 (but not C, NS4B, or NS5) in a viral RNA-independent manner, whereas prM/E complex does not interact with NS2B/NS3 complex. Remarkably, a single-amino-acid mutation (E103A) of NS2A impairs its binding to prM/E and NS2B/NS3 and abolishes virus production, demonstrating the indispensable role of NS2A/prM/E and NS2A/NS2B/NS3 interactions in virion assembly. In addition, RNA-protein pulldown analysis identified a stem-loop RNA from the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome as an "RNA recruitment signal" for ZIKV assembly. The 3' UTR RNA binds to a cytoplasmic loop of NS2A protein. Mutations of two positively charged residues (R96A and R102A) from the cytoplasmic loop reduce NS2A binding to viral RNA, leading to a complete loss of virion assembly. Collectively, our results support a virion assembly model in which NS2A recruits viral NS2B/NS3 protease and structural C-prM-E polyprotein to the virion assembly site; once the C-prM-E polyprotein has been processed, NS2A presents viral RNA to the structural proteins for virion assembly. ZIKV is a recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause devastating congenital Zika syndrome in pregnant women and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. The molecular mechanism of ZIKV virion assembly is largely unknown. Here, we report that ZIKV NS2A plays a central role in recruiting viral RNA, structural protein prM/E, and viral NS2B/NS3 protease to the virion assembly site and orchestrating virion morphogenesis. One mutation that impairs these interactions does not significantly affect viral RNA replication but selectively abolishes virion assembly, demonstrating the specific role of these interactions in virus morphogenesis. We also show that the 3' UTR of ZIKV RNA may serve as a "recruitment signal" through binding to NS2A to enter the virion assembly site. Following a coordinated cleavage of C-prM-E at the virion assembly site, NS2A may present the viral RNA to C protein for nucleocapsid formation followed by envelopment with prM/E proteins. The results have provided new insights into flavivirus virion assembly.Copyright © 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672136>Does low-density lipoprotein cholesterol induce inflammation? If so, does it matter? Current insights and future perspectives for novel therapies.</a></h2><p>Dyslipidemia and inflammation are closely interrelated contributors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Disorders of lipid metabolism initiate an inflammatory and immune-mediated response in atherosclerosis, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has possible pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that extend beyond lipid lowering.Activation of the immune system/inflammasome destabilizes the plaque, which makes it vulnerable to rupture, resulting in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The activated immune system potentially accelerates atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis activates the immune system, creating a vicious circle. LDL-C enhances inflammation, which can be measured through multiple parameters like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, multiple studies have shown that CRP is a marker of residual risk and not, itself, a causal factor. Recently, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to decelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in fewer MACE. Nevertheless, an important side effect of anti-inflammatory therapy is the potential for increased infection risk, stressing the importance of only targeting patients with high residual inflammatory risk. Multiple (auto-)inflammatory diseases are potentially related to/influenced by LDL-C through inflammasome activation.Research suggests that LDL-C induces inflammation; inflammation is of proven importance in atherosclerotic disease progression; anti-inflammatory therapies yield promise in lowering (cardiovascular) disease risk, especially in selected patients with high (remaining) inflammatory risk; and intriguing new anti-inflammatory developments, for example, in nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrine receptor inflammasome targeting, are currently underway, including novel pathway interventions such as immune cell targeting and epigenetic interference.

Lymphocyte counts recover shortly after the disappearance of measles-associated rash, but immunosuppression can persist for months to years after infection, resulting in increased incidence of secondary infections. Animal models and in vitro studies have proposed various immunological factors underlying this prolonged immune impairment, but the precise mechanisms operating in humans are unknown. Using B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing of human peripheral blood lymphocytes before and after MeV infection, we identified two immunological consequences from measles underlying immunosuppression: (i) incomplete reconstitution of the naïve B cell pool leading to immunological immaturity and (ii) compromised immune memory to previously encountered pathogens due to depletion of previously expanded B memory clones. Using a surrogate model of measles in ferrets, we investigated the clinical consequences of morbillivirus infection and demonstrated a depletion of vaccine-acquired  to influenza virus, leading to a compromised immune recall response and increased disease severity after secondary influenza virus challenge. Our results show that MeV infection causes changes in naïve and memory B lymphocyte diversity that persist after the resolution of clinical disease and thus contribute to compromised  to previous infections or vaccinations. This work highlights the importance of MeV vaccination not only for the control of measles but also for the maintenance of herd  to other pathogens, which can be compromised after MeV infection.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, studies focusing on the measurement of physiological traits are usually performed under constant temperature regimes. This mismatch between thermal exposure in the field and experimental conditions could act as a stressor agent, since physiological functions are strongly influenced by temperature. Herein, we asked the question whether constant thermal regimes would cause a stress response and impact the  of the South American rattlesnake () when compared to a fluctuating thermal regime. We addressed this question by determining heterophil:lymphocyte ratio (H:L), plasma bacteria killing ability (BKA) and corticosterone levels (CORT) in snakes kept under a constant temperature regime at 30°C, and under a fluctuating regime that oscillated between 25°C at nighttime to 35°C at daytime. The experiments had a mirrored design, in which half of the snakes were subjected to a fluctuating-to-constant treatment, while the other half was exposed to a constant-to-fluctuating treatment. The shift from constant to fluctuating thermal regime was accompanied by an increase in plasma CORT levels indicating the activation of a stress response. Exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime at the onset of the experiments induced a decrease in the BKA of rattlesnakes. H:L was not affected by treatments and, therefore, the shift between thermal regimes seems to have acted as a low intensity stressor. Our results suggest that the removal from temperatures close to the snakés preferred body temperature triggers a stress response in rattlesnakes.© 2019.

Here, we used mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to compare molecular profiles of primary tumors located in the thyroid gland and their synchronous metastases in regional lymph nodes to analyze phenotypic heterogeneity in papillary thyroid cancer. Two types of cancerous (primary tumor and metastasis) and two types of not cancerous (thyroid gland and lymph node) regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated in postoperative material from 11 patients, then the distribution of tryptic peptides (spectral components) was analyzed by MSI in all tissue regions. Moreover, tryptic peptides identified by shotgun proteomics in corresponding tissue lysates were matched to components detected by MSI to enable their hypothetical protein annotation. Unsupervised segmentation of all cancer ROIs revealed that different clusters dominated in tumor ROIs and metastasis ROIs. The intra-patient similarity between thyroid and tumor ROIs was higher than the intra-patient similarity between tumor and metastasis ROIs. Moreover, the similarity between tumor and its metastasis from the same patients was lower than similarities among tumors and among metastases from different patients (inter-patient similarity was higher for metastasis ROIs than for tumor ROIs). Components differentiating between tumor and its metastases were annotated as proteins involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and chromatin, as well as proteins involved in -related functions. We concluded that phenotypical heterogeneity between primary tumor and lymph node metastases from the same patient was higher than inter-tumor heterogeneity between primary tumors from different patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666026>Postoperative chemoradiotherapy is superior to postoperative chemotherapy alone in squamous cell lung cancer patients with limited N2 lymph node metastasis.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of postoperative chemoradiotherapy (POCRT) following surgery in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with N2 lymph node metastasis (N2-NSCLC).The clinical data of patients with N2-NSCLC treated with POCRT or postoperative chemotherapy (pCT) alone were retrospectively collected and reviewed.

Here we immunized recipient B6 mice with different types of allogenic leukocytes and found that vaccination with allogenic dendritic cells (alloDC) elicited the most efficient protection against broad-spectrum tumors. The recipient lymphocytes were analyzed and the data showed that CD8 T cells increased significantly after immunization and expressed effector memory T cell marker KLRG1. Functional evaluation demonstrated that these KLRG1CD8 T cells could kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in Granzyme B- and Fas/FasL-dependent manners with no tumor antigen specificity, and tend to migrate into tumor sites by high expression of heparanase. Adoptive transfer of these cells could provide antitumor protection against tumors. AlloDC could also treat mice with residual tumors and combination of anti-PD1 antibody could enhance this effects.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host  and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root .

Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor  is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662645>β-Glucan and Parasites.</a></h2><p>Immunosuppression caused by parasitic infections represents the foremost way by which the parasites overcome or escape the host's immune response.

Here, we developed five vaccines for this bank (clade 2.3.2.1C, clade 2.3.4.4A, B, C, and D) by reverse genetics, inactivated them with formalin, and evaluated the protective efficacy and potency of serial dilutions against lethal homologous challenge in specific-pathogen-free chickens. After vaccination with one dose, each vaccine resulted in 100% survival, with no clinical symptoms, or lack of detectable virus shedding, and high levels of pre-challenge protective  (8.4-10.2 log). After vaccination with one-tenth of the full dose, protection was similar to that with the full dose. After vaccination with one-hundredth of the initial dose, survival was 20-80%, and all vaccines showed virus shedding. Four vaccines (excluding clade 2.3.2.1C) had satisfactory potency. In antibody-persistence tests, all vaccines maintained long-lasting protective . Our results suggest that inactivated reverse-genetics vaccines genetically matched to outbreak viruses provide adequate protection after a single vaccination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and B-cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct B cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor- relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer immunotherapy and combination therapies. Specificity of protective B cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673402>Isometric versus isotonic exercise for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a randomised controlled pilot study.</a></h2><p>Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of exercise for GTPS. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of isometric and isotonic exercise for individuals with GTPS.This randomised controlled pilot trial recruited 30 participants with GTPS. Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.Twenty-three participants completed the trial. After 12 weeks, mean VISA-G scores improved in both groups; 55-65 in the isometric group and 62-72 in the isotonic group. 55% of the isometric group and 58% of the isotonic group achieved a reduction in pain of at least 2 points (minimally clinically important difference (MCID)) on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 64% of the isometric group and 75% of the isotonic group had improved by at least 2 points (MCID) on the Global Rating of Change Scale.Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to be effective for individuals with GTPS and should be considered in the loading management of patients with this condition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, its role in the modulation of trained  (innate immune memory) is unknown. In the present study, we assessed whether TLR10 modulates the induction of trained  induced by β-glucan or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). IL-1Ra production was increased upon activation of TLR10 ex vivo after BCG vaccination, and TLR10 protein expression on monocytes was increased after BCG vaccination, while anti-TLR10 antibodies did not significantly modulate β-glucan or BCG-induced trained  in vitro. A known immunomodulatory TLR10 missense single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11096957) influenced trained  responses by β-glucan or BCG in vitro. However, the in vivo induction of trained  by BCG vaccination was not influenced by TLR10 polymorphisms. In conclusion, TLR10 has a limited, non-essential impact on the induction of trained  in humans.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665510>Molecular diversification of the seminal fluid proteome in a recently diverged passerine species pair.</a></h2><p>Seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) mediate an array of post-mating reproductive processes that influence fertilization and fertility. As such, it is widely held that SFPs may contribute to post-mating, pre-zygotic (PMPZ) reproductive barriers between closely related taxa. We investigated seminal fluid (SF) diversification in a recently diverged passerine species pair (Passer domesticus and P. hispaniolensis) using a combination of proteomic and comparative evolutionary genomic approaches. First, we characterized and compared the SF proteome of the two species, revealing consistencies with known aspects of SFP biology and function in other taxa, including the presence and diversification of proteins involved in  and sperm maturation. Second, using whole genome resequencing data, we assessed patterns of genomic differentiation between house and Spanish sparrows. These analyses detected divergent selection on -related SF genes and positive selective sweeps in regions containing a number of SF genes that also exhibited protein abundance diversification between species. Finally, we analyzed the molecular evolution of SFPs across 11 passerine species and found a significantly higher rate of positive selection in SFPs compared with the rest of the genome, as well as significant enrichments for functional pathways related to  in the set of positively selected SF genes. Our results suggest that selection on  pathways is an important determinant of passerine SF composition and evolution. Assessing the role of  genes in speciation in other recently diverged taxa should be prioritized given the potential role for -related proteins in reproductive incompatibilities in Passer sparrows.© The Author(s) 2019.

This approach has the potential to search for new targets for vaccine development in the predicted proteome of pathogenic organisms. To date, there is no effective vaccine employed in vaccination campaigns against visceral leishmaniasis (VL). For the first time, herein, an in silico, in vitro, and in vivo peptide screening was performed, and immunogenic peptides were selected to constitute VL peptide-based vaccines. Firstly, the screening of in silico potential peptides using dogs naturally infected by  was conducted and the peptides with the best performance were selected. The mentioned peptides were used to compose Cockt-1 (cocktail 1) and Cockt-2 (cocktail 2) in combination with saponin as the adjuvant. Therefore, tests for immunogenicity, polyfunctional T-cells, and the ability to induce central and effector memory in T-lymphocytes capacity in reducing the parasite load on the spleen for Cockt-1 and Cockt-2 were performed. Among the vaccines under study, Cockt-1 showed the best results, eliciting CD4 and CD8 polyfunctional T-cells, with a reduction in spleen parasitism that correlates to the generation of T CD4 central memory and T CD8 effector memory cells. In this way, our findings corroborate the use of immunoinformatics as a tool for the development of future vaccines against VL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672911>Keratinocyte-intrinsic MHCII expression controls microbiota-induced Th1 cell responses.</a></h2><p>The cross-talk between the microbiota and the immune system plays a fundamental role in the control of host physiology. However, the tissue-specific factors controlling this dialogue remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that T cell responses to commensal colonization are associated with the development of organized cellular clusters within the skin epithelium. These organized lymphocyte clusters are surrounded by keratinocytes expressing a discrete program associated with antigen presentation and antimicrobial defense. Notably, IL-22-mediated keratinocyte-intrinsic MHC class II expression was required for the selective accumulation of commensal-induced IFN-γ, but not IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells within the skin. Taking these data together, this work uncovers an unexpected role for MHC class II expression by keratinocytes in the control of homeostatic type 1 responses to the microbiota.

The  against exogenous stimulation of sea cucumber is of great academic and economic importance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are considered as vital regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses in most eukaryotes. In sea cucumbers, some miRNAs (such as miR-133, miR-137, and miR-2008, among others) that participate in the regulation of innate  have been recently identified and characterized. This review focuses on those known miRNAs and their corresponding target genes that participate in the regulation of the complement system, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis pathways in sea cucumbers. Moreover, we cover immune-related miRNA investigations in sea cucumbers that provide insights into developing more miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for sea cucumber diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Studies have shown that for several vaccines, such as live attenuated, toxoid and conjugated vaccines, high maternal antibody titers inhibit the infant's humoral immune response after infant vaccination. However, it is not clear whether this decreased antibody titer has any clinical impact on the infant's protection, as the cellular immune responses are often equally important in providing disease protection and may therefore compensate for diminished antibody levels. Reports describing the effect of maternal antibodies on the cellular immune response after infant vaccination are scarce, probably because such studies are expensive, labor intensive and utilize poorly standardized laboratory techniques. Therefore, this review aims to shed light on what is currently known about the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination in the presence of high (maternal) antibody titers both in animal and human studies. Overall, the findings suggest that maternally derived antibodies do not interfere with the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination. However, more research in humans is clearly needed, as most data originate from animal studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell , but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral , and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor  in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

We found that labyrinthopeptins A1 and A2, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibit the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus, in the low μM to nM range. Mechanistic studies on viral particles revealed that labyrinthopeptins induce a virolytic effect through binding to the viral membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). These effects are enhanced by a combined equimolar application of both labyrinthopeptins, and a clear synergism was observed across a concentration range corresponding to IC-IC values of the compounds. Time-resolved experiments with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) reveal that membrane lipid raft compositions (PC/PE/Chol/SM (17:10:33:40)) are particularly sensitive to labyrinthopeptins compared to PC/PE (90:10) LUVs, even though the overall PE-amount remains constant. Labyrinthopeptins exhibited low cytotoxicity and had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice (t= 10.0 h), which designates them as promising antiviral compounds acting by an unusual viral lipid targeting mechanism. For many viral infections, current treatment options are insufficient. Because the development of each antiviral drug is time-consuming and expensive, the prospect of finding broad-spectrum antivirals that can fight multiple, diverse viruses - well-known as well as (re-)emerging species - has gained attention, especially for the treatment of viral co-infections. While most known broad spectrum agents address processes in the host cell, we found that targeting lipids of the free virus outside the host cell with the natural products labyrinthopeptin A1 and A2 is a viable strategy to inhibit the proliferation of a broad range of viruses from different families, including Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, or Cytomegalovirus. Labyrinthopeptins bind to viral phosphatidylethanolamine and induce virolysis without exerting cytotoxicity to host cells. This represents a novel and unusual mechanism to tackle medically relevant viral infections.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664034>Intronic ATTTC repeat expansions in STARD7 in familial adult myoclonic epilepsy linked to chromosome 2.</a></h2><p>Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is characterised by cortical myoclonic tremor usually from the second decade of life and overt myoclonic or generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Four independent loci have been implicated in FAME on chromosomes (chr) 2, 3, 5 and 8.

The ATTTC expansions segregate in 158/158 individuals typically affected by FAME from 22 pedigrees including 16 previously reported families recruited worldwide. RNA sequencing from patient derived fibroblasts shows no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences and STARD7 gene expression is not affected.

Around 5500 new cases of myeloma are diagnosed per year in the UK, and a quarter of patients will have a serious infection within 3 months of diagnosis. We aimed to assess whether patients newly diagnosed with myeloma benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection, and to investigate the effect on antibiotic-resistant organism carriage and health care-associated infections in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.TEAMM was a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in patients aged 21 years and older with newly diagnosed myeloma in 93 UK hospitals. All enrolled patients were within 14 days of starting active myeloma treatment. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to levofloxacin or placebo with a computerised minimisation algorithm. Allocation was stratified by centre, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intention to proceed to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. All investigators, patients, laboratory, and trial co-ordination staff were masked to the treatment allocation. Patients were given 500 mg of levofloxacin (two 250 mg tablets), orally once daily for 12 weeks, or placebo tablets (two tablets, orally once daily for 12 weeks), with dose reduction according to estimated glomerular filtration rate every 4 weeks. Follow-up visits occurred every 4 weeks up to week 16, and at 1 year. The primary outcome was time to first febrile episode or death from all causes within the first 12 weeks of trial treatment. All randomised patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN51731976, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2011-000366-35.Between Aug 15, 2012, and April 29, 2016, we enrolled and randomly assigned 977 patients to receive levofloxacin prophylaxis (489 patients) or placebo (488 patients). Median follow-up was 12 months (IQR 8-13). 95 (19%) first febrile episodes or deaths occurred in 489 patients in the levofloxacin group versus 134 (27%) in 488 patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·51-0·86; p=0·0018. 597 serious adverse events were reported up to 16 weeks from the start of trial treatment (308 [52%] of which were in the levofloxacin group and 289 [48%] of which were in the placebo group). Serious adverse events were similar between the two groups except for five episodes (1%) of mostly reversible tendonitis in the levofloxacin group.Addition of prophylactic levofloxacin to active myeloma treatment during the first 12 weeks of therapy significantly reduced febrile episodes and deaths compared with placebo without increasing health care-associated infections. These results suggest that prophylactic levofloxacin could be used for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma undergoing anti-myeloma therapy.UK National Institute for Health Research.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The syndrome is caused by an intronic mutation in POLA1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-α (Pol-α), which is responsible for Okazaki fragment synthesis during DNA replication. Reduced POLA1 expression in this condition triggers spontaneous type I interferon expression, which can be linked to the autoinflammatory manifestations of the disease. However, the history of recurrent infections in this syndrome is as yet unexplained. Here we report that patients with XLPDR have reduced NK cell cytotoxic activity and decreased numbers of NK cells, particularly differentiated, stage V, cells (CD3-CD56dim). This phenotype is reminiscent of hypomorphic mutations in MCM4, which encodes a component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase complex that is functionally linked to Pol-α during the DNA replication process. We find that POLA1 deficiency leads to MCM4 depletion and that both can impair NK cell natural cytotoxicity and show that this is due to a defect in lytic granule polarization. Altogether, our study provides mechanistic connections between Pol-α and the MCM complex and demonstrates their relevance in NK cell function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660333>Rescue of Replication-Competent ZIKV Hidden in Placenta-Derived Mesenchymal Cells Long After the Resolution of the Infection.</a></h2><p>The Zika virus (ZIKV) genome, its negative-strand viral proteins, and virus-like particles were detected in placenta-derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs), indicating that ZIKV persists after virus clearance from maternal blood and can be rescued by in vitro cultivation.

In this study, we examined the impact of developmental exposure to corticosterone (CORT, the main avian glucocorticoid hormone) on RMR (resting metabolic rate, measured in thermoneutrality, 25°C) and TMR (thermoregulatory metabolic rate, measured in cold challenging condition, 5°C) in the House sparrow. Following experimental administration of CORT at the nestling stage, house sparrows were kept in captivity until adulthood when their metabolism was measured. We found that post-natal CORT exposure decreased both RMR and TMR in adult sparrows. This CORT-mediated reduction of metabolism was also associated with a reduced overnight body mass loss. Therefore, our results suggest that developmental CORT exposure can orient the phenotype towards an energy-saving strategy, which may be beneficial in a constraining environmental context.© 2019.

If this represents a causal effect, the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio would increase for birth cohorts no longer receiving smallpox vaccination due to the phase-out of this vaccine.An ecological design using HIV surveys and information about smallpox vaccination coverage.Urban and rural Guinea-Bissau.Participants in HIV surveys were grouped into an age group with decreasing smallpox vaccination coverage (15-34 years) and an age group with steady smallpox vaccination coverage (≥35 years).The exposure of interest was the phase-out of the smallpox vaccine in Guinea-Bissau.HIV-1 prevalence.At both sites, the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio increased by calendar time for the age group with decreasing smallpox vaccination coverage; the combined female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio among people aged 15-34 years was 1.00 (95% CI 0.17 to 5.99) in 1987-1990, 1.16 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.93) in 1996-1997, 2.32 (95% CI 1.51 to 3.56) in 2006-2007 (p value for no trend=0.04). There was no increase in the female-to-male HIV-1 prevalence ratio for the age group >35 years with steady smallpox vaccination coverage; 1.93 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.25) in 1987-1990, 1.32 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.10) in 1996-1997, 0.81 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.16) in 2006-2007 (p value for no trend=0.07).Thus, data was compatible with the deduction that the phase-out of smallpox vaccination may have increased the susceptibility to HIV-1 relatively more for women than men. Hence, phasing out smallpox vaccination may have contributed to the global increase in the female/male HIV-1 prevalence ratio among young individuals. Due to the potential fallacies of ecological studies, the results should be interpreted carefully, and this hypothesis needs further assessment. If the hypothesis is true, studies of smallpox vaccination could inform HIV-1 vaccine research.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Sixty multiparous, pregnant lactating Holstein cows with somatic cell count <200,000/mL were blocked by days in milk and milk yield and randomly assigned to receive a daily top-dressed dietary supplement containing 1 or 3 mg of vitamin D (1mgD or 3mgD), or 1 or 3 mg 25(OH)D (1mg25D or 3mg25D) for 28 d (n = 15/treatment). Cows were kept in a freestall barn and fed a total mixed ration in individual feeding gates. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk and blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to the start of treatment. At 21 d, cows fed 1mgD and 3mg25D received an intramammary challenge with Streptococcus uberis. Cows were observed for severity of mastitis, and blood and milk samples were collected every 12 h to measure inflammation. The 1mg25D and 3mg25D cows had greater serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 21 d compared with 1mgD and 3mgD cows (62 ± 7, 66 ± 8, 135 ± 15, and 232 ± 26 ng/mL for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). The 3mg25D cows had greater concentrations of Ca and P in serum at 21 d compared with other treatments (Ca = 2.38, 2.4, 2.37, and 2.48 ± 0.02 mM, 1.87, 1.88, and 2.10 ± 0.08 mM for 1mgD, 3mgD, 1mg25D, and 3mg25D, respectively). Yields of milk and milk components, DMI, body weight, and concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Mg in serum did not differ among treatments. Abundance of mRNA transcripts for interleukin-1β (IL1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in milk somatic cells before S. uberis challenge were increased in cows fed 25(OH)D compared with cows fed vitamin D. Furthermore, IL1β, iNOS, β-defensin 7, and β-defensin 10 in milk somatic cells increased as concentrations of 25(OH)D increased in serum. Cows fed 3mg25D had less severe mastitis at 60 and 72 h after challenge with S. uberis compared with cows fed 1mgD. Concentrations of bacteria, somatic cells, and serum albumin in milk after challenge did not differ between treatments; however, an interaction between treatment and day was detected for lactate dehydrogenase in milk. Expression of adhesion protein CD11b on milk neutrophils after the S. uberis challenge was greater among 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Transcripts of CYP24A1 and iNOS in milk somatic cells during mastitis also were greater in 3mg25D cows compared with 1mgD cows. Feeding 25(OH)D increased serum 25(OH)D more effectively than supplemental vitamin D, resulting in increased serum mineral concentrations, increased expression of vitamin D-responsive genes, and altered immune responses to intramammary bacterial challenge.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

For that purpose, we calibrated an age-specific influenza dynamics model to Russian acute respiratory infection (ARI) incidence data over 2009-2016 and assessed the variability of proportion of non-immune individuals in the population depending on the regarded city, the non-epidemic indicence baseline, the contact structure considered and the used calibration method. The experiments demonstrated the importance of distinguishing characteristics of different age groups, such as contact intensities and background  levels. It was also found that the current model calibration process, which relies mostly on ARI incidence, demonstrates notable variation of output parameter values. Employing additional sources of data, such as strain-specific influenza incidence and external assessments on underreporting levels in different age groups, might enhance the plausibility of parameter values obtained by model calibration, along with reducing the assessment variation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In humans, selenium's biological activity occurs through the 25 identified selenoproteins. As total selenium concentration encompasses both functional selenoproteins, small selenocompounds and other selenium-binding proteins, selenium speciation, rather than total concentration, is critical in order to assess functional selenium. Previously, quantitative analysis of selenoproteins required laborious techniques that were often slow and costly. However, more recent advancements in tandem mass spectrometry have facilitated the qualitative and quantitative identification of these proteins. In light of the current alternatives for understanding selenium biochemistry, we aim to provide a review of the modern applications of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) as an alternative to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for qualitative and quantitative selenium speciation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672142>Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring , could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities.A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms.When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce inflammation, should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668641>Amino Acids License Kinase mTORC1 Activity and Treg Cell Function via Small G Proteins Rag and Rheb.</a></h2><p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical mediators of immune tolerance whose activity depends upon T cell receptor (TCR) and mTORC1 kinase signaling, but the mechanisms that dictate functional activation of these pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we showed that amino acids license Treg cell function by priming and sustaining TCR-induced mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activation was induced by amino acids, especially arginine and leucine, accompanied by the dynamic lysosomal localization of the mTOR and Tsc complexes. Rag and Rheb GTPases were central regulators of amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation in effector Treg (eTreg) cells. Mice bearing RagA-RagB- or Rheb1-Rheb2-deficient Treg cells developed a fatal autoimmune disease and had reduced eTreg cell accumulation and function. RagA-RagB regulated mitochondrial and lysosomal fitness, while Rheb1-Rheb2 enforced eTreg cell suppressive gene signature. Together, these findings reveal a crucial requirement of amino acid signaling for licensing and sustaining mTORC1 activation and functional programming of Treg cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HLA likewise forms an integral part of the innate immune response through the binding of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) molecules, which regulate the response of natural killer (NK) cells. The HLA complex is found on the short arm of chromosome 6 and is the most polymorphic region in the human genome. Africans are genetically more diverse than other populations; however, information on HLA diversity among southern Africans, including South African populations, is limited. Paucity of African HLA data limits our understanding of disease associations, the ability to identify donor-recipient matches for transplantation and the development of disease-specific vaccines. This review discusses the importance of HLA in the clinical setting in South Africans and highlights how tools such as HLA imputation might augment standard HLA typing methods to increase our understanding of HLA diversity in our populations, which will better inform disease association studies, donor recruitment strategies into bone marrow registries and our understanding of human genetic diversity in South Africa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673881>New Insights Into Cryptococcus Spp. Biology and Cryptococcal Meningitis.</a></h2><p>Defective cell-mediated  is a major risk factor for cryptococcosis, a fatal disease if untreated. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), the main presentation of disseminated disease, occurs through hematogenous spread to the brain from primary pulmonary foci, facilitated by yeast virulence factors. We revisit remarkable recent improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and management of CM.Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), main capsular polysaccharide of Cryptococcus spp. is detectable in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients with point of care lateral flow assays. Recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend 7-day amphotericin B plus flucytosine, then 7-day high dose (1200 mg/day) fluconazole for induction treatment of HIV-associated CM. Management of raised intracranial pressure, a consequence of CM, should rely mainly on daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until normalisation. In HIV-associated CM, following introduction of antifungal therapy, (re)initiation of antiretroviral therapy should be delayed by 4-6 weeks to prevent immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, common in CM. CM is a fatal disease whose diagnosis has recently been simplified. Treatment should always include antifungal combination therapy and management of raised intracranial pressure.

A safer and more effective vaccine than BCG is urgently required. More than a dozen TB vaccine candidates are under active evaluation in clinical trials aimed to prevent infection, disease, and recurrence. After decades of extensive research, renewed promise of an effective vaccine against this ancient airborne disease has recently emerged. In two innovative phase 2b vaccine clinical trials, one for the prevention of  infection in healthy adolescents and another for the prevention of TB disease in -infected adults, efficacy signals were observed. These breakthroughs, based on the greatly expanded knowledge of the  infection spectrum, immunology of TB, and vaccine platforms, have reinvigorated the TB vaccine field. Here, we review our current understanding of natural  to TB, limitations in BCG  that are guiding vaccinologists to design novel TB vaccine candidates and concepts, and the desired attributes of a modern TB vaccine.

A complex of the ligands Protein S (PROS1) or Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) with apoptotic phosphatidylserine activates the TAM receptors. Hence, this receptor family is essential for the efferocytosis of apoptotic material by antigen-presenting cells. In addition, TAM receptors are expressed by virtually all cells of the tumor microenvironment. They are also potent oncogenes, frequently overexpressed in cancer and involved in survival and therapy resistance. Due to their pro-oncogenic and immune-inhibitory traits, TAM receptors have emerged as promising targets for cancer therapy. Recently, TAM receptors have been described to function as costimulatory molecules on human T cells. TAM receptors' ambivalent functions on many different cell types therefore make therapeutic targeting not straight-forward. In this review we summarize our current knowledge of the function of TAM receptors in the tumor microenvironment.

However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor  with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor  produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor . Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors.

Therefore, vaccination through the mucosal route can greatly enhance the mucosal immune response. Vaccination via the mucosal surface is the most effective way to trigger a protective mucosal immune response, but the vast majority of vaccines used are administered by injection. Strategies to enhance the mucosal  have been developed by using vaccine adjuvants, delivery systems, bacterial or viral vectors, and DNA vaccines. Appropriate vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery systems can improve the immunogenicity of antigens, induce a stronger immune response, and reduce the vaccine dose and production cost. In recent years, many studies have focused on finding safe and effective vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery systems to formulate the mucosal vaccines for solving the above problems. Great progress has also been made in vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery systems based on biodegradable polymer nanoparticles. In this paper, the research progress of the mucosal vaccine and its related adjuvants and drug delivery systems in recent years was reviewed, and the application of polymers as adjuvants and drug delivery system in vaccine was prospected. This review provides a fundamental knowledge for the application of biodegradable polymer nanoparticles as adjuvants and carriers in mucosal vaccines and shows great application prospects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666653>MicroRNA-146a-deficient mice develop immune complex glomerulonephritis.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the kidneys under physiological and pathological conditions, but their role in immune glomerulonephritis is unclear. miR-146a has been identified as a key player in innate  and inflammatory responses, and in the kidney, this miRNA is involved in the response of injured tubular cells. We studied the renal and immune phenotypes of miR-146a and miR-146a mice at 12 months of age, and the results showed that miR-146a mice developed autoimmunity during aging, as demonstrated by circulating antibodies targeting double-stranded DNA and an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis associated with a mild renal immune infiltrate. In addition, miR-146a mice showed reduced expression of the transmembrane protein Kim1/Tim1, a key regulator of regulatory B cell (Breg) homeostasis, in the kidney and the immune cells. The numbers of memory B cells and plasmablasts were increased in miR-146a mice compared with the numbers in wild-type mice, whereas Bregs were decreased in number and displayed an altered capacity to produce IL-10. Finally, we showed that miR-146a mice develop an autoimmune syndrome with increasing age, and this syndrome includes immune complex glomerulonephritis, which might be due to altered B cell responses associated with Kim1/Tim1 deficiency. This study unravels a link between miR-146a and Kim1 and identifies miR-146a as a significant player in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661470>Antigen-loaded monocyte administration induces potent therapeutic anti-tumor T cell responses.</a></h2><p>Efficacy of dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccines is classically thought to depend on their antigen-presenting cell (APC) activity. Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor  by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious immunotherapy for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666531>Targeted deletion of NFAT-Interacting-Protein-(NIP) 45 resolves experimental asthma by inhibiting Innate Lymphoid Cells group 2 (ILC2).</a></h2><p>Here we investigated the role of NFAT-interacting protein (NIP)-45, an Interleukin (IL)-4 inducing Transcription Factor, and its impact on the differentiation of Group 2 Innate -Lymphoid -Cells (ILC2s) in the pathogenesis of asthma. NIP45, a transcription factor regulating NFATc1 activity, mRNA was found to be induced in the Peripheral Blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) of asthmatic pre-school children with allergies and in the peripheral blood CD4 T cells from adult asthmatic patients. In PBMCs of asthmatic and control children, NIP45 mRNA directly correlated with NFATc1 but not with T-bet. Targeted deletion of NIP45 in mice resulted in a protective phenotype in experimental asthma with reduced airway mucus production, airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophils. This phenotype was reversed by intranasal delivery of recombinant r-IL-33. Consistently, ILC2s and not GATA3 CD4 T-cells were decreased in the lungs of asthmatic NIP45 mice.

Endothelial dysfunction has been considered an important step in the initiation of the disease. TIPE1 is a newly identified protein of the TIPE family, and plays a vital role in inflammation and tumorigenesis. However, its role in atherogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that TIPE1 promoted atherogenesis by inducing endothelial dysfunction. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to oxidative stress, the level of TIPE1 was significantly up-regulated, and the ROS generation markedly increased in TIPE1 over-expressing HUVECs. As a result, the growth of HUVECs was inhibited, and the apoptosis was enhanced. However, the cell contact ability between HUVECs and THP-1 cells were augmented due to the up-regulation of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and ICAM-1 induced by TIPE1 overexpression. Importantly, ApoE mice injected with TIPE1 recombinant lentivirus developed significantly severe atherosclerosis accompanied by hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and increased white blood count. These findings indicated that excessive ROS induced by the overexpression of TIPE1 in endothelial cells accelerated the process of atherogenesis.Copyright © 2019.

Different potato cultivars react to the pathogen differently, resulting in resistant, tolerant or disease outcome of the interaction. Here we focus on tolerant interaction between potato cv. Désirée and PVY. To capture the response in its full complexity, we analyzed the dynamic changes on multiple molecular levels, including transcriptomics, sRNAomics, degradomics, proteomics and hormonomics. The analysis was complemented by the measurements of viral accumulation, photosynthetic activity and phenotypisation of the symptoms. Besides cv. Désirée we also studied its transgenic counterpart depleted for the accumulation of salicylic acid (NahG-Désirée). This multiomics analysis provides better insights into the mechanisms leading to tolerant response of potato to viral infection and can be used as a base in further studies of plant  regulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672785>Tumor-specific regulatory T cells from the bone marrow orchestrate antitumor  in breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Endogenous antitumor effector T cell responses and immune suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) critically influence the prognosis of cancer patients, yet many of the mechanisms of how this occurs remain unresolved. Based on an analysis of the function, antigen-specificity and distribution of tumor antigen-reactive T cells and Tregs in breast cancer patients and transgenic mouse tumor models we showed that tumor-specific Tregs were selectively activated in the bone marrow (BM) and egressed into the peripheral blood (PB). The BM was constantly depleted of tumor-specific Tregs and was instead a site of increased induction and activity of tumor-reactive effector/memory T cells. Treg egress from the BM was associated with activation-induced expression of peripheral homing receptors such as CCR2. Since breast cancer tissues express the CCR2 ligand CCL2, the activation and egress of tumor antigen-specific Tregs in the BM resulted in the accumulation of Tregs in breast tumor tissue. Such immune-compartmentalization and redistribution of T cell subpopulations between the BM and peripheral tissues was achieved by vaccination with adenoviral vector encoded TRP-2 tumor antigen in a RET transgenic mouse model of spontaneous malignant melanoma. Thus, the BM simultaneously represented a source of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and a site for the induction of endogenous tumor-specific effector T cell responses, suggesting that both antitumor  and local immune suppression are orchestrated in the BM.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666928>ERO1α promotes hypoxic tumor progression and is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide due to the difficulty of detecting early-stage disease and our poor understanding of the mediators that drive progression of hypoxic solid tumors. We therefore used a heavy isotope 'pulse/trace' proteomic approach to determine how hypoxia (Hx) alters pancreatic tumor expression of proteins that confer treatment resistance, promote metastasis, and suppress host . Using this method, we identified that hypoxia stress stimulates pancreatic cancer cells to rapidly translate proteins that enhance metastasis (NOTCH2, NCS1, CD151, NUSAP1), treatment resistance (ABCB6), immune suppression (NFIL3, WDR4), angiogenesis (ANGPT4, ERO1α, FOS), alter cell metabolic activity (HK2, ENO2), and mediate growth-promoting cytokine responses (CLK3, ANGPTL4). Database mining confirmed that elevated gene expression of these hypoxia-induced mediators is significantly associated with poor patient survival in various stages of pancreatic cancer. Among these proteins, the oxidoreductase enzyme ERO1α was highly sensitive to induction by hypoxia stress across a range of different pancreatic cancer cell lines and was associated with particularly poor prognosis in human patients. Consistent with these data, genetic deletion of ERO1α substantially reduced growth rates and colony formation by pancreatic cancer cells when assessed in a series of functional assays . Accordingly, when transferred into a mouse xenograft model, ERO1α-deficient tumor cells exhibited severe growth restriction and negligible disease progression . Together, these data indicate that ERO1α is potential prognostic biomarker and novel drug target for pancreatic cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664865>Improving Pulmonary  to Bacterial Pathogens Through  Colonisation of the Nasopharynx.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659299>HIV-2/SIV Vpx targets a novel functional domain of STING to selectively inhibit cGAS-STING-mediated NF-κB signalling.</a></h2><p>Innate  is the first line of host defence against pathogens. Suppression of innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses. However, the interplay between innate  and HIV/SIV is only poorly characterized. We have discovered Vpx as a novel inhibitor of innate immune activation that associates with STING signalosomes and interferes with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the induction of innate immune genes. This new function of Vpx could be separated from its role in mediating degradation of the antiviral factor SAMHD1, and is conserved among diverse HIV-2/SIV Vpx. Vpx selectively suppressed cGAS-STING-mediated nuclear factor-κB signalling. Furthermore, Vpx and Vpr had complementary activities against cGAS-STING activity. Since SIV lacking both Vpx and Vpr was less pathogenic than SIV deficient for Vpr or Vpx alone, suppression of innate  by HIV/SIV is probably a key pathogenic determinant, making it a promising target for intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672795>AKI with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Push beyond Case Reports.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668929>Mechanisms Controlling PD-L1 Expression in Cancer.</a></h2><p>The engagement of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; encoded by the PDCD1 gene) receptor expressed on activated T cells and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; encoded by the CD274 gene), is a major co-inhibitory checkpoint signaling that controls T cell activities. Various types of cancers express high levels of PD-L1 and exploit PD-L1/PD-1 signaling to evade T cell . Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has consistently shown remarkable anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced cancers and is recognized as the gold standard for developing new immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and combination therapies. However, the response rates of anti-PD-L1 have been limited in several solid tumors. Therefore, furthering our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 can bring substantial benefits to patients with cancer by improving the efficacy of current PD-L1/PD-1 blockade or other ICBs. In this review, we provide current knowledge of PD-L1 regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, post-translational, and extracellular levels, and discuss the implications of these findings in cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we have shown that a recombinant BCG expressing the LTAK63 adjuvant (rBCG-LTAK63) displayed higher protection than BCG against tuberculosis challenge in mice. In order to elucidate the immune effector mechanisms induced by rBCG-LTAK63, we evaluated the immune response before and after challenge. The potential to induce an innate immune response was investigated by intraperitoneal immunization with BCG or rBCG-LTAK63: both displayed increased cellular infiltration in the peritoneum with high numbers of neutrophils at 24 h and macrophages at 7 d. The rBCG-LTAK63-immunized mice displayed increased production of Nitric Oxide at 24 h and Hydrogen Peroxide at 7 d. The number of lymphocytes was higher in the rBCG-LTAK63 group when compared to BCG. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes showed that rBCG-LTAK63 immunization increased CD4 and CD8 T cells. An increased long-term Th1/Th17 cytokine profile was observed 90 d after subcutaneous immunization with rBCG-LTAK63. The evaluation of immune responses at 15 d after challenge showed that rBCG-LTAK63-immunized mice displayed increased TNF-α-secreting CD4 T cells and multifunctional IL-2 TNF-α CD4 T cells as compared to BCG-immunized mice. Our results suggest that immunization with rBCG-LTAK63 induces enhanced innate and long-term immune responses as compared to BCG.

WNV has been considered more benign than other WNV strains circulating globally. In 2011, a more virulent form of the virus emerged during an outbreak of equine arboviral disease in Australia.To better understand the emergence of this virulent phenotype and the mechanism by which pathogenicity is manifested in its host, cells were infected with either the virulent strain (NSW2012), or less pathogenic historical isolates, and their innate immune responses compared by digital immune gene expression profiling. Two different cell systems were used: a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH cells) and neuronal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).Significant innate immune gene induction was observed in both systems. The NSW2012 isolate induced higher gene expression of two genes (IL-8 and CCL2) when compared with cells infected with less pathogenic isolates. Pathway analysis of induced inflammation-associated genes also indicated generally higher activation in infected NSW2012 cells. However, this differential response was not paralleled in the neuronal cultures.NSW2012 may have unique genetic characteristics which contributed to the outbreak. The data herein is consistent with the possibility that the virulence of NSW2012 is underpinned by increased induction of inflammatory genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668684>Phosphoregulation of Ca Influx in Plant .</a></h2><p>A rapid influx of calcium into the cytosol represents a hallmark of plant immune responses.

The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666497>Comparison of clinical features of hepatitis A in people living with HIV between pandemic in 1999-2000 and that in 2017-2018 in a metropolitan area of Japan.</a></h2><p>Since 2017, hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has been an epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Japan. We experienced 11 MSM patients with hepatitis A who were also infected with HIV. In 1999-2000, we also experienced 5 HIV-infected patients with hepatitis A. Since conditions of current HIV-infected patients have changed owing to recent progress in anti-HIV therapies, we compared clinical features of hepatitis A between patients in 2017-2018 and those in 1999-2000. By comparing patients' background characteristics, we found the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in the 2017-2018 group. After the onset of hepatitis, peak levels of hepatic transaminases were higher in the 2017-2018 group, suggesting the hepatocellular damage was more severe. On the other hand, neither the peak level of total bilirubin nor the nadir of prothrombin time was significantly different.

The potential involvement of the neuroimmune axis in the motor cortex of ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology needs to be revealed. This information is vital for building effective treatment strategies.We investigated the presence of astrogliosis and microgliosis in the motor cortex of ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology. prpTDP-43-UeGFP mice, corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN) reporter line with TDP-43 pathology, are utilized to reveal the timing and extent of neuroimmune interactions and the involvement of non-neuronal cells to neurodegeneration.

Besides, CCR2+ TMEM119- infiltrating monocytes were detected as they penetrate the brain parenchyma. Interestingly, Betz cells, which normally do not express MCP1, were marked with high levels of MCP1 expression when diseased.There is an early contribution of a neuroinflammatory response for upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration with respect to TDP-43 pathology, and MCP1-CCR2 signaling is important for the recognition of diseased upper motor neurons by infiltrating monocytes.

Impaired transplacental transfer of influenza antibodies may reduce this protection.We conducted a cross-sectional study of influenza vaccine-naïve pregnant women recruited at delivery from Blantyre (urban, low malaria transmission) and Chikwawa (rural, high malaria transmission) in Southern Malawi. HIV-infected mothers were excluded in Chikwawa. Maternal and cord blood antibodies against circulating influenza strains A/California/7/2009, A/Victoria/361/2011, B/Brisbane/60/2008, and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). We studied the impact of maternal HIV infection and placental malaria on influenza antibody levels in mother-infant pairs in Blantyre and Chikwawa, respectively.We included 454 mother-infant pairs (Blantyre, n = 253; Chikwawa, n = 201). HIV-infected mothers and their infants had lower seropositivity (HAI titer ≥1:40) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (mothers, 24.3 vs 45.4%;  = .02; infants, 24.3 vs 50.5%;  = .003) and A(H3N2) (mothers, 37.8% vs 63.9%;  = .003; infants, 43.2 vs 64.8%;  = .01), whereas placental malaria had an inconsistent effect on maternal and infant seropositivity. In multivariable analyses, maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced infant seropositivity (A(H1N1)pdm09: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.79; A(H3N2): aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89).

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid-vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of , infection, cholesterol and drug metabolism, while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia. The identification of post-translational deimination of critical immunological and metabolic markers contributes to the current understanding of protein moonlighting functions, via post-translational changes, in the longevity and cancer resistance of naked mole-rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669836>Cell mediated and innate immune responses in pigs following vaccination and challenge with Toxoplasma parasites.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasma gondii has a worldwide distribution and can infect almost all warm blooded animals including pigs and humans. This study aims to examine the immune responses induced in pigs following vaccination (live S48 tachyzoites) and/or challenge with T. gondii oocysts, through the examination of changes in levels of transcription in CD4, CD8α, IFN-γ, IL-12p35, CXCR3, MyD88. The experiment involved four groups of animals; pigs in group 1 (Challenged) (Chal) were challenged orally with (1 × 10 oocysts) on day 28 of the experiment. Pigs in group 2 (Vaccinated /Challenged) (Vac/Chal) were vaccinated (S48 isolate tachyzoites) on day 0, then challenged on day 28. The group 3 (Vaccinated) (Vac) animals were vaccinated (S48 isolate tachyzoites) on day 0 of the experiment. Finally the group 4 (control) pigs remained non-vaccinated and non-challenged. All animals were culled 6 weeks post challenge. At post mortem samples of retropharyngeal lymph node (RLN), mesenteric LN (MLN) and spleen were collected, RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesised. The results showed significant increases in IFN-γ expression in samples from groups 1 (Chal) and 2 (Vac/Chal) (RLN) and groups 1, 2 and 3 (Vac) (spleen) and in MyD88 expression (RLN) in samples from groups 1, 2 and 3 compared to the group 4 (control) animals. Significant increases were also observed in CD8α expression in group 1 (Chal) (RLN) and groups 1 and 2 (Vac/Chal) (RLN and MLN) compared against group 4 (control) and group 3 (Vac) respectively. Conversely, significant down regulation of CD4 and/or IL-12p35 transcription was found in at least one sample from groups 1 (Chal), 2 (Vac/Chal) and 3 (Vac) compared to group 4 (control) pigs. This study demonstrates that cell mediated and innate immune responses are generated in pigs following exposure to T. gondii parasites (oocysts or tachyzoites), key amongst them appear to be IFN-γ, MyD88 and CD8α.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666126>Host-range shift of H3N8 canine influenza virus: a phylodynamic analysis of its origin and adaptation from equine to canine host.</a></h2><p>Prior to the emergence of H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) and the latest avian-origin H3N2 CIV, there was no evidence of a circulating canine-specific influenza virus. Molecular and epidemiological evidence suggest that H3N8 CIV emerged from H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV). This host-range shift of EIV from equine to canine hosts and its subsequent establishment as an enzootic CIV is unique because this host-range shift was from one mammalian host to another. To further understand this host-range shift, we conducted a comprehensive phylodynamic analysis using all the available whole-genome sequences of H3N8 CIV. We found that (1) the emergence of H3N8 CIV from H3N8 EIV occurred in approximately 2002; (2) this interspecies transmission was by a reassortant virus of the circulating Florida-1 clade H3N8 EIV; (3) once in the canine species, H3N8 CIV spread efficiently and remained an enzootic virus; (4) H3N8 CIV evolved and diverged into multiple clades or sublineages, with intra and inter-lineage reassortment.

Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium colonization in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria.

We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4 mucosal T Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17ACD4 T in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization. Our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665638>Mitochondrial Damage Causes Inflammation via cGAS-STING Signaling in Acute Kidney Injury.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the innate immune system. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway detects cytosolic DNA and induces innate . Here, we investigate the role of mitochondrial damage and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway using a genetically engineered animal model of cisplatin-induced AKI and cultured tubular cells. Cisplatin induced mtDNA leakage into the cytosol-probably through BCL-2-like protein 4 (BAX) pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane-in tubules, with subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby triggering inflammation and AKI progression, which is improved in STING-deficient mice. STING knockdown in cultured tubular cells ameliorates inflammatory responses induced by cisplatin. mtDNA depletion and repletion studies support tubular inflammatory responses via the cGAS-STING signal activation by cytosolic mtDNA. Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway is a critical regulator of kidney injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Repetitive sequences and chromatin architecture in particular are critical modulators of recombination and mutability. In Candida albicans, four major classes of repeats exist in the genome: telomeres, subtelomeres, the major repeat sequence (MRS), and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus. Characterization of these loci has revealed how their structure contributes to recombination and either promotes or restricts sequence evolution. The mechanisms of recombination that give rise to genome instability are known for some of these regions, whereas others are generally unexplored. More recent work has revealed additional repetitive elements, including expanded gene families and centromeric repeats that facilitate recombination and genetic innovation. Together, the repeats facilitate C. albicans evolution through construction of novel genotypes that underlie C. albicans adaptive potential and promote persistence across its human host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663301>Interrelationship between inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33, IL-37) and acquired .</a></h2><p>It is now well-known that interleukins (ILs) play a pivotal role in shaping innate : inflammatory ILs are responsible for all innate aspects of immune response, from the very first vascular reactions to the chronic non-specific response to inflammation; while anti-inflammatory ILs are responsible for keeping adaptive  at bay. The interactions between ILs and adaptive  have been long considered secondary to the effects on the innate immune system, but in recent years it has appeared more clearly that IL direct interactions with adaptive  are extremely important both in physiologic and pathologic immune response. In the present review we analyze the role of inflammatory ILs (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33 and IL-37) on adaptive  and briefly discuss the possible therapeutic perspectives of IL-blockade in adaptive  disorders.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p></html>
