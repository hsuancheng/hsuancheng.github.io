Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3 protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29 cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally, intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of  induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27652492>Discovery of 3α,7α,11β-Trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5β-cholan-24-oic  (TC-100), a Novel Bile  as Potent and Highly Selective FXR Agonist for Enterohepatic Disorders.</a></h2><p>As a continuation of previous efforts in mapping functional hot spots on the bile  scaffold, we here demonstrate that the introduction of a hydroxy group at the C11β position affords high selectivity for FXR. In particular, the synthesis and FXR/TGR5 activity of novel bile  bearing different hydroxylation patterns at the C ring are reported and discussed from a structure-activity standpoint. The results obtained led us to discover the first bile  derivative endowed with high potency and selectivity at the FXR receptor, 3α,7α,11β-trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5β-cholan-24-oic  (TC-100, 7) which also shows a remarkable physicochemical and pharmacological profile. Compound 7 combines the excellent physicochemical properties of hydrophilic bile  such as ursodeoxycholic , with the distinct ability to specifically bind and regulate FXR activity in vivo, thus providing a bona fide novel therapeutic agent to treat enterohepatic disorders such as cholestasis, NASH, and .</p></html>
