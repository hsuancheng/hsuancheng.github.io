However, the effect of  supply on mammary lipid synthesis is not clear. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of increasing  supply on milk fat synthesis in lactating dairy cows. Six multiparous lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a replicated design to investigate the effect of  supply on milk fat synthesis. Treatments were 0 (control), 5, 10, and 15 mol /d continuously infused into the rumen for 4 d. Rumen short-chain FAs, plasma hormones and metabolites, milk fat concentration, and milk FA profile were analyzed on day 4 of each treatment. Polynomial contrasts were used to test the linear and quadratic effects of increasing  supply.  increased milk fat yield quadratically ( < 0.01) by 7%, 16%, and 14% and increased milk fat concentration linearly ( < 0.001) by 6%, 9%, and 11% for 5, 10, and 15 mol /d, respectively, compared with the control treatment. Increased milk fat yield predominantly was due to a linear increase in 16-carbon FAs ( < 0.001) and a quadratic increase in de novo synthesized FAs (<16-carbon FAs;  < 0.01), indicating that there was stimulation of de novo synthesis pathways. Apparent transfer of  to milk fat was 33.4%, 36.2%, and 20.6% for 5, 10, and 15 mol/d, respectively.  infusion linearly increased the relative concentration of rumen  ( < 0.001) before feeding, but not after feeding.  linearly increased plasma ß-hydroxybutyric acid by 29%, 50%, and 78%, respectively, after feeding compared with the control treatment ( < 0.01). Increasing  supply to lactating cows increases milk fat synthesis, suggesting that nutritional strategies that increase ruminal  absorption would be expected to increase milk fat by increasing de novo FA synthesis.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic  in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed . In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic  in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480166>Chromium  stimulates  through regulation of gene expression and phosphorylation of AMPK in bovine intramuscular or subcutaneous adipocytes.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that Cr source can alter adipogenic-related transcriptional regulations and cell signaling. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the biological effects of chromium  (CrAc) on bovine intramuscular and subcutaneous adipose cells.Bovine preadipocytes isolated from two different adipose tissue depots; IM and SC were used to evaluate the effect of CrAc treatment during differentiation on adipogenic gene expression. Adipocytes were incubated with various doses of CrAc: 0 (differentiation media only, Control), 0.1, 1, and 10µM. Cells were harvested and then analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in order to measure the quantity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-α (AMPK-α), CCAAT enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ), G protein-coupled receptor 41(GPR41),GPR43, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) mRNA relative to ribosomal protein subunit 9 (RPS9). The ratio of phosphorylated-AMPK (pAMPK) to AMPK was determined using a western blot technique in order to determine changing concentration.The high dose (10µM) of CrAc increased C/EBPβ, in both IM (P = 0.02) and SC (P = 0.02). Expression of PPARγ was upregulated by 10µM of CrAc in IM but not in SC. Expression of SCD was also increased in both IM and SC with 10μM of CrAc treatment. Addition of CrAc did not alter gene expression of GLUT4, GPR41, or GPR43 in both IM and SC adipocytes. Addition of CrAc, resulted in a decreased pAMPKα to AMPKα ration (P < 0.01) in IM.These data may indicate that Cr source may influence lipid filling in IM adipocytes via inhibitory action of AMPK phosphorylation and upregulating expression of adipogenic genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380538>Anabolic payout of terminal implant alters adipogenic gene expression of the longissimus muscle in beef steers.</a></h2><p>This experiment evaluated the dose and payout pattern of trenbolone  (TBA) and estradiol-17β (E) on LM mRNA expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-ɑ (-ɑ), β, G protein-coupled receptor 41(), G protein-coupled receptor 43 (), γ, and stearoyl CoA desaturase () in finishing feedlot steers as indicators of  and marbling development. British × Continental steers (n = 168; 14 pens/treatment; initial BW = 362 kg) were used in a randomized complete block design. Treatments included: no implant (NI), Revalor-S (REV-S; 120 mg TBA + 24 mg E), or Revalor-XS (REV-X; delayed release implant: 80 mg TBA + 16 mg E [uncoated], 120 mg TBA + 24 mg E [coated], 200 mg TBA + 40 mg E [total]). Steers were fed 1 time daily for an average of 164 d. The LM biopsies were collected (1 steer/pen) on d -1, 27, 55, and 111 relative to timing of implant. Total RNA was isolated from each sample and real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure quantity of -ɑ, β, , ,it, γ, and mRNA. No implant × day interactions were detected ( ≥ 0.19) in this experiment. Day impacted the mRNA expression of all adipogenic genes ( ≤ 0.02). The main effect of implant tended ( = 0.09) to influence expression of -ɑ, REV-X had an 8.8% increase over NI and an 18.7% increase over REV-S. Implant influenced ( = 0.03) mRNA expression of , expression of for the REV-X treatment was not different ( > 0.10) from NI, and both were greater ( ≤ 0.05) than REV-S (1.13, 1.00, and 0.67 ± 0.224 arbitrary units) for REV-X, NI, and REV-S, respectively. Implant also influenced ( = 0.02) expression of , expression of for REV-X was not different ( > 0.10) from NI, and both were greater ( ≤ 0.05) than REV-S (1.27, 1.07, and 0.72 ± 0.234 arbitrary units) for REV-X, NI, and REV-S, respectively. Implant influenced ( = 0.02) mRNA expression of γ in LM tissue, expression of γ for REV-X was not different ( > 0.10) from NI, and both were greater ( ≤ 0.05) than REV-S (1.09, 1.02, and 0.69 ± 0.195 arbitrary units) for REV-X, NI, and REV-S, respectively. The REV-X steers received the greatest anabolic dose of TBA + E without detriment to marbling scores. The increased mRNA expression of adipogenic genes for REV-X steers suggest that the delayed and gradual release of anabolic stimulants associated with REV-X might have mitigated decreases in marbling generally attributed to multiple combined TBA + E implants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain fatty acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in obesity development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/browning markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed  in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27469197>Screening of six Ayurvedic medicinal plants for anti-obesity potential: An investigation on bioactive constituents from Oroxylum indicum (L.)

Bioactivity guided isolation approach was used to identify active constituent for anti- and PL inhibition assay. Inhibition of lipid accumulation and adipogenic transcription factor was measured by oil Red 'O' staining and quantitative real-time PCR method respectively.Ethyl  extract of Oroxylum indicum bark was found to be most active in screening of anti- (59.12±1.66% lipid accumulation as compared to control at 50μg/mL dose) and PL inhibition (89.12±6.87% PL inhibition at 250μg/mL dose) assays. Further, three bioactive flavonoids were isolated and identified as oroxylin A, chrysin and baicalein from O. indicum bark. Oroxylin A, chrysin, and baicalein were inhibited lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (75.00±5.76%, 70.21±4.23% and 77.21±5.49% lipid accumulation respectively in comparison to control at 50μM dose) and PL enzyme (69.86±2.96%, 52.08±2.14% and 45.06±2.42% PL inhibition respectively at 250μg/mL dose). In addition, oroxylin A and chrysin also inhibited PPARγ and C/EBPα, major adipogenic transcription factors, in 3T3L-1 preadipocytes during  process at 50μM dose.The present study augurs the anti-obesity potential of well practiced Ayurvedic herb O. indicum and its flavonoids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, its unrevealed mechanism and complicated comorbidities have led to no specific medication, except for weight loss and lifestyle modification.  (Sam.) Juzep (, Alismataceae) has been increasingly reported on therapeutic effects of  against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to review the preclinical efficacy of  and its chemical constituents including Alisol A 24-, Alisol B 23-, Alisol F, and Alismol against NAFLD and metabolic syndrome.  prevented hepatic triglyceride accumulation through suppressing de novo  and increasing lipid export. In addition, it controlled oxidative stress markers, lipoapoptosis, liver injury panels, and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators, eventually influencing steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Moreover, it exhibited pharmacological activities against hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hyperglycemia as well as appetite. These biological actions of  might contribute to adiponectin activation or a role as a farnesoid X receptor agonist. In particular, Alisol A 24- and Alisol B 23- could be expected as main compounds. Taken together,  might be an effective candidate agent for the treatment of NAFLD and its comorbidities, although further assessment of its standardization, safety test, and clinical trials is consistently required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27895388> alters expression of genes involved in beige  in 3T3-L1 cells and obese KK-Ay mice.</a></h2><p>The induction of beige  within white adipose tissue, known as "browning", has received attention as a novel potential anti-obesity strategy.

Although  has been reported to suppress weight gain in both rodents and humans, its potential effects on beige  in white adipose tissue have not been fully characterized. We examined the effects of  treatment on 3T3-L1 cells and in obese diabetic KK-Ay mice. The mRNA expression levels of genes involved in beige adipocyte differentiation and genes selectively expressed in beige adipocytes were significantly elevated in both 3T3-L1 cells incubated with 1.0 mM  and the visceral white adipose tissue from mice treated with 0.6%  for 16 weeks. In KK-Ay mice,  reduced the food efficiency ratio and increased the whole-body oxygen consumption rate. Additionally, reduction of adipocyte size and -positive adipocytes and interstitial areas with multilocular adipocytes appeared in the visceral white adipose tissue of -treated mice, suggesting that  induced initial changes of "browning".

This was undertaken to investigate the mechanism responsible for the effect of ethyl  fraction of CI (CIEA) on , in vitro and in vivo models of obesity. In the in vitro study, differentiating 3T3-L1 cells were treated with media to initiate differentiation (MDI) in the presence or absence of CIEA with different concentrations, and in the in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were fed with HFD and administered CIEA daily for six weeks. Garcinia cambogia (GC) was used as the positive control, and was administered in the same manner as CIEA. Results showed CIEA reduced HFD-induced body weight gain, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), and liver weight. In addition, CIEA significantly decreased serum lipid profiles, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) levels. Furthermore, CIEA also reduced leptin levels and increased adiponectin levels in serum, and significantly decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [Formula: see text] (PPAR[Formula: see text]) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EPBs) levels, but increased PPAR[Formula: see text] level and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in eWATs and in the liver tissues of HFD fed obese mice.

The effects of ALS-L1023 on  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipocyte hypertrophy in high fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were measured using in vivo and in vitro approaches.ALS-L1023 inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the HUVEC tube formation assay in vitro. Treatment of cells with ALS-L1023 inhibited lipid accumulation and adipocyte-specific gene expression caused by troglitazone or MDI differentiation mix. ALS-L1023 reduced mRNA expression of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in differentiated cells. In contrast, mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP-1, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) increased. Protease activity, as measured by zymography, showed that activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased in ALS-L1023-treated cells. ALS-L1023 also inhibited MMP-2 and MMP-9 reporter gene expression in the presence of the MMP inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-. An in vivo study showed that ALS-L1023 not only decreased adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size, but also reduced mRNA levels of adipose tissue angiogenic factors and MMPs in HFD-fed obese mice.These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic herbal extract ALS-L1023 suppresses  and adipocyte hypertrophy, and this effect may be mediated by inhibiting angiogenesis and MMP activities.

The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing energy intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group. Epididymal adipocyte volume was reduced in GbE-supplemented rats, as were epididymal [1-C]- incorporation into fatty acids, perilipin () and fatty acid synthase () mRNA, and FAS protein levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity is associated with insulin resistance, and in the present study we observed a reduction in the adipocyte volume of GbE-supplemented obese rats to dimensions equivalent to adipocytes from non-obese rats. GbE supplementation significantly reduced  accumulation and tended to reduce [H]-oleate incorporation, into epididymal adipose tissue, suggesting a potentially anti-obesogenic effect in longer term therapies. Further studies that investigate the effects of GbE supplementation in other experimental models are required to fully elucidate its suggested beneficial effects on mild chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. , propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, , lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk.

Aberrant NAA concentrations have been detected in many pathological conditions and although the function of NAA has been extensively investigated in the brain it is still controversial. Only recently, a role of NAA has been reported outside the brain. In brown adipocytes, which show high expression of the NAA-producing and the NAA-cleaving enzyme, the metabolism of NAA has been implicated in lipid synthesis and histone acetylation. Increased expression of -acetyltransferase 8-like (, the gene encoding the NAA synthesizing enzyme) induces   and the brown adipocyte phenotype. Accordingly silencing of aspartoacylase, the NAA-cleaving enzyme, reduced brown adipocyte differentiation mechanistically by decreasing histone acetylation and gene transcription. Notably, the expression of Nat8l and the amount of NAA were also shown to be increased in several tumors and inversely correlate with patients' survival. Additionally, Nat8l silencing reduced cell proliferation in tumor and non-tumor cells, while NAA supplementation could rescue it. However, the mechanism behind has not yet been clarified. It remains to be addressed whether NAA  and/or its catabolism to  and aspartate, metabolites that have both been implicated in tumor growth, are valuable targets for future therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25671109>Quantitative analysis of acetyl-CoA production in hypoxic cancer cells reveals substantial contribution from .</a></h2><p>Cell growth requires fatty acids for membrane synthesis. Fatty acids are assembled from 2-carbon units in the form of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). In nutrient and oxygen replete conditions, acetyl-CoA is predominantly derived from glucose. In hypoxia, however, flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA decreases, and the fractional contribution of glutamine to acetyl-CoA increases. The significance of other acetyl-CoA sources, however, has not been rigorously evaluated. Here we investigate quantitatively, using (13)C-tracers and mass spectrometry, the sources of acetyl-CoA in hypoxia.In normoxic conditions, cultured cells produced more than 90% of acetyl-CoA from glucose and glutamine-derived carbon. In hypoxic cells, this contribution dropped, ranging across cell lines from 50% to 80%. Thus, under hypoxia, one or more additional substrates significantly contribute to acetyl-CoA production.

Expression of ACSS2 was high in lipid synthesizing tissues, and its expression increased during lactation compared with non-lactating period. Simultaneous knockdown of both ACSS2 and ACLY by siRNA in primary goat mammary epithelial cells decreased (p < 0.05) the mRNA abundance of genes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis (FASN, ACACA, SCD1) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis (DGAT1, DGAT2, GPAM, and AGPAT6). Genes responsible for lipid droplet formation and secretion (PLIN2 and PLIN3) and fatty acid oxidation (ATGL, HSL, ACOX, and CPT1A) all decreased (p < 0.05) after ACSS2 and ACLY knockdown. Total cellular TAG content and lipid droplet formation also decreased. Use of a luciferase reporter assay revealed a direct regulation of ACSS2 by SREBP-1. Furthermore, SREBP-1 interacted with an SRE (SREBP response element) spanning at -475 to -483 bp on the ACSS2 promoter.

Moreover, main constituents of EEG extract were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).EEG extract decreased the lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulations during the differentiation process and down-regulated the -related transcriptional factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. EEG extract treatment increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. In addition, pretreatment with AMPK inhibitor, weakened the inhibitory effects of EEG extract on the expressions of PPARγand C/EBPα.

How HG impacts the differentiation of BMSCs and what is the underlying molecular mechanism remain largely unknown. Our results showed that ethyl  extract of HG (HGE) significantly decreased the adipocyte differentiation as determined by oil red staining, while slightly increased the ALP activity. Investigation of the molecular mechanism revealed that HGE could inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyteprotein2 (AP2). Interestingly, the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation in BMSCs by HGE could be restored by DKK-1, an inhibitor of Wnts. However, Noggin (an inhibitor of BMPs) displayed an additive role with HGE in suppressing the expression of PPARγ, LPL, and AP2. Furthermore, the bone marrow fat formation, as well as the expression of Wnt3a and PPARγ, was effectively regulated by HGE in the steroid-induced ONFH rats.

An important aspect of the bacterium's growth at low temperatures is its ability to increase the branched-chain fatty acid anteiso C15:0 content of its membrane at lower growth temperatures, which imparts greater membrane fluidity. Mutants in the branched-chain α-keto dehydrogenase (bkd) complex are deficient in branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs,) but these can be restored by feeding C4 and C5 branched-chain carboxylic acids (BCCAs). This suggests the presence of an alternate pathway for production of acyl CoA precursors for fatty acid biosynthesis. We hypothesize that the alternate pathway is composed of butyrate kinase (buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) encoded in the bkd complex which produce acyl CoA products by their sequential action through the metabolism of carboxylic acids. We determined the steady state kinetics of recombinant His-tagged Buk using 11 different straight-chain and BCCA substrates in the acyl phosphate forming direction. Buk demonstrated highest catalytic efficiency with pentanoate as the substrate. Low product formation observed with  (C2) and hexanoate (C6) as the substrates indicates that Buk is not involved in either  metabolism or long chain carboxylic acid activation. We were also able to show that Buk catalysis occurs through a ternary complex intermediate. Additionally, Buk demonstrates a strong preference for BCCAs at low temperatures. These results indicate that Buk may be involved in the activation and assimilation of exogenous carboxylic acids for membrane fatty acid biosynthesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous results offered no convincing support for these differences being related to relevant changes in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile, including potentially antilipogenic FA, or in the transcript abundance of candidate genes involved in mammary . Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations in the processes of rumen biohydrogenation and fermentation, as well as in the bacterial community structure, might account for individual variation in fish oil-induced MFD severity. To test this explanation, 15 ewes received a total mixed ration without lipid supplementation (control; n = 5) or supplemented with 20 g of fish oil/kg of dry matter [10 animals divided into those showing a strong (RESPON+; -25.4%; n = 5) or a mild (RESPON-; -7.7%; n = 5) decrease in milk fat concentration] for 5 wk. Rumen fermentation parameters, biohydrogenation metabolites, and bacterial structure and diversity were analyzed in rumen samples collected before and after treatments. Although the fish oil supplementation increased the concentration of demonstrated or putative antilipogenic FA (e.g., cis-9 16:1, cis-11 18:1, or trans-10,cis-12 CLA), surprisingly, none of them differed significantly in relation to the extent of MFD (i.e., between RESPON- and RESPON+), and this was the case only for a few minor FA (e.g., cis-6+7 16:1 or 17:0 anteiso). Changes in total volatile FA, , and propionate concentrations were associated with MFD severity, with higher decreases in more susceptible animals. Individual responses were not related to shifts in rumen bacterial structure but some terminal restriction fragments compatible with Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Succiniclasticum showed greater abundances in RESPON-, whereas some others that may correspond to Prevotella, Mogibacterium, and Quinella-related spp. were more abundant in RESPON+. Overall, the results suggest that individual variation in MFD severity in dairy ewes fed fish oil cannot be fully explained by differences in the processes of rumen biohydrogenation and fermentation or in the bacterial community, and further research would be necessary to elucidate the large variability in the responsiveness to MFD-inducing marine lipids.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

We aimed to answer this paradox by investigating the effects of fermentable and non-fermentable fibers on obesity induced by high-fat diet in gnotobiotic C3H/HeOuJ mice colonized with a simplified human microbiota. Mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented either with 10% cellulose (non-fermentable) or inulin (fermentable) for 6 weeks. Feeding the inulin diet resulted in an increased diet digestibility and reduced feces energy, compared to the cellulose diet with no differences in food intake, suggesting an increased intestinal energy extraction from inulin. However, we observed no increase in body fat/weight. The additional energy provided by the inulin diet led to an increased bacterial proliferation in this group. Supplementation of inulin resulted further in significantly elevated concentrations of total SCFA in cecum and portal vein plasma, with a reduced cecal :propionate ratio. Hepatic expression of genes involved in  (Fasn, Gpam) and fatty acid elongation/desaturation (Scd1, Elovl3, Elovl6, Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2) were decreased in inulin-fed animals. Accordingly, plasma and liver phospholipid composition were changed between the different feeding groups. Concentrations of omega-3 and odd-chain fatty acids were increased in inulin-fed mice, whereas omega-6 fatty acids were reduced. Taken together, these data indicate that, during this short-term feeding, inulin has mainly positive effects on the lipid metabolism, which could cause beneficial effects during obesity development in long-term studies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The GRX line is an activated HSC model that can be induced by all-trans-retinol to accumulate lipid droplets. Resveratrol is known for activating Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that suppresses the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), an important adipogenic transcription factor involved in the quiescence maintenance of HSC. We evaluated the effects of 0.1 μM of resveratrol in retinol-induced GRX quiescence by investigating the interference of SIRT1 and PPARγ on cell . GRX lipid accumulation was evaluated through Oil-red O staining, triacylglycerides quantification, and [(14)C]  incorporation into lipids. mRNA expression and protein content of SIRT1 and PPARγ were measured by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 stimuli did not induce  and reduced the retinol-mediated fat-storing capacity in GRX. In order to support our results, we established a cell culture model of transgenic super expression of PPARγ in GRX cells (GRXPγ). Resveratrol reduced lipid droplets accumulation in GRXPγ cells. These results suggest that the PPARγ/SIRT1 ratio plays an important role in the fate of HSC. Thus, whenever the PPARγ activity is greater than SIRT1 activity the  is enabled.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26001655>Metabolic and mind shifts: from glucose to glutamine and  addictions in cancer.</a></h2><p>Glutamine and  were recently identified as alternatives to glucose for fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in cancer cells, particularly in the context of hypoxia.Molecular mechanisms orchestrating glutamine and  metabolism were elicited through the combination of C tracer analysis and genetic silencing, or pharmacological modulation of key metabolic enzymes including those converting glutamate into α-ketoglutarate (αKG) (and beyond) and  into acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA).Oxidative decarboxylation and reductive carboxylation of αKG represent two options for the glutamine metabolism. The canonical forward mode of the TCA cycle fuelled by glutamine may benefit from the decarboxylation of malate into pyruvate for fueling pyruvate dehydrogenase and generating acetyl-CoA to offer a self-sustainable TCA cycle. Under hypoxia and mutations in the TCA cycle, the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived αKG into citrate mainly supports  via the ATP citrate lyase that cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Still, a largely unsuspected source of acetyl-CoA was shown to derive from the direct ligation of  to CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetases.

Objectives of this study were to evaluate how acute HS affects lipid metabolism in subcutaneous adipose tissue of dairy cattle. Adipose tissue biopsies were performed on Holstein cows for bovine primary adipocyte isolation and cultured at either 42°C (HS) or 37°C (thermal neutral, TN). Adipocytes were incubated with increasing isoproterenol (ISO), and with increasing concentrations of insulin in the presence of ISO to evaluate changes in lipolysis. Incorporation of radioactive  into lipids was measured as an indicator of . Abundance and phosphorylation of several lipolytic and lipogenic proteins were also measured. Adipocytes exposed to HS had an elevated maximal response to ISO and were more sensitive to lipolytic stimulation by ISO compared with cells cultured at TN. Thermal treatment did not affect the antilipolytic effects of insulin in the presence of ISO.  measured as  incorporation was not altered by HS, but a temperature by insulin interaction was observed for the regulation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, such that the presence of insulin resulted in a reduction in phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase in adipocytes cultured at TN but not HS conditions.

Alisol B 23-, one of the abundant triterpenes in ZX, was used as the marker of quality control for ZX in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while it could not reflect the lipid-lowering effect because other triterpenes in ZX also had prominent medicinal efficacy. To identify the significantly bioactive triterpenes in ZX, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based characteristic chemical profile (CCP)-support vector machine (SVM) model was used to explore the relationship between triterpenes and lipid-lowering effect of ZX. Firstly, the content of 87 targeted triterpenes was quantified by the MRM-based CCP using UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS. Secondly, the lipid-lowering effect of 30 ZX samples was assessed by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thirdly, 9 of the 87 triterpenes possessing high mean impact value were identified to have significant lipid-lowering effect via the particle swarm-optimized SVM model. The new SVM model constructed by the 9 triterpenes showed good prediction performance and the overall prediction accuracy reached 81.94%. Finally, the real activity of these triterpenes was partly confirmed and was consistent with the prediction of SVM. These results showed that the method for discovery of triterpenes with prominent lipid-lowering activity in ZX was reliable. The proposed method is expected to provide an efficient and rapid approach for screening of active component and drug discovery in traditional herbs.

Engineering strains capable of producing high lipid titers and yields is crucial to the economic viability of these processes. However, lipid synthesis in cells is a complex phenomenon subject to multiple layers of regulation, making gene target identification a challenging task. In this study, we aimed to identify genes in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica whose overexpression enhances lipid production by this organism. To this end, we examined the effect of the overexpression of a set of 44 native genes on lipid production in Y. lipolytica, including those involved in glycerolipid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, central carbon metabolism, NADPH generation, regulation, and metabolite transport and characterized each resulting strain's ability to produce lipids growing on both glucose and  as a sole carbon source. Our results suggest that a diverse subset of genes was effective at individually influencing lipid production in Y. lipolytica, sometimes in a substrate-dependent manner. The most productive strain on glucose overexpressed the diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGA2 gene, increasing lipid titer, cellular content, and yield by 236, 165, and 246 %, respectively, over our control strain. On , our most productive strain overexpressed the acylglycerol-phosphate acyltransferase SLC1 gene, with a lipid titer, cellular content, and yield increase of 99, 91, and 151 %, respectively, over the control strain. Aside from genes encoding enzymes that directly catalyze the reactions of lipid synthesis, other ways by which  was increased in these cells include overexpressing the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) gene to increase production of glycerol head groups and overexpressing the 6-phosphogluconolactonase (SOL3) gene from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to increase NADPH availability for fatty acid synthesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the overall kinetics of microbial lipid synthesis is sensitive to a wide variety of factors. Fully optimizing a strain for single cell oil processes could involve manipulating and balancing many of these factors, and, due to mechanistic differences by which each gene product investigated here impacts lipid synthesis, there is a high likelihood that many of these genes will work synergistically to further increase lipid production when simultaneously overexpressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25720493>Activated α2-macroglobulin binding to human prostate cancer cells triggers insulin-like responses.</a></h2><p>Ligation of cell surface GRP78 by activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) promotes cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis. α2M*-treated human prostate cancer cells exhibit a 2-3-fold increase in glucose uptake and lactate secretion, an effect similar to insulin treatment. In both α2M* and insulin-treated cells, the mRNA levels of SREBP1-c, SREBP2, fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, and Glut-1 were significantly increased together with their protein levels, except for SREBP2.

These lipogenic promoters drive the expression of critical pathways that are responsible for the generation of reducing equivalents (NADPH), carbon backbones (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, DHAP, etc.), synthesis and degradation of fatty acids.

Clinically, the rate of this process can be ascertained by use of labeled  and stimulation by fructose administration. A systems pharmacology model of this process is desirable because it facilitates the description, analysis, and prediction of this experiment. Due to the multiple enzymes involved in de-novo , and the limited data, it is desirable to use single functional expressions to encapsulate the flux between multiple enzymes. To accomplish this we developed a novel simplification technique which uses the available information about the properties of the individual enzymes to bound the parameters of a single governing 'transfer function'. This method should be applicable to any model with linear chains of enzymes that are well stimulated. We validated this approach with computational simulations and analytical justification in a limiting case. Using this technique we generated a simple model of hepatic de-novo  in these experimental conditions that matched prior data. This model can be used to assess pharmacological intervention at specific points on this pathway. We have demonstrated this with prospective simulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibition.

Functional macrophage migration assays also were performed. Surprisingly, the EtOAc fraction of MeOH extracts from native Korean plant species Sasa coreana Nakai (SCN) has shown potent anti-inflammatory properties; SCN pretreatment inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production (p < 0.01) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Inflammatory genes induced by LPS, including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, were significantly attenuated by SCN (p < 0.01). Pretreatment with SCN antagonized NF-κB nuclear translocation and the simultaneous degradation of inhibitory κB protein. Furthermore, SCN selectively inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK (p < 0.01) and p38 (p < 0.05) but not ERK (p > 0.05). Similar to leaf extracts of other bamboo species, we identified that SCN contained several flavonoids including orientin, isoorientin, and vitexin; these compounds inhibited LPS-induced NO production (p < 0.05) and iNOS expression. In addition, SCN inhibited adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining and the protein expression of mature adipogenic marker genes.

Control diets (low-fat (LF), HF) contained no SCFA. SCFA did not affect body composition but reduced hepatic gene and protein expression of lipogenic enzymes leading to a reduced hepatic triglyceride concentration after 22 weeks in HF-HPr mice. Analysis of long-chain fatty acid composition (liver and plasma phospholipids) showed that supplementation of both ratios led to a lower ω6:ω3 ratio. Pr directly led to increased odd-chain fatty acid (C15:0, C17:0) formation as confirmed in vitro using HepG2 cells. Remarkably, plasma C15:0 was correlated with the attenuation of HF diet-induced insulin resistance.Dependent on the Ac:Pr ratio, especially odd-chain fatty acid formation and insulin sensitivity are differentially affected, indicating the importance of Pr.© 2016 The Authors.

Thus, the development of novel drugs is urgently needed to control obesity related diseases.Here, we investigated the protective role of Lavatera critica (LC), a green vegetable, in male C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks to induce hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage.After oral administration of chloroform (CFLC), ethyl  (EFLC), or methanol (MFLC) fractions of Lavatera critica to the HF group, EALC alone significantly reduced the activities of hepatic markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); moreover, the results showed that 50 mg/kg dose has the maximum activity. Thus, this active dose of EFLC was used for further analysis. Moreover, EFLC reduced the level of hepatic triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acids (FFA), and prevented further increase in the body weight. Intriguingly, EFLC treatment also reversed the mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidative genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACO), and fatty acid synthesis genes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Furthermore, EFLC treatment also decreased the production of oxidative stress biomarkers, such as conjugated diene (CD), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH), and significantly enhanced the level of enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, and vitamin E in the liver.Taken together, we conclude that EFLC has a protective effect against HF diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative cellular damage through the regulation of  and lipolysis genes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Then, the test groups were subjected to the in vitro antidiabetic investigation using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes to determine the insulin-like and insulin sensitizing activities. Rosiglitazone was used as a standard antidiabetic agent. All compounds were also subjected to fluorescence glucose (2-NBDG) uptake test on differentiated adipocytes. Test solutions were introduced to the cells in different safe concentrations as well as in different adipogenic cocktails, which were modified by the addition of compounds to be investigated and in the presence or absence of insulin. Isolation of bioactive compounds from the most effective subfraction (ethyl ) was performed through repeated silica gel and sephadex LH-20 column chromatographies and their structures were elucidated through H-and C-NMR spectroscopy.Four monoflavonoids, namely, wogonin, norwogonin, quercetin and techtochrysin were isolated from the T. indica stems ethanol extract.

In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects. NASH was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum liver functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic  through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased lipid metabolism via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. AB23A produces protective effects against NASH in mice via FXR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932968>Micro-PET imaging of [18F]fluoroacetate combined with [18F]FDG to differentiate chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from an acute bacterial infection in a mouse model: a preliminary study.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide and is responsible for 1.7 million deaths per year. The increase in multidrug-resistant TB poses formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. TB infection could easily yield false-positive results in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG) PET imaging for cancer detection because of its high [F]FDG uptake. We describe the combined [F]FDG PET with fluorine-18-fluoroacetate ([F]FAC), a promising analog of carbon-11-, for targeting glycolysis and de novo , respectively, to determine the metabolic differences between chronic TB infection and acute infection.Six-month-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis to induce chronic TB infection, and Escherichia coli as well as Staphylococcus aureus to induce acute infection for an in-vivo imaging study. Eighteen days after inoculation for chronic TB infection and 5 days for acute infection, both [F]FDG and [F]FAC micro-PET were performed on the infected mice. Analysis of variance and the Tukey honest ad-hoc test were carried out to determine differences among treatment with different bacterial infections.TB infection showed much lower [F] FAC accumulation than acute infection. However, both TB infection and acute infection exhibited high [F]FAC accumulation.The marked metabolic differences in de novo  and glycolysis in [F]FDG and [F]FAC uptakes in micro-PET imaging, respectively, help to differentiate chronic TB infection from acute infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27136001>Adiposity, , and fatty acid composition of subcutaneous and intramuscular adipose tissues of Brahman and Angus crossbred cattle.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to demonstrate differences in aspects of adipose tissue cellularity, lipid metabolism, and fatty and cholesterol composition in Angus and Brahman crossbred cattle. We hypothesized that in vitro measures of  would be greater in three-fourths Angus progeny than in three-fourths Brahman progeny, especially in intramuscular (i.m.) adipose tissue. Progeny ( = 227) were fed a standard, corn-based diet for approximately 150 d before slaughter. Breed was considered to be the effect of interest and was forced into the model. There were 9 breed groups including all 4 kinds of three-fourths Angus calves: Angus bulls Angus-sired F cows ( = 32), Angus bulls Brahman-sired F cows ( = 20), Brahman-sired F bulls Angus cows ( = 24), and Angus-sired F bulls Angus cows ( = 20). There were all 4 kinds of three-fourths Brahman calves: Brahman bulls Brahman-sired F cows ( = 21), Brahman bulls Angus-sired F cows ( = 43), Brahman-sired F bulls Brahman cows ( = 26), and Angus-sired F bulls Brahman cows ( = 13). Additionally, F calves (one-half Brahman and one-half Angus) were produced only from Brahman-sired F bulls Angus-sired F cows ( = 28). Contrasts were calculated when breed was an important fixed effect, using the random effect family(breed) as the error term. Most contrasts were nonsignificant ( > 0.10). Those that were significant ( < 0.05) included cholesterol concentration of subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissue (three-fourths Angus > F, three-fourths Brahman > F, and three-fourths crossbred progeny combined > F), s.c. adipocyte volume (three-fourths Angus > F and three-fourths bloods combined > F),  from  in s.c. adipose tissue (three-fourths Brahman calves from Brahman dams > three-fourths Brahman calves from F dams), and percentage 18:3-3 in s.c. adipose tissue (three-fourths Brahman calves from Brahman-sired F dams < three-fourths Brahman calves from Angus-sired F dams). Intramuscular adipocyte volume ( < 0.001) was less in three-fourths Brahman cattle than in three-fourths Angus cattle.

Plasma , propionate, and butyrate were associated with body mass index and visceral and SC fat (all P < .05) and with hepatic DNL (P = .01, P = .09, P = .04, respectively). Moreover, the rate of CHO fermentation from the gut flora was higher in obese than in lean subjects (P = .018).These data demonstrate that obese youth show a different gut flora composition than lean and that short chain fatty acids are associated with body fat partitioning and DNL. Also, the gut microbiota of obese youth have a higher capability than the gut flora of lean to oxidize CHO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368568>Phenolic components rich ethyl  fraction of Orostachys japonicus inhibits lipid accumulation by regulating reactive oxygen species generation in .</a></h2><p>In this study, Orostachys japonicus was extracted with ethyl alcohol and fractionated by a serial of organic solvents.

However, the metabolic biomarkers of this model were not identified. Meanwhile, Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS) as natural products have been found to show strong antitumor activity, while its anti-cancer mechanism is not clear. To search for potential metabolite biomarkers of this model, serum metabonomics approach was applied to detect the variation of metabolite biomarkers and the related metabolism genes and signaling pathway were used to deduce the antitumor mechanisms of RPS. As a result, ten serum metabolites were identified in twenty-four mice including healthy mice, non-treated cancer mice, RPS-treated cancer mice and RPS-treated healthy mice. RPS significantly decreased tumor weight correlates to down-regulating lactate, , N-acetyl amino acid and glutamine signals (p < 0.05), which were marked metabolites screened according to the very important person (VIP), loading plot and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) tests. For the analysis of metabolic enzyme related genes, RPS reversed the aerobic glycolysis through activating tumor suppressor p53 and PTEN, and suppressed FASN to inhibit . What's more, RPS repressed Myc and GLS expression and decreased glutamine level. The regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR and HIF-1α/Myc/Ras networks also participated in these metabolic changes. Taken together, RPS suppressed ATP product made the tumor growth slow, which indicated a good anti-cancer effect and new angle for understanding the mechanism of RPS. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the utility of (1)H NMR metabolic profiles taken together with tumor weight and viscera index was a promising screening tool for evaluating the antitumor effect of candidates. In addition, RPS was a potent anticancer agent through inhibiting cancer cellular metabolism to suppress proliferation in hepatoma H22 tumor murine, which promoted the application of RPS in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To further develop this scientific point, the effect of resistant starch (RS) or exogenous  carried by RS (RSA) in the gut on metabolic syndrome is investigated using diet-induced obese rats.The metabonomics analysis shows that the gut of rats in the RSA group generate more butyrate in both serum and feces rather than  compared to the rats in RS group, indicating the conversion among metabolites, in particular from  to butyrate via gut microbiota. Consistently, the gut microbiome uses  as a substrate to produce butyrate, such as Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium and was highly promoted in RSA group, which further supports the metabolic conversion. This is the first report to reveal the accumulation of gut microbiota-produced butyrate (GMPB) but not GMPA significantly enriched AMPK signaling pathway with reduced expression of -associated genes for suppressing sphingosines and ceramides biosynthesis to trigger insulin sensitivity.Gut microbiome profile and  pathway are regulated by GMPB, which substantially influences energy harvesting in the gut from patterns opposed to GMPA.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent gene silencing studies in mammary cells indicate that SREBP-1 has a central role in milk fat synthesis. However, SREBP-1 knockdown studies in goat mammary cells have not been performed; hence, its direct role in controlling mRNA expression of lipid metabolism genes and triacylglycerol synthesis remains unknown. Inhibition of SREBP-1 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) by small interference RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the content of cellular triacylglycerol (~50% decrease, P < 0.05) and was partly related to downregulation of AGPAT6, LPIN1, and DGAT2 (-23%, -28% and -19%, respectively. P < 0.05), which are key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis, cellular triacylglycerol content and lipid droplet accumulation all decreased by SREBP-1 inhibition. The expression of lipid droplet formation and secretion genes was not altered in response to treatment. Although the lack of effect on expression of ACACA and FASN (rate-limiting enzymes for de novo fatty acid synthesis) with SREBP-1 knockdown was unexpected (P > 0.05), the downregulation of genes related to synthesis of acetyl-CoA and  activation (ACLY, ACSS2, and IDH1, P < 0.05) suggests that  was inhibited. SREBP-1 knockdown also resulted in decreased expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation and elongation (SCD1 and ELOVL6, P < 0.05), long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) activation and transport (ACSL1, FABP3, and SLC27A6, P < 0.05). The results underscored the essential role of SREBP-1 not only in fatty acid synthesis but also in desaturation, elongation, and esterification in GMEC. Clearly, the lack of effect on ACACA and FASN, both of which are considered the key lipogenic enzymes, implies that there may be different regulatory mechanisms in goat compared with bovine mammary cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28434739>The effect of conjugated linoleic acid, , and their interaction on adipose tissue lipid metabolism in nonlactating cows.</a></h2><p>During biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression, adipose tissue  may be increased through nutrients spared from milk fat synthesis. However, the direct effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and the indirect effect of spared nutrients on adipose tissue  during milk fat depression is not clear. The objective of this study was to determine the direct effect of CLA, spared , and their interaction on adipose tissue  using nonlactating dairy cows as an experimental model, which allows separation of the effect of CLA and nutrient sparing. Eight ruminally cannulated, multiparous nonlactating and pregnant Holstein cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors were CLA and , and treatments were control (CON), rumen  infusions (Ac; continuous infusion of 7 mol/d adjusted to pH 6.1 with sodium hydroxide), abomasal infusion of trans-10,cis-12 CLA (CLA; 10 g/d of both trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA), and Ac + CLA (Ac + CLA). Dry matter intake was not affected by Ac, but tended to decrease by CLA. Plasma trans-10,cis-12 CLA concentration as a percentage of fatty acids was increased by 0.3 percentage points by CLA. No treatment effect was observed on plasma glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate, but an interaction was observed of CLA and Ac on plasma insulin and nonesterified fatty acids. Insulin was increased 24% by CLA, but not by Ac + CLA, and nonesterified fatty acids were increased 55% by Ac + CLA, but not by CLA alone.  and oxidation capacity of adipose tissue explants were not affected by treatments. Adipose expression of key lipogenic factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 and sterol response element binding protein 1c) were reduced by CLA, by the interaction of Ac and CLA (sterol response element binding protein 1c), and tended to be reduced with Ac (S14 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1). Expression of several adipose lipogenic enzymes (fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) was reduced by CLA and Ac. An interaction was observed of Ac and CLA for fatty acid binding protein 4, which was decreased by Ac, but not Ac + CLA.

This assay functions well with multiple adipose depots, a previously unattained analysis. To delipidate and facilitate recovery, tissues were homogenized in acetonitrile and the homogenate was frozen. The supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in an aqueous  buffer, and extracted with hexane to separate free (unconjugated) from sulfated steroids. Sulfated steroids in the aqueous medium were then hydrolyzed with sulfatase and extracted with hexane. Each extract was analyzed separately. HPLC resolution combined with the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS allowed quantification of DHEA, E2, and T with 10, 10 and 5 fmol lower limits of quantification and linear ranges to 1 pmol. Application of the method to mouse serum and tissues reveals ranges of DHEA, E2, and T and their sulfates, and tissue-specific differences in steroid profile, especially white vs brown adipose.

With the recent recognition of lipid metabolic alterations in bladder cancers, we studied the metabolic implications of cisplatin resistance using cisplatin-sensitive (T24S) and resistant (T24R) bladder cancer cells. Real-time live metabolomics revealed that T24R cells consume more glucose, leading to higher production of glucose-derived  and fatty acids. Along with the activation of general metabolic regulators, enzymes involved in  usage (ACSS2) and fatty acid synthesis (ACC) and a precursor for fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA) were elevated in T24R cells. Consistently, metabolic analysis with C isotope revealed that T24R cells preferred glucose to  as the exogenous carbon source for the increased fatty acid synthesis, contrary to T24S cells. In addition, ACSS2, rather than the well-established ACLY, was the key enzyme that supplies acetyl-CoA in T24R cells through glucose-derived endogenous . The relevance of ACSS2 in cisplatin resistance was further confirmed by the abrogation of resistance by an ACSS2 inhibitor and, finally, by the higher expression of ACSS2 in the patient tissues with cisplatin resistance.

In mammalian cells the central precursor for lipid biosynthesis, cytosolic acetyl CoA (Ac-CoA), is produced by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) from mitochondria-derived citrate or by acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) from . It has been reported that ACLY is the primary enzyme involved in making cytosolic Ac-CoA in cells with abundant nutrients. However, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we have shown that ACLY is not essential for HCMV growth and virally induced . Instead, we found that in HCMV-infected cells glucose carbon can be used for lipid synthesis by both ACLY and ACSS2 reactions. Further, the ACSS2 reaction can compensate for the loss of ACLY. However, in ACSS2-KO human fibroblasts both HCMV-induced  from glucose and viral growth were sharply reduced. This reduction suggests that glucose-derived  is being used to synthesize cytosolic Ac-CoA by ACSS2. Previous studies have not established a mechanism for the production of  directly from glucose metabolism.

Angus steers were assigned to 4 stocker cattle production systems in 2 consecutive years: 1) 1.0 kg/d of 40% CP cottonseed meal–based supplement while grazing dormant native range (CON), 2) ground corn/soybean meal–based supplement while grazing dormant native range fed at 1% of BW (CORN), 3) grazing wheat pasture at a high stocking rate to achieve a low rate of BW gain (LGWP), and 4) grazing wheat pasture at a low stocking rate for a high rate of BW gain (HGWP). Eight ruminally cannulated steers were used to determine rumen fermentation characteristics. Steers were harvested during the stocker phase at similar age (different carcass weight) in Exp. 1 (3 steers/treatment) or at similar carcass weight in Exp. 2 (4 steers/treatment). Adipose tissues were analyzed for mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose (solute carrier family 2, member 4 [GLUT4], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PDH], phosphofructokinase, muscle [PFKM], and pyruvate kinase 2, muscle [PK2]), lactate (lactate dehydrogenase B [LDHB]), and  (acetyl-CoA synthetase, cytosol [ACSS2]) utilization for fatty acid synthesis. The :propionate ratio was least (P < 0.05) for HGWP steers, intermediate for CORN and LGWP steers, and greatest for CON steers. At similar age, LGWP and HGWP steers tended (F-test; P < 0.15) to have greater (P < 0.10) G6PDH and ACSS2 mRNA expression than CON and CORN steers in SC and PR but not IM adipose tissue. Expression of PFKM and PK2 mRNA tended (F-test; P < 0.15) to be greater (P < 0.10) in HGWP than CON and LGWP steers in IM but not SC or PR adipose tissue. At similar HCW, expression of GLUT4 and G6PDH mRNA were greater (P < 0.10) in SC adipose tissue of LGWP and HGWP steers compared with CON and CORN steers but not in IM and PR adipose tissue. Expression of LDHB mRNA was lesser (P < 0.10) in SC adipose tissue but greater (P < 0.10) in PR adipose tissue of LGWP and HGWP steers compared with CON and CORN steers. These results indicate a shift toward glucose utilization in SC adipose tissue but a shift towards lactate utilization in PR adipose tissue.

Recent advances in this field reveal a possible relationship between the compositional pattern of gut microbiota and genesis of obesity. Several study results have shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, microbiota-induced fermentation products) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, an integral component of Gram negative microorganisms) play the key role in linking the two. Though several SCFAs are produced as microbiota-fermentation products, three of them, i.e., butyrate, propionate and  have been found to be definitely involved in obesity; though individually they are neither purely obesogenic nor antiobesogenic. Out of these, butyrate and propionate are predominantly antiobesogenic. Butyrate, though a major energy source for colonocytes, has been found to increase mitochondrial activity, prevent metabolic endotoxemia, improve insulin sensitivity, possess anti-inflammatory potential, increase intestinal barrier function and protect against diet-induced obesity without causing hypophagia. Propionate has been found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, thereby antagonizing the cholesterol increasing action of , and to inhibit the expression of resistin in adipocytes. Moreover, both these SCFAs have been found to cause weight regulation through their stimulatory effect on anorexigenic gut hormones and to increase the synthesis of leptin. Unlike butyrate and propionate, , which is substantially absorbed, shows more obesogenic potential, as it acts as a substrate for hepatic and adipocyte . High fat diet increases the absorption of LPS, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with metabolic endotoxemia and to induce inflammation resulting in obesity.

They are used in preparation of herbal decoction and teas, which have been used traditionally to reduce body weight and for its effect on metabolic syndrome.To investigate the anti adipogenic efficacy of major fraction from ethyl  extract of the Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower at 25 and 50 µg/mL (HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL) in 3T3-L1 cells and delineate its possible mechanism of action.Pre adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence and absence of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL, their lipid accumulation was measured qualitatively by Oil red O staining and quantitatively by triglyceride estimation. Effect on adipolysis was determined, adipogenic and its regulatory gene and protein expression were studied and effect of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL on AMPK was confirmed in the presence of dorsomorphin.Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was found to alleviate triglyceride accumulation significantly (p < 0.001) by 1.6 and 2.3 times respectively in pre adipocytes during differentiation. HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also nonsignificantly reduced lipolysis which releases free fatty acids, a major contributing factor for insulin resistance. Activation of AMPK by phosphorylation has led to reduced gene and protein expression of adipogenic factors Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), CCAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), Sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and their targets Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Perilipin and enhanced Adiponectin expression. Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also resulted in inactivation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, which reduced the levels of malonyl-CoA an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Enhanced CPT1 levels causes induction of fatty acid β- oxidation. Effects of HRF were nullified in the presence of AMPK antagonist dorsomorphin.In summary, HRF treatments reduced , enhanced factors regulating fatty acid oxidation and this is mediated by AMPK activation. The results conclusively showed anti-obesity potential of HRF and it might be helpful in treatment of associated complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, glucose uptake and utilization is important for adipose tissue development in beef cattle, and increasing glucose utilization in intramuscular adipose tissue can increase carcass quality. Research from the 1980s demonstrated a lack of insulin sensitivity in isolated bovine adipocytes and adipose tissue explants incubated in vitro. Insulin did not stimulate glucose or  incorporation into fatty acids, nor did it increase concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in bovine adipose tissue incubated with exogenous glucose. Specific binding of [I] iodoinsulin and insulin degradation in bovine isolated adipocytes was low to non-detectable. These early studies indicated that insulin-dependent receptor-mediated signaling was less important in bovine adipose tissue than in adipose tissues of humans, swine, or laboratory species. More recent research demonstrated that glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) expression in muscle and adipose tissue declines markedly after birth in calves, indicating the development of insulin resistance as cattle transition from suckling to functional ruminants. Insulin resistance is important in dairy cattle, causing ketosis and fatty liver. Consistent with this, subcutaneous adipose tissue expression decreases 50% following parturition in dairy cattle, although expression of genes associated with insulin responsiveness (, , and ) is up-regulated by 21 d postpartum. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance in beef and dairy cattle would increase animal health and thereby improve productivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460516>Second-generation antipsychotics and metabolism alterations: a systematic review of the role of the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Multiple drugs are known to induce metabolic malfunctions, among them second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The pathogenesis of such adverse effects is of multifactorial origin.We investigated whether SGAs drive dysbiosis, assessed whether gut microbiota alterations affect body weight and metabolic outcomes, and looked for the possible mechanism of metabolic disturbances secondary to SGA treatment in animal and human studies.A systematic literature search (PubMed/Medline/Embase/ClinicalTrials.gov/PsychInfo) was conducted from database inception until 03 July 2018 for studies that reported the microbiome and weight alterations in SGA-treated subjects.Seven articles reporting studies in mice (experiments = 8) and rats (experiments = 3) were included. Olanzapine was used in five and risperidone in six experiments. Only three articles (experiments = 4) in humans fit our criteria of using risperidone and mixed SGAs. The results confirmed microbiome alterations directly (rodent experiments = 5, human experiments = 4) or indirectly (rodent experiments = 4) with predominantly increased Firmicutes abundance relative to Bacteroidetes, as well as weight gain in rodents (experiments = 8) and humans (experiments = 4). Additionally, olanzapine administration was found to induce both metabolic alterations (adiposity, , plasma free fatty acid, and  levels increase) (experiments = 3) and inflammation (experiments = 2) in rodents, whereas risperidone suppressed the resting metabolic rate in rodents (experiments = 5) and elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, LDL, hs-CRP, antioxidant superoxide dismutase, and HOMA-IR in humans (experiment = 1). One rodent study suggested a gender-dependent effect of dysbiosis on body weight.Antipsychotic treatment-related microbiome alterations potentially result in body weight gain and metabolic disturbances.

Flax oil and soy oil were used as sources of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, respectively, either with or without α-tocopheryl . A total of 192 day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were used in a completely randomized design using isoenergetic and isonitrogenous experimental diets. Results showed that dietary flax oil significantly (p < 0.05) improved feed conversion ratio during 21-42 days of age. However, body weight gain did not significantly differ among the experimental groups in entire trial. Birds received flax oil had significantly higher serum concentration of nitric oxide (NO) but they had lower serum concentration of malondialdehyde when compared with their counterparts fed with soy oil. Liver and abdominal fat weights were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by substitution of soy oil for flax oil. The right-to-total ventricle weight ratio (RV/TV) and mortality from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in birds that received flax oil.

Given that elevated fatty acid biosynthesis is a hallmark of many cancers and that these drugs can affect lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that BaP exerts anticancer effects by disrupting . We applied mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and gene and protein expression measurements of key lipogenic enzymes [acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] to AML and eBL cell lines treated with BaP. BaP treatment decreased fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis from (13)C D-glucose. The proportion of phospholipid species with saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains was also decreased after treatment, whereas those with polyunsaturated chains increased. BaP decreased SCD1 protein levels in each cell line (0.46- to 0.62-fold; P < 0.023) and decreased FASN protein levels across all cell lines (0.87-fold decrease; P = 1.7 × 10(-4)). Changes to ACC1 protein levels were mostly insignificant. Supplementation with the SCD1 enzymatic product, oleate, rescued AML and e-BL cells from BaP cell killing and decreased levels of BaP-induced reactive oxygen species, whereas supplementation with the SCD1 substrate (and FASN product), palmitate, did not rescue cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that the critical anticancer actions of BaP are decreases in SCD1 levels and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of action of G on cellular metabolism are largely unknown.We propose that G could be a potential agent for the treatment of hyperlipidemia that could contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to advance our understanding of its mechanism of action on cholesterol and TG metabolism.NIH mice received supplemented diets containing 25, 50, and 75 mmol G/kg chow. After a 3-week treatment, serum total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by commercial kits and lipid biosynthesis determined by the [(14)C]  incorporated into fatty acids plus nonsaponifiable and total hepatic lipids of the mice. The activity of the mRNA encoding HMGCR-the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis-along with the enzyme levels and catalysis were assessed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and HMG-CoA-conversion assays, respectively. In-silico analysis of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and regulated by G in cultured cells was also performed. Finally, the mRNA levels encoded by the genes for the low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), the sterol-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor (SREBF2), the very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA) were determined by real-time RT-PCR.Plasma total-cholesterol and triglyceride levels plus hepatic fatty-acid, total-lipid, and nonsaponifiable-lipid biosynthesis were significantly reduced by feeding with G. Even though an up-regulation of the mRNA encoding HMGCR occurred in the G treated mouse livers, the protein levels and specific activity of the enzyme were both inhibited. G also enhanced the mRNAs encoding the LDL and VLDL receptors and reduced ACACA mRNA, without altering the transcription of the mRNA encoding the SREBF2.The following mechanisms may have mediated the decrease in plasma lipids levels in mice: a down-regulation of hepatocyte-cholesterol synthesis occurred as a result of decreased HMGCR protein levels and catalytic activity; the levels of LDLR mRNA became elevated, thus suggesting an increase in the uptake of serum LDL, especially by the liver; and TG synthesis became reduced very likely because of a decrease in fatty-acid synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

At baseline, d-lactate was positively correlated with DNL-area under the curve (AUC) (P = 0.003), liver fat fraction (P = 0.02), TG (P = 0.004), and TG/high-density lipoprotein ratio (P = 0.002). After 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction, serum d-lactate levels reduced by 50% (P < 0.0001), and changes in d-lactate correlated with both changes in DNL-AUC and measures of insulin sensitivity.Baseline correlation of d-lactate with DNL and measures of insulin sensitivity and reduction in d-lactate after 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction suggest that DNL and nonenzymatic glycation are functionally linked via intermediary glycolysis in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and point to fructose as a key dietary substrate that drives both pathways.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29409001>Glucose and  metabolism in bovine intramuscular and subcutaneous adipose tissues from steers infused with glucose, propionate, or .</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that abomasal infusion of glucose would promote de novo fatty acid biosynthesis from glucose in vitro in bovine intramuscular (i.m.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissues to a greater extent than ruminal infusion of , propionate, or glucose. Angus crossbred steers (n = 24), 22 mo of age, were fitted with ruminal cannulas, and steers were adapted to another corn/sorghum finishing diet over a 2-wk period while recovering from the placement of the cannulas. After the adaptation period, the steers were fed the second finishing diet at 130% of their voluntary intake and were infused with isocaloric amounts (3.76 Mcal/d) of glucose, propionate, or  for 35 d.

Being the major isoform of glucose transporter in adipose tissue, regulations of insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking have always been of research interest. The present study aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of curculigoside and polyphenol-rich ethyl  fraction (EAF) of Molineria latifolia rhizome in triggering glucose uptake. We assessed the adipogenic potential and glucose uptake stimulatory activity of curculigoside and EAF by employing a murine 3T3-L1 adipocyte model. The transcriptional and translational expressions of selected intermediates in the insulin signalling pathway were evaluated. While curculigoside neither promoted  nor activated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, treatment with polyphenol-rich EAF resulted otherwise. However, both treatments enhanced insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose. This was coupled with increased availability of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane of the differentiated adipocytes although the total GLUT4 protein level was unaffected. In addition, the treatment increased the phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR, which have been reported to be associated with GLUT4 translocation. The present findings proposed that curculigoside and EAF increased glucose transport activity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via GLUT4 translocation as a result of potential mTOR/AKT activation. The more potent efficacy observed with EAF suggested potential synergistic and multi-targeted action.Copyright © 2018.

Aerobic glycolysis may or may not coincide with changes in lipid metabolism, resulting in combinatorial metabolic phenotypes that may have different prognostic or therapeutic implications. Consequently, PET imaging using dual metabolic tracers, in addition to being diagnostically superior to imaging with individual tracers, could eventually play a greater role in supporting precision medicine, as efforts to develop small-molecule metabolic pathway inhibitors are coming to fruition.

PEMT expression is strongly induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hence, we hypothesized that white adipose tissue (WAT) might be a key player in the protection against DIO in Pemt(-/-) mice. We fed Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice the HFD for 2 weeks, after which we examined adipocyte differentiation,  and lipolysis in WAT. Pemt(-/-) mice gained less body weight, had reduced WAT mass and had smaller adipocytes than Pemt(+/+) mice. The protein levels of adipose differentiation markers FABP4, PPARγ and C/EBPβ were not altered by genotype, but acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression and activation was reduced in the Pemt(-/-) mice. The in vivo conversion of [¹⁴C] to [¹⁴C]TG in WAT was also lower in Pemt(-/-) mice. The release of glycerol from WAT explants was comparable between Pemt(+/+) and Pemt(-/-) mice under basal condition and in the presence of isoproterenol, indicating unaffected lipolytic capacity. Furthermore, the amounts of leptin, cytokines and chemokines in WAT were not altered by genotype in mice fed the HFD for 2 weeks. However, after 10 weeks of HFD, WAT from Pemt(-/-) mice had dramatically lower leptin, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES), and significantly higher anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 than Pemt(+/+) mice. Together, our data show that PEMT deficiency did not affect the capability for differentiation and lipolysis in WAT.

We present an explanation for our finding that DGKε MEFs exhibited greater uptake of H-glycerol into the cell and a greater incorporation into lipids compared with their WT counterparts, with no change in the relative amounts of various lipids between the DGKε and WT MEFs. Glycerol kinase is more highly expressed in the DGKε cells than in their WT counterparts. In addition, the activity of glycerol kinase is greater in the DGKε cells than in their WT counterparts. Other substrates that enter the cell independent of glycerol kinase, such as pyruvate or , are incorporated into lipid to the same extent between DGKε and WT cell lines. We also show that expression of p53, a transcription factor that increases the synthesis of glycerol kinase, is increased in DGKε MEFs in comparison to WT cells. We conclude that the increased incorporation of glycerol into lipids in DGKε cells is a consequence of up-regulation of glycerol kinase and not a result of an increase in the rate of lipid synthesis. Furthermore, increased expression of the pro-survival gene, p53, in cells knocked out for DGKε suggests that cells over-expressing DGKε would have a greater propensity to become tumorigenic.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The measurements were performed in rats adapted to 27°C, which were acutely subjected to cold (10°C) for 2 and 6 hours, and in rats chronically adapted to 10°C for 21 days, which were returned to 27°C for 2 and 6 hours. Cold exposure (acutely and chronically) led to increases in BAT oxidative activity, which was accompanied by concomitant increases in glucose and NEFA uptake. The increases were particularly high in cold-adapted rats and largely readily reduced by the return to a warm environment. The cold-induced increase in oxidative activity was meaningfully blunted by nicotinic acid, a lipolysis inhibitor, which emphasizes in vivo the key role of intracellular lipid in BAT thermogenesis. The changes in BAT oxidative activity and glucose and NEFA uptakes were paralleled by inductions of genes involved in not only oxidative metabolism but also in energy substrate replenishment (triglyceride and glycogen synthesis). The capacity of BAT for energy substrate replenishment is remarkable.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348600>Chinese olive extract ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo by regulating lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Chinese olive contains plenty of polyphenols, which possess a wide range of biological actions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl  fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of fatty acid transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and  genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited body weight gain, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of fatty acid transporter, , and fatty acid oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet.

Hepatic de novo  is one of the main causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is thought to be a hepatic manifestation of certain metabolic syndromes. However, it has not yet been reported if CA has any therapeutic value in these diseases. Here, we investigated whether CA can inhibit hepatic  induced by liver X receptor α (LXRα) using an in vitro model. We found that the extract and ethyl acetated layer of CW decreased the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which plays a crucial role in hepatic . Additionally, we observed that CA could suppress the level of SREBP-1c, which was increased using two commercial LXRα agonists, GW3954 and T0901317. Moreover, the enzymes that act downstream of SREBP-1c were also inhibited by CA treatment. To understand the mechanism underlying this effect, the levels of phosphorylated AMP kinase (pAMPK) were measured after CA treatment. Therefore, CA might increase the pAMPK level by inducing phosphorylation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which can then convert AMPK to pAMPK. Taken together, we conclude that CA has an alleviative effect on hepatic  through the stimulation of the LKB1/AMPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251955> as a Metabolic and Epigenetic Modifier of Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Metabolic networks are significantly altered in neoplastic cells. This altered metabolic program leads to increased glycolysis and  and decreased dependence on oxidative phosphorylation and oxygen consumption. Despite their limited mitochondrial respiration, cancer cells, nonetheless, derive sufficient energy from alternative carbon sources and metabolic pathways to maintain cell proliferation. They do so, in part, by utilizing fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies, and , in addition to glucose. The alternative pathways used in the metabolism of these carbon sources provide opportunities for therapeutic manipulation. , in particular, has garnered increased attention in the context of cancer as both an epigenetic regulator of posttranslational protein modification, and as a carbon source for cancer cell biomass accumulation. However, to date, the data have not provided a clear understanding of the precise roles that protein acetylation and  oxidation play in carcinogenesis, cancer progression or treatment. This review highlights some of the major issues, discrepancies, and opportunities associated with the manipulation of  metabolism and acetylation-based signaling in cancer development and treatment.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27879277>Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 promotes metabolic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Reprogramming of intracellular metabolism is common in liver cancer cells. Understanding the mechanisms of cell metabolic reprogramming may present a new basis for liver cancer treatment. In our previous study, we reported that a novel oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) promotes tumorigenesis under hypoxic condition. Here, we aim to investigate the role of EIF5A2 in cell metabolic reprogramming during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. In this study, we reported that the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of EIF5A2 was upregulated in 59 of 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), and EIF5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression of EIF5A2 in HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth and accelerated glucose utilization and  rates. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion conferred by EIF5A2 revealed an abnormal activity of aerobic glycolysis in HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved in glycolysis including glucose transporter type 1 and 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase liver type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A were upregulated by overexpression of EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations with FASN and ACSS2, two key enzymes involved in the fatty acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, at both protein and mRNA levels in HCC. These results indicated that EIF5A2 may regulate fatty acid de novo biosynthesis by increasing the uptake of . In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EIF5A2 has a critical role in HCC cell metabolic reprogramming and may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment.© The Author 2016.

In vivo experiment performed using binge alcohol consumption model.Although all five fractions (0-1000 µg/mL) were non-cytotoxic to HepG2 cells, only ethyl  fraction (SQEA), rich in phenolic acids such as p-coumaric acid and flavonoids particularly myristin, showed hepatoprotective effect against EtOH (400 mM) in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, SQEA significantly decreased the ethanol induced cell death and enhanced the cell proliferation. In in vivo experiment using binge consumption model (5 g of EtOH/kg body weight in every 12 h for 3 times), SQEA treatment (10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) markedly reduced the alcohol induced histopathological changes and serum EtOH content, and reversed the reduction of glutathione level in ethanol challenged livers. Further, it suppressed the expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). In particular, SQEA activated AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), which attenuated  via decreased expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Inhibited  due to SQEA treatment directed towards decreased perilipin-2 expression. These results indicate that SQEA has hypolipidemic effect which is mediated by decreased oxidative stress, increased fatty acid oxidation response and decreased .Our results suggest the possibility of developing SQEA as a natural hepatoprotective agent potent in attenuating alcohol-induced fatty liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Alterations in the adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may contribute to the adipose tissue remodeling associated with metabolic syndrome and impact the regional distribution of adipose tissue by generating inherently dysfunctional adipocytes. Here we examine the expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes and their relationship with the lipogenic, antioxidant and oxidative potential of adipocytes generated from visceral ASCs (adipo-visASCs) and subcutaneous ASCs (adipo-subASCs) from subjects with different metabolic profiles.Paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed to isolate the respective ASCs from normal-weight (Nw) subjects and obese patients with metabolic syndrome (METS) and without METS (NonMETS). qPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of the genes studied in both adipo-ASCs from the patient groups and those generated after silencing by small interfering RNA of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes. The accumulation of lipids was quantified by absorbance.No significant differences in cell yield or CD34CD31CD45 ASC percentage were observed between the different patient groups. Unlike adipo-visASCs, adipo-subASCs from METS patients showed a decrease in expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes as well as proteins linked to , antioxidant defense and fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional silencing of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes in adipo-subASCs reduced lipid accumulation and affected transcription levels of lipogenic and antioxidant defense proteins.Adipo-subASCs may be more susceptible than adipo-visASCs to deterioration of the lipogenic, oxidative and antioxidant potential associated with metabolic syndrome. Intrinsic alterations in transcription levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of adipo-subASCs from METS patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the roles of OC compounds in the development of NAFLD has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if exposure to trans-nonachlor, a prevalent OC compound, could promote hepatocyte lipid accumulation and determine potential pro-steatotic mechanisms. McArdle-RH7777 (McA) hepatoma cells were incubated with trans-nonachlor for 24 h then neutral lipid accumulation was determined by Oil Red O staining. Exposure to trans-nonachlor produced a concentration dependent increase in neutral lipid accumulation. Trans-nonachlor also increased extracellular free fatty acid-induced neutral lipid accumulation which appears to be due at least in part to increased free fatty acid accumulation as evident by increased accumulation of Bodipy labeled dodecanoic acid. Additionally, C- incorporation into total cellular lipids was increased by trans-nonachlor implicating increased de novo  (DNL) as a potential mediator of trans-nonachlor-induced neutral lipid accumulation. Taken together, the present data indicate exposure to trans-nonachlor has a direct, pro-steatotic effect on hepatocytes to increase lipid accumulation through the combinatorial actions of extracellular free fatty acid accumulation and increased DNL.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Since it is not clear whether modulation of one step in the lipogenic pathway is more important than another, the use of tracer methods can provide a deeper level of insight regarding the control of metabolic activity. Although [H]water is generally considered a reliable tracer for quantifying DNL in vivo (it yields a homogenous and quantifiable precursor labeling), the relatively long half-life of body water is thought to limit the ability of performing repeat studies in the same subjects; this can create a bottleneck in the development and evaluation of novel therapeutics for inhibiting DNL. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to perform back-to-back studies of DNL using [H]water. However, this work uncovered special circumstances that affect the data interpretation, i.e., it is possible to obtain seemingly negative values for DNL. Using a rodent model, we have identified a physiological mechanism that explains the data.

Here we have studied the role of kodo millet supplementation in age matched Swiss albino mice that were randomly divided into groups and fed their respective diets for 16 weeks. A high fat diet increased weight gain, reduced glucose tolerance, increased serum lipids, altered hepatic and adipocyte gene expression and caused dysbiosis in the intestinal beneficial bacteria. Kodo millet supplementation did not affect weight gain but it improved glucose tolerance and prevented an increase in the serum cholesterol and lipid parameters (P ≤ 0.05), modulated  related gene expression, decreased serum IL-6 and LPS levels (P ≤ 0.05), promoted selected beneficial gut bacterial abundances (Lactobacillus sp., Bifidobacteria, Akkermansia and Roseburia spp.) and improved the total short chain fatty acid production (P ≤ 0.05) and  levels (P ≤ 0.05) in cecal contents.

This study examines the anti-adipogenic and pro-apoptotic effect of red pepper seed water extract (RPS) prepared at 4℃ (RPS4) in 3T3-L1 cells.Effect of RPS4 or its fractions on lipid accumulation was determined in 3T3-L1 cells using oil red O (ORO) staining. The expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adipogenic associated proteins [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α (C/EBP α), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)] were measured in 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4. Apoptosis and the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 family proteins [B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), Bcl-2 like protein 4 (Bax), Bal-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak)] were measured in mature 3T3-L1 cells treated with RPS4.Treatment of RPS4 (0-75 µg/mL) or its fractions (0-50 µg/mL) for 24 h did not have an apparent cytotoxicity on pre and mature 3T3-L1 cells. RPS4 significantly suppressed differentiation and cellular lipid accumulation by increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK and reducing the expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBP α, SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC. In addition, all fractions except ethyl  fraction significantly suppressed cellular lipid accumulation. RPS4 induced the apoptosis of mature adipocytes by hypophosphorylating Akt, increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak, Bax, and Bad, and reducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and p-Bad.These finding suggest that RPS4 can reduce the numbers as well as the size of adipocytes and might useful for preventing and treating obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo  in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo  (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C - IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250162>Changes in body composition and mRNA expression of ghrelin and lipoprotein lipase in rats treated with leuprolide , a GnRH agonist.</a></h2><p>Leuprolide  (LA), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, was identified to cause changes in body weight in experimental and clinical trials; however, to date, the effect of LA on the body composition has not been properly assessed.

Regulation of lipid metabolism involves fatty acid synthesis from  and β-adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin in adipocytes. Although basic mechanisms of mobilizing fat storage in transition cows are understood, we lack a sufficiently detailed understanding to declare the exact regulatory network of these in a broad range of dairy cattle. The objective of the present study was to quantify 1) protein abundance of fatty acid synthase (FAS), 2) extent of phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin in vivo, and 3) β-adrenergic stimulated lipolytic response of adipose tissues in vitro at different stages of the periparturient period. We fed 20 German Holstein cows an energy-dense or an energetically adequate diet prepartum and 0 or 24 g/d nicotinic acid (NA) supplementation. Biopsy samples of subcutaneous and retroperitoneal adipose tissue were obtained at d 42 prepartum (d -42) and at d 1, 21, and 100 postpartum (d +1, d +21, d +100, respectively). To assess β-adrenergic response, tissue samples were incubated with 1 μ isoproterenol for 90 min at 37°C. The NEFA and glycerol release, as well as HSL and perilipin phosphorylation, was measured as indicators of in vitro stimulated lipolysis. In addition, protein expression of FAS and extent of HSL and perilipin phosphorylation were measured in fresh, nonincubated samples. There was no effect of dietary energy density or NA on the observed variables. The extent of HSL and perilipin phosphorylation under isoproterenol stimulation was strongly correlated with the release of NEFA and glycerol, consistent with the functional link between β-adrenergic-stimulated protein phosphorylation and lipolysis. In the nonincubated samples, FAS protein expression was decreased at d +1 and d +21, whereas HSL and perilipin phosphorylation increased from d -42 to d +1 and remained at an increased level throughout the first 100 d of lactation. In vitro lipolytic response was significant in prepartum samples at times when in vivo lipolysis was only minimally activated by phosphorylation.

Here, we report that T2, administered for 1 week to hypothyroid rats, increases total fatty acid synthesis from  in isolated hepatocytes. Studies carried out on liver subcellular fractions demonstrated that T2 not only increases the activity and the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase but also of other proteins linked to DNL such as the mitochondrial citrate carrier and the cytosolic ATP citrate lyase. Parallelly, T2 stimulates the activities of enzymes supplying cytosolic NADPH needed for the reductive steps of DNL. With respect to both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats, T2 administration decreases the hepatic mRNA level of SREBP-1, a transcription factor which represents a master regulator of DNL. However, when compared to hypothyroid rats T2 significantly increases, without bringing to the euthyroid value, the content of both mature (nSREBP-1), and precursor (pSREBP-1) forms of the SREBP-1 protein as well as their ratio. Moreover, T2 administration strongly augmented the nuclear content of ChREBP, another crucial transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. Based on these results, we can conclude that in the liver of hypothyroid rats the transcriptional activation by T2 of DNL genes could depend, at least in part, on SREBP-1- and ChREBP-dependent mechanisms.© 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679516>STC1 and PTHrP Modify Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Liver of a Teleost Fish.</a></h2><p>Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) are calciotropic hormones in vertebrates.

Proposed mechanisms on how the gut microbiota could contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases include: (1) improved energy extraction from diet by the conversion of dietary fibre to SCFA; (2) increased intestinal permeability for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in response to the consumption of high-fat diets resulting in an elevated systemic LPS level and low-grade inflammation. Animal studies indicate differences in the physiologic effects of fermentable and non-fermentable dietary fibres as well as differences in long- and short-term effects of fermentable dietary fibre. The human intestinal microbiome is enriched in genes involved in the degradation of indigestible polysaccharides. The extent to which dietary fibres are fermented and in which molar ratio SCFA are formed depends on their physicochemical properties and on the individual microbiome.  and propionate play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism.  serves as a substrate for de novo  in liver, whereas propionate can be utilised for gluconeogenesis. The conversion of fermentable dietary fibre to SCFA provides additional energy to the host which could promote obesity. However, epidemiologic studies indicate that diets rich in fibre rather prevent than promote obesity development. This may be due to the fact that SCFA are also ligands of free fatty acid receptors (FFAR). Activation of FFAR leads to an increased expression and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones such as glucagon-like-peptide 1 or peptide YY which cause satiety. In conclusion, the role of SCFA in host energy balance needs to be re-evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26859303>Physiological Role of Gut Microbiota for Maintaining Human Health.</a></h2><p>The human body is colonized by an extremely complex and abundant aggregation of microbes, collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. Recent studies have focused on the link between these microbes and our health.Diet contributes to shaping the gut microbial structure and influences metabolic functions of the host. Alteration of the microbial structure and function (dysbiosis) is associated with the pathogenesis of various disorders. Fermentation is the process by which anaerobic bacteria (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) break down indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; , propionate and butyrate), collaborating with species specialized in oligosaccharide fermentation (e.g. Bifidobacteria). Butyrate and propionate can regulate intestinal physiology and immune function, while  acts as a substrate for  and gluconeogenesis. The gut microbiota regulates immune homeostasis via the induction of regulatory T cells and Th17 cells. In addition, butyrate has strong anti-inflammatory effects possibly through the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity.

Regional fat distribution and functioning may contribute to obesity-related metabolic disorders and adverse health outcomes. Specific fat depots are suggested to possess unique biological properties, but specific metabolic profiles of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain unknown. We aimed to characterize VAT and SAT glucose metabolism, and their correlation with body mass index (BMI). AT samples from patients (n = 12; F:M, 9:3) with a mean age of 46 years (26-83 years) and an average BMI of 29.6 kg/m (18-37 kg/m) were used. VAT and SAT explants were obtained during elective laparoscopy, either cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis or gastric bypass for severe obesity. Explants were placed in insulin-free cell culture media and their metabolic profile was established by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. AT explants display a glucose and pyruvate consumption and  production that is region-dependent according to the patients BMI. In VAT, glucose consumption was positively correlated with BMI, while alanine and lactate production were negatively correlated with BMI, whereas in SAT the patients BMI did not affect AT secretome suggesting that increased BMI promotes a metabolic reprogramming of VAT towards de novo . This region-dependent metabolic reprogramming of AT associated with BMI was autonomous of insulin. This data, although preliminary, suggests that there is a BMI-related remodeling of glucose metabolism in VAT. Targeting this BMI-induced metabolic shift may represent a potential target to counteract unwanted consequences derived from visceral adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28470676>Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibition reduces de novo  in overweight male subjects: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study.</a></h2><p>NDI-010976, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylases (ACC) ACC1 and ACC2, reduces hepatic de novo  (DNL) and favorably affects steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluating the pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of NDI-010976 on hepatic DNL in overweight and/or obese but otherwise healthy adult male subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive either NDI-010976 (20, 50, or 200 mg) or matching placebo in period 1, followed by the alternate treatment in period 2; and hepatic  was stimulated with oral fructose administration. Fractional DNL was quantified by infusing a stable isotope tracer, [1- C], and monitoring  C incorporation into palmitate of circulating very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride. Single-dose administration of NDI-010976 was well tolerated at doses up to and including 200 mg. Fructose administration over a 10-hour period stimulated hepatic fractional DNL an average of 30.9 ± 6.7% (mean ± standard deviation) above fasting DNL values in placebo-treated subjects. Subjects administered single doses of NDI-010976 at 20, 50, or 200 mg had significant inhibition of DNL compared to placebo (mean inhibition relative to placebo was 70%, 85%, and 104%, respectively). An inverse relationship between fractional DNL and NDI-010976 exposure was observed with >90% inhibition of fractional DNL associated with plasma concentrations of NDI-010976 >4 ng/mL.ACC inhibition with a single dose of NDI-010976 is well tolerated and results in a profound dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic DNL in overweight adult male subjects. Therefore, NDI-010976 could contribute considerable value to the treatment algorithm of metabolic disorders characterized by dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

We aimed to investigate the independent role of circulating glucose, NEFA and insulin on glucose and NEFA uptake, and  in skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT).Twenty-two pigs were stratified according to four protocols: 1) and 2) low NEFA + high insulin ± high glucose (hyperinsulinaemia-hyperglycaemia or hyperinsulinaemia-euglycaemia), 3) high NEFA + low insulin (fasting), 4) low NEFA + low insulin (nicotinic acid). Positron emission tomography with [F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and [C], was combined with [C] and [U-C]palmitate enrichment techniques to assess glucose and lipid metabolism. Hyperinsulinaemia increased glucose extraction, whilst hyperglycaemia enhanced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and SCAT. In SCAT, during hyperglycaemia, elevated glucose uptake was accompanied by greater [U-C]palmitate-TG enrichment compared to the other groups, and by a 39% increase in de novo  (DNL) compared to baseline, consistent with a 70% increment in plasma lipogenic index. Conversely, in skeletal muscle, [U-C]palmitate-TG enrichment was higher after prolonged fasting.Our data show the necessary role of hyperglycaemia-hyperinsulinaemia vs euglycaemia-hyperinsulinaemia in promoting expansion of TG stores in SCAT, by the consensual elevation in plasma NEFA and glucose uptake and DNL. In contrast, skeletal muscle NEFA uptake for TG synthesis is primarily driven by circulating NEFA levels. These results suggest that a) prolonged fasting or dietary regimens enhancing lipolysis might promote muscle steatosis, and b) the control of glucose levels, in association with adequate energy balance, might contribute to weight loss.Copyright © 2017 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

In this study we show by in vivo administration of locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitors that suppression of endogenous miR-29 lowers plasma cholesterol levels by ~40%, commensurate with the effect of statins, and reduces fatty acid content in the liver by ~20%. Whole transcriptome sequencing of the liver reveals 883 genes dysregulated (612 down, 271 up) by inhibition of miR-29. The set of 612 down-regulated genes are most significantly over-represented in lipid synthesis pathways. Among the up-regulated genes are the anti-lipogenic deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and the anti-lipogenic transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), the latter of which we demonstrate is a direct target of miR-29. In vitro radiolabeled  incorporation assays confirm that pharmacologic inhibition of miR-29 significantly reduces de novo cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Our findings indicate that miR-29 controls hepatic lipogenic programs, likely in part through regulation of Ahr and Sirt1, and therefore may represent a candidate therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27392615>Malignant  defined by C- PET/CT predicts prostate cancer-specific survival in patients with biochemical relapse after prostatectomy.</a></h2><p>Malignant de novo  is strongly linked to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) under experimental conditions. C- PET/CT is a potential noninvasive biomarker of malignant  in PCa, but its prognostic value is not known. The objective of this study was to analyse C- PET/CT image metrics in relation to survival.All patients undergoing C- PET/CT in one university hospital from 2005 to 2011 due to PSA relapse after previous prostatectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Two groups of patients were compared: those who died from PCa and those who were censored. All previously reported findings of local recurrence, regional or distal lymph node metastases and bone metastases were counted and evaluated regarding C- uptake intensity (SUV) and tumour volume. Total tumour volume and total lipogenic activity (TLA, summed SUV × TV) were calculated. Survival analysis in the entire study population was followed by Cox proportional hazards ratio (HR) analysis.A total of 121 patients were included, and 22 PCa-specific deaths were recorded. The mean PSA level at the time of PET was 2.69 ± 4.35 ng/mL. The median follow-up of the study population was 79 ± 28 months. PET identified at least one PCa lesion in 53 % of patients. Five-year PCa-specific survival after PET was 80 % and 100 % in patients with a positive and a negative PET scan, respectively (p < 0.001). Time-to-death was linearly correlated with highest SUV (r = -0.55, p = 0.01) and nonlinearly with TLA (r = -0.75, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed statistical significance for number of bone metastases (HR 1.74, p = 0.01), tertile of TLA (HR 5.63, p = 0.029) and postoperative Gleason score (HR 1.84, p = 0.045).Malignant C- accumulation measured with PET/CT is a strong predictor of survival in the setting of PSA relapse after prostatectomy. The study provides further evidence for a quantitative relationship between malignant de novo  and early death. C- PET/CT might be useful for identifying a high-risk population of relapsing patients in which therapies targeting malignant  might be of particular benefit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352773>Anti-adipogenic effect of flavonoids from Chromolaena odorata leaves in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The leaves of Chromolaena odorata, a highly invasive shrub found growing wild worldwide, are traditionally used for wound healing. Due to its high flavonoid contents, we aimed to find a new application for this plant. Preliminary tests using its ethanolic leaf extract showed that it could suppress the accumulation of lipids in adipocytes. We therefore studied the anti-adipogenic effect of several C. odorata leaf extracts and the relationship between molecular structure and bio-activity of its isolated flavonoid constituents using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes/adipocytes as a model.Three leaf extracts and thirteen flavonoids isolated from C. odorata were tested for their effect on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using AdipoRed reagent, with quercetin as the positive control. The effects of active flavonoids on the adipocytes were confirmed by oil red O staining and visualized under a light microscope.n-Hexane and ethyl  extracts of C. odorata leaves displayed anti-adipogenic activity. The latter extract was the more potent one, especially at 40 µg/mL. Four flavonoids, pectolinarigenin, kaempferide, 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone and dillenetin, exhibited significant, concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The most potent flavonoid obtained in this study was 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone, which caused 75% and 90% inhibition of cellular lipid accumulation at 30 and 50 µmol/L, respectively. Both kaempferide and 4,2'-dihydroxy-4',5',6'-trimethoxychalcone were major constituents in the ethyl  extract of this plant.C. odorata leaves contained several flavonoids with anti-adipogenic effects against lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

The pathogenesis of acne is very complex, involving the increase of sebum production and perifollicular inflammation. In this study, we screened the anti-lipogenic material and demonstrated its effect using cultured human sebocytes.Normal human sebocytes were cultured by explanting the sebaceous glands. To evaluate the anti-lipogenic effect, sebocytes were treated with test materials and (14)C- incorporation assay was performed.To screen the anti-lipogenic materials, we tested the effect of many herbal plant extracts. We found that Angelica dahurica extract inhibited the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced sebum production in terms of squalene synthesis in sebocytes. Furthermore, imperatorin isolated from A. dahurica showed remarkable inhibitory effect on squalene production as well as squalene synthase promoter activity. To investigate the putative action mechanism, we tested the effect of imperatorin on intracellular signaling. The results showed that imperatorin inhibited IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, imperatorin significantly down-regulated PPAR-γ and SREBP-1, the important transcription factors for lipid synthesis.These results suggest that imperatorin has a potential for reducing sebum production in sebocytes, and can be applicable for acne treatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Constitutively active Acc1 ( ) or a deletion of the Acc1 negative regulator, Snf1 (yeast AMPK), shows elevated autophagy levels, which can be reversed by the Acc1 inhibitor soraphen A. Vice versa, pharmacological inhibition of Acc1 drastically reduces cell survival and results in the accumulation of Atg8-positive structures at the vacuolar membrane, suggesting late defects in the autophagic cascade. As expected,  cells exhibit a reduction in /acetyl-CoA availability along with elevated cellular lipid content.

However, isolating RNA from milk would be a useful and cost-effective technique that may avoid distress to the animal and facilitate the collection of samples in time series experiments. This assay was therefore conducted to test the hypothesis that RNA extracted from milk somatic cells (MSC) in dairy sheep would be a feasible alternative to the performance of MT biopsies for nutrigenomic analyses. To meet this objective, 8 lactating Assaf ewes were divided in 2 groups and offered a total mixed ration without supplementation (control) or supplemented with 2.4% dry matter of fish oil, which was known not only to elicit milk fat depression but also to downregulate the expression of some candidate genes involved in mammary . Total RNA was extracted from MSC and biopsied MT to examine whether the potential changes in the abundance of transcripts was similarly detected with both RNA sources. Milk fatty acid profile was also analyzed by gas chromatography, and variations in mRNA abundance were determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Values of RNA integrity number were always ≥7.7. The expected and designed decrease of milk fat concentration with fish oil (-29%), was associated with a lower transcript abundance of genes coding for enzymes involved in fatty acid activation (ACSS1), de novo synthesis (ACACA and FASN), uptake from plasma lipids (LPL), and esterification of fatty acids to glycerol (LPIN1), as well as of a transcription factor that may regulate their expression (INSIG1). Stable mRNA levels were showed in other candidate genes, such as FABP3, GPAT4, or SCD. Changes due to the dietary treatment were similarly detected with both RNA sources (MSC and MT biopsies), which supports the initial hypothesis and would validate the use of milk as an alternative RNA source for nutrigenomic analyses in dairy sheep.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the protective effects of  leaf extract on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  and . In this study, the effects of  leaf extract on inhibiting the free fatty acid (FFA)-induced accumulation of fat in HepG2 cells and on improving fatty liver syndrome in mice with high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD were investigated. For the  assay, HepG2 cells were treated with FFAs (oleate/palmitate = 2:1) with or without treatment with  leaf ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction to observe lipid accumulation using Nile red and oil red O stains. For the  assay, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to three groups ( = 5), including the normal diet group, the HFD group and the HFD+EtOAc group. After 11 weeks, body weight, serum biochemical indices and the mRNA expressions of the liver tissue, as well as the outward appearance, weight and histopathological analysis of liver and adipose tissues were evaluated. Among the fractions derived from  leaf, the EtOAc fraction exhibited a strong fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Following reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), four specific phytochemicals, including (2, 3)-astilbin (AS), hyposide (HY), guaijaverin (GU) and quercitrin (QU), were isolated and identified from the EtOAc fraction of  leaf extract. Among them, AS and HY showed excellent fat-accumulation inhibitory activity. Thus, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf and its derived phytochemicals have great potential in preventing FFA-induced fat accumulation. In addition, the EtOAc fraction of  leaf significantly improved fatty liver syndrome and reduced total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in HFD-induced NAFLD mice at a dosage of 200 mg/kg BW. These results demonstrated that the methanolic extracts from  leaf have excellent inhibitory activities against fat accumulation and anti-NAFLD activities and thus have great potential as a natural health product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28832233>Bioactivity-guided isolation and identification of anti-adipogenic compounds from Sanguisorba officinalis.</a></h2><p>Sanguisorba officinalis Linne (Rosaceae) is a medicinal plant used traditionally for the treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases in Korea, China, and Japan.

The cytotoxicity of each fraction and isolated compound was tested using MTT assay (with 25-300 μg/mL test material). Structures of the isolated active compounds were elucidated using H NMR, C NMR, HSQC, HMBC, FT-IR, and MS.An active ethyl  fraction obtained with solvent partition of the extract inhibited lipid accumulation (44.84%) on 3T3-L1 cells without cytotoxicity (102.3%) at the concentration of 50 μg/mL. The ethyl  fraction was determined to be mainly composed by isorhamnetin-3-O-d-glucuronide (1) and ellagic acid (2). Pure isorhamnetin-3-O-d-glucuronide (IC is 18.43 μM) and ellagic acid (IC is 19.32 μM) showed lipid accumulation inhibition on 3T3-L1 cells without cytotoxicity (117.5% and 104.3%) at the concentration of 20 μM, respectively.These results suggested that S. officinalis is a potential natural ingredient for the prevention of obesity, which may due to bioactive compounds such as isorhamnetin-3-O-d-glucuronide and ellagic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558206>Dose-dependent quantitative effects of acute fructose administration on hepatic de novo  in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>Fructose feeding increases hepatic de novo  (DNL) and is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

In this three-period crossover study, 17 healthy male subjects were enrolled to evaluate the within- and between-subject variability of acute fructose feeding on hepatic fractional DNL. During each assessment, [1-C] was infused to measure DNL in the fasting state and during fructose feeding. Subjects randomly received a high dose of fructose (10 mg·kg fat-free mass·min) on two occasions and a low dose (5 mg·kg fat-free mass·min) on another. Fructose solutions were administered orally every 30 min for 9.5 h. Ten subjects completed all three study periods. DNL was assessed as the fractional contribution of newly synthesized palmitate into very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides using mass isotopomer distribution analysis. Mean fasting DNL was 5.3 ± 2.8%, with significant within- and between-subject variability. DNL increased dose dependently during fructose feeding to 15 ± 2% for low- and 29 ± 2% for high-dose fructose. The DNL response to high-dose fructose was very reproducible within an individual ( r = 0.93, P < 0.001) and independent of fasting DNL. However, it was variable between individuals and significantly correlated to influx of unlabeled acetyl-CoA ( r = 0.7, P < 0.001).

Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C- label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo  in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice.
