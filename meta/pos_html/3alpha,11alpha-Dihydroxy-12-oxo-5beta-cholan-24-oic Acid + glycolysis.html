<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566785>Temporally differential protein expression of glycolytic and glycogenic enzymes during in vitro preimplantation bovine embryo development.</a></h2><p>Proteomic analyses are useful for understanding the metabolic pathways governing embryo development. This study investigated the presence of enzymes involved in  and glycogenesis in in vitro-produced bovine embryos at five developmental stages leading up to blastocyst formation. The enzymes examined were: (1) glycolytic: hexokinase-I (HK-I), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), pyruvate kinase mutase 1/2 (PKM-1/2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and (2) glycogenic: glycogen synthase kinase-3 isoforms α/ β (GSK-3α/β). Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was also analysed. The developmental stages examined were: (1) 2-4-cell, (2) 5-8-cell, (3) 16-cell, (4) morula and (5) expanded blastocyst. The enzymes HK-I, PFK-1, PKM-1/2, GAPDH and GLUT-1 were differentially expressed throughout all stages (P<0.05). GSK-3α and β were also differentially expressed from the 2-4-cell to the expanded blastocyst stage (P<0.05) and GLUT-1 was identified throughout. The general trend was that the abundance of PFK1, GAPDH and PKM-1/2 decreased whereas HK-I, phospho-GSK3α (P-GSK3α) and P-GSK3β levels increased as the embryo advanced. In contrast, GLUT-1 expression peaked at the 16-cell stage. These data combined suggest that in vitro bovine embryo metabolism switches from being glycolytic-centric to glycogenic-centric around the 16-cell stage, the developmental window also characterised by embryonic genome activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732824>Metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by IDH3α downregulation.</a></h2><p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) provide critical metabolites for tumor growth and undergo metabolic reprogramming to support glycolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this change remain unclear. Here, we report that TGF-β1- or PDGF-induced CAFs switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We identify downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α (IDH3α) as a marker for this switch. Furthermore, miR-424 downregulates IDH3α during CAF formation. Downregulation of IDH3α decreases the effective level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by reducing the ratio of α-KG to fumarate and succinate, resulting in PHD2 inhibition and HIF-1α protein stabilization. The accumulation of HIF-1α, in turn, promotes glycolysis by increasing the uptake of glucose, upregulating expression of glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions, and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating NDUFA4L2. CAFs from tumor samples exhibit low levels of IDH3α, and overexpression of IDH3α prevents transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs. Our studies reveal IDH3α to be a critical metabolic switch in CAFs.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
