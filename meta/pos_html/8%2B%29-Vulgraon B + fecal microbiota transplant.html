Endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus is related to both increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-driven superoxide production and Rho-kinase-mediated eNOS inhibition. LC40 treatment prevents all the aortic changes induced by tacrolimus. LC40 restores the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells induced by tacrolimus in mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Tacrolimus-induced gut , that is, it decreases microbial diversity, increases the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio and decreases acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria, and these effects are prevented by LC40. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from LC40-treated mice to control mice prevents the increase in SBP and the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine induced by tacrolimus.LC40 treatment prevents hypertension and endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus by inhibiting gut . These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular oxidative stress, mainly through NOX2 downregulation and prevention of eNOS uncoupling, and inflammation possibly because of decreased Th17 and increased Treg cells polarization in mesenteric lymph nodes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The effect of metformin on the gut  has been reported; however, the relationship between the gut  and the mechanism of action of metformin in elderly individuals is unclear. In this study, the effect of metformin on the gut  was investigated in aged obese mice. The abundance of the genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Butyricimonas, and Parabacteroides was significantly increased by metformin in mice fed a high-fat diet. Metformin treatment decreased the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in epididymal fat, which was correlated with the abundance of various bacterial genera. In addition, both    from metformin-treated mice and extracellular vesicles of Akkermansia muciniphila improved the body weight and lipid profiles of the mice. Our findings suggest that modulation of the gut  by metformin results in metabolic improvements in aged mice, and that these effects are associated with inflammatory immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27753689>New and emerging therapies for Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection has attained high prominence given its prevalence and impacts on patients and healthcare institutions. Multiple new approaches to the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI) are undergoing clinical trials.Bezlotoxumab is a monoclonal antibody against toxin  that has successfully completed phase III studies, demonstrating a significant reduction in recurrent CDI when given with standard of care antibiotics. Antibiotics under development include cadazolid and ridinilazole, whereas surotomycin has had disappointing phase III results.

Alternatives to faecal  , that aim to improve safety, including a microbial suspension, RBX2660, and a complex spore formulation, SER-109, have progressed to phase II studies. A nontoxigenic C. difficile strain has also shown promise to prevent recurrent CDI.

Case reports suggest    (FMT) is a promising treatment of severe and severe-complicated disease but there is a paucity of data. Here, we present a single center experience with a novel sequential FMT protocol for patients refractory to maximal medical therapy. This approach consists of at least one FMT delivered via colonoscopy with criteria for repeat FMT and continued vancomycin therapy based on clinical response and pseudomembranes. Our cohort included 57 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with severe or severe-complicated CDI and treated with FMT. Overall, 91% (52/57) experienced clinical cure at 1 month with a 100% cure rate among severe CDI (n = 19) patients and an 87% cure rate for severe-complicated CDI (n = 33) patients. For the cohort, the survival rate was 94.7% at 1 month and 78.6% at 3 months. There were no serious adverse events related to FMT including no procedure-related complications or perforation. There was no difference in outcome between fresh or frozen  material.

Stool donors are essential, but difficult to recruit and retain. We aimed to identify factors influencing willingness to donate stool. This multi-center study with a 32-item questionnaire targeted young adults and health care workers via social media and university email lists in Edmonton and Kingston, Canada; London and Nottingham, England; and Indianapolis and Boston, USA. Items included baseline demographics and FMT knowledge and perception. Investigated motivators and deterrents included economic compensation, screening process, time commitment, and stool donation logistics. Logistic regression and linear regression models estimated associations of study variables with self-assessed willingness to donate stool. 802 respondents completed our questionnaire: 387 (48.3%) age 21-30 years, 573 (71.4%) female, 323 (40%) health care workers. Country of residence, age and occupation were not associated with willingness to donate stool. Factors increasing willingness to donate were: already a blood donor (OR 1.64), male, altruism, economic benefit, knowledge of how FMT can help patients (OR 1.32), and positive attitudes towards FMT (OR 1.39). Factors decreasing willingness to donate were: stool collection unpleasant (OR 0.92), screening process invasive (OR 0.92), higher stool donation frequency, negative social perception of stool, and logistics of collection/transporting . We conclude that 1) blood donors and males are more willing to consider stool donation; 2) altruism, economic compensation, and positive feedback are motivators; and 3) screening process, high donation frequency, logistics of collection/transporting , lack of public awareness, and negative social perception are deterrents.

However, current knowledge of the overall profiles of 5-Fu-disturbed gut  is limited, and so far there is no direct convincing evidence proving the causality between 5-Fu-disturbed  and colonic mucositis. In mice, in agreement with previous reports, 5-Fu resulted in severe colonic mucositis indicated by weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, shortened colon, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. It significantly changed the profiles of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in serum and colon. Adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and VE-Cadherin were increased. While tight junction protein occludin was reduced, however, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) were increased in colonic tissues of 5-Fu treated mice. Meanwhile, inflammation related signaling pathways including NF-κ and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKs) in the colon were activated. Further study disclosed that 5-Fu diminished bacterial community richness and diversity, leading to the relative lower abundance of Firmicutes and decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio in  and cecum contents. 5-Fu also reduced the proportion of Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and Candidate division TM7, but increased that of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria in  and/or cecum contents. The   from healthy mice prevented body weight loss and colon shortening of 5-Fu treated mice. In addition, the   from 5-Fu treated mice reduced body weight and colon length of vancomycin-pretreated mice. Taken together, our study demonstrated that gut  was actively involved in the pathological process of 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis, suggesting potential attenuation of 5-Fu induced intestinal mucositis by manipulating gut  homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27194400>   for the intestinal decolonization of extensively antimicrobial-resistant opportunistic pathogens: a review.</a></h2><p>Treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are limited and often less effective. Non-pharmacologic approaches to preventing or treating MDR infections are currently restricted to improved antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices.    (FMT), a highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, has emerged as a promising therapy for intestinal MDR bacterial decolonization. A total of eight case reports have been published showing FMT resulted in intestinal decolonization of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The procedure has been shown to work even in immunocompromised patients and those experiencing medical crises without any adverse events. Five trials are currently underway to further investigate the use of FMT for MDR bacterial decolonization. FMT is a completely novel way to eradicate drug-resistant bacteria from the intestinal reservoir and should be further investigated to address the global problem of difficult-to-treat, MDR bacterial infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26585376>Obstacles to establishing an NHS faecal  programme.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113028>Restoration of a healthy intestinal  normalizes portal hypertension in a rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Portal hypertension (PH) drives most of the clinical complications in chronic liver diseases. However, its progression in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its association with the intestinal  (IM) have been scarcely studied. Our aim was to investigate the role of the IM in the mechanisms leading to PH in early NASH. The experimental design was divided in two stages. In stage 1, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 8 weeks a high-fat, high-glucose/fructose diet (HFGFD) or a control diet/water (CD). Representative rats were selected as IM donors for stage 2. In stage 2, additional HFGFD and CD rats underwent intestinal decontamination, followed by IM  with  from opposite-diet donors (heterologous ) or autologous   (as controls), generating four groups: CD-autotransplanted, CD-transplanted, HFGFD-autotransplanted, HFGFD-transplanted. After IM , the original diet was maintained for 12-14 days until death. HFGFD rats developed obesity, insulin resistance, NASH without fibrosis but with PH, intrahepatic endothelial dysfunction, and IM dysbiosis. In HFGFD rats,  with  from CD donors caused a significant reduction of PH to levels comparable to CD without significant changes in NASH histology. The reduction in PH was due to a 31% decrease of intrahepatic vascular resistance compared to the HFGFD-autotransplanted group (P < 0.05). This effect occurs through restoration of the sensitivity to insulin of the hepatic protein kinase -dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway.The IM exerts a direct influence in the development of PH in rats with diet-induced NASH and dysbiosis; PH, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction revert when a healthy IM is restored.

Despite the attractiveness of probiotic therapy as a tool to beneficially alter the intestinal , its immunological effects are still incompletely understood. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of the probiotic formulation VSL#3 consisting of eight distinct bacterial species (including  subsp. ) in reversing immunological effects of  depletion as compared to reassociation with a complex murine . To address this, conventional mice were subjected to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 8 weeks and perorally reassociated with either VSL#3 bacteria or a complex murine . VSL#3 recolonization resulted in restored CD4+ and CD8+ cell numbers in the small and large intestinal lamina propria as well as in B220+ cell numbers in the former, whereas probiotic intervention was not sufficient to reverse the antibiotic induced changes of respective cell populations in the spleen. However, VSL#3 application was as efficient as complex  reassociation to attenuate the frequencies of regulatory T cells, activated dendritic cells and memory/effector T cells in the small intestine, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Whereas broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment resulted in decreased production of cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-10 by CD4+ cells in respective immunological compartments, VSL#3 recolonization was sufficient to completely recover the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 without affecting pro-inflammatory mediators. In summary, the probiotic compound VSL#3 has an extensive impact on mucosal, peripheral, and systemic innate as well as adaptive immunity, exerting beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in intestinal as well as systemic compartments. Hence, VSL#3 might be considered a therapeutic immunomodulatory tool following antibiotic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28430060>Cultural and Personal Considerations in Informed Consent for   .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667487>Pre-colonization with the commensal fungus Candida albicans reduces murine susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for close to half a million infections and 27,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Preceding antibiotic treatment is a major risk factor for C. difficile infection (CDI) leading to recognition that commensal microbes play a key role in resistance to CDI. Current antibiotic treatment of CDI is only partially successful due to a high rate of relapse. As a result, there is interest in understanding the effects of microbes on CDI susceptibility to support treatment of patients with probiotic microbes or entire microbial communities (e.g.,   ). The results reported here demonstrate that colonization with the human commensal fungus Candida albicans protects against lethal CDI in a murine model. Colonization with C. albicans did not increase the colonization resistance of the host. Rather, our findings showed that one effect of C. albicans colonization was to enhance a protective immune response. Mice pre-colonized with C. albicans expressed higher levels of IL-17A in infected tissue following C. difficile challenge compared to mice that were not colonized with C. albicans. Administration of cytokine IL-17A was demonstrated to be protective against lethal murine CDI in mice not colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans colonization was associated with changes in the abundance of some bacterial components of the gut . Therefore, C. albicans colonization altered the gut ecosystem, enhancing survival after C. difficile challenge.

The pathogenesis of CD infection (CDI) involves the acquisition of CD with a concurrent disruption of the native gut flora. Antibiotics are a major risk although other contributing factors have also been identified. Clinical management combines discontinuation of the offending antibiotic, initiation of CD-specific antibiotic therapy, probiotic agent use,    (FMT), and surgery as the "last resort" option. The aim of this study is to review short-term clinical results following the implementation of FMT protocol (FMTP) at our community-based university hospital.After obtaining Institutional Review Board and Infection Control Committee approvals, we implemented an institution-wide FMTP for patients diagnosed with CDI. Prospective tracking of all patients receiving FMT between July 1, 2015, and February 1, 2017, was conducted using REDCap™ electronic data capture system. According to the FMTP, indications for FMT included (a) three or more CDI recurrences, () two or more hospital admissions with severe CDI, or (c) first episode of complicated CDI (CCDI). Risk factors for initial infection and for treatment failure were assessed. Patients were followed for at least 3 months to monitor for cure/failure, relapse, and side effects. Frozen 250 mL FMT samples were acquired from OpenBiome (Somerville, MA, USA). After 4 h of thawing, the liquid suspension was applied using colonoscopy, beginning with terminal ileum and proceeding distally toward mid-transverse colon. Monitored clinical parameters included disease severity (Hines VA CDI Severity Score or HVCSS), concomitant medications, number of FMT treatments, non-FMT therapies, cure rates, and mortality. Descriptive statistics were utilized to outline the study results.A total of 35 patients (mean age 58.5 years, 69% female) were analyzed, with FMT-attributable primary cure achieved in 30/35 (86%) cases. Within this subgroup, 2/30 (6.7%) patients recurred and were subsequently cured with long-term oral vancomycin. Among five primary FMT failures (14% total sample), 3 (60%) achieved medical cure with long-term oral vancomycin therapy and 2 (40%) required colectomy. For the seven patients who either failed FMT or recurred, long-term vancomycin therapy was curative in all but two cases. For patients with severe CDI (HVCSS ≥3), primary and overall cure rates were 6/10 (60%) and 8/10 (80%), respectively. Patients with CCDI ( = 4) had higher HVCSS (4 vs. 3) and a mortality of 25%. Characteristics of patients who failed initial FMT included older age (70 vs. 57 years), female sex (80% vs. 67%), severe CDI (80% vs. 13%), and active opioid use during the initial infection (60% vs. 37%) and at the time of FMT (60% vs. 27%). The most commonly reported side effect of FMT was loose stools.This pilot study supports the efficacy and safety of FMT administration for CDI in the setting of a community-based university hospital. Following FMTP implementation, primary (86%) and overall (94%) nonsurgical cure rates were similar to those reported in other studies. The potential role of opioids as a modulator of CDI warrants further clinical investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28282270>Community dynamics drive punctuated engraftment of the  microbiome following  using freeze-dried, encapsulated  .</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is a highly effective treatment of recurrent and recalcitrant Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). In a recent study oral-delivery of encapsulated, freeze-dried donor material, resulted in comparable rates of cure to colonoscopic approaches. Here we characterize shifts in the  bacterial community structure of patients treated for rCDI using encapsulated donor material. Prior to FMT, patient  samples showed declines in diversity and abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with concurrent increases in members of the Proteobacteria, specifically Enterobacteriaceae. Moreover, patients who experienced recurrence of CDI within the 2-month clinical follow-up had greater abundances of Enterobacteriaceae and did not show resolution of dysbioses. Despite resolution of rCDI following oral-administration of encapsulated  , community composition was slow to return to a normal donor-like assemblage. Post-FMT taxa within the Firmicutes showed rapid increases in relative abundance and did not vary significantly over time. Conversely, Bacteroidetes taxa only showed significant increases in abundance after one month post-FMT, corresponding to significant increases in the community attributable to the donors. Changes in the associations among dominant OTUs were observed at days, weeks, and months post-FMT, suggesting shifts in community dynamics may be related to the timing of increases in abundance of specific taxa. Administration of encapsulated, freeze-dried,   to rCDI patients resulted in restoration of bacterial diversity and resolution of dysbiosis. However, shifts in the  microbiome were incremental rather than immediate, and may be driven by changes in community dynamics reflecting changes in the host environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289345>The authors reply.</a></h2><p>This is a reply to the commentary of Ossorio and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454797>Alterations in Intestinal  Lead to Production of Interleukin 17 by Intrahepatic γδ T-Cell Receptor-Positive Cells and Pathogenesis of Cholestatic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Variants at the ABCB4 or MDR2 locus, which encodes a biliary transport protein, are associated with a spectrum of cholestatic liver diseases. Exacerbation of liver disease has been linked to increased hepatic levels of interleukin (IL) 17, yet the mechanisms of this increase are not understood. We studied mice with disruption of Mdr2 to determine how defects in liver and alteration in the  contribute to production of IL17 by intrahepatic γδ T cells.We performed studies with Mdr2 and littermate FVB/NJ (control) mice. IL17 was measured in serum samples by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice were injected with neutralizing antibodies against the γδ T-cell receptor (TCR; anti-γδ TCR) or mouse IL17A (anti-IL17A). Livers were collected and bacteria were identified in homogenates by culture procedures; TCRγδ cells were isolated by flow cytometry.  samples were collected from mice and analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Cells were stimulated with antibodies or bacteria, and cytokine production was measured. We obtained tissues from 10 patients undergoing liver  for primary sclerosing cholangitis or chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Tissues were analyzed for cytokine production by γδ TCR cells.Mdr2 mice had collagen deposition around hepatic bile ducts and periportal-bridging fibrosis with influx of inflammatory cells and increased serum levels of IL17 compared with control mice. Administration of anti-IL17A reduced hepatic fibrosis. Livers from Mdr2 mice had increased numbers of IL17A γδTCR cells-particularly of IL17A Vγ6Jγ1 γδ TCR cells.  samples from Mdr2 mice were enriched in Lactobacillus, and liver tissues were enriched in Lactobacillus gasseri compared with control mice. Mdr2 mice also had increased intestinal permeability. The γδ TCR cells isolated from Mdr2 livers produced IL17 in response to heat-killed L gasseri. Intraperitoneal injection of control mice with L gasseri led to increased serum levels of IL17 and liver infiltration by inflammatory cells; injection of these mice with anti-γδ TCR reduced serum level of IL17. Intravenous injections of Mdr2 mice with anti-γδ TCR reduced fibrosis; liver levels of IL17, and inflammatory cells; and serum levels of IL17. γδTCR cells isolated from livers of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but not hepatitis C virus infection, produced IL17.In Mdr2 mice, we found development of liver fibrosis and inflammation to require hepatic activation of γδ TCR cells and production of IL17 mediated by exposure to L gasseri. This pathway appears to contribute to development of cholestatic liver disease in patients.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite a lack of high-quality trials to provide more information on the long-term effects of FMT, there has been great enthusiasm about the potential for expanding its applications. However, FMT presents many serious ethical and social challenges that must be addressed as part of a successful regulatory policy response. In this article, we draw on a sample of the scientific and bioethics literatures to examine clusters of ethical and social issues arising in five main areas: (1) informed consent and the vulnerability of patients; (2) determining what a "suitable healthy donor" is; (3) safety and risk; (4) commercialization and potential exploitation of vulnerable patients; and (5) public health implications. We find that these issues are complex and worthy of careful consideration by health care professionals. Desperation of a patient should not be the basis for selecting treatment with FMT, and the patient's interests should always be of paramount concern. Authorities must prioritize development of appropriate and effective regulation of FMT to safeguard patients and donors, promote further research into safety and efficacy, and avoid abuse of the treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124390>   from chronic unpredictable mild stress mice donors affects anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in recipient mice via the gut -inflammation-brain axis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that there are significant changes in the gut  (GM) of humans with depression and animal models of depression and chronic stress. In our present study, we determined whether an alteration in GM is a decisive factor in anxiety-like and depression-like behavior and its impact on brain neurochemistry. An antibiotic cocktail was used to deplete the GM of mice before they were colonized, via    (FMT), by the GM of control mice or mice that had been exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS donors). The CUMS-donor group of mice and the mice that were colonized by their  (the CUMS-recipient group) both showed higher levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. The GM community of the CUMS-donor and CUMS-recipient was distinctively different from the controls, with the CUMS group characterized by a lower relative abundance of  and a higher relative abundance of . Interestingly, FMT affected both behavior and neuroinflammation. Mice given the CUMS  had significant elevations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus, which were accompanied by upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that GM modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus through dysfunctional -gut-brain axis, exacerbating anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes. Key Points Chronic unpredictable mild stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in mice. Mice colonized with gut  (GM) from stressed mice showed similar behaviors. The GM composition of the donor and recipient mice was also comparable. Their relative pattern of two bacteria has been tied to neuroinflammatory activity.

Accuracy was improved by combing antibiotic history with 3-IS levels (accuracy 89%, npv 88%, ppv 92%).In conjunction with patient antibiotic history, 3-IS is a candidate marker to predict RAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193538>Microbiome manipulation with faecal microbiome  as a therapeutic strategy in Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Faecal microbiome  (FMT) has generated huge recent interest as it presents a potential solution to a significant clinical problem--the increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). In the short term, however, there remain many practical questions regarding its use, including the optimal selection of donors, material preparation and the mechanics of delivery. In the longer term, enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of action of FMT may potentiate novel therapies, such as targeted manipulation of the microbiome in CDI and beyond.© The Author 2014.

We aimed to assess the risk of worsening in IBD activity following FMT. An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946-June 2016), EMBASE (1954-June 2016) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016). Studies in which FMT was provided to IBD patients for IBD management or (Clostridium difficile infection) CDI treatment were included. The primary outcome was the rate of worsening in IBD activity.Twenty-nine studies with 514 FMT-treated IBD patients were included. Range of follow up was 4 weeks to 3 y. The pooled rate of IBD worsening was 14.9% (95% CI 10-21%). Heterogeneity was detected: I2 D 52.1%, Cochran Q test D 58.1, p D 0.01. A priori subgroup analyses were performed. Although not significant, the pooled rate of worsening in IBD activity following FMT for CDI (22.7% (95% CI: 13-36%)) was higher compared with FMT for IBD (11.1% (95% CI 7-17%)). Rates of worsening in IBD after lower GI FMT delivery revealed a higher rate of worsening in IBD activity (16.5% (95% CI: 11-24%)) compared with upper GI delivery (5.6% (95% CI: 2-16%)). Rates of worsening in high quality studies and randomized controls trials (RCTS) suggested a marginal risk of worsening in IBD activity (4.6%, (95% CI: 1.8-11%). Rates of IBD worsening are overall marginal across high quality RCTS. It is unknown if the FMT itself led to the worsening of IBD in this small fraction or if this represents alternative etiologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023615>A different gut microbiome linked to inflammation found in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>A pro-oncogenic intestinal microbiome was observed in murine models; however, no specific microbiome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome found in cirrhotic patients with or without HCC.From 407 patients with Child Pugh A/ cirrhosis prospectively followed, 25 with HCC (cases) were matched with 25 without HCC (wo-HCC) in a 1:1 ratio according to age, gender, etiology, Child Pugh and severity of portal hypertension. In addition, results were also compared with 25 healthy subjects.  stool samples were sequenced for the V3-V4 region of the microbial 16S rRNA (Illumina MiSeq Platform). Plasma cytokines were quantified including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).We found a differential abundance in family members of Firmicutes with a 3-fold increase of Erysipelotrichaceae and a 5-fold decrease in family Leuconostocaceae in HCC when compared to wo-HCC controls. Genus Fusobacterium was found to be 5-fold decreased in HCC vs wo-HCC. The ratio bacteriodes/prevotella was increased in HCC. Three operational taxonomic units (OTUs), genus Odoribacter and Butyricimonas were more abundant in HCC, whereas a decreased abundance in Lachnospiraceae family genus Dorea was observed in HCC patients. A Random Forest model trained with differential abundant taxa correctly classified HCC individuals. This pattern was associated with an inflammatory milieu with a putative increased activation of NOD-like receptor pathways.We found a pattern of microbiome linked to inflammation that could be potentially useful as HCC biomarker after follow-up validation studies.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The gut  has been touted as an important mediator of liver disease development; however, the precise roles of gut  in regulating sepsis-induced liver injury are unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut  in sepsis-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanism. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to induce polymicrobial sepsis and related liver injury.    (FMT) was used to validate the roles of gut  in these pathologies. Metabolomics analysis was performed to characterize the metabolic profile differences between sepsis-resistant (Res; survived to 7 days after CLP) and sepsis-sensitive (Sen; moribund before or approximately 24 hours after CLP) mice. Mice gavaged with  from Sen mice displayed more-severe liver damage than did mice gavaged with  from Res mice. The gut microbial metabolic profile between Sen and Res mice was different. In particular, the  from Res mice generated more granisetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT ) receptor antagonist, than the  from Sen mice. Granisetron protected mice against CLP-induced death and liver injury. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine expression by macrophages after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge was markedly reduced in the presence of granisetron. Both treatment with granisetron and genetic knockdown of the 5-HT receptor in cells suppressed nuclear factor kappa  (NF-к) transactivation and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) accumulation in macrophages. Gut microbial granisetron levels showed a significantly negative correlation with plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in septic patients. Conclusion: Our study indicated that gut  plays a key role in the sensitization of sepsis-induced liver injury and associates granisetron as a hepatoprotective compound during sepsis development.© 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143780>Cutting Edge: Probiotics and    in Immunomodulation.</a></h2><p>Probiotics are commensal or nonpathogenic microbes that confer beneficial effects on the host through several mechanisms such as competitive exclusion, antibacterial effects, and modulation of immune responses. Some probiotics have been found to regulate immune responses via immune regulatory mechanisms. T regulatory (Treg) cells, T helper cell balances, dendritic cells, macrophages,  cells, and natural killer (NK) cells can be considered as the most determinant dysregulated mediators in immunomodulatory status. Recently,    (FMT) has been defined as the transfer of distal gut microbial communities from a healthy individual to a patient's intestinal tract to cure some immune disorders (mainly inflammatory bowel diseases).

Here, we extended the virome analyses and found the patient's phage population to exhibit highly donor-similar characteristics following FMT, which remained stable for the whole period tested (up to 7 months). Moreover, the detected viral populations of donor and patient exhibited comparable diversity and richness. These findings were unexpected since enteric viromes are normally highly variable, assumed to influence the bacterial host community and change with environmental conditions. In contrast to the virome, the bacterial  varied indeed for more than 7 months with ongoing dysbiosis before it reached donor similarity. Our findings that are based on sequence information and protein domain analysis seem to suggest that stable phage properties correlate with successful FMT better than the changing bacterial communities. We speculate that we here preferentially detected a stable core virome, which dominated over a variable flexible virome that may have been too heterogeneous for experimental detection or was underrepresented in the databases. It will be interesting to analyze whether the enteric virome allows predictions for the clinical outcome of FMT for rCDI and other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673295>Gut microbiota, metabolism and psychopathology: A critical review and novel perspectives.</a></h2><p>Psychiatric disorders are often associated with metabolic comorbidities. However, the mechanisms through which metabolic and psychiatric disorders are connected remain unclear. Pre-clinical studies in rodents indicate that the bidirectional signaling between the intestine and the brain, the so-called microbiome-gut-brain axis, plays an important role in the regulation of both metabolism and behavior. The gut microbiome produces a vast number of metabolites that may be transported into the host and play a part in homeostatic control of metabolism as well as brain function. In addition to short chain fatty acids, many of these metabolites have been identified in recent years. To what extent both microbiota and their products control human metabolism and behavior is a subject of intense investigation.

Colonization in a susceptible individual, with risk factors such as prior antibiotic use, advanced age, or medical comorbidities, may result in symptomatic infection. Although patients with a gynecologic malignancy may be at a higher risk of developing CDI due to an increased likelihood of having one or more risk factors, data do not consistently support the idea that chemotherapy or cancer itself are independently associated with CDI. For diagnosis of CDI, we recommended using a multi-step approach, with a highly sensitive initial rapid test such as the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), followed by confirmatory testing with of the above two tests or EIA toxin A/, which has high specificity. Treatment varies based on the severity of disease. We recommend vancomycin as first-line therapy for an initial episode of mild/moderate or severe CDI, with consideration of fidaxomicin for patients at particularly high risk for recurrence. Rectal vancomycin may play an adjunctive role for some severe cases, while surgical intervention is indicated for fulminant CDI if no improvement six or more days after initiating medical therapy.

Treatment for myocarditis is still a difficult task in clinical practice. The gut  is related to cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. However, little is known about the role of the gut  in myocarditis. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis is associated with myocarditis. We focused on whether    (FMT) can be used as an effective treatment for myocarditis. We used an experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model.  samples were isolated from the control and EAM groups for bacterial genome analysis. We observed an increase in microbial richness and diversity in the myocarditis mice. These changes were accompanied by an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We also evaluated the efficacy of FMT for the treatment of myocarditis. EAM mouse guts were repopulated with  contents from an untreated male mouse donor. We found that myocardial injury was improved by diminished inflammatory infiltration, showing that IFN-γ gene expression in the heart tissue and CD4IFN-γ cells in the spleen were decreased after FMT in EAM mice. We also found that FMT was able to rebalance the gut  by restoring the Bacteroidetes population and reshaping the  composition. Myocarditis is associated with gut  dysbiosis and characterized by an increased F/ ratio. FMT treatment can rebalance the gut  and attenuate myocarditis. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of myocarditis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut  are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut  and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing gut , causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or   , further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut  in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, ., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Antibiotic treatment can affect weight gain by elimination of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-producing microbes, which are anti-inflammatory by augmenting regulatory T (T) cells. We asked whether mice that lack HDAC6 and have potent suppressive T cells are protected from -induced accelerated weight gain. We crossed wild-type and HDAC6-deficient mice and subjected the offspring to perinatal penicillin, inducing weight gain via  disturbance. We observed that male HDAC6-deficient mice were not protected and developed profoundly accelerated weight gain. The antibiotic-exposed HDAC6-deficient mice showed a mixed immune phenotype with increased CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation yet maintained the enhanced T cell-suppressive function phenotype characteristic of HDAC6-deficient mice. 16S rRNA sequencing of mouse  samples reveals that their  diverged with time, with HDAC6 deletion altering microbiome composition. On a high-fat diet, HDAC6-deficient mice were depleted in representatives of the S24-7 family and Lactobacillus but enriched with Bacteroides and Parabacteroides; these changes are associated with obesity.

This illness markedly predisposes patients to thrombophilia and chronic debility as well as bowel, lymphatic, and liver cancers. Development of new therapies is needed to re-establish long-term immune tolerance in IBD patients without increasing the risk of opportunistic infections and cancer. Aberrant purinergic signaling pathways have been implicated in disordered thromboregulation and immune dysregulation, as noted in the pathogenesis of IBD and other gastrointestinal/hepatic autoimmune diseases. Expression of CD39 on endothelial or immune cells allows for homeostatic integration of hemostasis and immunity, which are disrupted in IBD. Our focus in this review is on novel aspects of the functions of CD39 and related NTPDases in IBD. Regulated CD39 activity allows for scavenging of extracellular nucleotides, the maintenance of P2-receptor integrity and coordination of adenosinergic signaling responses. CD39 together with CD73, serves as an integral component of the immunosuppressive machinery of dendritic cells, myeloid cells, T and  cells. Genetic inheritance and environental factors closely regulate the levels of expression and phosphohydrolytic activity of CD39, both on immune cells and released microparticles. Purinergic mechanisms associated with T regulatory and supressor T helper type 17 cells modulate disease activity in IBD, as can be modeled in experimental colitis. As a recent example, upregulation of CD39 is dependent upon ligation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), as with natural ligands such as bilirubin and 2-(1' H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE). Decreased expression of CD39 and/or dysfunctional AHR signaling, however, abrogates the protective effects of immunosuppressive AHR ligands. These factors could also serve as biomarkers of disease activity in IBD. Heightened thrombosis, inflammation, and immune disturbances as seen in IBD appear to be associated with aberrant purinergic signaling. Ongoing development of therapeutic strategies augmenting CD39 ectonucleotidase bioactivity via cytokines or AHR ligands offers promise for management of thrombophilia, disordered inflammation, and aberrant immune reactivity in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29493330>   for managing irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a widespread gastrointestinal disorder affecting 11.2% of the world adult population. The intestinal microbiome is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of IBS. The composition of the  microbiome in IBS patients differs from that in healthy individuals, but the exact bacteria species involved in the development of IBS remain to be determined. There is also an imbalance between useful and harmful bacteria (dysbiosis) in the intestinal microbiome in patients with IBS. Consuming prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics has a limited effect on IBS symptoms. In contrast,  microbiome  (FMT) in IBS patients reverses the dysbiosis to normobiosis and reduces the IBS symptoms in about 70% of patients, and is not associated with any serious adverse events.

Preventing infections is therefore very relevant. Because gut bacterial translocation is their main pathogenic mechanism, prevention of infections is mostly based on the use of orally administered poorly absorbed antibiotics such as norfloxacin (selective intestinal decontamination). However, antibiotic prophylaxis leads to antibiotic resistance, limiting therapy and increasing morbidity and mortality. Prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhosis should therefore move away from antibiotics.This review focuses on various potentially novel methods to prevent infections in cirrhosis focusing on non-antibiotic strategies. The use of probiotics, nonselective intestinal decontamination with rifaximin, prokinetics and beta-blockers or    as means of targeting altered gut , bile acids and FXR agonists are all potential alternatives to selective intestinal decontamination. Prokinetics and beta-blockers can improve intestinal motility, while bile acids and FXR agonists help by improving the intestinal barrier. Finally, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and statins are emerging therapeutic strategies that may improve immune dysfunction in cirrhosis.Evidence for these strategies has been restricted to animal studies and proof-of concept studies but we expect this to change in coming years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487251>[Refractory colitis by Clostridium difficile treated with   ].</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly recognized cause of diarrhea in inpatients, frequently associated to high mortality.

Since FMT's complex and highly variable composition cannot be easily characterized - nor its quality routinely assessed - FMT as a sui generis biologic drug cannot conform to existing standards for preparation. Clearly, donors must be carefully selected and the raw material prepared under close microbiological control, but FMT should also conform to manufacturing and laboratory practice standards for which international consensus can only be achieved with further experience.

In the present study, we generated with respect to their  "humanized" mice by human    of secondary abiotic mice. Following peroral challenge with a clinical  isolate on two consecutive days, mice harboring a human or murine  were only partially protected from stable intestinal  colonization given that up to 78% of mice were -positive at day 28 post-infection (p.i.). Irrespective of the host-specificity of the ,  colonized mice were clinically uncompromised. However,  colonization resulted in increased intestinal epithelial apoptosis that was accompanied by pronounced proliferative/regenerative cell responses. Furthermore, at day 7 p.i. increased innate immune cell populations such as macrophages and monocytes could be observed in the colon of mice harboring either a human or murine , whereas this held true at day 28 p.i. for adaptive immune cells such as  lymphocytes in both the small and large intestines of mice with murine . At day 7 p.i., pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was enhanced in the colon and mesenteric lymph nodes, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was down-regulated in the former at day 28 p.i. Strikingly, cytokine responses upon intestinal  colonization were not restricted to the intestinal tract, but could also be observed systemically, given that TNF and IFN-γ concentrations were elevated in spleens as early as 7 days p.i., whereas splenic IL-10 levels were dampened at day 28 p.i. of mice with human . In conclusion, mere intestinal carriage of MDR  by clinically unaffected mice results in pro-inflammatory sequelae not only in intestinal, but also systemic compartments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143316>Environmental management in the gut:   to restore the intestinal ecosystem.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25893454>   for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection after peripheral autologous stem cell  for diffuse large -cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183502>Bugs in the system: bringing the human microbiome to bear in cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>The influence of the composition of the human microbiome on the efficacy of cancer directed immunotherapies, such as antibodies directed against the programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1), has garnered increasing attention as the role of immunotherapies in the care of cancer has grown.

Particularly the application of probiotics has become remarkably popular because of their expected association with gut  modulation. Although there are many literatures on the effects of probiotics in obese animal models, most of them reported the effects of probiotic bacteria on metabolic indications with limited information on anti-obesity itself. Besides, some probiotics have been shown to reduce certain metabolic symptoms but they failed to achieve weight loss. This report reviewed the current literatures on the anti-obesity effects of next-generation probiotics in various animal obesity models and discussed the beneficial potential of    in treating obesity in humans. The purpose of this article is to help guide further research improve the probiotic bacteria experiments in more precise animal obesity models by standardizing the anti-obesogenesis, obesity control, and treatment assays and hopefully the evidence-based investigations on harnessing gut  through next-generation probiotics or    will develop new interventions to promote and achieve anti-obesity.© 2019 The Authors.

Generally these animals are maintained in semi-rigid or flexible-film isolators to ensure their continued sterility or, if colonized with specific , to ensure that no new species are introduced. Here, we describe the use of a caging system in which individual cages are hermetically sealed and have their own filtered positive airflow. This isopositive caging system requires less space and reduces animal housing costs. By using strict sterile techniques, we kept mice germ-free in this caging system for 12 weeks. We also used this caging system and approach to conduct studies evaluating a) the stability of the microbiome in germ-free mice receiving a   and ) the stability of dietary-induced  changes in -transplanted mice. As has been shown in  transfer studies in isolators, we found that the transferred  stabilizes as early as 2 weeks post transfer although recipient  did not completely recapitulate those of the donors.

It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and microbiome composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and colitis in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them 2% DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of  samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted  from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS colitis. IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM  cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with  from IMQ mice, but not with  from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS colitis.These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes. Our finding of a novel potential skin-gut interaction provides new insights into the coincidence of psoriasis and IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26456940>MicroRNA-146a constrains multiple parameters of intestinal  immunity and increases susceptibility to DSS colitis.</a></h2><p>Host-microbial interactions within the mammalian intestines must be properly regulated in order to promote host health and limit disease. Because the  provide constant immunological signals to intestinal tissues, a variety of regulatory mechanisms have evolved to ensure proper immune responses to maintain homeostasis. However, many of the genes that comprise these regulatory pathways, including immune-modulating microRNAs (miRNAs), have not yet been identified or studied in the context of intestinal homeostasis. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) in regulating intestinal immunity and barrier function and found that this miRNA is expressed in a variety of gut tissues in adult mice. By comparing intestinal gene expression in WT and miR-146a-/- mice, we demonstrate that miR-146a represses a subset of gut barrier and inflammatory genes all within a network of immune-related signaling pathways. We also found that miR-146a restricts the expansion of intestinal T cell populations, including Th17, Tregs, and Tfh cells. GC  cells, Tfh ICOS expression, and the production of luminal IgA were also reduced by miR-146a in the gut. Consistent with an enhanced intestinal barrier, we found that miR-146a-/- mice are resistant to DSS-induced colitis, a model of Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and this correlated with elevated colonic miR-146a expression in human UC patients. Taken together, our data describe a role for miR-146a in constraining intestinal barrier function, a process that alters gut homeostasis and enhances at least some forms of intestinal disease in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862530>Exercise training-induced modification of the gut  persists after  colonization and attenuates the response to chemically-induced colitis in gnotobiotic mice.</a></h2><p>Exercise reduces the risk of inflammatory disease by modulating a variety of tissue and cell types, including those within the gastrointestinal tract. Recent data indicates that exercise can also alter the gut , but little is known as to whether these changes affect host function. Here, we use a germ-free (GF) animal model to test whether exercise-induced modifications in the gut  can directly affect host responses to  colonization and chemically-induced colitis. Donor mice (n = 19) received access to a running wheel (n = 10) or remained without access (n = 9) for a period of six weeks. After euthanasia, cecal contents were pooled by activity treatment and transplanted into two separate cohorts of GF mice. Two experiments were then conducted. First, mice were euthanized five weeks after the   and tissues were collected for analysis. A second cohort of GF mice were colonized by donor microbiotas for four weeks before dextran-sodium-sulfate was administered to induce acute colitis, after which mice were euthanized for tissue analysis. We observed that microbial  from donor (exercised or control) mice led to differences in  β-diversity, metabolite profiles, colon inflammation, and body mass in recipient mice five weeks after colonization. We also demonstrate that colonization of mice with a gut  from exercise-trained mice led to an attenuated response to chemical colitis, evidenced by reduced colon shortening, attenuated mucus depletion and augmented expression of cytokines involved in tissue regeneration. Exercise-induced modifications in the gut  can mediate host-microbial interactions with potentially beneficial outcomes for the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337874>Precision microbiome reconstitution restores bile acid mediated resistance to Clostridium difficile.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are colonized by hundreds of microbial species that contribute to health, including colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens. Many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Among these, Clostridium difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Which intestinal bacteria provide resistance to C. difficile infection and their in vivo inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa with development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that result in distinct  changes and lead to varied susceptibility to C. difficile. Mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the  of hospitalized patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice and humans. Using these platforms, we determine that Clostridium scindens, a bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance to C. difficile infection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to infection in a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. Using a workflow involving mouse models, clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical modelling, we identify a probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant microbiome deficiency. These findings have implications for the rational design of targeted antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for individuals at risk of C. difficile infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197926>Initial experience of    in gastrointestinal disease: A case series.</a></h2><p>Current studies have proven the strong association between gut  dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases.    (FMT) from a healthy donor is a promising therapeutic strategy to change and restore composition of the recipient's gut . Rapidly increasing clinical literatures confirmed the truth of the benefits of FMT on recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) and inflammatory bowel disease. This article retrospectively reviewed nine cases (four cases had ulcerative colitis [UC], five cases had rCDI) who received FMT in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital from April 2016 to November 2018. We summarized the procedure including donor selection,  materials preparation,  delivery methods, and clinical outcomes. All of the four UC cases got clinical improvement and four rCDI cases achieved clinical remission after FMT. The other one rCDI case remained positive stool Toxin A+ result after FMT, and got remission after salvage treatment with fidaxomicin. FMT is considered to be a well-tolerated adjuvant treatment for UC and effective salvage treatment for rCDI in our initial experience. Multiple infusions of FMT in UC and rCDI might have exceptional clinical efficiency, and enteral tube insertion could be a useful method to reach this goal and make multiple sessions of FMT easier.© 2019 The Authors.

As customary antibiotic therapies against , metronidazole and vancomycin, are broad spectrum, they affect greatly the gut microbiota, which result in very high recurrence rates. Therefore, new strategies are researched intensively. New therapies focus on limiting further destruction of the gut microbiota or restoring the microbiota to its pre-destructed state.

Study of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice contributed to our knowledge of the pathophysiology of human allergic contact dermatitis. Here we report a negative regulatory role of the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) on DTH by modulating gut bacterial ecology. Cohousing and fecal transplantation experiments revealed that the dysbiotic microbiota of   mice conferred a proallergic phenotype that is communicable to wild-type mice. DTH sensitization coincided with increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation within lymphoid organs that enhanced DTH severity. Collectively, we unveiled an unexpected impact of RIG-I-like signaling on the gut microbiota with consequences on allergic skin disease outcome. Primarily, these data indicate that manipulating the gut microbiota may help in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human allergic skin pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26110044>The role of beneficial bacteria wall elasticity in regulating innate immune response.</a></h2><p>Probiotics have great potential to contribute to development of healthy dietary regimes, preventive care, and an integrated approach to immunity-related disease management. The bacterial wall is a dynamic entity, depending on many components and playing an essential role in modulating immune response. The impact of cell wall elasticity on the beneficial effects of probiotic strains has not been sufficiently studied. The aim was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria strains on phagocytic system cells (macrophages) as related to bacterial wall elasticity, estimated using atomic force microscopy (AFM).We conducted studies on Balb/c line mice 18-20 g in weight using lyophilized strains of LAB-Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV -7279, Lactobacillus casei IMV -7280, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV -7281, and bifidobacteria-Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB. We cultivated the macrophages obtained from the peritoneal cavity of mice individually with the strains of LAB and bifidobacteria and evaluated their effect on macrophages, oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity, nitric oxide production, and immunoregulatory cytokines. We used AFM scanning to estimate bacterial cell wall elasticity.All strains had a stimulating effect on the functional activity of macrophages and ability to produce NO/NO2 in vitro. Lactobacilli strains increased the production of IL-12 and IFN-γ in vitro. The AFM demonstrated different cell wall elasticity levels in various strains of LAB and bifidobacteria. The rigidity of the cell walls among lactobacilli was distributed as follows: Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV -7279 > Lactobacillus casei IMV -7280 > Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV -7281; among the strains of bifidobacteria: . animalis VKB > . animalis VKL. Probiotic strain survival in the macrophages depended on the bacterial cell wall elasticity and on the time of their joint cultivation.LAB and bifidobacteria strains stimulate immune-modulatory cytokines and active oxygen and nitrogen oxide compound production in macrophages. Strains with a more elastic cell wall according to AFM data demonstrated higher resistance to intracellular digestion in macrophages and higher level of their activation. AFM might be considered as a fast and accurate method to assess parameters of probiotic strain cell wall to predict their immune-modulatory properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27496472>Profile of Gut  Associated With the Presence of Hepatocellular Cancer in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Changes within the gut  contribute to the progression of chronic liver diseases. According to the results of several studies performed in animal models, gut dysbiosis plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of gut  associated with the presence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis of the liver undergoing liver .A total of 15 patients with HCC and 15 non-HCC patients matched according to etiology of cirrhosis and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores who underwent liver transplantations between 2012 and 2014 were included. Analysis of their gut microbial profile was based on prospectively collected stool samples from the pretransplant period.Patients with and without HCC were similar with respect to age (P = .506), sex (P = .700), hepatitis C virus (P > .999) and hepatitis  virus (P = .715) infection status, alcoholic liver disease (P > .999), and MELD score (P = .337). Notably, the presence of HCC was associated with significantly increased  counts of Escherichia coli (P = .025). Prediction of HCC presence based on E coli counts was associated with the area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.742 (95% confidence interval, 0.564-0.920), with the optimal cutoff on the level of 17.728 (natural logarithm of colony-forming units per 1 g of ). Sensitivity and specificity rates for the established cutoff were 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively.The profile of gut  associated with the presence of HCC in cirrhotic patients is characterized by increased  counts of E coli. Therefore, intestinal overgrowth of E coli may contribute to the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

One way in which the risk for PCOS may be increased in daughters of affected women is through exposure to elevated androgens in utero. Hyperandrogenemic conditions have serious health consequences, including increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been found to induce hypertension in rats, such that blood pressure can be normalized through  microbial . Therefore, we hypothesized that the hypertension seen in PCOS has early origins in gut dysbiosis caused by in utero exposure to excess androgen. We investigated this hypothesis with a model of prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure and maternal hyperandrogenemia by single-injection of testosterone cypionate or sesame oil vehicle (VEH) to pregnant dams in late gestation. We then completed a gut  and cardiometabolic profile of the adult female offspring.The metabolic assessment revealed that adult PNA rats had increased body weight and increased mRNA expression of adipokines: adipocyte binding protein 2, adiponectin, and leptin in inguinal white adipose tissue. Radiotelemetry analysis revealed hypertension with decreased heart rate in PNA animals. The   profile of PNA animals contained higher relative abundance of bacteria associated with steroid hormone synthesis, Nocardiaceae and Clostridiaceae, and lower abundance of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Clostridium. The PNA animals also had an increased relative abundance of bacteria associated with biosynthesis and elongation of unsaturated short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).We found that prenatal exposure to excess androgen negatively impacted cardiovascular function by increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreasing heart rate. Prenatal androgen was also associated with gut microbial dysbiosis and altered abundance of bacteria involved in metabolite production of short chain fatty acids. These results suggest that early-life exposure to hyperandrogenemia in daughters of women with PCOS may lead to long-term alterations in gut  and cardiometabolic function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946615>Multidonor FMT capsules improve symptoms and decrease  calprotectin in ulcerative colitis patients while treated - an open-label pilot study.</a></h2><p> Growing evidence indicates that gut dysbiosis is a factor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC).

Secondary objectives were to follow changes in  calprotectin and microbial diversity through  samples and quality of life through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Participants were followed through regular visits for six months.  From a median of 6 at baseline, the SCCAI of all participants decreased, with median decreases of 5 ( = .001) and 6 ( = .001) after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Three of the seven patients had flare-up/relapse of symptoms after the active treatment period. The median F-calprotectin of ≥1800 mg/kg at baseline decreased significantly during the treatment period, but increased again in the follow-up period. The median IBDQ improved at all visits compared to baseline. The   α-diversity did not increase in the study period compared to baseline. All participants completed the treatment and no serious adverse events were reported.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of CDI.Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane database were used. The authors searched studies with 10 or more patients examining the resolution of symptoms after FMT in patients with CDI. Reviews, letters to the editors, and abstracts were excluded.

One potential modulator of these complex disorders is the gut microbiome, which was described in recent years to be altered in patients suffering from features of cardiometabolic syndrome and to transmit cardiometabolic phenotypes upon transfer into germ-free mice. As a result, there is great interest in developing new modalities targeting the altered commensal bacteria as a means of treatment for cardiometabolic syndrome.    (FMT) is one such modality in which a disease-associated microbiome is replaced by a healthy microbiome configuration. So far clinical use of FMT has been overwhelmingly successful in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and is being extensively studied in other microbiome-associated pathologies such as cardiometabolic syndrome. This review will focus on the rationale, promises and challenges in FMT utilization in human disease. In particular, it will overview the role of the gut  in cardiometabolic syndrome and the rationale, experience, and prospects of utilizing FMT treatment as a potential preventive and curative treatment of metabolic human disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28027582>   induces hepatitis  virus e-antigen (HBeAg) clearance in patients with positive HBeAg after long-term antiviral therapy.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711739>Role of the Gut Microbiome in Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Induced Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Individuals suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at increased risk for systemic hypertension. The importance of a healthy gut , and detriment of a dysbiotic , on host physiology is becoming increasingly evident. We tested the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis contributes to hypertension observed with OSA. OSA was modeled in rats by inflating a tracheal balloon during the sleep cycle (10-s inflations, 60 per hour). On normal chow diet, OSA had no effect on blood pressure; however, in rats fed a high-fat diet, blood pressure increased 24 and 29 mm Hg after 7 and 14 days of OSA, respectively (P<0.05 each). Bacterial community characterization was performed on  pellets isolated before and after 14 days of OSA in chow and high-fat fed rats. High-fat diet and OSA led to significant alterations of the gut , including decreases in bacterial taxa known to produce the short chain fatty acid butyrate (P<0.05). Finally,  of dysbiotic cecal contents from hypertensive OSA rats on high-fat diet into OSA recipient rats on normal chow diet (shown to be normotensive) resulted in hypertension similar to that of the donor (increased 14 and 32 mm Hg after 7 and 14 days of OSA, respectively; P<0.05). These studies demonstrate a causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and hypertension, and suggest that manipulation of the  may be a viable treatment for OSA-induced, and possibly other forms of, hypertension.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28103145>Can you cause inflammatory bowel disease with  ?

Furthermore, the potential implications for host physiology of these FMT-related changes in gut bile acid metabolism are also not well explored. In this study, we investigated the impact of FMT for rCDI upon signalling through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Herein, we identify that in addition to restoration of gut microbiota and bile acid profiles, FMT for rCDI is accompanied by a significant, sustained increase in circulating levels of FGF19 and reduction in FGF21. These FGF changes were associated with weight gain post-FMT, to a level not exceeding the pre-rCDI baseline.

Practice guidelines have recently been revised incorporating updated recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.This review discusses updated aspects of CDI management. New and emerging pharmacologic options for treatment and prevention are reviewed.Metronidazole is associated with lower rates of treatment success compared to vancomycin and should no longer be used as primary therapy for the first episode of CDI or recurrent disease. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are now recommended for first-line therapy for most cases of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplant is effective and safe for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Evidence supports the use of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab for prevention of recurrent CDI; however, the costs associated with these therapies may limit their use. Validated risk prediction tools are needed to identify patients most likely to benefit from these treatments. Future advancements in microbiota targeting treatments will emerge as promising alternatives to standard CDI treatments.

Although not well understood, alterations in the gut microbiota, or , may be responsible for age-related inflammation.Using stroke as a disease model, we tested the hypothesis that a youthful microbiota, when established in aged mice, produces positive outcomes following ischemic stroke. Conversely, an aged microbiota, when established in young mice, produces negative outcomes after stroke. Young and aged male mice had either a young or an aged microbiota established by fecal transplant gavage (FTG). Mice were subjected to ischemic stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO) or sham surgery. During the subsequent weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing and fecal samples were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis of bacterial content.We found that the microbiota is altered after experimental stroke in young mice and resembles the biome of uninjured aged mice. In aged mice, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F:), two main bacterial phyla in gut microbiota, increased ∼9-fold (p < 0.001) compared to young. This increased F: ratio in aged mice is indicative of . Altering the microbiota in young by fecal gavage to resemble that of aged mice (∼6-fold increase in F: ratio, p < 0.001) increased mortality following MCAO, decreased performance in behavioral testing, and increased cytokine levels. Conversely, altering the microbiota in aged to resemble that of young (∼9-fold decrease in F: ratio, p < 0.001) increased survival and improved recovery following MCAO.Aged biome increased the levels of systemic proinflammatory cytokines. We conclude that the gut microbiota can be modified to positively impact outcomes from age-related diseases.

Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic acid have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals. Furthermore, some new iron supplements with the ability of slow-releasing Fe, e.g. ferrous citrate liposome and EDTA iron sodium, have been successfully prepared. In order to recover the intestinal micro-ecological balance, probiotics and prebiotics, bacterial consortium , and    have been developed.

To address this, mice with a human gut microbiota were perorally infected with one cyst of  (day 0) and subjected to intraperitoneal synthetic NAP treatment from day 1 until day 8 postinfection (p.i.). Whereas placebo (PLC) control animals displayed subacute ileitis at day 9 p.i., NAP-treated mice exhibited less pronounced pro-inflammatory immune responses as indicated by lower numbers of intestinal mucosal T and  lymphocytes and lower interferon (IFN)- concentrations in mesenteric lymph nodes. The NAP-induced anti-inflammatory effects were not restricted to the intestinal tract but could also be observed in extra-intestinal including systemic compartments, given that pro-inflammatory cytokines were lower in liver, kidney, and lung following NAP as compared to PLC application, whereas at day 9 p.i., colonic and serum interleukin (IL)-10 concentrations were higher in the former as compared to the latter. Remarkably, probiotic commensal bifidobacterial loads were higher in the ileal lumen of NAP as compared to PLC-treated mice with ileitis.

Established therapies for CDI such as vancomycin and metronidazole (an off-label use) are limited by poor efficacy and high recurrence rates. An investigational antibiotic with potent in vitro activity against all C. difficile strains (including the hypervirulent BI/NAP1/027 strain) has yielded encouraging results in early clinical trials. Another promising approach involves the use of monoclonal antibodies with selective activity against toxins responsible for CDI-associated diarrhea; in a small Phase II clinical trial, a single monoclonal antibody infusion in combination with vancomycin or metronidazole therapy was more effective than antibiotic therapy alone in preventing CDI relapse. Other emerging approaches to CDI treatment and prophylaxis include the use of vaccines against C. difficile toxins (several C. difficile-targeted vaccines are under development in Europe and the United States); microbe-based strategies such as   , "microbial ecosystem therapeutics," and probiotic supplements; and an investigational encapsulated form of β-lactamase designed to prevent C. difficile colonization from progressing to CDI.The current antibiotic therapies for CDI, mainly vancomycin and (off-label) metronidazole and the newer agent fidaxomicin, have limitations with respect to efficacy, recurrence rates, and adverse effects, but a variety of promising approaches are emerging.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut  as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut  is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut  could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; () increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system.   studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut  in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut , leading to lean host phenotype body composition.

CDI now represents a common cause of health care-associated diarrhea, and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. CDI disproportionally affects the elderly, possibly explained by the following risk factors: age-related impairment of the immune system, increasing antibiotic utilization, and frequent health care exposure. In the USA, recent epidemiological studies estimate that two out of every three health care-associated CDIs occur in patients 65 years or older. Additionally, the elderly are at higher risk for recurrent CDI. Existing therapeutic options include metronidazole, oral vancomycin, and fidaxomicin. Choice of agent depends on disease severity, history of recurrence, and, increasingly, the drug cost. Bezlotoxumab, a recently approved monoclonal antibody targeting  toxin , offers an exciting advancement into immunologic therapies. Similarly,    is gaining popularity as an effective option mainly for recurrent CDI. The challenge of decreasing CDI burden in the elderly involves adopting preventative strategies, optimizing initial treatment, and decreasing the risk of recurrence.

One of the organs significantly affected by age is the gut. Age-dependent changes of the gut-associated microbiome have been linked to increased frailty and systemic inflammation. This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes.

However, the effects of commensal  on intestinal mucosa antimicrobial molecules have not been elucidated systematically. Here, we investigate the impacts of antibiotic-induced depletion and subsequent restoration of the intestinal  on the murine antimicrobial molecules in intestinal mucosa. Our results demonstrate that depletion of commensal  leads to intestinal mucosa atrophy and reduction of antimicrobial molecules, including lysozyme, regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIIIγ), and cryptdin 5 mRNA, whereas subsequent reconstitution of intestinal  by    (FMT) rescues mucosa morphology and antimicrobials. Importantly, our study shows that down-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), interleukin-22 (IL-22), and phosphorylated Stat3 (p-Stat3) is associated with decreased antimicrobials, which might mediate the antibiotic-associated intestinal mucosa injury. Last, exogenous activation of the AhR/IL-22/Stat3 signaling pathway with the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-)carbazole (Ficz) rescued antimicrobial molecule levels markedly after antibiotic treatment to levels similar to those following reconstitution of intestinal  by FMT.

However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs.An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A& genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle was orally administered to the subject. Stool consistency and frequency and faecal blood and mucus became normal 2-3 days after oral FMT, and real-time PCR analysis and immunochromatography was negative for C. difficile antigen and toxin A& genes and proteins. No adverse events were observed.The present case report demonstrated that oral FMT was an effective treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog.

Each center used a different donor type, stool preparation and method of delivery. The Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center used unrelated  donors and frozen stool samples and delivered them primarily (92%) via the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Shaare Zedek Medical Center used fresh donor stool of relatives and delivered them primarily (90%) via the upper GI tract.FMT had an overall 2 month cure rate of 89%. Patients treated with FMT that was executed through the lower GI tract recovered faster from the infection (1.6 ± 1.08 vs. 2.4 ± 1 days for the upper tract, P = 0.03). The results also showed that patients who received lower GI tract FMTs were more likely to be cured of CDI (100% vs. 75% for upper tract FMTs, P = 0.16). Five patients (22%) died of CDI/FMT-unrelated causes and two (10%) died of CDI/FMT-related causes during the study period.Lower GI tract FMT is a safe and effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI, and yields quicker results than upper GI tract FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879241>Clinical Inquiries: How effective and safe is  microbial  in preventing C difficile recurrence?</a></h2><p> microbial  (fmt) is reasonably safe and effective.

Currently, conservative treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI) relies on the antibiotics vancomycin, metronidazole or fidaxomicin, or in case of multiple recurrences,    (FMT).The fast-spreading, epidemic nature of this pathogen urgently necessitates the search for alternative treatment strategies as well as antibiotic targets. Accordingly, in this review, we highlight the recent findings regarding virulence associated traits of C. difficile, evaluate their potential as alternative drug targets, and present current efforts in designing inhibitory compounds, with the aim of pointing out possibilities for future treatment strategies.Increased attention on systematic analysis of the virulence mechanisms of C. difficile has already led to the identification of several alternative drug targets. In the future, applying state of the art 'omics' and the development of novel infection models that mimic the human gut, a highly complex ecological niche, will unveil the genomic and metabolic plasticity of this pathogen and will certainly help dealing with future challenges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414076>   in gastrointestinal disease: 2015 update and the road ahead.</a></h2><p>At its height, the Clostridium difficile infection epidemic caused approximately 7000 infections and 300 deaths per day in the USA.

Recent advances in our understanding of steady-state hematopoiesis have allowed us to explore the effects of antibiotics on hematopoietic progenitors in detail using a murine model. Antibiotic-treated mice exhibited anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukopenia, with pronounced pan-lymphopenia as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood. Bone marrow progenitor analysis revealed depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors across all subtypes. Granulocytes and  cells were also diminished in the bone marrow, whereas the number of CD8 T cells increased. Reductions in progenitor activity were not observed when cells were directly incubated with antibiotics, suggesting that these effects are indirect. Hematopoietic changes were associated with a significant contraction of the  microbiome and were partially rescued by   transfer. Further, mice raised in germ-free conditions had hematopoietic abnormalities similar to those seen in antibiotic-treated mice, and antibiotic therapy of germ-free mice caused no additional abnormalities. The effects of antibiotics were phenocopied in Stat1-deficient mice, with no additional suppression by antibiotics in these mice. We conclude that microbiome depletion as a result of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupts basal Stat1 signaling and alters T-cell homeostasis, leading to impaired progenitor maintenance and granulocyte maturation.

The incidence and mortality of C. difficile infection (CDI) has significantly increased during recent years. Mortality lies between 3 and 14%. CDI is generally caused by intestinal dysbiosis, which can be triggered by various factors, including antibiotics or immune suppressants.

Oral vancomycin is suitable as a first-line therapy of mild CDI occurring during pregnancy and lactation, as well as in cases of intolerance or allergy to metronidazole. Severe courses should be treated with vancomycin. Recurrence should be treated with vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

This composition is affected by a number of factors, including the genetic background of the individual, early life factors (including method of birth, length of breastfeeding) and nature of the diet and other environmental exposures (including cigarette smoking) and general life habits. It plays a key role in the control of inflammation, and in turn, its' composition is significantly influenced by inflammation. Areas covered: We consider metabolic, protective, and trophic functions of the microbiome and influences through the lifespan from post-partum effects, to diet later in life in healthy older adults, the effects of aging on both its' composition, and influence on health and potential therapeutic targets that may have anti-inflammatory effects.

The intestinal microbiota contributes to resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens in the lung. However, whether intestinal microbiota composition and associated changes in microbe-derived metabolites contribute to the risk of LRTI following upper respiratory tract viral infection remains unexplored in the setting of allo-HCT. Fecal samples from 360 allo-HCT patients were collected at the time of stem cell engraftment and subjected to deep, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid levels were determined in a nested subset of fecal samples. The development of respiratory viral infections and LRTI was determined for 180 days following allo-HCT. Clinical and microbiota risk factors for LRTI were subsequently evaluated using survival analysis. Respiratory viral infection occurred in 149 (41.4%) patients. Of those, 47 (31.5%) developed LRTI. Patients with higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria were fivefold less likely to develop viral LRTI, independent of other factors (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.69). Higher representation of butyrate-producing bacteria in the fecal microbiota is associated with increased resistance against respiratory viral infection with LRTI in allo-HCT patients.© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493500>Prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Recurrent Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (rCDI) is common, and patients who have had one recurrence are more likely to have multiple recurrences. Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight    (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin ; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr  into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in  identified a significant reduction in the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice.

It has been estimated that there are 350 million chronic hepatitis  virus (HBV) carriers worldwide. The liver is connected to the small intestine by the bile duct, which carries bile formed in the liver to the intestine. Nearly all of the blood that leaves the stomach and intestines must pass through the liver. Human intestines contain a wide diversity of microbes, collectively termed the 'gut '. Gut  play a significant role in host metabolic processes and host immune modulation, and influence host development and physiology (organ development). Altered gut  is a common complication in liver disease. Changes in intestinal  seem to play an important role in induction and promotion of HBV-induced chronic liver disease progression, and specific species among the intestinal commensal bacteria may play either a pathogenic or a protective role in the development of HBV-induced chronic liver disease. Thus, the gut microbiome may represent fertile targets for prevention or management of HBV-induced chronic liver disease. Faecal   (FMT) may be a useful therapy for HBV-related disease in the future. However, the data available in this field remain limited, and relevant scientific work has only just commenced. New technologies have enabled systematic studies of gut , and provided more realistic information about its composition and pathological variance.

Antibiotic pretreated mice received vascularized cardiac allografts and   transfer (FMT), along with tacrolimus immunosuppression. FMT source samples were from normal, pregnant (immune suppressed), or spontaneously colitic (inflammation) mice. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (. pseudolongum) in pregnant FMT recipients was associated with prolonged allograft survival and lower inflammation and fibrosis, while normal or colitic FMT resulted in inferior survival and worse histology. Transfer of . pseudolongum alone resulted in reduced inflammation and fibrosis. Stimulation of DC and macrophage lines with . pseudolongum induced the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and homeostatic chemokine CCL19 but induced lesser amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6. In contrast, LPS and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (D. desulfuricans), more abundant in colitic FMT, induced a more inflammatory cytokine response. Analysis of mesenteric and peripheral lymph node structure showed that . pseudolongum gavage resulted in a higher laminin α4/α5 ratio in the lymph node cortical ridge, indicative of a suppressive environment, while D. desulfuricans resulted in a lower laminin α4/α5 ratio, supportive of inflammation.

In a prospective cohort study, we recruited blood donors onsite at a public Danish blood bank. Following their consent, the blood donors underwent a stepwise screening process: First, blood donors completed an electronic pre-screening questionnaire to rule out predisposing risk factors. Second, eligible blood donors had blood and  samples examined. Of 155 blood donors asked to participate, 137 (88%) completed the electronic pre-screening questionnaire, 16 declined, and 2 were excluded. Of the 137 donors who completed the questionnaire, 79 (58%) were excluded mainly due to having an allergy, being overweight, or presenting gastrointestinal complaints. Among the remaining 58 (37%) donors, complete blood and  screenings were obtained from 46 (79%). Of these 46 donors, 15 (33%) were excluded primarily due to abnormal blood results or the presence of apathogenic intestinal parasites.

Mortality due to rotavirus diarrhea is common in developing countries where malnutrition is prevalent; however, the relationship between malnutrition and rotavirus infection remains unclear. In this study, gnotobiotic pigs transplanted with the   of a healthy 2-month-old infant were fed protein-sufficient or -deficient diets and infected with virulent human rotavirus (HRV). After human rotavirus infection, protein-deficient pigs had decreased human rotavirus antibody titers and total IgA concentrations, systemic T helper (CD3 CD4) and cytotoxic T (CD3 CD8) lymphocyte frequencies, and serum tryptophan and angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2. Additionally, deficient-diet pigs had impaired tryptophan catabolism postinfection compared with sufficient-diet pigs. Tryptophan supplementation was tested as an intervention in additional groups of  -transplanted, rotavirus-infected, sufficient- and deficient-diet pigs. Tryptophan supplementation increased the frequencies of regulatory (CD4 or CD8 CD25 FoxP3) T cells in pigs on both the sufficient and the deficient diets. These results suggest that a protein-deficient diet impairs activation of the adaptive immune response following HRV infection and alters tryptophan homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28296584>Intestinal  and Relapse After Hematopoietic-Cell .</a></h2><p>Purpose The major causes of mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell  (allo-HCT) are relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infection. We have reported previously that alterations in the intestinal flora are associated with GVHD, bacteremia, and reduced overall survival after allo-HCT. Because intestinal bacteria are potent modulators of systemic immune responses, including antitumor effects, we hypothesized that components of the intestinal flora could be associated with relapse after allo-HCT. Methods The intestinal  of 541 patients admitted for allo-HCT was profiled by means of 16S ribosomal sequencing of prospectively collected stool samples. We examined the relationship between abundance of  species or groups of related species and relapse/progression of disease during 2 years of follow-up time after allo-HCT by using cause-specific proportional hazards in a retrospective discovery-validation cohort study. Results Higher abundance of a bacterial group composed mostly of Eubacterium limosum in the validation set was associated with a decreased risk of relapse/progression of disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 per 10-fold increase in abundance; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .009). When the patients were categorized according to presence or absence of this bacterial group, presence also was associated with less relapse/progression of disease (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.87; P = .01). The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse/progression among patients with and without this group of bacteria were 19.8% and 33.8%, respectively. These associations remained significant in multivariable models and were strongest among recipients of T-cell-replete allografts. Conclusion We found associations between the abundance of a group of bacteria in the intestinal flora and relapse/progression of disease after allo-HCT. These might serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets to prevent relapse and improve survival after allo-HCT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538686>Bezlotoxumab for Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection in Patients at Increased Risk for Recurrence.</a></h2><p>Bezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin  indicated to prevent C. difficile infection (CDI) recurrence (rCDI) in adults at high risk for rCDI.

Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U-C-inulin (INU) or ) 24 g maltodextrin placebo (PLA), with a wash-out period of at least five days. Fat oxidation was measured via an open-circuit ventilated hood and blood samples were collected up to 7 h after ingestion. Plasma, breath, and  samples were collected, and appetite and satiety scores were assessed.Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P < 0.05). Plasma free fatty acids were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma acetate concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma C-SCFA enrichments (P < 0.05 from t = 120 onwards) and breath CO enrichments after INU intake. There were no effects on plasma triglycerides, free glycerol, satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and appetite and satiety scores.Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men.

Malnutrition perturbs the infant gut  leading to sub-optimal functioning of the immune system and further predisposing infants to enteric infections. Therefore, we hypothesized that malnutrition exacerbates rotavirus disease severity in infants.In the present study, we used a neonatal germ free (GF) piglets transplanted with a two-month-old human infant's   (HIFM) on protein deficient and sufficient diets. We report the effects of malnourishment on the HRV infection and the HIFM pig  in , intestinal and systemic tissues, using MiSeq 16S gene sequencing (V4-V5 region). analysis indicated that the HIFM  resulted in a microbial composition in pigs similar to that of the original infant . This model was then used to understand the interconnections between  diversity, diet, and HRV infection. Post HRV infection, HIFM pigs on the deficient diet had lower body weights, developed more severe diarrhea and increased virus shedding compared to HIFM pigs on sufficient diet. However, HRV induced diarrhea and shedding was more pronounced in non-colonized GF pigs compared to HIFM pigs on either sufficient or deficient diet, suggesting that the  alone moderated HRV infection. HRV infected pigs on sufficient diet showed increased  diversity in intestinal tissues; whereas, greater diversity was observed in systemic tissues of HRV infected pigs fed with deficient diet.These results suggest that proper nourishment improves the  quality in the intestines, alleviates HRV disease and lower probability of systemic translocation of potential opportunistic pathogens/pathobionts.

Included Animal trials and cell assays describes different anti-inflammatory mechanisms of S. boulardii supporting a possible effect when treating IBD patients.The number of studies of S. boulardii as treatment for IBD is limited. Furthermore, the existing trials have small populations and short duration.We do not have enough evidence to prove the effect of S. boulardii in IBD. Saccharomyces boulardii is, however, a plausible treatment option in the future, but more placebo-controlled clinical studies on both patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519847>   Capsules with Targeted Colonic Versus Gastric Delivery in Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection: A Comparative Cohort Analysis of High and Lose Dose.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium. difficile infection (rCDI). FMT capsules have emerged, and it is unknown if delivery location and dose impact efficacy.We compared two cohorts of patients receiving two capsule formulations: gastric release (FMTgr) and targeted colonic release (FMTcr) at two different sites. Cohort A received FMTgr at (1) high dose: 60 capsules and low dose: 30 capsules. Patients in Cohort  received FMTcr at (1) high dose: 30 capsules (2) low dose: 10 capsules. Clinical cure rates and adverse events were monitored through week 8. Paired t-tests were used to compare diversity pre- and post-FMT.51 rCDI patients were enrolled. Cohort A contained n = 20 and Cohort  contained n = 31. Overall cure at week 8 for FMTgr was 75% (15/20) compared to 80.6% for FMTcr, (25/31), p = 0.63. Both formulations were safe with no serious adverse events. FMTcr was superior at increasing gut microbial diversity.To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare targeted delivery of FMT capsules. While both capsules were safe and efficacious, microbial engraftment patterns were superior in FMTcr.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27447476>   for Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection in the Elderly: Long-Term Outcomes and  Changes.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) has become the cornerstone in management of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI) in adults. However, data on efficacy, safety, long-term outcomes, and  alterations are limited in elderly patients (>65 years).Twenty-nine consecutive elderly patients with RCDI underwent FMT with combined jejunal and colonic method and monitored for long-term outcomes.  samples from five elderly RCDI patients (G65) were subjected to genomic analysis before and after FMT, and  changes were compared with matched RCDI patients below 65 years (L65).FMT resulted in marked improvement in all clinical parameters, including abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea in all elderly RCDI patients.  C. difficile toxin was positive in all 29 patients and turned negative in all 27 patients, who agreed to undergo this test after FMT. Statistically significant improvement in leukocytosis was noted (p < 0.05). Only adverse events reported were transient mild fever (2/29) and bloating (3/29). Long-term follow-up over 25.4 ± 12.8 months did not reveal any additional adverse events or RCDI recurrence. Genomic analysis suggested that overall  diversity increased post-FMT in elderly RCDI patients. However, this response was less robust than the younger group. While Firmicutes did not change markedly, Proteobacteria decreased significantly in post-FMT samples in elderly RCDI patients.These observations suggest that FMT in elderly patients with RCDI appears to be highly efficacious with no recurrence of infection over long-term follow-up. Alterations in  in this group of patients are characterized by less robust increase in microbial diversity and marked reduction in phylum Proteobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318396>A proposed definition of   for regulatory purposes.</a></h2><p>The advent of    (FMT) and the prospect of other types of   (MT), e.g. vaginal, skin, oral and nasal, are challenging regulatory agencies. Although FDA is regulating FMT (as a biologic), there is currently no widely accepted or agreed upon scientific or legal definition of FMT or MT. The authors report on discussions regarding a definition of MT that took place among a working group of stakeholders convened under a National Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases grant to address the regulation of MT. In arriving at a definition, the group considered the 1) nature of the material being transplanted; 2) degree of manipulation of the transferred materials prior to implantation; 3) ability to characterize the transplanted product using external techniques; and 4) origin of the stool product (single vs multiple donors).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658519>Gut-Liver Axis, Gut , and Its Modulation in the Management of Liver Diseases: A Review of the Literature.</a></h2><p>The rapid scientific interest in gut  (GM) has coincided with a global increase in the prevalence of infectious and non-infectivous liver diseases. GM, which is also called "the new virtual metabolic organ", makes axis with a number of extraintestinal organs, such as kidneys, brain, cardiovascular, and the bone system. The gut-liver axis has attracted greater attention in recent years. GM communication is bi-directional and involves endocrine and immunological mechanisms. In this way, gut-dysbiosis and composition of "ancient"  could be linked to pathogenesis of numerous chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis  (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), development of liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this paper, we discuss the current evidence supporting a GM role in the management of different chronic liver diseases and potential new therapeutic GM targets, like  , antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics. We conclude that population-level shifts in GM could play a regulatory role in the gut-liver axis and, consequently, etiopathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. This could have a positive impact on future therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28609252>   in metabolic syndrome: History, present and future.</a></h2><p>The history of    (FMT) dates back even to ancient China. Recently, scientific studies have been looking into FMT as a promising treatment of various diseases, while in the process teaching us about the interaction between the human host and its resident microbial communities. Current research focuses mainly on Clostridium difficile infections, however interest is rising in other areas such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the metabolic syndrome. With regard to the latter, the intestinal  might be causally related to the progression of insulin resistance and diabetes. FMT in metabolic syndrome has proven to be an intriguing method to study the role of the gut  and open the way to new therapies by dissecting in whom insulin resistance is driven by . In this article we review the history of FMT, the present evidence on its role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome and its efficacy, limitations and future prospects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27577172>High fat diet drives obesity regardless the composition of gut  in mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  is involved in many aspects of host physiology but its role in body weight and glucose metabolism remains unclear. Here we studied the compositional changes of gut  in diet-induced obesity mice that were conventionally raised or received  . In conventional mice, the diversity of the faecal  was weakly associated with 1(st) week weight gain but transferring the  of mice with contrasting weight gain to germfree mice did not change obesity development or feed efficiency of recipients regardless whether the  was taken before or after 10 weeks high fat (HF) feeding. Interestingly, HF-induced glucose intolerance was influenced by  inoculation and improved glucose tolerance was associated with a low Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio.  of Bacteroidetes rich  compared to a control  ameliorated glucose intolerance caused by HF feeding. Altogether, our results demonstrate that gut  is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly modulates HF-induced glucose intolerance but has limited impact on obesity in mice. Our results suggest that gut  is a part of complex aetiology of insulin resistance syndrome, individual  composition may cause phenotypic variation associated with HF feeding in mice.</p></html>
