<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680281>Liver Fat and Cardio-metabolic Risk Factors among School Age Children.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a major risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease in adults. The burden of liver fat and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors in healthy children is unknown. In a population-based prospective cohort study among 3,170 10-year old children, we assessed whether both liver fat accumulation across the full range and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors already in childhood. Liver fat fraction was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was defined as liver fat fraction ≥5.0%. We measured body mass index, blood pressure, and , glucose, lipids and C-reactive protein concentrations. Cardio-metabolic clustering was defined as having three or more risk factors out of high visceral fat mass, high blood pressure, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglycerides, and high  concentrations. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease prevalences were 1.0%, 9.1% and 25.0% among normal weight, overweight and obese children, respectively. Both higher liver fat within the normal range (<5.0% liver fat) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were associated with higher blood pressure, , total-cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive protein concentrations (p-values <0.05). As compared to children with <2.0% liver fat, children with ≥5.0% liver fat had the highest odds of cardio-metabolic clustering (Odds Ratio 24.43 (95% Confidence Interval 12.25, 48.60)). The associations remained similar after adjustment for body mass index and tended to be stronger in overweight and obese children. Conclusions: Higher liver fat is, across the full range and independently of body mass index, associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile already in childhood. Future preventive strategies focused on improving cardio-metabolic outcomes in later life may need to target liver fat development in childhood.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657254>[Musculoskeletal relevance of obesity: a new approach to an old topic].</a></h1><p>Authors discuss the musculoskeletal aspects of obesity by applying a novel approach. Biochemical changes associated with obesity and especially metabolic syndrome, may have a great impact on the function of bones, joints and muscles. Therefore we need a new view and new strategies in rheumatic diseases. Obesity-associated metabolic changes should be considered during the progress of as well as the selection of treatment in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Individualised treatment is necessary due to associated comorbidities as well.

Protein kinases are implicated in  signaling and glucose metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying OIR involving global kinase activities remain incompletely understood.To investigate abnormal kinase activity associated with OIR in human skeletal muscle.Stable isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics combined with affinity-based​​ active enzyme probes to profile in vivo kinase activity in skeletal muscle from lean control (Lean) and OIR participants.Eight Lean and eight OIR non-diabetic human adults who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with muscle biopsy.We identified the 1st active kinome comprised of 54 active protein kinases in human skeletal muscle. The activities of 23 kinases were different in OIR compared to Lean muscle (11 hyper- and 12 hypo-active), while their protein abundance was the same between the two groups. The activities of multiple kinases involved in AMPK and p38 signaling were lower in OIR compared to Lean. On the contrary, multiple kinases in the JNK signaling pathway exhibited higher activity in OIR vs. Lean. The kinase-substrate-prediction based on experimental data further confirmed a potential down-regulation of  signaling (e.g., inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT1/2).These findings provide a global view of the kinome activity in OIR and Lean muscle, pinpoint novel specific impairment in kinase activities in signaling pathways important for skeletal muscle  and may provide potential drug targets (i.e., abnormal kinase activities) to prevent and/or reverse skeletal muscle  in humans.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Subjects were examined during an oral glucose stimulus and results compared to preoperative and 1-year (1 y) post RYGB results. Glucose tolerance, , beta-cell function and incretin hormone secretion were evaluated. 1 y weight loss was maintained late after surgery. Glycemic control, , beta-cell function and GLP-1 remained improved late after surgery in both groups. In NGT subjects, nadir glucose decreased 1 y after RYGB, but did not change further. In T2D patients, relative change in weight from 1 y to late after RYGB correlated with relative change in fasting glucose and HbA1c, whereas relative changes in glucose-stimulated  release correlated inversely with relative changes in postprandial glucose excursions. In NGT subjects, relative changes in postprandial nadir glucose correlated with changes in beta-cell glucose sensitivity. Thus, effects of RYGB on weight and glucose metabolism are maintained late after surgery in patients with and without preoperative T2D. Weight loss and improved beta-cell function both contribute to maintenance of long-term glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, and increased glucose stimulated  secretion may contribute to postprandial hypoglycemia in NGT subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and , genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, , IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia,  and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h1><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed , reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and activation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signaling may reverse this effect. However, whether angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation improve oxidative damage and albuminuria through different mechanisms is not known. Using  resistant Otsuka Long Evan Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of AT1 and activation of GLP-1r additively decrease oxidative damage and urinary albumin excretion (U V) in the following groups: (1) untreated, lean LETO (n=7), (2) untreated, obese OLETF (n=9), (3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10 mg olmesartan /kg/d; n=9), (4) OLETF + GLP-1 mimetic (EXE; 10 ug exenatide/kg/d; n=7), and (5) OLETF + ARB + exenatide (Combo; n=6). Mean kidney Nox4 protein expression and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels were 30% and 46% greater, respectively, in OLETF compared to LETO. Conversely, Nox4 protein expression and NT were reduced to LETO levels in ARB and EXE, and Combo reduced Nox4, NT, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal levels by 21%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. At baseline, U V was nearly double in OLETF compared to LETO, and increased to nearly 10-fold greater levels by the end of the study. While ARB (45%) and EXE (55%) individually reduced U V, the combination completely ameliorated the albuminuria. Collectively, these data suggest that AT1 blockade and GLP-1 receptor activation reduce renal oxidative damage similarly during , while targeting both signaling pathways provides added benefit in restoring and/or further ameliorating albuminuria in a model of diet-induced obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle  in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat Metabolism.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle  sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by . Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668310>Glucose and  Responses to an Intravenous Glucose Load in Thoroughbred and Paso Fino Horses.</a></h1><p>Certain breeds of horses may be genetically predisposed to developing  dysregulation, which is a risk factor for development of endocrinopathic laminitis in horses. This study was performed to test the hypotheses that Paso Fino horses exhibit evidence of  dysregulation compared with Thoroughbred horses and that obesity exaggerates the  dysregulation. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed in 14 moderate-weight Thoroughbreds, 12 moderate-weight Paso Finos, and 12 overweight Paso Finos. Moderate Paso Finos had greater baseline serum  concentrations, area under the  concentration curve, peak , -to-glucose ratio, area under the  to glucose curve, and modified glucose-to- ratio compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. The reciprocal inverse square of basal  (RISQI) and glucose-to- ratio were significantly lower in moderate Paso Finos compared with moderate Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had greater baseline  concentrations, area under the  concentration curve, time to peak , baseline plasma glucose concentration, -to-glucose ratio, and area under the  to glucose curve compared with moderate Paso Finos. The RISQI and glucose-to- ratio were significantly lower in overweight Paso Finos compared with moderate Paso Finos. In conclusion, moderate-weight Paso Finos had higher baseline serum  concentrations and an excessive hyperinsulinemic response to an intravenous glucose load when compared with moderate-weight Thoroughbreds. Overweight Paso Finos had even greater baseline  concentrations and hyperinsulinemic responses to glucose compared with moderate Paso Finos, as well as greater baseline plasma glucose concentrations. Paso Finos exhibit  dysregulation compared with Thoroughbreds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Of the two predominant Aβ alloforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42, the latter is particularly strongly linked to AD. Longitudinal studies revealed a correlation between AD and type 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized by abnormal  levels and . Although administration of intranasal  is explored as a therapy against AD, the extent to which  affects Aβ dynamics and activity is unclear. We here investigate the effect of  on Aβ42 self-assembly and characterize the capacity of , Aβ42, and Aβ42 co-incubated with  to disrupt the integrity of biomimetic lipid vesicles. We demonstrate that quiescently incubated , which does not form amyloid fibrils, over time develops membrane-disrupting capacity, which we propose to originate in misfolded  monomers. These hypothetically toxic misfolded monomers might contribute to the development of  in early stages of T2D that are associated with abnormally high  levels. We show that in contrast to quiescent incubation,  incubated under agitated conditions readily forms amyloid fibrils, which protect against membrane permeation.  quiescently incubated with Aβ42 attenuates both Aβ42 fibril formation and the ability of Aβ42 to disrupt membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings offer insights into interactions between  and Aβ42 that are relevant to understanding the molecular basis of intranasal  as a therapy against Aβ-induced AD pathology, thereby elucidating a plausible mechanism underlying the observed correlations between AD and T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641635>Comparison of the Different PCOS Phenotypes Based on Clinical Metabolic, and Hormonal Profile, and their Response to Clomiphene.</a></h1><p>To compare the different polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes based on their clinical, metabolic, hormonal profile, and their differential response to clomiphene.Prospective observational study.Infertility clinic, a government hospital.164 women with PCOS-related infertility.Sample population was divided into four phenotypes based on the NIH (National Institute of Health) consensus panel criteria. The incremental dose of clomiphene from 50 to 150 mg/day over three cycles was given.Clinical history, metabolic, hormonal profile, and ultrasound features of each phenotype. Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting , HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene  was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, 2-hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with metabolic syndrome and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE interaction contributes to fat accumulation in the liver leading to inflammation, fibrosis, , and other complications of the fatty liver disease. The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669422>Differential metabolic and multi-tissue transcriptomic responses to fructose consumption among genetically diverse mice.</a></h1><p>Understanding how individuals react differently to the same treatment is a major concern in precision medicine. Metabolic challenges such as the one posed by high fructose intake are important determinants of disease mechanisms. We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential metabolic dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/2 J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type 2 diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AGEs are formed when reducing sugars non-enzymatically bind to proteins or lipids, a process that is enhanced by hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic environments characteristic of numerous metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes and its complications. In this mini-review, we put forth the notion that AGEs span the spectrum from cause to consequence of  (IR) and diabetes, and represent a "common soil" underlying the pathophysiology of these metabolic disorders. Collectively, the surveyed literature suggests that AGEs, both those that form endogenously as well as exogenous AGEs derived from environmental factors such as pollution, smoking and "Western" style diets, contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Specifically, AGE accumulation in key metabolically-relevant organs induces IR, inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn provide substrates for excess AGE formation, thus, creating a feed-forward fueled pathological loop mediating metabolic dysfunction.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts fat metabolism and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral fat were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and  (p < 0.001).  was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral fat were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic acid (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism. Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach.

We investigated the safety of naringenin, its effects on metabolic rate, and blood glucose and  responses in a single female subject with diabetes. The subject ingested 150 mg naringenin from an extract of whole oranges standardized to 28% naringenin three times/day for 8 weeks, and maintained her usual food intake.

Adverse events were evaluated every 2 weeks. We also examined the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase G (PKG) in the response of human adipocytes to naringenin treatment. Compared to baseline, the body weight decreased by 2.3 kg. The metabolic rate peaked at 3.5% above baseline at 1 h, but there was no change in the respiratory quotient.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly  sensitive, which could result from higher rates of -stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic lipid availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) -stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion,  sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased lipid availability, which primarily results from maintained -stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647291>Associations between homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and routinely examined parameters in individuals with metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether routine clinical parameters, including visceral adiposity index (VAI) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), could become widely applicable predictors of  (IR), evaluated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta), with regard to presence of metabolic syndrome (MS).

In a multivariate linear regression model, the predictors of HOMA-IR were WC (linear coefficient beta=0.1, p<0.001), ALT (beta=2.28, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (beta=0.04, p<0.001). HOMA-beta was determined by WC (beta=1.97, p=0.032) and ALT (beta=99.49, p=0.004) and inversely associated with age (beta=-1.31, p=0.004). Neither VAI nor AIP were significant predictors. The presence of MS was significantly associated with both HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta. These results indicate that WC and ALT appear to be reliable predictors of IR. Comprehensive assessment of these parameters may serve for estimating the level of IR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663469>Effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and serum lipids.</a></h1><p>Pterostilbene, a phenolic compound derived from resveratrol, possesses greater bioavailability than its parent compound due to the presence of two methoxyl groups. In this review, the beneficial effects of pterostilbene on diabetes, liver steatosis and dyslipidemia are summarized. Pterostilbene is a useful bioactive compound in preventing type 1 diabetes,  and type 2 diabetes in animal models. Concerning type 1 diabetes, the main mechanisms described to justify the positive effects of this phenolic compound are increased liver glycogen content and hepatic glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities, the recovery of pancreatic islet architecture, cytoprotection and a decrease in serum and pancreatic pro-inflammatory cytokines. As for type 2 diabetes, increased liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase and decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activities are reported. When  is induced by diets, a greater activation of  signaling cascade has been reported, increased cardiotrophin-1 levels and liver glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities, and a decreased fructose-1,6-biphosphatase activity. Data concerning pterostilbene and liver steatosis are scarce so far, but the reduction in oxidative stress induced by pterostilbene may be involved since oxidative stress is related to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. Finally, pterostilbene effectivelly reduces total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, while increases HDL-cholesterol in animal models of dyslipidemia.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661295>Effects of resistant starch on glycemic control, serum lipoproteins and systemic inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.</a></h1><p>The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of resistant starch (RS) on glycemic status, serum lipoproteins and inflammatory markers in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related disorders. Two independent authors systematically searched online database including EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception until 30 April 2019. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of included trials. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and I-square (I) statistic. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and weighted mean difference (WMD) was considered as the overall effect size. Nineteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. Administration of RS resulted in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (14 studies) (WMD: -4.28; 95% CI: -7.01, -1.55),  (12 studies) (WMD: -1.95; 95% CI: -3.22, -0.68), and HbA1C (8 studies) (WMD: -0.60; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.24). When pooling data from 13 studies, a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels (WMD: -8.19; 95% CI: -15.38, -1.00) and LDL-cholesterol (WMD: -8.57; 95% CI: -13.48, -3.66) were found as well. Finally, RS administration was associated with a significant decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (WMD: -2.02; 95% CI: -3.14, -0.90).

There are several studies connecting sugar/sweetened beverages to the cardiovascular disease. Currently, many sweeteners have been extensively introduced into lifestyle to normalize blood glucose levels without altering the sweet taste. However, there is growing concern for their impact on metabolic health.Human endothelial cells were treated with Glucose, Fructose, Aspartame, Rebaudioside A, Stevioside, or Steviol. Morphological characteristics, in vitro angiogenesis and array gene expression were analyzed.High-glucose and fructose concentrations significantly decreased cell features such as angiogenic capability. Interestingly, non-caloric sweeteners did not significantly modified all cell characteristics and they did not compromised cell angiogenic ability. Array gene expression analysis revealed that the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and the enzyme transferase (HPRT1) were always significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively, after glucose and fructose treatments (P > .05), whereas they were non-differentially expressed with all the other sweeteners. Interestingly, both genes are considered as cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers. Specifically, upregulation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 occurs in the human placenta and serum levels of the ligand are associated with markers of  in GDM.Differently from glucose and fructose, steviol glycosides do not damage endothelial cells. Prospective preclinical studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm the long-term safety of such compounds.Copyright © 2019.

The co-existence of CAD,  (IR) and coagulation incongruity are believed to exacerbate the existing condition towards more lethal pathological events.The purpose of current study was to find out a possible association between fibrinogen and IR in CAD patients. The study population consist of 135 participants; 82 angiographically confirmed CAD patients who visited the outpatient department at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah and 53 healthy control individuals. Peripheral blood samples were collected from CAD patients and healthy control individuals. Various biochemical parameters such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), , C-peptide, lipid profile, platelet, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured by the use of different analytical methods. Calculation of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and non-HDL were done by using online tools. Among the studied parameters, majority of the conventional risk factors were found to be significantly increased in CAD patients compared with control individuals. Different coagulation components such as fibrinogen (223.8 vs. 394 mg/dL), D-dimer (0.25 vs. 0.63 mg/L), platelet (222.9 vs. 245.9 K/uL) and PTT (27.6 vs. 29.6 seconds) were also found to be significantly enhanced in CAD patients. Based on the severity of IR [HOMA index up to 3 and ≥ 3], comparison with different parameters such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-peptide and  in CAD groups were also made. As per HOMA index, fibrinogen level was found to be significantly increased in below and above 3 categories. Moreover, C-peptide (P < 0.01) and  (P < 0.001) levels also showed significant association with both HOMA groups. Our study provides an insight towards the association of fibrinogen and IR in CAD patients with respect to severity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672148>Association of PCSK9 plasma levels with metabolic patterns and coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable angina.</a></h1><p>Aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of plasma PCSK9 with metabolic and inflammatory profile and coronary atherosclerotic burden in patients with suspected CAD enrolled in the EVINCI study.PCSK9 was measured in 539 patients (60.3 ± 8.6 years, 256 males) with symptoms of CAD characterized by risk factors, bio-humoral profiles, and treatment. N = 412 patients underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the presence and characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis. A CTA score, combining extent, severity, composition, and location of plaques was computed.Patients were divided according to PCSK9 quartiles: I (< 136 ng/mL), II-III (136-266 ng/mL), and IV quartile (> 266 ng/mL). Compared with patients in quartile IV, patients in quartile I had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and higher values of body mass index. LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in patients in the quartile I than in those in quartile IV. Coronary CTA documented normal vessels in 30% and obstructive CAD in 35% of cases without differences among PCSK9 quartiles. Compared with patients with the highest levels, patients with the lowest PCSK9 levels had a higher CTA score mainly due to higher number of mixed non-obstructive coronary plaques. At multivariable analysis including clinical, medications, and lipid variables, PCSK9 was an independent predictor of the CTA score (coefficient - 0.129, SE 0.03, P < 0.0001), together with age, male gender, statins, interleukin-6, and leptin.In patients with stable CAD, low PCSK9 plasma levels are associated with a particular metabolic phenotype (low HDL cholesterol, the metabolic syndrome, obesity,  and diabetes) and diffuse non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis.

We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and development of  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679020>Metabolic syndrome and related risk factors among adults in the northern West Bank, a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that includes central obesity, , dyslipidaemia and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of MetS and its associated risk factors among adult Palestinians using the International Diabetes Federation definition.A total of 1348 subjects ages 18-65 y were recruited in a cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2018-2019 in the northern West Bank.A total of 1082 subjects participated; 51.7% were men. The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.2%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and  have been associated with the frailty syndrome. However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.2% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.2,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-2.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-2.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various metabolic, immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty syndrome. To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special metabolic states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659910> for Diabetes Mellitus: Past, Present and Future.</a></h1><p> (Radix Puerariae Lobatae), the root of , is an edible and medicinal herb which has been used in treating diabetic symptoms in the orient for thousands of years. We present an evidence map of the efficacy and safety of  and  formulas (GGFs) that use  as an essential herb for diabetes, and also its mechanism of actions. We comprehensively searched the ancient medical records to identify empirical evidence; conducted a systematic review (SR) based on moderate- to high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to synthesize the clinical evidence; and reviewed the possible mechanisms of its antidiabetic effects. Empirical application of  in treating diabetic symptoms dated back to more than 2000 years ago. Common herbs used in RCTs that accompany with  included Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae, Radix et Rhizoma Ginseng, Rhizoma Dioscoreae, Poria, and Radix Ophiopogonis. The combinations used today are consistent with their usage in ancient times. Results of the SR showed that GGFs could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes for blood glucose control. When in combination with hypoglycemic agents or , GGFs enhanced the glucose-lowering effect as well as the lipid-lowering effects. Also, the incidence and the risk of adverse events (AE), especially the hypoglycemic episodes, were lower in the combination group. No serious or life-threatening AE was reported.

As augmented arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the increased predisposition of obese and -resistant women to arterial stiffening may explain their heightened risk for CVD. However, the cellular mechanisms by which females are more vulnerable to arterial stiffening associated with obesity and  remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that female mice are more susceptible to Western diet-induced endothelial cell stiffening compared to age-matched males. Mechanistically, we show that the increased stiffening of the vascular intima in Western diet-fed female mice is accompanied by enhanced epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in endothelial cells (EnNaC). Our data further indicate that: 1) estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) increases EnNaC activity to a larger extent in females compared to males, 2) estrogen-induced activation of EnNaC is mediated by the serum glucocorticoid inducible-kinase 1 (SGK-1), and 3) estrogen signaling stiffens endothelial cells when nitric oxide is lacking and this stiffening effect can be reduced with amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor. In aggregate, we demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in obesity-associated endothelial stiffening, whereby females are more vulnerable than males. In females, endothelial stiffening with obesity may be attributed to estrogen signaling through the ERα-SGK-1-EnNaC axis, thus establishing a putative therapeutic target for female obesity-related vascular stiffening.© Endocrine Society 2019.

In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing . However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce . A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving .

Unsurprisingly, disruptions of the circadian rhythms through sleep curtailment or shift work have been connected through numerous studies to positive associations with obesity, , and diabetes. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) measures oscillation in messenger RNA expression, an essential foundation for the study of the physiological circadian regulatory network. Primarily, measured oscillations have involved the use of reference gene normalization. However, the validation and identification of suitable reference genes is a significant challenge across different biological systems. This study focuses on adipose tissue of premenopausal, otherwise healthy, morbidly obese women voluntarily enrolled after being scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Acquisition of tissue was accomplished by aspiratory needle biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery and 12 to 13 weeks following surgery and an in-surgery scalpel-assisted excision of mesenteric adipose tissue. Each biopsy was sterile cultured ex vivo and serially collected every 4 h over approximately 36 h. The candidate reference genes that were tested were 18S rRNA, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPII, RPL13α, and YWHAZ. Three analytic tools were used to test suitability, and the candidate reference genes were used to measure oscillation in expression of a known circadian clock element (Dbp). No gene was deemed suitable as an individual reference gene control, which indicated that the optimal reference gene set was the geometrically averaged 3-gene panel composed of YWHAZ, RPL13α, and GAPDH.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, , serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and , and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648561>KLF15-activating Twist2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting inflammation and improving mitochondrial dysfunction  NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway.</a></h1><p>Twist-related protein 2 (TWIST2) is identified as a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription repressor by dimerizing with other b-HLH proteins. The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, , and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by -targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, , and fasting  concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some metabolic outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant  secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21.  and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

SOD3 expression and release were evaluated in adipocytes differentiated from primary human preadipocytes and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The regulatory role for SOD3 was determined by SOD3 lentivirus knockdown in human adipocytes and global SOD3 KO mice. SOD3 was expressed at high levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes were the main cells expressing SOD3 in adipose tissue. SOD3 expression was significantly elevated in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, SOD3 expression and release were markedly increased in differentiated human adipocytes and adipocytes differentiated from mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to undifferentiated cells. In addition, SOD3 silencing in human adipocytes increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways such as PPARγ and SREBP1c and promoted the accumulation of triglyceride. Finally, global SOD3 KO mice were more obese and  resistant with enlarged adipose tissue and increased triglyceride accumulation.Our data showed that SOD3 is secreted from adipocytes and regulates lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. This important discovery may open up new avenues of research for the cytoprotective role of SOD3 in obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.SOD3 is a protective factor secreted by adipocytes in response to HFD-induced obesity and regulates adipose tissue lipid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673468>Visceral adiposity indicators as predictors of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women.</a></h1><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of visceral adiposity indicators on metabolic parameters in postmenopausal women.This cross-sectional study included 200 postmenopausal subjects. Postmenopausal women were divided into two groups based on the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as MetS+ and MetS-. Comparisons of clinical and metabolic characteristics were performed between the groups.The current study included 200 postmenopausal women and 63 subjects were diagnosed as having MetS. Postmenopausal women with MetS demonstrated significantly higher values with respect to systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), triglyceride (TG), lipid ratios, Homeostasis Model Assessment  (HOMA) index, TG glucose (TyG), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) when compared with women without MetS. Correlation analyses showed that LAP and VAI were positively correlated with waist circumference, WHR, BMI, TG, lipid ratios, TyG and HOMA index, and with each other. LAP was also positively correlated with blood pressures.Visceral adiposity indicators may be useful as predictors of MetS in postmenopausal women.©Copyright 2019 by Turkish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology | Turkish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology published by Galenos Publishing House.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646823>Correlations of recurrence after radical surgery for esophageal cancer with glucose-lipid metabolism, , inflammation, stress and serum p53 expression.</a></h1><p>Esophageal cancer mortality trends vary substantially across the world.

Diagnostic BPD and BPD-related traits, for instance, have been shown to associate with self-reported cardiovascular disease and various cardiometabolic risk factors. However, potential confounding of these associations by comorbid depression, which itself contributes to risk for heart disease, remains unresolved, and previous research is limited by nearly uniform reliance on self-reported health status. In the present study, we examine the association of BPD traits and contemporaneously assessed depressive mood with instrumented measures of cardiometabolic risk in a midlife community sample ( = 1,295). BPD pathology was measured using dimensional, multi-informant trait measures; depressive symptomology was self-reported; and cardiometabolic risk was indexed via multiple indicators of , adiposity, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the effects of BPD traits and depressive symptoms on aggregated cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for their shared variance. Results showed both BPD features and depressive symptomatology related to the extent of cardiometabolic risk; when examined simultaneously, only BPD associated independently with risk indicators. In further supporting a link between BPD pathology and cardiovascular disease risk, these findings warrant future work to elucidate intervening behavioral and biological mechanisms.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia, obesity and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676315>Protective role of adiponectin against testicular impairment in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder, leading to reproductive impairments and infertility in male. Our recent study showed crucial role of adiponectin in the regulation of testicular functions, and the circulating level of adiponectin declines in diabetes. The current study thus aimed to examine the efficacy of adiponectin in improving testicular dysfunction in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced T2D mice. T2D was induced in pre-pubertal mice fed with high-fat diet for ∼10 weeks followed by single treatment of streptozotocin. T2D mice showed presence of increased body mass, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , increased oxidative stress, and declined serum testosterone compared to vehicle-treated control mice. The spermatogenic, steroidogenic, metabolic, and antioxidative parameters were evaluated in T2D mice treated with adiponectin for both two and four weeks. The exogenous administration of adiponectin to T2D mice showed enhanced serum testosterone and expression of testicular steroidogenic markers proteins,  receptor and GLUT8 proteins, increase in intra-testicular concentrations of glucose and lactate and activity of LDH and antioxidant enzymes compared to the levels in untreated T2D mice. This suggests that treatment of adiponectin effectively improves testicular functions by increasing expression of  receptor-mediated increased transport of energy substrate (glucose and lactate) and a marked reduction in oxidative stress are the possible mechanism by which adiponectin effectively improves testicular function in T2D mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Increased consumption of unhealthy, calorie-dense foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyles, is the main factor contributing to a positive energy balance and the development of obesity. Leptin and  are key hormones implicated in pathogenesis of this disorder and are crucial for controlling whole-body energy homeostasis. Their respective function is mediated by the counterbalance of anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons located within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Dysregulation of leptin and  signaling pathways within this brain region may contribute not only to the development of obesity, but also systemically affect the peripheral organs, thereby manifesting as metabolic diseases. Although the exact mechanisms detailing how these hypothalamic nuclei contribute to disease pathology are still unclear, increasing evidence suggests that altered DNA methylation may be involved. This review evaluates animal studies that have demonstrated diet-induced DNA methylation changes in genes that regulate energy homeostasis within the arcuate nucleus, and elucidates possible mechanisms causing hypothalamic leptin and  leading to the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report that a pheromone mixture that signals overcrowding inhibits C. elegans from learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria. We find that learning depends on the balanced signaling of two -like peptides (ILPs), INS-16 and INS-4, which act respectively in the pheromone-sensing neuron ADL and the bacteria-sensing neuron AWA. Pheromone exposure inhibits learning by disrupting this balance: it activates ADL and increases expression of ins-16, and this cellular effect reduces AWA activity and AWA-expressed ins-4. The activities of the sensory neurons are required for learning and the expression of the ILPs. Interestingly, pheromones also promote the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria while increasing  to the pathogen. Thus, the balance of the ILP signals integrates social information into the learning process as part of a coordinated adaptive response that allows consumption of harmful food during times of high population density.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum , glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of , body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001).

The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess  signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic  sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived  secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial  secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition. Longer-term studies will be needed to evaluate the safety and metabolic efficacy in diabetes patients.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as .Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino acid supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h1><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the energy status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by  and amino acid availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing  to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino acid supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among 976 identified publications, 20 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The initial search was extended to include five studies published between July 2016 and September 2018.Maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, cesarean section, maternal parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations, and infant gestational age, birth weight, and birth length.Mean differences, odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, only for the initial search, using separate random-effects meta-analyses for each outcome.Evidence was good or strong that maternal vitamin D supplementation significantly increased maternal (13 studies, n=18, mean difference, 14.1 ng/mL [35.2 nmol/L]; 95% CI=9.6-18.6 ng/mL [24.0-46.4 nmol/L]) and infant (nine studies, n=12; 9.7, 5.2, 14.2 ng/mL [24.2, 12.9, 35.5 nmol/L]) 25(OH)D concentrations, although heterogeneity was significant (I=95.9% and I=97.4, respectively, P<0.001). Evidence was fair that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreases maternal homeostatic model assessment- (five studies, n=7; -1.1, -1.5, -0.7) and increases infant birth weight (nine studies, n=11, 114.2, 63.4, 165.1 g), both had insignificant heterogeneity. A null effect of maternal supplementation on other maternal (preeclampsia, cesarean section) and infant (gestational age, birth length) outcomes was found.Results show vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves maternal and infant 25(OH)D concentrations and may play a role in maternal  and fetal growth. To further inform practice and policies on the amount of vitamin D, which supports a healthy pregnancy, high quality dose-response randomized clinical trials, which assess pregnancy-specific 25(OH)D thresholds, and appropriately powered clinical outcomes are needed.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

A series of reactions are involved in this process, including increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors. Among the therapeutic tools available nowadays, physical exercise (PE) has a known hypoglycemic effect explained by complex molecular mechanisms, including an increase in  receptor phosphorylation, in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) pathway, with subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), Rac1, TBC1 domain family member 1 and 4 (TBC1D1 and TBC1D4), in addition to a variety of signaling molecules, such as GTPases, Rab and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. These pathways promote greater translocation of GLUT4 and consequent glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and some of its isoforms, such as PKC-iota/lambda also seem to play a fundamental role in the transport of glucose. In this sense, the association between autophagy and exercise has also demonstrated a relevant role in the uptake of muscle glucose. , in turn, uses a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism, while exercise signal may be triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The objective of this review is to describe the main molecular mechanisms of IR and the relationship between PE and glucose uptake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669858>News and views in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): The role of co-morbidity and novel treatments.</a></h1><p>Though affecting many thousands of patients, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) should be considered an orphan disease, since the cause remains elusive and no treatment is available that can provide complete cure.

Here, we demonstrate that maternal high fat diet (HFD)-dependent  multigenerationally impairs synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. HFD downregulates BDNF and  signaling in maternal tissues and epigenetically inhibits BDNF expression in both germline and hippocampus of progeny. Notably, exposure of the HFD offspring to novel enriched environment restores Bdnf epigenetic activation in the male germline and counteracts the transmission of cognitive impairment to the next generations. BDNF administration to HFD-fed mothers or preserved  sensitivity in HFD-fed p66Shc KO mice also prevents the intergenerational transmission of brain damage to the progeny.

The preterm group showed lower concentrations of HDL-c (60.1 ± 10.1 vs. 69.0 ± 10.0 mg/dL; p < 0.001); higher concentrations of hs-CRP [0.55 mg/dL (0.30; 39.4) vs. 0.30 mg/dL (0.30; 10.80); p = 0.043], of MPO [21.1 ng/mL (5.7; 120.0) vs. 8.1 ng/mL (2.6; 29.6); p < 0.001] and of MPO/HDL-c ratio [0.39 (0.09; 2.07) ng/mg vs. 0.11 (0.05; 0.58)]. The MPO/HDL-c ratio was the variable that showed the best discriminatory power between the groups (AUC = 0.878; 95% CI; 0.795-0.961).

Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome is also caused by defects of the  receptor gene (INSR) but is more serious than type A IRS. We here performed a nationwide survey of these syndromes in Japan.We sent questionnaires to a total of 1957 academic councilors or responsible individuals at certified facilities of the Japan Diabetes Society as well as at the department pediatrics or neonatology in medical centers with >300 beds.We received 904 responses with information on 23, 30, and 10 cases of type A or B IRS and Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome, respectively. Eight cases with type A IRS-like clinical features but without an abnormality of INSR were tentatively designated type X IRS, with five of these cases testing positive for PIK3R1 mutations. Fasting serum  levels at diagnosis (means±SD) were 132.0±112.4, 1122.1±3292.5, 2895.5±3181.5, and 145.0±141.4 μU/ml for type A IRS, type B IRS, Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome, and type X IRS, respectively. Type A and type X IRS as well as Rabson-Mendenhall/Donohue syndrome were associated with low birth weight. Type B IRS was diagnosed most frequently in elderly individuals and was often associated with concurrent autoimmune conditions and hypoglycemia.Information yielded by this first nationwide survey should provide epidemiological insight into these rare conditions and inform better health care for affected patients.© 2019 The Authors.

However not all data is convergent regarding the exact impact of this SNP on the pattern of disease progression in different clinical settings. In this study, we aimed to further bridge the knowledge gap on this topic by investigating the role of the G allele in promoting steatosis, fibrosis and disease progression in relation to other metabolic and anthropometric host factors. Two hundred and fifty consecutive patients, previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) underwent liver biopsy. Histology was assessed using the Metavir scoring system. Transient elastography was used for follow-up. Ninety-eight patients were genotyped for PNPLA3 rs738409 and followed up for fibrosis progression. PNPLA3 rs738409[G] allele was significantly correlated with severe steatosis (P = 0.04), severe fibrosis at the time of enrollment (P = 0.0005) and fibrosis progression with an OR of 10.31 (95% CI 1.06 - 99.59, P = 0.04), after a mean follow-up time of 62.85 (95%CI: 52.21 - 76.15) months. Severe steatosis at the time of enrollment had an OR of 11.02 (95% CI 1.48 - 82.09, P = 0.01) for the association with fibrosis progression. The HOMA-IR index was also positively correlated with severe fibrosis (P = 0.03) and fibrosis progression on univariate analysis (P = 0.02).

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has recently emerged as an attractive target for obesity treatment. Here we demonstrate that isotschimgine (ITG), a constituent in genus Ferula, as a novel FXR agonist with anti-obesity and anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The results showed that ITG activated the FXR transactivity and bound with the ligand binding dormain (LBD) of FXR with gene reporter assays and AlphaScreen assays. In high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, ITG lowered body weight and fat mass, improved  and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistic studies showed that ITG altered the expression levels of FXR downstream genes, lipid synthesis and energy metabolism genes in the liver of mice. Our findings suggest that ITG is a novel FXR agonist and may be a potential therapeutic choice for obesity associated with NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although several case reports exist, a comprehensive statistical analysis investigating growth profile and benefit of recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) treatment is still missing.Here, we compared IGF1RM carriers (n = 23) retrospectively regarding birth parameters, growth response to rhGH therapy, near final height and glucose/ homeostasis to treated children born small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 34). Additionally, health profiles of adult IGF1RM carriers were surveyed by a questionnaire.IGF1RM carriers were significantly smaller at rhGH initiation and had a diminished first-year response compared to SGA children (Δ height SDS: 0.29 vs. 0.65), resulting in a lower growth response under therapy. Interestingly, the number of poor therapy responders was three times higher for IGF1RM carriers than for SGA patients (53 % vs. 17 %). However, most IGF1RM good responders showed catch-up growth to the levels of SGA patients. Moreover, we observed no differences in HOMA-IR before treatment, but during treatment  was significantly increased in IGF1RM carriers compared to SGA children. Analyses in adult mutation carriers indicated no increased occurrence of comorbidities later in life compared to SGA controls.In summary, IGF1RM carriers showed a more pronounced growth retardation and lower response to rhGH therapy compared to non-mutation carriers, with high individual variability. Therefore, a critical reevaluation of success should be performed periodically. In adulthood, we could not observe a significant influence of IGF1RM on metabolism and health of carriers.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

The most feasible explanation for this association is the hypothesis of catch up. Some studies postulate a greater influence of catch up growth than the low birth weight itself in developing metabolic and cardiovascular disease.This is a prospective cohort study of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (defined as weight percentile at birth less than 10th) born during a one-year period. Clinical data of patients were recorded (gender, gestational age, data about breastfeeding and anthropometry during follow-up every 3 months). Some details of pregnancy and characteristics of the mother were also registered. Serum biochemical parameters (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, , glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, triglycerides, HOMA) were collected at birth from cord blood, 9 and 12 months. Two main comparative groups were established: those GRF who made a catch-up growth (increase in weight Z score higher than 0,67) during the follow-up and those who did not get it.126 GRF children were born in the study period. 125 accepted the inclusion in the study and 67 of them completed the full monitoring for a year; 47 of them made recovery growth and 20 did not. A significant difference between both groups was found in glucose in umbilical cord and triglycerides at 12 months: GRF children with catch up growth showed lower glucose levels (p = 0.03) and higher levels of triglycerides (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the rest of laboratory parameters analyzed (IGF-1, IGF-BP3, , glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, DLD cholesterol, HOMA at 9 and 12 months or triglycerides at 9 months).Those GRF with catch up growth during the first year of life have early changes in the triglycerides at the end of that period with higher levels than those GRF children without catch up growth. This finding could be useful to develop a tool for early detection of GRF children with higher metabolic risk in order to prevent future pathology.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (2.2%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (2.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.2%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications. MetS also significantly and independently predicts death and should be identified early to facilitate prompt multidisciplinary treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on -related metabolism in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on  sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high fat diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum  concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the -dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated  receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated  receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR.

It is well known that , especially hepatic , is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic  through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired  signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic . Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic .

Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic  and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636807>Ethanol Extract of Leaves of  Protects against Diabetes-Induced , Hepatic, and Endothelial Dysfunctions in  Mice.</a></h1><p>Despite long traditional utilization and some reports on the antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic action of , the mechanisms involved have not been investigated yet.

Obese  ) vs. control () mice were treated daily with intragastric administration of either vehicle or LECS (200 mg/kg, per day) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, food intake, glucose and  tolerance, oxidative stress, and liver damage as well as vascular complications with respect to endothelial dysfunction were examined. Administration of LECS in obese mice significantly reduced blood glucose and  levels, improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity, and restored the increase of circulating AST and ALT without modification of body weight and food intake. These effects were associated with increased activity of both  and AMPK pathways in the liver and skeletal muscles. Of particular interest, administration of LECS in obese mice completely prevented the endothelial dysfunction resulting from an increased NO and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aorta. Altogether, oral administration of LECS remarkably attenuates features of type 2 diabetes on glucose, hepatic inflammation, , endothelial function, and vascular oxidative stress, being as most of these effects are related to -dependent and -independent mechanisms.

There is a relationship between the high activity of this enzyme and the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. The inhibition of 11β-HSD1 has been shown to attenuate the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, , metabolic syndrome and other diseases mediated by excessive cortisol production. In this work, fifteen benzothiazole derivatives substituted with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were designed to explore their affinity for 11β-HSD1 using in silico methods. The results show that (E)-5-((benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)(methylthio)methylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (C1) has good physicochemical properties and favorable interactions with 11β-HSD1 through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the catalytic site formed by Y183, S170 and Y177. Furthermore, C1 was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using clobenzorex (CLX) as a reference drug in obese Zucker rats.

The latter favors a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system, which contribute to  and type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise is a powerful preventive tool and treatment for several diseases as it induces metabolic and immune effects that provide health benefits. Exercise is known to reduce inflammation; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible are not fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism is a reduced expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune cells after exercise, which could contribute to the protective effect of exercise against  and the prevention of the development of metabolic diseases. The aim of the present study is therefore to review the current evidence about the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise and toll-like receptors regulation on immune cells in humans. Key PointsObesity leads to a low-grade chronic inflammatory state and an over-activation of the innate immune system that is directly involved in the develop metabolic syndrome.The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise has been previously suggested through the reduction of the expression and/or activation of pro-inflammatory toll-like receptors (TLRs) in innate immune cells, which represent one of the main inflammatory responses triggered by obesityThe underlying mechanisms in which toll-like receptors expression modulate the reduction of chronic inflammation are not fully elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672462>iNOS as a metabolic enzyme under stress conditions.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical acting as a cellular signaling molecule in many different biochemical processes. NO is synthesized from l-arginine through the action of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family of enzymes, which includes three isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). iNOS-derived NO has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of several diseases, including liver diseases, , obesity and diseases of the cardiovascular system. However, transient NO production can modulate metabolism to survive and cope with stress conditions. Accumulating evidence strongly imply that iNOS-derived NO plays a central role in the regulation of several biochemical pathways and energy metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions. This review summarizes current evidence for the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism by iNOS during inflammation, and argues for the role of iNOS as a metabolic enzyme in immune and non-immune cells.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of liver disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by liver histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%.  (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or liver injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673032>Targeting ERβ in Macrophage Reduces Crown-like Structures in Adipose Tissue by Inhibiting Osteopontin and HIF-1α.</a></h1><p>Proinflammatory processes in adipose tissue contribute to development of breast cancer and . Crown-like structures (CLS) are histologic hallmarks of the proinflammatory process in adipose tissue. CLS are microscopic foci of dying adipocytes surrounded by macrophages mostly derived from monocytes in blood. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is expressed in microglia, macrophages within the central nervous system (CNS), where it evokes an anti-inflammatory response. The present study investigates the function of ERβ in macrophages within CLS. We report that even though monocytes in the blood have no detectable levels of ERβ, macrophages in CLS do express ERβ. In ERβ-/- mice, there was a significant increase in the number of CLS in both subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). CLS in these mice were dominated by pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1 macrophages) with higher expression of osteopontin (OPN) and an increase in number of proliferating macrophages. In mice made obese by Western diet, treatment with an ERβ selective agonist (LY3201) reduced the number of CLS in both SAT and VAT with downregulation of OPN, activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), proliferation and upregulation prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), the enzyme which prevents activation of HIF1α, in macrophages. We conclude that ERβ expression is induced in macrophages in CLS within adipose tissue where it plays a pivotal role in suppression of CLS. Thus ERβ agonists may be used to alleviate CLS-related breast cancer and  in adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664995>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of SPRY2 in human hepatocytes leads to increased glucose uptake and lipid droplet accumulation.</a></h1><p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is dramatically increasing throughout the world; however, the underlying aetiology is incompletely understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to  production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and .CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling pathways (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652943>The CCR4-NOT Deadenylase Complex Maintains Adipocyte Identity.</a></h1><p>Shortening of poly(A) tails triggers mRNA degradation; hence, mRNA deadenylation regulates many biological events. In the present study, we generated mice lacking the  gene, which encodes an essential scaffold subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in adipose tissues (-AKO mice) and we examined the role of CCR4-NOT in adipocyte function. -AKO mice showed reduced masses of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), indicating abnormal organization and function of those tissues. Indeed, -AKO mice showed hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, , and glucose intolerance and they could not maintain a normal body temperature during cold exposure. Muscle-like fibrous material appeared in both WAT and BAT of -AKO mice, suggesting the acquisition of non-adipose tissue characteristics. Gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the levels of adipose tissue-related mRNAs, including those of metabolic genes, decreased, whereas the levels of inflammatory response-related mRNAs increased. These data suggest that the CCR4-NOT complex ensures proper adipose tissue function by maintaining adipocyte-specific mRNAs at appropriate levels and by simultaneously suppressing mRNAs that would impair adipocyte function if overexpressed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676981>Circulating palmitoleic acid is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals: a longitudinal analysis.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that the fatty acid palmitoleate may act as an adipocyte-derived lipid hormone (or 'lipokine') to regulate systemic metabolism. We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between  Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance,  secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body  sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose  sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver  index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to fat mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body  sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver  (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in  sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and  sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of  sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h1><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, , glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677889>, but not  response, during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to worse histological outcome in obese NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Obese subjects are at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes (T2D) due to  (IR). Since high glucose levels are as toxic as lipids for hepatic metabolism, we hypothesize that altered response to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is associated to more severe NAFLD with significant/advanced liver damage.We studied 90 subjects with morbid obesity (73F/17M, BMI = 43.2 ± 5,9 kg/m) undergoing bariatric surgery and intraoperative liver biopsy, and measured HbA1c, HOMA-IR (fasting Glucose x /22.5), OGTT glucose and  profile, and calculated OGIS (muscle  sensitivity), hepatic-IR (glucose [AUC] x  [AUC]) during OGTT,  response as ( [dAUC]/glucose [dAUC] or Insulinogenic Index (IGI = (I-I)/(G-G)). Patients were divided in 3 groups according to liver biopsy: A (no-NAFLD, 23%), B (simple steatosis (SS), 53%) and C (NASH, 24%) with similar age, gender and BMI. Diabetes was 0% in no-NAFLD, 13% in SS, 35% in NASH. During OGTT, OGIS decreased from A to C (422 vs 360 vs 338, p < 0.01). Increased  concentrations, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and OGIS, not Hep-IR, were strongly associated to hepatic steatosis (p = 0.03, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01 respectively). Hepatic fibrosis stage was mild as most of the patients had fibrosis grade-1 (69% vs. 8% no fibrosis) and associated to fasting , HbA1c and HOMA-IR. dAUC-I/dAUC-G was similar in the 3 groups, while only AUC-I was strongly associated to steatosis (r = 0.35, p = 0.005), but not to fibrosis.In morbid obesity indexes of IR, and not of  response, are markers of histological severity of liver disease.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Long-term, continuous, GH treatments in short children born SGA lead to a normalization of height through childhood to adulthood. Recombinant human GH has been proven to be relatively safe. We recommend early surveillance in a growth clinic for children born SGA without catch-up growth. Obesity, , and the risk of metabolic syndrome increase with catch-up growth, but short stature and cognitive dysfunction increase without catch-up growth in children born SGA. A solution to this catch-up dilemma is breast feeding for a minimum of 6 to 12 mo. Because the overall prevalence of metabolic risk factors is very low, routine evaluation of metabolic parameters is not recommended for all children born SGA, but it may be useful to consider metabolic evaluations in overweight or obese children born SGA.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing  sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy metabolism and  signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to  signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646303>27th Annual Meeting of the European Group for the study of , Lisbon, Portugal, 8-9th May 2019.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or saturated fatty acid (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment- (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1),  receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty acid- and fructose-induced impaired  signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether epigenetics and environmental factors interact to promote progressive NAFLD during IR. We examined the miRNA signature in  receptor haploinsufficient (InsR+/-) and wild-type (wt) HSCs by RNAseq ( = 4 per group). Then, we evaluated their impact in an IR-NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) model (InsR+/- mice fed standard or methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet,  = 10 per group) and in vitro. InsR+/- HSCs displayed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs ( < 0.05 vs. wt), whose expression was then analyzed in the liver of InsR+/- mice fed an MCD diet. We found that miR-101-3p negatively associated with both InsR+/- genotype and MCD ( < 0.05) and the histological spectrum of liver damage ( < 0.01). miR-101-3p was reduced in InsR+/- hepatocytes and HSCs and even more in InsR+/- cells exposed to  (0.33 µM) and fatty acids (0.25 mM), resembling the IR-NASH model.

PCOS women with IR (M-value<6.28) had lower circulating ZAG concentrations, and higher circulating Irisin and Betatrophin levels relative to PCOS women without IR (M-value ≥ 6.28). ROC curve analyses showed that the AUC for Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin for predicting PCOS were 0.77, 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. In a joint ROC curves analysis of these serum markers and other parameters, the results showed that the AUC was 0.93, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1 % and 92.3 %, respectively.When compared to using single cytokine, the analysis of Irisin, ZAG and Betatrophin elevates the accuracy in diagnosing PCOS.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642978>Elevated  levels compromise endometrial decidualization in mice with decrease in uterine apoptosis in early-stage pregnancy.</a></h1><p>Women with hyperinsulinism and  have reduced fertility, but the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. Aberrant endometrial decidualization in early pregnancy was linked to pregnancy complications. In this study, we aimed to test whether elevated  levels compromise decidualization in early-stage pregnancy. C57BL/6J mice in high -exposed group were given a subcutaneous injection of recombinant  at a concentration of 0.05 IU daily. During decidualization in early pregnancy, serum levels of , E2, P4, LH, FSH and blood glucose were significantly altered in mice treated with high  levels. The number of embryo implantation sites and endometrial decidual markers BMP2, ER, PR was significantly decreased by high  levels in vivo. Artificial decidual induction in primary mouse endometrial stromal cells and immortal human endometrial stromal cells line were all compromised after treated with 100 nmol/L  levels. All these results on flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting of Bax, Bcl2, cleaved Caspase3, cleaved PARP proteins level showed that decidual cells apoptosis was significantly decreased. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential also significantly increased by the influence of high  levels. PI3K and p-Akt were much higher after  exposure and the compromised decidualization by high  treatment was rescued by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrated that elevated  levels could compromise mice decidualization in early-stage pregnancy and PI3K/p-Akt-regulated apoptosis was essential for this role.

Moreover, subjects with OW/OB showed impaired peripheral vasodilation, diminished heart rate and myocardial contractility responses but increased peripheral pulse pressure (all p < 0.05).Young male subjects with OW/OB, but without glucose intolerance or hypertension, showed attenuated peripheral vasodilation and diminished cardiac responses to a glucose drink.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668389>New roles for prokineticin 2 in feeding behavior,  and type 2 diabetes: Studies in mice and humans.</a></h1><p>Prokineticin 2 (PROK2) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that plays a critical role in the rhythmicity of physiological functions and inhibits food intake. PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Metabolic parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally  injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the  Syndrome) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced  compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Its more severe type, namely nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may result in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD, and especially NASH, are also associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predisposes to NAFLD development and progression via  and hyperglycemia. It has also been reported that the majority of T2DM patients have NAFLD/NASH, thus potentially further increasing their cardiometabolic risk. Current guidelines recommend to screen for NAFLD in all T2DM patients and vice-versa. Lifestyle remains the first-line therapeutic option for NAFLD/NASH. Among antidiabetic drugs, pioglitazone was shown to improve histological features of NASH. More recently, there is an increasing interest regarding the effects of newer anti-diabetic drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on NAFLD/NASH. The present narrative review considers the up-to-date data on the impact of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, and GLP-1 RAs on biochemical and/or histological markers of NAFLD/NASH. The potential clinical implications of these findings in daily practice are also discussed. Taking into consideration the global increasing prevalence of NAFLD/NASH, therapeutic options that can prevent or treat this disease will exert considerable benefits on human health.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to examine the association of serum ALP level with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in apparently healthy adults.A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between serum ALP level and MetS in 7,101 men and 8,873 women aged 19 to 75 years using data from the 2008 to 2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MetS were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses across serum ALP quartiles (Q1: ≤190 U/L; Q2: 191-224 U/L; Q3: 225-263 U/L; and Q4: ≥264 U/L for men and Q1: ≤163 U/L; Q2: 164-201 U/L; Q3: 202-251 U/L; and Q4: ≥252 U/L for women).The mean values of most cardiometabolic variables, HOMA-IR, and leukocyte count gradually increased with serum ALP quartile. The prevalence of MetS significantly increased in accordance with serum ALP quartile. In comparison with those of individuals in the lowest quartile, the OR (95% CI) for MetS in the highest quartile was 1.32 (1.05-1.64) in men and 1.99 (1.42-3.81) in women after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, regular exercise, household income, education level, occupation, AST, ALT, and GGT levels.Serum ALP level was positively and independently associated with MetS in men and women.Copyright © 2019.

We examined sex differences in distinct components of oxygen transport and utilization during exercise using linear and logistic regression models. The data were analyzed from June 2018 to May 2019.Resting and exercise gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing.Of 295 participants, 121 (41.0%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [12] years) and 174 (59.0%) were women (mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with men, women with HFpEF in this tertiary referral cohort had fewer comorbidities, including diabetes, , and hypertension, and a more favorable adipokine profile. Exercise capacity was similar in men and women (percent predicted peak oxygen [O2] consumption: 66% in women vs 68% in men; P = .38), but women had distinct deficits in components of the O2 pathway, including worse biventricular systolic reserve (multivariable-adjusted analyses: ΔLVEF β = -1.70; SE, 0.86; P < .05; ΔRVEF β = -2.39, SE=0.80; P = .003), diastolic reserve (PCWP/CO: β = 0.63; SE, 0.31; P = .04), and peripheral O2 extraction (C(a-v)O2 β=-0.90, SE=0.22; P < .001)).Despite a lower burden of cardiometabolic disease and a similar percent predicted exercise capacity, women with HFpEF demonstrated greater cardiac and extracardiac deficits, including systolic reserve, diastolic reserve, and peripheral O2 extraction. These sex differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle responses to exercise may illuminate the pathophysiology underlying the development of HFpEF and should be investigated further.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651303>Association between plasma adipsin level and mild cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>The adipokine adipsin contributes to  (IR), inflammation, and obesity, which are all regarded as high-risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research aimed to uncover the role of adipsin in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population with early cognitive dysfunction and determine whether adipsin contributes to diabetic MCI caused by IR.In our study, 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Demographic data and neuropsychological test results were evaluated. Plasma adipsin level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The MCI group (n = 57) presented higher plasma adipsin levels compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.018). After adjustment for educational attainment, and age, begative correlations were found between plasma adipsin levels and MoCA, Mini Mental State Exam, and Verbal Fluency Test scores(r = - 0.640, p < 0.001; r = - 0.612, p < 0.001; r = - 0.288, p = 0.035; respectively).

It has been noted that nearly 50% of all patients undergo the systemic treatment module; however, most of them exhibit drug . In addition, targeted gene therapy has also been used in treatment but has been found to be effective only in patients with a specified molecular profile (or else this might lead to an increased risk of developing resistant mutations). This has led to increasing interest among researchers in finding innovative treatment options. Metformin, a biguanide, has been widely used in treating diabetes. The drug has been reportedly used in cases of hypothesis-generating retrospective population studies of diabetic patients showing reduced incidence of cancer. Metformin helps in reduction of excess  levels that possess various effects on cell signaling and metabolism. Nonetheless, there is need for an in-depth study on its molecular mechanism to fill any existing research gaps.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678183>A 28.6-kD small heat shock protein (MnHSP28.6) protects Macrobrachium nipponense against heavy metal toxicity and oxidative stress by virtue of its anti-aggregation activity.</a></h1><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones and involved into various physiological and stress processes. In the present study, a 28.6-kD sHSP coding gene, MnHSP28.6, was cloned and characterized from the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. Tissue distribution analysis via qPCR and western blot revealed that MnHSP28.6 predominantly expressed in muscle. The temporal transcription of MnHSP28.6 in muscle after bacterial challenge, heavy metal exposure and doxorubicin (DOX) injection was investigated by qPCR. The results showed that the expression of MnHSP28.6 were strongly enhanced by both Cd and Cu exposure, as well as DOX injection, but not by bacterial infection. Aggregation assays showed that recombinant MnHSP28.6 could effectively prevent temperature-induced aggregation of citrate synthase, and reduction-induced aggregation of  in vitro. MnHSP28.6 also could protect muscle extracts from heat-induced protein denaturation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inactivation. Expressing MnHSP28.6 in E. coli conferred host cell impressive protection against HO compared to control.

It is important to combat the negative effects on age-associated hormonal decline, BP, and body composition by incorporating appropriate lifestyle interventions, such as exercise. We sought to examine the effects of a 12-week  band exercise training program on aging-related hormones including estradiol, growth hormone (GH), -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), BP, and body composition in postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension.Postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension (n = 20) were recruited and randomly assigned to a 12-week  band exercise training group (EX, n = 10) or control group (CON, n = 10). The EX group performed a total-body  band exercise training program. Levels of estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, as well as BP and body composition were assessed before and after 12 weeks.There were significant group by time interactions (P < 0.05) for estradiol, GH, IGF-1, DHEA-S, and lean body mass, which significantly increased (P < 0.05), and systolic BP, total body mass, body mass index, and body fat percentage, which significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after EX compared to no changes in CON. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in diastolic BP after 12 weeks.These results indicate that 12 weeks of  band exercise may be an effective, easily accessible, and cost-efficient intervention for improving age-associated hormonal decline, high BP, and poor body composition in postmenopausal women with stage 1 hypertension. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A494.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639486>Flavonoids extracted from mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaf improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial function by activating AMPK in type 2 diabetes.</a></h1><p>Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaves have been widely applied to controlling blood glucose as an efficacious traditional Chinese medicine or salutary medical supplement. The extracts of mulberry leaf suppress inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, protect the pancreatic β-cells and modulate glucose metabolism in diabetic rats. Our previous studies and others have shown that mulberry leaf extract has excellent therapeutic effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), however, the underlying mechanism remains to be studied.Skeletal muscle  (IR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Mulberry leaf flavonoids (MLF) in L6 skeletal muscle cells and db/db mice.L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured and treated with/without MLF for in vitro studies. For in vivo studies, the db/db mice with/without MLF therapy were used.MLF and metformin significantly ameliorated muscle glucose uptake and mitochondrial function in L6 muscle cells. MLF also increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and the expression of PGC-1α, and upregulated the protein levels of m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4. These effects were reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. In db/db mice, MLF improve diabetes symptoms and . Moreover, MLF elevated the levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1α, raised m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4 protein expression, and ameliorated mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of db/db mice.MLF significantly improved skeletal muscle  and mitochondrial function in db/db mice and L6 myocytes through AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway, and our findings support the therapeutic effects of MLF on type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this review was to summarize information on the association between dietary habits and the risk of developing T2D.We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed database from its inception to June, 2019. Articles were restricted to those written in English and concerning human subjects. Relevant manuscripts found in the list of references of the retrieved articles were also used in preparation for the review.Animal protein consumption increases the risk of T2D independently of body mass index. Intake of both unprocessed meat and processed meat is strongly and consistently associated with increased risk of developing T2D. In contrast, consumption of high-quality vegetable foods prevents the disease. High-quality plant foods include whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Among less healthy plant-based foods are fruit juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes, sweets, and desserts. Carbohydrate-restricted diets that encourage consumption of animal products promote T2D. Low intake of animal products is linked to high educational level so that well-informed individuals tend to consume diets with elevated content of vegetable food. According to the American Dietetic Association, "appropriately planned vegetarian diets including vegan diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases".restricting animal products while increasing healthy plant-based foods intake facilitates T2D prevention. To neutralize worldwide the burden of T2D and its devastating complications, animal products consumption should be limited or discontinued.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Methods The wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (TLR2) C57BL/6 male mice, aged 28 days, were selected, with 12 mice in each group. The genotype of each mouse was identified by PCR. After mice were fed with basic diet for 3 months, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  test (ITT) were performed. The mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated with GM-CSF/IFN-γ and M-CSF/IL-4/IL-13, respectively, to induce differentiation to M1-like and M2-like macrophages. The CD11b, F4/80, CD11c, CD206 and early growth response 2 (EGR2) were detected by flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of macrophages. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 in the culture supernatant of macrophages were detected using ELISA. Results The result of PCR identification was consistent with the genotype of mice. Compared to WT mice, TLR2 mice exhibited the significantly improved glycemic control at 30 min during GTT and the significantly increased  sensitivity at 15 minutes during ITT. The flow cytometry showed that M1 markers decreased and M2 macrophages increased in the TLR2 mice. ELISA showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of M1 macrophages, while the level of IL-10 significantly increased in the culture supernatant of M2 macrophages in TLR2 mice compared with WT mice. Conclusion TLR2 signal has an effect on the polarization of macrophages and makes macrophages tend to switch to M1 phenotype. A higher number of pro-inflammatory factors secreted by M1 macrophages contribute to a low-grade inflammation state in the body, which leads to a decrease in glucose tolerance and  sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647776>Treatment of Neurodegeneration: Integrating Photobiomodulation and Neurofeedback in Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's: A Review.</a></h1><p> A review of photobiomodulation (PBM) in Alzheimer's dementia is submitted. The addition of PBM in neurodegenerative diseases is a dual modality that is at present gaining traction as it is safe, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory for treating neurodegeneration with photons that stimulate mitochondria increasing adenosine triphosphate and proteasomes increasing misfolded protein removal. Neurofeedback provides neural plasticity with an increase in brain-derived nerve factor mRNA and an increase in dendrite production and density in the hippocampus coupled with overall growth in dendrites, density, and neuronal survival.  Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein neurofibrillary tangles and subsequently amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. PBM and neurobiofeedback (NBF)address the multiple gene expression and upregulation of multiple pathogenic pathway inflammation, reactive oxidative stress, mitochondrial disorders, , methylation defects, regulation of neuroprotective factors, and regional hypoperfusion of the brain. There is no human evidence to suggest a clinical therapeutic benefit from using consistent light sources while significantly increasing safety concerns.  A PBM test with early- to mid-Alzheimer's was reported in 2017, consisting of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a small pilot group of early- to mid-dementia subjects under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Clinical Trial.  PBM-treated subjects showed that active treatment subjects tended to show greater improvement in the functioning of the executive: clock drawing, immediate recall, practical memory, and visual attention and task switching (Trails A&B). A larger study using the CerebroLite helmet in Temple Texas again of subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled IRB-approved FDA Clinical Trial demonstrated gain in memory and cognition by increased clock drawing.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and  and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase  secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces . It reduces obesity by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates obesity and the metabolism of glucose and .

Compared with participants with the lowest average BPA exposure (below the first quartile), participants in the second, third, and fourth quartile groups of exposure had a near doubling of the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a hazard ratio  2.56 (95% CI: 1.16, 5.65), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 5.15), and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.68, 3.55), respectively. The detection of BPS-G in urine at one or both time points was associated with incident diabetes, with an  2.81 (95% CI: 1.74, 4.53).This study shows positive associations between exposure to BPA and BPS and the incidence of type 2 diabetes, independent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Our results should be confirmed by recent, population-based observational studies in different populations and settings. Overall, these findings raise concerns about using BPS as a BPA substitute. Further research on BPA analogs is warranted. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5159.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646287>26th Annual Meeting of the European Group for the study of , Lille, France, 7-8th June 2018.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666143>Maternal high-fat diet displayed disorders characteristic of metabolic syndrome that were transferred to first-and second-generation offspring.</a></h1><p>High fat diet (H) increases metabolic disorders in offspring.

Our data showed that maternal H diet only during mating, gestation and breastfeeding induced cardio-metabolic disorders characteristic of human metabolic syndrome (MetS) that were transferred to F1 and F2 offspring, both females and males, even they fed control diet after weaning. This process probably occurs due to disturbance in mechanisms related to leptin that increases energy intake in F1H and F2H offspring.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1), the major active ginsenoside enriched in tonic food ginseng, was reported to help alleviate liver diseases. In the present study, GRg1 was evaluated for its impact on palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatic  model in vitro. in HepG2 cells was induced by 0.5 mM PA exposure for 24 h and then the effect of GRg1 on cellular glucose consumption was measured. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6Pase) were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of protein kinases and transcript factor was analyzed by measuring protein phosphorylation. The influence of GRg1 on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HepG2 was also examined.GRg1 reversed PA-induced decrease in glucose consumption of HepG2 cells by downregulating gluconeogenesis genes G6pase and PEPCK. GRg1 increased Akt activation but inhibited JNK activation in PA-challenged HepG2 cells. Cellular ROS level was elevated in -resistant HepG2 cells but was reduced by GRg1.Together these findings indicate that GRg1 protects against hepatic  via preserving  signaling sensitivity and is a promising alternative medicine.Copyright © 2019.

Obesity and overweight are closely related to metabolic diseases and diabetes. However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or obesity [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM. VD may regulate the formation and differentiation of adipocytes through the VDR and PPARγ pathways and participate in the occurrence of GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672447>The Rho GTPase RND3 regulates adipocyte lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in diet- and obesity-related , with implications for several metabolic diseases. Identification of novel target genes and mechanisms that regulate adipocyte function could lead to improved treatment strategies. RND3 (RhoE/Rho8), a Rho-related GTP-binding protein that inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, has been linked to diverse diseases such as apoptotic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, in part by regulating cytoskeleton dynamics and -mediated glucose uptake.We here investigated the expression of RND3 in adipose tissue in human obesity, and discovered a role for RND3 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. In cross-sectional and prospective studies, we observed 5-fold increased adipocyte levels of RND3 mRNA in obesity, reduced levels after surgery-induced weight loss, and positive correlations of RND3 mRNA with adipocyte size and surrogate measures of  (HOMA2-IR and circulating triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TAG/HDL-C) ratio). By screening for RND3-dependent gene expression following siRNA-mediated RND3 knockdown in differentiating human adipocytes, we found downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of genes related to adipocyte ipolysis and  signaling. Treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia or cAMP analogs increased RND3 mRNA levels 1.5-2-fold. Functional assays in primary human adipocytes confirmed that RND3 knockdown reduces cAMP- and isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, which were mimicked by treating cells with ROCK inhibitor. This effect could partly be explained by reduced protein expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).We here uncovered a novel differential expression of adipose RND3 in obesity and , which may at least partly depend on a causal effect of RND3 on adipocyte lipolysis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in , dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate  secretion and  sensitivity. As  is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, , and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body  sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced  sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body  sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic  sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651856>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictive marker of metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a strong prognostic indicator for patients suffering from various diseases. Neutrophil activation promotes the recruitment of a number of different cell types that are involved in acute and chronic inflammation and are associated with cancer treatment outcome. Measurement of NLR, an established inflammation marker, is cost-effective, and it is likely that NLR can be used to predict the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) at an early stage. MS scores range from 1 to 5, and an elevated MS score indicates a greater risk for MS. Monitoring NLR can prevent the risk of MS.A total of 34,013 subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects (score 0-5) within the 6 groups were classified according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, and all anthropometrics, laboratory biomarkers, and hematological measurements were recorded. For the 6 groups, statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the development of MS.Analysis of the ROC curve indicated that NLR served as a good predictor for MS. An MS score of 1 to 2 yielded an acceptable discrimination rate, and these rates were even higher for MS scores of 3 to 5 (P < .001), where the prevalence of MS was 30.8%.NLR can be used as a prognostic marker for several diseases, including those associated with MS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661991>Pyrroloquinoline quinone protected autophagy-dependent apoptosis induced by mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in INS-1 cells.</a></h1><p>Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is the main metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in organisms and is commonly used as a plasticizer. Exposure to DEHP impairs the function of islet beta cells (INS-1 cells), which is related to  and type 2 diabetes. At present, some research data have also confirmed that MEHP has a certain damage effect on INS-1 cells. In our experiment, we found that MEHP would lead to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of autophagy. And downregulated ROS production by -acetyl-l-cysteine could also reduce autophagy. In addition, MEHP-induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) subsequently released cathepsin D. Additionally, MEHP induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome . Addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine relieved MEHP-induced apoptosis as assessed by the expression of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, indicating that MEHP-induced apoptosis was autophagy dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, suppressed MEHP-induced mitochondria release of cytochrome  and apoptosis as well. Meanwhile, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a new B vitamin, improved the above phenomenon. Taken together, our results indicate that MEHP induces autophagy-dependent apoptosis in INS-1 cells by lysosomal-mitochondrial axis. PQQ improved this process by downregulating ROS and provided a degree of protection. Our study provides a new perspective for MEHP on the cytotoxic mechanism and PQQ protection in INS-1 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671770>Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Dysregulation of Glucose Metabolism: Beyond Weight Gain.</a></h1><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia because of their high clinical efficacy. However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in -sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG, lipid dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on  signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and  secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668590>Sex difference in the association between surrogate markers of  and arterial stiffness.</a></h1><p>To investigate the predictive capability of  surrogate markers for  and arterial stiffness based on sex.We assessed the association of triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP) with homeostasis model assessment- (HOMA-IR) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in both sexes.A total of 1720 men and 1098 women were evaluated. HOMA-IR showed good correlation with the TyG index (men: r = 0.47, women: r = 0.45), TG/HDL-C (men: r = 0.45, women: r = 0.41), VAI (men: r = 0.51, women: r = 0.48), and LAP (men: r = 0.55, women r = 0.49) (all p-values < 0.001).

Marantodes pumilum (Blume) Kuntze (Primulaceae) is believed to have phytoestrogenic properties and is claimed to have beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), but the mechanism behind its phytoestrogenic effects on estrogen-deficient diabetic condition have not been fully examined.The present study investigated the effects of oral treatment with M. pumilum var. alata (MPA) extracts on the estrogen receptor, metabolic characteristics and  signaling pathway in pancreas and liver of ovariectomised nicotidamide streptozotocin-induced diabetes in female rats.Ovariectomised diabetic (OVXS) Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with either aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA (50 or 100 mg/kg) respectively for 28 days. Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring fasting blood glucose, serum , oral glucose and  tolerance test. Distribution and expression level of , oxidative stress and inflammatory marker in the pancreatic islets and liver were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively.Oral treatment with aqueous leaf and ethanol (50%) stem-root extracts of MPA (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed the elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose and  tolerance. The protein expression of , glucose transporter (GLUT-2 and GLUT-4) increased in the pancreatic islets and liver. Furthermore, marked improvement in the tissue morphology following treatment with MPA was observed. Similarly, the western blots analysis denotes improved  signaling in the liver and decreased reactive oxygen species producing enzymes, inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules with MPA treatment.Taken together, this work demonstrate that 100 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract and ethanol (50%) stem-root extract of MPA improves β-cell function and  signaling in postmenopausal diabetes through attenuation of oxidative stress and partially mediated by oestrogen receptor stimulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

High fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced  is implicated in multiple metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these metabolic diseases has become epidemic health issue worldwide. In this study, the effect of C. lanceolata polysaccharide (CLPS) on improving  sensitivity in chronic HFHS diet-fed mice was investigated. Our data indicates that CLPS significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum  (FINS) and  index, in parallel with improved glucose and  tolerance impaired by HFHS diet. Impaired phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 were observed in the mice fed with HFHS diet, and those defects were also rescued by CLPS administration. In addition, CLPS caused a significant decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and an increase in reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidised glutathione (GSSG) ratio; concurrent with enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and activated Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these findings suggest that CLPS ameliorates HFHS diet-induced  through activating anti-oxidative signaling pathway, providing new insights into the protective effects of C. lanceolata polysaccharide in metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown several unexpected pleiotropic effects of mannose including increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), prevention of auto-immune disease and ability to reduce growth of human cancer cells. We have previously shown in large cohorts that elevated serum mannose levels are associated with future development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. However, potential direct effects of mannose on  sensitivity in vivo or in vitro are unknown. We here show that administration of mannose (0.1 g/kg BW twice daily) for one week in man did not elicit negative effects on meal-modified glucose tolerance, markers of inflammation or  levels.

According to reactivity hypothesis, sympathetic response to stressors may be more sensitive at predicting IR than baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), a baseline measure of baroreflex functioning. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of negative affect coupled with minute-to-minute HR and heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring, we examined whether negative affect (NA)-related autonomic arousal mediates the association of BRS with IR. At baseline, BRS was measured, and fasting serum glucose and  levels were collected from 178 young adults (18-39 years old), from which homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell functioning (HOMA %B) were derived. Participants subsequently underwent one day of Holter HR and HRV monitoring while reporting negative affect levels  EMA. Multilevel modeling was used to assess the associations of momentary negative affect with HR and low- (LF) and high-frequency (HF) HRV during the 5-minute intervals following each EMA reading. Structural equation modeling was then used to determine whether individual differences in these associations mediated the association of BRS with IR, measured by HOMA-IR, HOMA %B, and  levels. As predicted, BRS was negatively associated with the IR ( = -.17,  = .024). However, NA-related autonomic arousal mediated their association, accounting for 56% of the covariance between BRS and IR. Not only do these results provide support for reactivity hypothesis, they reveal a potential point of intervention in the treatment of affective dysregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677302>Bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland in type 2 diabetes patients.</a></h1><p>The hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are hyperglycemia and . These factors, at the cellular level, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased glucose uptake. Such events are poorly explored in the context of the salivary glands. In this study, we present a series of eight cases of a distinct salivary gland lesion characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts, and we provide new pathologic insights regarding its pathogenesis.Seven patients (87.5%) had a confirmed T2D, and obesity was identified in five (62.5%) patients. Clinically, the patients demonstrated bilateral parotid gland swelling with recurrent episodes of pain and enlargements. Imaging exams revealed multiple cystic lesions in both parotid glands. Microscopically, the parotid glands showed multiple cysts of different sizes, lined by oncocytic epithelial cells. Intraluminally, high-eosinophilic glass-like crystalloid materials were observed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed and the most notable finding was GLUT1 overexpression in the oncocytic cysts (not observed in any other oncocytic lesion of patients without T2D). In addition, higher expressions of mitochondrial antigen, fission 1 protein, and mitofusin-2 were observed in the oncocytic epithelium of the cysts. Furthermore, most of the oncocytic cysts demonstrated a pattern of cytokeratin expression consistent with striated ducts.Thus, these results strongly suggest that T2D is associated with alterations in GLUT1 expression in the cells of striated ducts with mitochondrial dysfunction, causing a hyperplastic process characterized by multiple oncocytic cysts. For this lesion, the designation of "diabetes associated-bilateral multiple oncocytic cysts of the parotid gland" is proposed.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670492>Correlations of glycolipid metabolism abnormality and  with the onset of prostate cancer and its postoperative recurrence.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640197>Effect of Dietary Inulin Supplementation on Growth Performance, Carcass Traits, and Meat Quality in Growing-Finishing Pigs.</a></h1><p>Inulin is one of the commercially feasible dietary fibers that has been implicated in regulating the gut health and metabolism of animals.

Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for  (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health.

Recently, studies on experimental animals showed that AM2 is an adipokine with beneficial effects on energy metabolism. However, there is little information regarding AM2 expression in human adipose tissue.To investigate the pattern and regulation of AM2 expression and that of its receptor component in human adipose tissue, in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes.We measured metabolic parameters, serum AM2 and expression of ADM2 and its receptor component genes in abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in obese (with or without type 2 diabetes) and normal-weight women. Serum AM2 was assessed before and 6-9 months after bariatric surgery. Expression/secretion of AM2 and its receptor was assessed in human adipocytes.ADM2 mRNA in both fat depots was higher in obese patients, whether diabetic or not. Although serum AM2 was significantly lower in obese patients, it was not changed after bariatric surgery. AM2 and its receptor complex were predominantly expressed by adipocytes, and expression of CALCRL, encoding a component of the AM2 receptor complex, was lower in both fat depots of obese patients. Incubating adipocytes with substances mimicking the microenvironment of obese adipose tissue increased ADM2 mRNA but reduced AM2 secretion into culture media and CALCRL mRNA expression.Our data indicate that AM2 signalling is suppressed in adipose tissue in obesity, involving lower receptor expression and ligand availability, likely contributing to  and other aspects of the pathophysiology associated with obesity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

In women with PCOS, effective ovulation induction serves as an important first-line treatment for anovulatory infertility. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered as the gold standard for evidence synthesis which provides accurate assessments of outcomes from primary randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and allows additional analyses for time-to-event outcomes. It also facilitates treatment-covariate interaction analyses and therefore offers an opportunity for personalised medicine.We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different ovulation induction agents, in particular letrozole alone and clomiphene citrate (CC) plus metformin, as compared to CC alone, as the first-line choice for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility, and to explore interactions between treatment and participant-level baseline characteristics.We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 20 December 2018. We included RCTs comparing the following interventions with each other or placebo/no treatment in women with PCOS and infertility: CC, metformin, CC plus metformin, letrozole, gonadotrophin and tamoxifen. We excluded studies on treatment-resistant women. The primary outcome was live birth. We contacted the investigators of eligible RCTs to share the IPD and performed IPD meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs.IPD of 20 RCTs including 3962 women with PCOS were obtained. Six RCTs compared letrozole and CC in 1284 women. Compared with CC, letrozole improved live birth rates (3 RCTs, 1043 women, risk ratio [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates (6 RCTs, 1284 women, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.23-1.70, moderate-certainty evidence) and reduced time-to-pregnancy (6 RCTs, 1235 women, hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.38-2.15, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline serum total testosterone levels and treatment effects on live birth (interaction RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). Eight RCTs compared CC plus metformin to CC alone in 1039 women. Compared with CC alone, CC plus metformin might improve clinical pregnancy rates (8 RCTs, 1039 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, low-certainty evidence) and might reduce time-to-pregnancy (7 RCTs, 898 women, HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, low-certainty evidence), but there was insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth rates (5 RCTs, 907 women, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87-1.35, low-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect modifications showed a positive interaction between baseline  levels and treatment effects on live birth in the comparison between CC plus metformin and CC (interaction RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06).In women with PCOS, letrozole improves live birth and clinical pregnancy rates and reduces time-to-pregnancy compared to CC and therefore can be recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for women with PCOS and infertility. CC plus metformin may increase clinical pregnancy and may reduce time-to-pregnancy compared to CC alone, while there is insufficient evidence of a difference on live birth. Treatment effects of letrozole are influenced by baseline serum levels of total testosterone, while those of CC plus metformin are affected by baseline serum levels of . These interactions between treatments and biomarkers on hyperandrogenaemia and  provide further insights into a personalised approach for the management of anovulatory infertility related to PCOS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Muscle mass loss is associated with weakness, fatigue, and . In fact, it is predicted that controlling muscle atrophy can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with diseases such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia.We analyzed gene expression data from muscle of mice or human patients with diverse muscle pathologies and identified LMCD1 as a gene strongly associated with skeletal muscle function. We transiently expressed or silenced LMCD1 in mouse gastrocnemius muscle or in mouse primary muscle cells and determined muscle/cell size, targeted gene expression, kinase activity with kinase arrays, protein immunoblotting, and protein synthesis levels. To evaluate force, calcium handling, and fatigue, we transduced the flexor digitorum brevis muscle with a LMCD1-expressing adenovirus and measured specific force and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release in individual fibers. Finally, to explore the relationship between LMCD1 and calcineurin, we ectopically expressed Lmcd1 in the gastrocnemius muscle and treated those mice with cyclosporine A (calcineurin inhibitor). In addition, we used a luciferase reporter construct containing the myoregulin gene promoter to confirm the role of a LMCD1-calcineurin-myoregulin axis in skeletal muscle mass control and calcium handling.Here, we identify LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1 (LMCD1) as a positive regulator of muscle mass, that increases muscle protein synthesis and fiber size. LMCD1 expression in vivo was sufficient to increase specific force with lower requirement for calcium handling and to reduce muscle fatigue. Conversely, silencing LMCD1 expression impairs calcium handling and force, and induces muscle fatigue without overt atrophy. The actions of LMCD1 were dependent on calcineurin, as its inhibition using cyclosporine A reverted the observed hypertrophic phenotype. Finally, we determined that LMCD1 represses the expression of myoregulin, a known negative regulator of muscle performance. Interestingly, we observed that skeletal muscle LMCD1 expression is reduced in patients with skeletal muscle disease.Our gain- and loss-of-function studies show that LMCD1 controls protein synthesis, muscle fiber size, specific force, Ca handling, and fatigue . This work uncovers a novel role for LMCD1 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function with potential therapeutic implications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661671>Leptin and  in young adulthood are associated with weight in infancy.</a></h1><p>Low weight in early infancy is a known risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome in adult life.

High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low weight at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial  and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) . Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and  correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age two years and . We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641012> in healthy US adults: findings from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES).</a></h1><p> is fundamental in two-conditions that are epidemic in the United States and globally: obesity and Type 2 diabetes. We examined 's relationship to common health-related endpoints in a large population-based sample.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a cross-sectional study that uses a complex multistage probability design to obtain a representative sample of the United States population. Adult participants were included from 8 successive 2-year data waves (1999-2014) including 9224 normal individuals, 7699 pre-diabetic and 3413 diabetic subjects. We examined the Homeostatic Model for  (HOMA-IR) in 20336 participants in relation to demographic, anthropometric and clinical data. We examined the relationship of HOMA-IR to 8 groups of outcome variables: general health, anthropometric/metabolic (waist size, BMI), cardiovascular (blood pressure), lipid (triglycerides, HDL), hepatic (ALT, GGT), hematologic (WBC, Hgb, platelets), inflammatory (CRP) and nutritional (vitamin D, C, serum folate and pyridoxine) variables.HOMA-IR was generally strongly, monotonically, and highly significantly associated with adjusted outcomes in normal subjects. In the normal subset, the OR and 95% CI for a quartile change in HOMA-IR for obesity (BMI >30) was 3.62 (3.30, 3.97), and for the highest quintile for the triglyceride/HDL the ratio was 2.00 (1.77-2.26), for GGT it was 1.40 (1.24-1.58), and for white blood count it was 1.28 (1.16-1.40).HOMA-IR levels are associated with poorer general health and adverse changes across a wide range of markers.Clinically, checking  levels may be helpful to identify patients that merit observation and early interventions.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667980>Metformin in pregnancy to avert gestational diabetes in women at high risk: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>Previous randomized and observational studies on the efficacy of metformin in pregnancy to reduce incident gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women at high risk (obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS], or pregestational ) have been conflicting and several groups are planning further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer this question conclusively. This work assesses the efficacy of metformin in pregnancy to avert one outcome-incident GDM in women at high risk. We included RCTs comparing metformin with usual care or placebo controls in terms of incident GDM and recruiting women at high risk during early pregnancy. Eleven eligible trials enrolled 2370 adult women whose intervention arm consisted of metformin started at conception or before 20 weeks of gestation. Risk of GDM was similar in intervention compared with controls (risk ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.24). The data were of sufficient quality meeting the criteria for consistency and directness. We conclude that metformin does not contribute to averting the GDM outcome in women at high risk when initiated in pregnancy. The evidence provided by this synthesis affirms that further broad clinical trials investigating this question are no longer needed.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667610>Serum zonulin level is not elevated in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome without metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder with gynecological, metabolic and carcinogenic effects. Increased intestinal permeability is related with obesity, , type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. The existence of such a relationship between PCOS and intestinal permeability has come to an end. Zonulin can change intestinal permeability, and this effect is reversible. We studied the relation between zonulin and the hormonal and metabolic parameters of PCOS.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 17 healthy women were included in the study. Histories were taken from all the participants, body mass indexes were calculated, and biochemical tests and suprapubic over ultrasonography were made. Zonulin was studied with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum zonulin levels were similar between PCOS and control groups (p = 0.893). In all participants, there were negative correlations between zonulin and the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and non-HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.00, 0.018, 0.004, 0.002), there were boundary correlations with age and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (respectively, p = 0.052 and 0.058). No statistically significant was detected in the PCOS group except negative correlation between zonulin and age (p = 0.046), boundary correlation between zonulin and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.064).PCOS patients did not have metabolic syndrome. Zonulin was not higher in PCOS then controls, and it had only negative relation with age. The negative relation between zonulin and some metabolic parameters in all participants was not detected in PCOS group. So zonulin is not a useful molecule for the diagnosis of PCOS without metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652442>Berberine improves  in adipocyte models by regulating the methylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-3α.</a></h1><p>Methylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-3α (HIF3A) was previously demonstrated to be highly associated with  (IR) in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We aimed to study the therapeutic effects of Berberine (BBR) on GDM and the possible mechanisms. The expressions and methylated states of HIF3A in pregnant women with GDM were compared with that in healthy controls. The IR cell models of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was constructed by 1 μmol/l dexamethasone (Dex) and 1 μmol/l  (Ins). To evaluate the effects of BBR on IR adipocyte models, cells were subjected to BBR treatment at different concentrations. Transfection of HIF3A siRNA further confirmed the role of HIF3A in the BBR-induced improving effects. Low expression and high methylation of HIF3A gene were frequent in the GDM pregnancies. BBR treatment noticeably increased the glucose usage rates, adiponectin secretion and cell differentiation of IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Increased HIF3A expression and decreased methylated state of HIF3A were also found in IR adipocytes. Furthermore, HIF3A silencing not only reversed the effects of BBR on improving  sensibility, but also partially abolished the expression alterations of -related genes in IR adipocytes induced by BBR treatment. Our results suggest that BBR improves  sensibility in IR adipocyte models, and the improving effects of BBR are possibly realized through the inhibition of HIF3A methylation.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682461>[Influence of rs670 variant of APOA1 gene on serum HDL response to an enriched-polyunsaturated vs. an enriched-monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet].</a></h1><p>genetic variants of the APOA1 gene have been related to lipid profile in obese subjects.

One group received an enriched-polyunsaturated fat (diet P) and the other an enriched-monounsaturated fat hypocaloric diet (diet M) during 12 weeks. The effects on serum biomarkers related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were evaluated before and after the dietary intervention.after both diets, body mass index, weight, fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, plasma leptin concentration, and waist circumference decreased in all patients. After 12 weeks of intervention with diet P, plasma  levels and HOMA-IR decreased in A-allele carriers: delta: -7.3 ± 2.2 IU/L (p = 0.01), and delta: -2.8 ± 0.5 units (p = 0.02), respectively.

Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking  to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty acid transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential glycolysis intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino acids of relevance as tricarboxylic acid suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation. Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino-acids and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648183>IL-34 causes inflammation and beta cell apoptosis and dysfunction in gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by glucose intolerance during gestation. It is associated with a series of maternal and foetal complications. Interleukin (IL)-34 is a recently discovered pro-inflammatory cytokine that functions as a ligand for colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). The contribution of IL-34 in the development of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases has been recently discovered. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether IL-34 participates in the pathogenesis of GDM.A total of 120 women were enrolled in this study, which included 60 GDM patients and age- and sex-matched healthy pregnant women. The expression of IL-34 in serum, cord blood and placental tissues was analysed by ELISA and Western blot assays. The association between IL-34 levels and clinical features was also studied. We additionally evaluated the effect of recombinant mouse IL-34 (rmIL-34) on apoptosis and pancreatic β cell function.We found that IL-34 expression is highly increased in serum, cord blood and placental tissues in patients with GDM. In addition, there was a positive association between serum IL-34 and  and glucose concentrations. Our data also revealed that IL-34 contributes to the apoptosis of pancreatic β cells in GDM caused by CSF-1R. Furthermore, functional studies found that IL-34 inhibited pancreatic β cell function and cell viability, while CSF-1R inhibitor blocked this effect.IL-34 plays a crucial role in the development of GDM by targeting CSF-1R,  production and β cell function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669171>Hormonal regulation of visfatin gene in avian Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells.</a></h1><p>Visfain has been extensively studied in mammals and has been shown to play an important role in obesity and . However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity-related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although obesity is usually defined as elevated body mass index (BMI), recent data indicate a superior role of waist circumference or hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) over BMI in the assessment of cardiometabolic risk. In dyslipidemic patients, the specific contributions of risky waist, HTGW or BMI have not been evaluated as yet. 686 dyslipidemic subjects (322 males and 364 females) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study. In each subject basic antropometry (i.e. waist circumference, HTGW, BMI) and laboratory parameters of lipid profile and  were determined. Cardiometabolic risk was given by fulfilling the criteria (harmonized definition) of metabolic syndrome. The significance of risky waist, HTGW and BMI were assessed by comparing the respective predictive values for the presence of metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemic patients with risky waist, HTGW or high BMI have a more atherogenic lipid profile and higher  compared to those without risky waist, HTGW or high BMI. Risky waist is stronger predictor of metabolic syndrome (PPV 66 %, NPV 90 %) and thus poses a greater cardiometabolic risk than higher BMI per se does (PPV 42 %, NPV 97 %). The contribution of triglycerides (i.e. HTGW) to these predictive values is marginal (PPV 66 %, NPV 92 %). The present results highlight the superior role of waist circumference as a screening tool over BMI for the evaluation of cardiometabolic risk in dyslipidemic subjects. HTGW brings little additional benefit in risk stratification. Lower BMI proved to be optimal for identifying the subjects with inferior risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660753>A Complex Relationship: Dietary Folate, Arsenic Metabolism, and  in Mice.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657699>Are there any differences among psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in terms of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors?</a></h1><p>Although the frequency of metabolic syndrome has been studied separately in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, there is no study that compares the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in all three diseases.

Furthermore, most people with type 2 diabetes are either obese or overweight, with the associated dyslipidaemia contributing to the development of  and increased cardiovascular risk. Here we incubated INS-1 pancreatic β-cells for 72h in RPMI-1640 media, or media supplemented with 28mM glucose, 200µM palmitic acid, and 200µM oleic acid as a cellular model of diabetic glucolipotoxicity. Illumina HiSeq gene expression analysis showed the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family to be among the most highly downregulated by glucolipotoxicity. Importantly, MetaCore integrated knowledge database, from Clarivate Analytics, indicated potential TAAR impact on  secretion through adenylyl cyclase signalling pathways. We therefore investigated the effect of TAAR ligands on cAMP signalling and  secretion, and found that only the branch of the TAAR family tree that is activated by isopentylamine, 2-phenylethylamine, p-tyramine, and agmatine significantly increased intracellular cAMP and resulted in increased  secretion from INS-1 cells and primary mouse islets under normal conditions. Crucially however, this enhancement was not evident when the receptor family was downregulated by glucolipotoxic conditions. This data indicates that a subset of TAARs are regulators of  secretion in pancreatic β-cells, and that their downregulation contributes to glucolipotoxic inhibition of  secretion. As such they may be potential targets for treatment of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we enrolled placental samples from twenty pregnant women with GDM and twenty non-GDM pregnant women and found that the abundance of fetuin-A was upregulated in terms of mRNA and protein levels. Fetuin-A inhibited placental cell growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting S phase entry. Irregular alignment of mitotic chromosomes and aberrant mitotic spindle poles were observed. In addition, centrosome amplification was induced by fetuin-A treatment, and these amplified centrosomes nucleated microtubules with disorganized microtubule arrays in placental cells. Furthermore, fetuin-A inhibited autophagy, and thus blocked the growth of the primary cilium, a cellular antenna that regulates placenta development and differentiation. Thus, our study uncovered the novel function of fetuin-A in regulating placental cell growth and ciliogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661672>Elucidating the role of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) in metabolic PCOS models.</a></h1><p>PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women; associated with obesity and  (IR). IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with /AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h1><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is reported in several populations.

In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting  ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004). Serum lipids, ALT, adiponectin, fetuin-A, WBISI, IGI, and oDI were not associated with liver fat.In nonobese Afro-Caribbean participants, greater liver fat was associated with weight and height and lower fasting  and hyperinsulinemia appears to be influential in the reduction of NAFLD. These findings may be influenced by ethnicity, body size, and method of estimating liver fat.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662623>High IL-1α Production Was Induced in the WBN/Kob- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Rat Model and Inhibited by  Infection.</a></h1><p>The novel WBN/Kob- () congenic rat strain is considered a useful rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Accumulating findings suggest that low-grade inflammation is a causative factor in T2DM and that circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with . However, inflammatory cytokine profiles and their correlations with T2DM development/ progression in  rats have not been studied. In this study, we found that the  rats had considerably high plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α. Abundant cecal IL-1α mRNA expression and cecal inflammation with infiltrating IL-1α-producing macrophages was observed in  rats. Bone marrow derived macrophages from  rats expressed high levels of IL-1α upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore,  infection, which delays the onset of T2DM, reduced both plasma and cecal IL-1α levels in  rats. These results suggest that macrophage infiltration and IL-1α secretion comprise an important part of T2DM development and that  infection inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in  rats.© 2018 M.

This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting.Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR.Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P < .001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r = 0.16; P = .03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P < .001).This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676093>PM aggravates diabetes via the systemically activated IL-6-mediated STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in rats' liver.</a></h1><p>PM exposure aggravates type 2 diabetes, in which inflammatory factors play an important role. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating diabetes after PM exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in -resistant type 2 diabetes. Our study indicated that short-time PM exposure enhances  in type 2 diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream pathways including STAT1, ERK1/2, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose metabolism after PM exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type 2 diabetes via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger  to the PM exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Military Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

The objective of present study was to evaluate the androgens levels in young females with emphasis on the association of 17OHP with IR. Serum concentrations of glucose, , and androgens in 80 young females were measured by standard routine procedures. Total testosterone (TT), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (ASD), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) levels were higher in patients with IR compared to healthy controls ( < .05). 17OHP was associated with IR and other androgens tested in young females. According to the results, androgen excess was associated with IR in young females and TT appeared to be independent predictor of IR in these patients. These data may suggest that simultaneous quantification of an androgen profile including at least TT, DHT, and 17OHP can present useful clinical information for assessment of androgen excess.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678069>Ingestion of lean meat elevates muscle inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 protein content independent of a distinct post-prandial circulating proteome in young adults with obesity.</a></h1><p>We have recently shown that a novel signalling kinase, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1), is implicated in whole-body  via its inhibitory action on Akt.  and  like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein metabolism in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g fat) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Different epidemiologic studies have shown a significant relationship between lower intake of fibre and metabolic disorders. There are many naturally occurring dietary fibres among which gums are utmost important class e.g. guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, gellan gum, and gum acacia. Gum acacia has been considered as a safe dietary fibre by the United States, Food and Drug Administration and it is used widely as a stabilizer, thickening agent, and emulsifier in the food industry. Though gum acacia feeding has been reported to exert many beneficial effects in both rodents and humans, the underpinning for the different proposed molecular mechanisms are still elusive.

The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated  renders neurons resistant to . This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal  reduces hexokinase 2, thus impairing glycolysis. This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

The aim of this study was to determine the FA profile and pro-antioxidant status in sarcopenic frail elderly patients enrolled in a nutritional and physical activity program and to evaluate their correlation with clinical markers. Moreover, the possible changes, produced after a short-term clinical protocol, were evaluated. Plasma and erythrocyte FA composition and pro-antioxidant status were analyzed in sarcopenic elderly subjects recruited for the randomized clinical study and treated with a placebo or dietary supplement, a personalized diet, and standardized physical activity. Subjects were tested before and after 30 days of treatment. Pearson correlations between biochemical parameters and patients' characteristics at recruitment indicate interesting features of sarcopenic status such as negative correlation among the plasma FA profile, age, and physical characteristics. Physical activity and dietetic program alone for 30 days induced a decrease of saturated FA concentration with a significant increase of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid. Supplementation plus physical activity induced a significant decrease of linoleic acid, omega-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase of stearic and oleic acid concentration. Moreover, glutathione reductase activity, which is an indicator of antioxidant status, significantly increased in erythrocytes. Changes over time between groups indicate significant differences for saturated FAs, which suggest that the amino acid supplementation restores FA levels that are consumed during physical activity. A relationship between FA and clinical/metabolic status revealed unique correlations and a specific metabolic and lipidomic fingerprint in sarcopenic elderly. The results indicate the positive beneficial role of supplementation and physical activity on plasma FA status and the antioxidant system as a co-adjuvant approach in sarcopenic, frail, elderly patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667363>Adipocyte browning and  to obesity in mice is induced by expression of ATF3.</a></h1><p>Billions of people have obesity-related metabolic syndromes such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Promoting the browning of white adipose tissue has been suggested as a potential strategy, but a drug still needs to be identified. Here, genetic deletion of activating transcription factor 3 (  ) in mice under a high-fat diet (HFD) resulted in obesity and , which was abrogated by virus-mediated ATF3 restoration. ST32da, a synthetic ATF3 inducer isolated from , promoted ATF3 expression to downregulate adipokine genes and induce adipocyte browning by suppressing the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 axis. Furthermore, ST32da increased white adipose tissue browning and reduced lipogenesis in HFD-induced obese mice. The anti-obesity efficacy of oral ST32da administration was similar to that of the clinical drug orlistat.

Semaphorins are involved in axonal guidance; however, the role of secretory semaphorin 3G (SEMA3G) in regulating adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Microarray analysis showed that the SEMA3G gene was upregulated in an in vitro model of adipogenesis. In this study, SEMA3G was highly expressed in the white adipose tissue and liver. Analysis of 3T3-L1 cell and primary mouse preadipocyte differentiation showed that SEMA3G mRNA and protein levels were increased during the middle stage of cell development. In vitro experiments also showed that adipocyte differentiation was promoted by SEMA3G; however, SEMA3G inhibition using a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed the opposite results. Mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet (HFD); knockdown of SEMA3G was found to inhibit weight gain, reduce fat mass in the tissues, prevent lipogenesis in the liver tissue, reduce  and ameliorate glucose tolerance in HFD mice. Additionally, the effect of SEMA3G on HFD-induced obesity was activated through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling in the adipose tissue and the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway in the liver. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of SEMA3G and leptin were measured in 20 obese and 20 non-obese human subjects. Both proteins were increased in obese subjects, who also exhibited a lower level of adiponectin and presented with . In summary, we demonstrated that SEMA3G is an adipokine essential for adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and  and is associated with obesity. SEMA3G inhibition may, therefore, be useful for treating diet-induced obesity and its complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649313>Improving obesity and blood pressure.</a></h1><p>Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by  stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular . Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666643>Empagliflozin and Dulaglutide are Effective against Obesity-induced Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Fibrosis in A Murine Model.</a></h1><p>Patients with asthma with obesity experience severe symptoms, are unresponsive to conventional asthma treatment, and lack proper pharmacotherapy.

HFD induced interleukin (IL)-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression, which was significantly reduced by empagliflozin, dulaglutide, and their combination. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 showed similar patterns without significant differences. HFD-enhanced T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation was improved by both drugs.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and  resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for  and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h1><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked , type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis.

Herein, we report data relative to the expression and function of TRP vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channels in cancer. Overexpression of TRPV2 is observed in high-grade urothelial cancers and treatment with the TRPV2 agonist cannabidiol induces apoptosis. In prostate cancer, TRPV2 promotes migration and invasion, and TRPV2 overexpression characterizes the castration-resistant phenotype. In breast cancer cells, inhibition of TRPV2 by tranilast reduces the -like growth factor-1 stimulated proliferation. TRPV2 overexpression in triple-negative breast cancer cells is associated with high recurrence-free survival. Increased TRPV2 overexpression is present in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Increased TRPV2 transcripts have been found both in benign hepatoma and in hepatocarcinomas, where TRPV2 expression is associated with portal vein invasion and reduction of cancer stem cell expression. TRPV2 expression and function has been also evaluated in gliomagenesis. This receptor negatively controls survival, proliferation, and  to CD95- or BCNU-induced apoptosis. In glioblastoma stem cells, TRPV2 activation promotes differentiation and inhibits the proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In glioblastoma, the TRPV2 is part of an interactome-based signature complex, which is negatively associated with survival, and it is expressed in high risk of recurrence and temozolomide-resistant patients. Finally, also in hematological malignancies, such as myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia, TRPV2 might represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches. Overall, these findings demonstrate that TRPV2 exhibits an oncogenic activity in different types of cancers, controlling survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion signaling pathways. Thus, it prompts the pharmacological use of TRPV2 targeting in the control of cancer progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h1><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes.

However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: 2.20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile 2: 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile 2: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-2.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of  ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population. Low-grade endotoxemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD through chronic systemic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681178>Elevated Serum Mannose Levels as a Marker of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</a></h1><p> Recent reports have highlighted the role of monosaccharide biosynthesis in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting that these processes may serve as a biomarker in PCOS. Mannose is the main monosaccharide for protein glycosylation in mammals; however, the correlation between mannose and PCOS remains largely unknown.  A total of 132 Chinese Han women were recruited at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. Mannose levels were measured in serum samples collected from 71 patients with PCOS (29 lean, 42 obese) and 61 control subjects (28 lean, 33 obese). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were prepared to compare the diagnostic performance of mannose and hormonal parameters, individually or in combination. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess whether serum mannose levels were associated with PCOS after adjusting for other co-variables.  We showed that serum mannose levels were significantly increased in PCOS patients compared with control subjects regardless of obese status, and hyperandrogenic PCOS patients had higher serum mannose levels than normo-androgenic PCOS and control subjects. In addition, serum mannose levels were significantly correlated with serum androgen levels. Mannose had an area under the curve (AUC) of 73% at a cutoff value of 225.79 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 66.2% and specificity of 73.8% for predicting PCOS. There were no differences between mannose, total testosterone, free testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the reliability of predicting PCOS using the method outlined by Hanley and McNeil. Combining mannose and total testosterone resulted in a higher AUC of 83.3%, and had moderate sensitivity (78.9%) and specificity (77%) for predicting PCOS. The positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 75.8%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher serum mannose levels were strongly associated with an increased risk of PCOS ( = 0.016; odds ratio, 5.623; 95% confidence interval, 1.371-23.070).  Taken together, substantially elevated serum mannose levels are significantly associated with PCOS, highlighting the importance of further research into the role of mannose in the pathogenesis of PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Feng, Shi, Bi, Sagnelli, Sun, Jiao, Wang and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658625> Receptor Trafficking: Consequences for  Sensitivity and Diabetes.</a></h1><p> receptor (INSR) has been extensively studied in the area of cell proliferation and energy metabolism. Impaired INSR activities lead to , the key factor in the pathology of metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mainstream opinion is that  begins at a post-receptor level. The role of INSR activities and trafficking in  pathogenesis has been largely ignored. Ligand-activated INSR is internalized and trafficked to early endosome (EE), where INSR is dephosphorylated and sorted. INSR can be subsequently conducted to lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The metabolic fate of INSR in cellular events implies the profound influence of INSR on  signaling pathways. Disruption of INSR-coupled activities has been identified in a wide range of -related diseases such as T2DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in INSR trafficking may lead to severe . However, there is very little understanding of how altered INSR activities undermine complex signaling pathways to the development of  and T2DM. Here, we focus this review on summarizing previous findings on the molecular pathways of INSR trafficking in normal and diseased states.

Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the β cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic  and triglyceride accumulation through IRS2/AKT and SREBP1 signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CRTC2 in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (e.g., PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (OR = 2.692, P = 0.023, n = 135). Integrating grafts' CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (AUCs: 0.71 vs. 0.79, P = 0.048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces 'hepatogenous diabetes' via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.© 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657304>Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy or Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass for Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: An MBSAQIP Analysis.</a></h1><p>In patients undergoing bariatric surgery, the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to perioperative morbidity. We aimed to evaluate the utilization and outcome of severely obese patients with MetS who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)  laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Using the 2015 and 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database, data were obtained for patients with MetS undergoing LSG or LRYGB. There were 29,588 MetS patients (LSG: 58.7%  LRYGB: 41.3%). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (0.1% for LSG  0.2% for LRYGB, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.58, confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.05,  = 0.07) or length of stay between groups (2 ± 2 for LSG  2.2 ± 2 days for LRYGB,  = 0.40). Compared with LRYGB, LSG was associated with significantly shorter operative time (78 ± 39  122 ± 54 minutes,  < 0.01), lower overall morbidity (2.3%  4.4%, AOR 0.53, CI 0.46-0.60,  < 0.01), lower serious morbidity (1.5%  2.3%, AOR 0.64, CI 0.53-0.76,  < 0.01), lower 30-day reoperation (1.2%  2.3%, AOR 0.52, CI 0.43-0.63,  < 0.01), and lower 30-day readmission (4.2%  6.6%, AOR 0.62, CI 0.55-0.69,  < 0.01). In conclusion, LSG is the predominant operation being performed for severely obese patients with MetS, and its popularity may in part be related to its improved perioperative safety profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667577>Orexin A-induced inhibition of leptin expression and secretion in adipocytes reducing plasma leptin levels and hypothalamic leptin .</a></h1><p>Orexin A (OXA) is a neuropeptide associated with plasma  and leptin levels involved in body weight and appetite regulation. However, little is known about the effect of OXA on leptin secretion in adipocytes and its physiological roles. Leptin secretion and expression were analysed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and  levels were measured by ELISA assay. Phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) levels in the hypothalamus were evaluated by western blotting. OXA dose-dependently suppressed leptin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes by inhibiting its gene expression while facilitating adiponectin secretion. The leptin inhibition by OXA was mediated via orexin receptors (OXR1 and OXR2). In addition to the pathway via extracellular signal-regulated kinases, OXA triggered adenylyl cyclase-induced cAMP elevation, which results in protein kinase A-mediated activation of cAMP response element-binding proteins (CREB). Accordingly, CREB inhibition restored the OXA-induced downregulation of leptin gene expression and secretion. Exogenous OXA for 4 weeks decreased fasting plasma leptin levels and increased hypothalamic pSTAT3 levels in high-fat diet-fed mice, regardless of increase in body weight and food intake. These results suggest that high dose of OXA directly inhibits leptin mRNA expression and thus secretion in adipocytes, which may be a peripheral mechanism of OXA for its role in appetite drive during fasting. It may be also critical for lowering basal plasma leptin levels and thus maintaining postprandial hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678325>Extracellular vesicles as an emerging tool for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a series of interacting pathophysiological cascades, including the aggregation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles derived from hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. AD is the cause of approximately 70% of dementia, an irreversible and untreatable syndrome at its late stage. Hence, more efforts should be devoted to identifying at-risk or preclinical AD populations for early intervention and the improved design of drug trials. The exosome, a nanoscale subtype of extracellular vesicle that serves as a cell-to-cell communication messenger, is an emerging liquid biopsy tool for various diseases including AD. Recently, it has been discovered that brain-derived exosomes can flow through the blood-brain barrier to the peripheral blood, containing important protein and nucleic acid biomarkers that are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Other reports showed a strong involvement of exosomes in synaptic function, , and neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we summarize those studies and assess the value of exosomes as an emerging tool for the early detection of AD in conjunction with the current clinical diagnosis paradigm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to provide a basis for the clinical differential diagnosis of IAS and B-IRS. This was a retrospective study of the medical records of all patients diagnosed with IAS or B-IRS between January 2006 and March 2018 at the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Demographic, clinical, biochemistry, treatment, and follow-up data were examined. There were several different biochemical parameters between IAS (n=13) and B-IRS (n=6): white blood count (WBC, 7.05±3.06 vs. 2.70±0.73×10/l, p=0.004), platelet (249±56.6 vs. 111±68.0×10/l, p<0.001), serum creatine (59.0±17.8 vs. 43.1±7.05 μmol/l, p=0.013), serum albumin (42.3±5.17 vs. 33.6±3.40 g/l, p=0.002), triglyceride (median, 1.33 (1.01, 1.93) vs. 0.56 (0.50, 0.79) mmol/l, p=0.002), plasma IgG (1183±201 vs. 1832±469 mg/ml, p=0.018), IgA (328±140 vs. 469±150 mg/ml, p=0.018), and C3 (128±23.4 vs. 45.3±13.5 mg/l, p<0.001). Fasting  in the IAS and B-IRS patients was high (299-4708 vs. 118-851 mU/l, p=0.106), and there was a difference in 2 h oral glucose tolerance test  (4217-8343 mU/l vs. 274-1143 mU/l, p=0.012).

Serum -like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was lower in all B-IRS patients (25±0.00 vs. 132±52.7 ng/ml, p<0.001). Although IAS and B-IRS are autoimmune hyperinsulinemic dysglycemic syndromes, several clinical parameters (body mass index, HbA1c, WBC, platelet, albumin, triglyceride, IgG, C3, and IGF-1) are different between these two syndromes.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h1><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment  (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

Special emphasis is given also on intriguing insights into the relationship between obesity and BC as well as on the role of novel adipokines in BC development.Recent evidence has underscored the role of the triad of obesity, , and adipokines in postmenopausal BC. Adipokines exert independent and joint effects on activation of major intracellular signal networks implicated in BC cell proliferation, growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis, particularly in the context of obesity, considered a systemic endocrine dysfunction characterized by chronic inflammation. To date, more than 10 adipokines have been linked to BC, and this catalog is continuously increasing. The majority of circulating adipokines, such as leptin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, lipocalin 2, osteopontin, and oncostatin M, is elevated in BC, while some adipokines such as adiponectin and irisin (adipo-myokine) are generally decreased in BC and considered protective against breast carcinogenesis. Further evidence from basic and translational research is necessary to delineate the ontological role of adipokines and their interplay in BC pathogenesis. More large-scale clinical and longitudinal studies are awaited to assess their clinical utility in BC prognosis and follow-up. Finally, novel more effective and safer adipokine-centered therapeutic strategies could pave the way for targeted oncotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669002>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension and risk of chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.</a></h1><p>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been favorably linked to important risk factors associated with development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as , hypertension, and dyslipidemia. However, the protective role of DASH dietary patterns in development of CKD, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), remains inconsistent in the literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to summarize the findings of previous observational studies and quantify the potential association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of CKD using meta-analysis.A comprehensive search was done with the use of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and Scopus databases to find relevant articles published prior to June 2019. Search terms included: ([Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension] OR [DASH]) AND ([Kidney Failure, Chronic] OR [Renal Insufficiency, Chronic] OR [Chronic Kidney Disease], OR [CKD] OR [End-Stage Renal Disease] OR [ESRD] OR [Kidney] OR [Renal]). To pool the risk estimates, fixed-effects and random-effects models were applied. Cochrane Q test was performed to detect sources of heterogeneity among the included studies.Out of the seven studies included in the systematic review, six were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The total sample size was 568,213 participants including 16,694 cases of CKD. Combined risk estimates for 2 cross-sectional and 4 prospective cohort studies showed an inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD (Pooled risk estimate: 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.01). Stratified analysis showed a marginally significant relationship between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in prospective cohort studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.01; p = 0.05), and no significant association in cross-sectional studies (Pooled risk estimate: 0.71, 95% CI 0.38-1.34; p = 0.29), respectively. A significant association was observed between DASH dietary patterns and risk of CKD in the studies extracted DASH based on nutrients (Pooled risk estimate: 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97; p = 0.02), compared to the studies extracted DASH based on food groups (Pooled risk estimate: 0.66, 95% CI 0.28-1.58; p = 0.35).The results of the present study showed a significant inverse association between DASH dietary patterns and the risk of developing CKD. Adherence to DASH dietary patterns might have protective effects against CKD development and progression. Further research is required to confirm the certainty of estimates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In a Charcot foot, there is movement between bones. In an attempt to prevent this movement, the small muscles of the foot contract continuously when the foot is weight bearing. This contraction takes energy in the form of ATP. However, the reduction of glucose transport into the muscle cells due to  / insufficiency, leads to reduction in the ATP producing capacity of the mitochondria. The ATP depletion affects the cell membrane gradient leading to mitochondrial and cellular swelling.

The benefits are most strongly observed in abdominal and cardiac surgery patients, but there has also been data which support its use in other specialties and surgeries. Barriers to the adoption of perioperative carbohydrate loading are few, but importantly include overcoming the inertia to modify older and more restrictive fasting guidelines and achieving the multidisciplinary consensus necessary to implement such changes.

Glioma represents a cancer resulting from an imbalance between glucose metabolism and tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for dysregulated brain glucose metabolism and lactate accumulation in glioma remain to be elucidated. The present study identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) as a candidate to mediate glucose metabolism in glioma. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and  to apoptosis were evaluated in lncRNA-XIST-depleted glioblastoma cells by short hairpin RNA. Glucose uptake, lactate production, as well as levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT3, were measured. Luciferase assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to validate the interactions among lncRNA-XIST, microRNA-126 (miR-126), and  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). An in vivo analysis was carried out in nude mice bearing glioblastoma cell xenografts. The study found that lncRNA-XIST knockdown inhibited cell viability, migration, invasion,  to apoptosis, and glucose metabolism of glioblastoma cells. LncRNA-XIST functioned as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-126 and then regulated IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway in glioblastoma cells. In vivo results demonstrated lncRNA-XIST knockdown reduces the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Taken together, we demonstrated a novel cellular mechanism that was dependent of the lncRNA-XIST/miR-126/IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway in enhanced glucose metabolism in glioma.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
