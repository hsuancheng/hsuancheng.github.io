Alpha-enolase (ENO1), as a prominent glycolytic enzyme, is upregulated in multiple cancers and its overexpression is involved in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of ENO1 in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). Here, we found that ENO1 expression was upregulated in human GC and was associated with Lauren type, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TNM stage. Knockdown of ENO1 attenuated GC cell proliferation and metastasis and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in vitro while ENO1 overexpression did the opposite. ENO1 could modulate AKT signaling pathway in GC cells and the enhanced proliferation and migration ability induced by ENO1 overexpression was impaired after incubation with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 in SGC7901 cells. Our data demonstrated that ENO1 enhances GC cell proliferation and metastasis through the protein kinase  (AKT) signaling pathway, indicating that ENO1/AKT signaling axis may serve as a potential target for treatment of GC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier .V.

NK cells bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system; they are primed for immediate anti-tumour function but can also have prolonged actions alongside the adaptive T cell response. However, the key signals and cellular processes that are required for extended NK cell responses are not fully known. Herein we show that murine NK cell interaction with tumour cells induces the expression of CD25, the high affinity IL2 receptor, rendering these NK cells highly sensitive to the T cell-derived cytokine IL2. In response to IL2, CD25 NK cells show robust increases in metabolic signalling pathways (mTORC1, cMyc), nutrient transporter expression (CD71, CD98), cellular growth and in NK cell effector functions (IFNγ, granzyme ). Specific ligation of an individual activating NK cell receptor, NK1.1, showed similar increases in CD25 expression and IL2-induced responses. NK cell receptor ligation and IL2 collaborate to induce mTORC1/cMyc signalling leading to high rates of  and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and prolonged NK cell survival. Disrupting mTORC1 and cMyc signalling in CD25 tumour interacting NK cells prevents IL2-induced cell growth and function and compromises NK cell viability. This study reveals that tumour cell interactions and T cell-derived IL2 cooperate to promote robust and prolonged NK cell anti-tumour metabolic responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821169>Polychlorinated biphenyls promote cell survival through pyruvate kinase M2-dependent  in HeLa cells.</a></h2><p>It is well known that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment. The present study investigated the effects of three PCBs including 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118), and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell survival and the possible underlying mechanisms. The results showed that PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153 exposure for 48 h significantly promoted HeLa cell survival. Meanwhile, glucose consumption, lactate production, and -related proteins including glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) were remarkably elevated after three PCBs treatment, indicated PCBs stimulating . Moreover, we found that the expression and nuclear distribution of PKM2 protein was significantly increased in PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153-treated HeLa cells. However, the enzymatic activity of PKM2 was reduced. In addition, the three congeners exposure elevated ROS levels and the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits such as NOX2, p47, and p40. The addition of antioxidant NAC antagonized the three PCBs-induced effects on PKM2, cell survival, and . Taken together, these results indicated that PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153 exposure promotes cervical cancer HeLa cell survival by PKM2-dependent upregulation of , which is mediated by NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049769>Influence of aging on germinal centre reaction and antibody response to inactivated influenza virus antigens in mice: sex-based differences.</a></h2><p>The study examined sex-specificities in age-related changes in BALB/c mice IgG antibody responses to immunisation with trivalent inactivated split-virus influenza bulk. Aging diminished the total serum IgG antibody responses to H1N1 and H3N2 and  influenza virus antigens in mice of both sexes, but they remained greater in aged females. This sex difference in aged mice correlated with the greater post-immunisation increase in the frequency of spleen germinal centre (GC)  cells and more favourable T follicular regulatory (Tfr)/GC  cell ratio, as Tfr cells are suggested to control antibody production through suppression of . The greater post-immunisation GC  cell response in aged females compared with males correlated with the greater proliferation of  cells and CD4+ cells in splenocyte cultures from aged females restimulated with inactivated split-virus influenza from the bulk. To support the greater post-immunisation increase in the frequency GC  cell in aged females was more favourable Tfr/T follicular helper (Tfh) cell ratio. Additionally, compared with aged males, in age-matched females the greater avidity of serum IgG antibodies was found. However, in aged females IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio, reflecting spleen Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, was shifted towards IgG1 when compared with age-matched male mice. This shift was ascribed to a more prominent decline in the titres of functionally important IgG2a antibodies in females with aging. The study suggest that biological sex should be considered as a variable in designing strategies to manipulate with immune outcome of immunisation in aged animals, and possibly, at very long distance, humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340681>Sirtuin 3 deficiency accelerates Angiotensin II-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.</a></h2><p>: It has been reported that Angiotensin II (Ang II) induced skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, plays a central role in maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis. This work aims to determine the role of SIRT3-mediated cellular metabolism in skeletal muscle wasting. : Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and SIRT3 knockout (SIRT3 KO) mice were infused with Ang II or saline for 4 weeks. Ang II induces skeletal muscle atrophy by inducing expression of the muscle-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase muscle RING-finger-1 (MuRF1) and atrogin-1, accompanied by a reduction in SIRT3 in skeletal muscle. SIRT3 deficiency accelerated Ang II-induced loss of lean mass and protein hyper-acetylation, while the activities of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes, such as complex I and complex V, were significantly decreased. Furthermore, SIRT3 deficiency accelerated the Ang II-induced shift from slow-twitch towards fast-twitch fibres. Similarly, the three major rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, hexokinase 2 (HK2), phosphofructokinase-1(PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), were upregulated in Ang II-treated SIRT3 KO mice. : These studies indicate that SIRT3 deficiency augmented Ang II-induced fibre-type shifting and metabolic reprogramming.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106485>Antitumor activity of SR splicing-factor 5 knockdown by downregulating pyruvate kinase M2 in non-small cell lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>SR splicing-factors (SRSFs) play a vital role in carcinogenesis. SRSF5 was demonstrated to be upregulated in lung cancer and identified as a novel prognostic indicator for small-cell lung cancer. However, the role of SRSF5 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the molecular mechanism involved are still undefined. The expression of SRSF5 in NSCLC cells was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The proliferation of cells was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 and BrdU assays. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis of apoptosis-associated proteins including -cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, and cytochrome C (Cyt C).  was detected by determining glucose consumption, lactate production, and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression. We found that SRSF5 messenger RNA and protein levels were elevated in NSCLC cells. SRSF5 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and Ki67 expression in NSCLC cells. SRSF5 silencing increased the apoptotic rate, upregulated Bax and Cyt C, and decreased Bcl-2 level in NSCLC cells. Moreover, Knockdown of SRSF5 repressed  in NSCLC cells via reducing PKM2 expression. Enhanced  by PKM2 overexpression attenuated the effects of SRSF5 silencing on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overall, knockdown of SRSF5 inhibited proliferative ability and induced apoptosis by suppressing PKM2 expression in NSCLC cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827861>GAPDH Expression Predicts the Response to R-CHOP, the Tumor Metabolic Status, and the Response of DLBCL Patients to Metabolic Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Diffuse large  cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease treated with anti-CD20-based immuno-chemotherapy (R-CHOP). We identified that low levels of GAPDH predict a poor response to R-CHOP treatment. Importantly, we demonstrated that GAPDH lymphomas use OxPhos metabolism and rely on mTORC1 signaling and glutaminolysis. Consistently, disruptors of OxPhos metabolism (phenformin) or glutaminolysis (L-asparaginase) induce cytotoxic responses in GAPDH  cells and improve GAPDH  cell-lymphoma-bearing mice survival, while they are low or not efficient on GAPDH  cell lymphomas. Ultimately, we selected four GAPDH DLBCL patients, who were refractory to all anti-CD20-based therapies, and targeted DLBCL metabolism using L-asparaginase (K), mTOR inhibitor (T), and metformin (M) (called KTM therapy). Three out of the four patients presented a complete response upon one cycle of KTM. These findings establish that the GAPDH expression level predicts DLBCL patients' response to R-CHOP treatment and their sensitivity to specific metabolic inhibitors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The following parameters were analyzed: primary tumor size, gross tumor volume, maximal standardized uptake value (SUV), total lesion  (TLG), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume transfer constant (K), reverse reflux rate constant (k), extracellular extravascular volume fraction (v), blood plasma volume fraction (v), and initial area under the time-concentration curve defined over the first 60 s post-enhancement (iAUC). CRT responses were defined using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).Thirty patients were included. Non-responders demonstrated higher baseline TLG (p = 0.012), and lower baseline K (p = 0.020) and iAUC (p = 0.016) compared to responders, indicating the usefulness of DCE integrated MR-PET to predict treatment responses. Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that TLG has the best differentiation capability to predict responders. By setting the threshold of TLG to 277, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 66.7%, 83.3%, and 75.0%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.776. The median follow-up time was 19.6 (range 7.8-32.0) months. In univariate analyses, baseline TLG >277 (p = 0.005) and baseline K <254 (10 min; p = 0.015) correlated with poor survival after CRT. In multivariate analysis, baseline TLG >277 remained the significant factor in predicting progression (p = 0.012) and death (p = 0.031).The radiologic parameters derived from DCE integrated MR-PET scans are useful for predicting treatment response in NSCLC patients treated with CRT; furthermore, these parameters are correlated with clinical and survival outcomes including tumor progression and death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286200>Radiomic features of glucose metabolism enable prediction of outcome in mantle cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>To determine whether [F]FDG PET/CT-derived radiomic features alone or in combination with clinical, laboratory and biological parameters are predictive of 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and whether they enable outcome prognostication.Included in this retrospective study were 107 treatment-naive MCL patients scheduled to receive CD20 antibody-based immuno(chemo)therapy. Standardized uptake values (SUV), total lesion , and 16 co-occurrence matrix radiomic features were extracted from metabolic tumour volumes on pretherapy [F]FDG PET/CT scans. A multilayer perceptron neural network in combination with logistic regression analyses for feature selection was used for prediction of 2-year PFS. International prognostic indices for MCL (MIPI and MIPI-) were calculated and combined with the radiomic data. Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank tests were used for PFS prognostication.SUVmean (OR 1.272, P = 0.013) and Entropy (heterogeneity of glucose metabolism; OR 1.131, P = 0.027) were significantly predictive of 2-year PFS: median areas under the curve were 0.72 based on the two radiomic features alone, and 0.82 with the addition of clinical/laboratory/biological data. Higher SUVmean in combination with higher Entropy (SUVmean >3.55 and entropy >3.5), reflecting high "metabolic risk", was associated with a poorer prognosis (median PFS 20.3 vs. 39.4 months, HR 2.285, P = 0.005). The best PFS prognostication was achieved using the MIPI-bm (MIPI- and metabolic risk combined): median PFS 43.2, 38.2 and 20.3 months in the low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups respectively (P = 0.005).In MCL, the [F]FDG PET/CT-derived radiomic features SUVmean and Entropy may improve prediction of 2-year PFS and PFS prognostication.

As an ecological wastewater treatment facility, constructed wetland (CW) is an important sink of NPs. However, little is known about the effects of NPs on microbial nitrogen transformation and related genes in CWs. In this study, short-term (5 days) and long-term (60 days) exposure experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of TiO NPs (0, 1, and 50 mg/L) on microbial nitrogen removal in CWs. The results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was decreased by 35%-51% after long-term exposure to TiO NPs. Metagenomic analysis further confirmed that TiO NPs declined the relative abundance of functional genes and those enzyme encoding genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism pathway and  metabolism process. Furthermore, our data proved that the indigent  metabolism process resulted in the shortage of electron (NADH) and energy sources (ATP), causing inefficient nitrogen removal. Overall, these results revealed that the accumulation of TiO NPs altered the genetic expression of biofilm in CWs, which had significant impacts on biological nitrogen transformation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Cardiomyocytes retain some proliferative capacity in the neonates but lose it in adulthood. Consequently, a number of signaling hubs including microRNAs are altered during cardiac development that adversely impacts regenerative potential of cardiac tissue. Embryonic stem cell cycle miRs are a class of microRNAs exclusively expressed during developmental stages; however, their effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart function in adult myocardium has not been studied previously.To determine whether transient reintroduction of embryonic stem cell cycle miR-294 promotes cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry enhancing cardiac repair after myocardial injury.miR-294 is expressed in the heart during development, prenatal stages, lost in the neonate, and adult heart confirmed by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Neonatal ventricular myocytes treated with miR-294 showed elevated expression of Ki67, p-histone H3, and Aurora  confirmed by immunocytochemistry compared with control cells. miR-294 enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and  in Neonatal ventricular myocytes measured by seahorse assay. Mechanistically, miR-294 represses Wee1 leading to increased activity of the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Next, a doxycycline-inducible AAV9-miR-294 vector was delivered to mice for activating miR-294 in myocytes for 14 days continuously after myocardial infarction. miR-294-treated mice significantly improved left ventricular functions together with decreased infarct size and apoptosis 8 weeks after MI. Myocyte cell cycle reentry increased in miR-294 hearts analyzed by Ki67, pH3, and AurB (Aurora  kinase) expression parallel to increased small myocyte number in the heart.

Ursolic acid (UA) as a natural compound exhibits a number of potential biological effects including antitumor. Searching for the reversal agents from the natural products has been an effective strategy recently applied in overcoming the MDR. So in this study, the reversal effect of UA on the MDR and involved mechanisms were investigated via a multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells model and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analytical methods. The synergistic effects were yielded by the combination of UA and Dox based on the investigation of the intracellular accumulation, the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated transport, the energy metabolism including , tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glutamine metabolism as well as related amino acid metabolism. Obtained results showed that the UA could increase amount of doxorubicin (Dox) entering the cell to accumulate in nuclei, decrease the efflux ratio of digoxin comparable to the effects of the known inhibitor verapamil by acting as a P-gp substrate, decrease the content of intracellular alanine, lactate, pyruvate, glucose, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, serine, and glycine. Taken together, inhibition of P-gp function and disruption of the metabolism of energy and related amino acids could be the key mechanisms by which UA could reverse the MDR.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in biological processes. We have previously shown that hyperthermia (43°C, 30 min) promotes lactate secretion by inhibiting phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cultured immature boar SCs. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs are involved in AMPK-modulated  in SCs. In the present study, we identified 349 miRNAs (227 upregulated and 122 downregulated) in hyperthermia-treated boar SCs by next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing. MiR-8-3p, which was found to be a novel upregulated miRNA in hyperthermia-treated SCs, suppressed the expression of AMPK upstream genes (protein phosphatase 2 subunit , PPP2R5B), and further downregulated the expression of p-AMPK. The miR-8-3p mimic upregulated expression of glucose transporter 3, lactate dehydrogenase A and monocarboxylate transporter 1, and increased lactic acid dehydrogenase activity, lactate secretion, and ATP depletion in SCs; the miR-8-3p inhibitor had the opposite effects on these parameters.

Bacillus manusensis S50-6 is the type strain of a new thermophilic species isolated from hydrothermal vent in Manus Basin. In this study, we examined the growth and global responses of S50-6 to high temperature on molecular level using multi-omics method (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). S50-6 grew optimally at 50 °C (Favorable, F) and poorly at 65 °C (Non-Favorable, NF); it formed spores at F but not at NF condition. At NF condition, S50-6 formed long filaments containing undivided cells. A total of 1621 proteins were identified at F and NF conditions, and 613 proteins were differentially expressed between F and NF. At NF condition, proteins of , rRNA mature and modification, and DNA/protein repair were up-regulated, whereas proteins of sporulation and amino acid/nucleotide metabolism were down-regulated. Consistently, many metabolites associated with amino acid and nucleotide metabolic processes were down-regulated at NF condition. Our results revealed molecular strategies of deep-sea . manusensis to survive at unfavorable high temperature and provided new insights into the thermotolerant mechanisms of thermophiles. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we systematically characterized the genomic, proteomic and metabolomic profiles of a thermophilic deep-sea Bacillus manusensis under different temperatures. Based on these analysis, we propose a model delineating the global responses of . manusensis to unfavorable high temperature. Under unfavorable high temperature,  is a more important energy supply pathway; protein synthesis is subjected to more stringent regulation by increased tRNA modification; protein and DNA repair associated proteins are enhanced in production to promote heat survival. In contrast, energy-costing pathways, such as sporulation, are repressed, and basic metabolic pathways, such as amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms, are slowed down.

Quantitative metabolic parameters, including total metabolic tumour volume (TMTV) using a standardized uptake value (SUV) of ≥2.5 as the threshold, were estimated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off values for the metabolic parameters. The relationships between study variables and patient survival were tested using Cox regression analysis. Patient survival rates were derived from Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test.Median follow-up was 34 months. In patients with a low TMTV (<249 cm), the 3-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 83% and the overall survival (OS) rate was 92%, in contrast to 41% and 57%, respectively, in those with a high TMTV (≥249 cm). In univariate analysis, a high TMTV and NCCN-IPI ≥4 were associated with inferior PFS and OS (P < 0.0001 for all), as was a high total lesion  (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively). In multivariate analysis, TMTV and NCCN-IPI were independent predictors of PFS (hazard ratio, HR, 3.11, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.37-7.07, P = 0.007, and HR 3.42, 95% CI 1.36-8.59, P = 0.009, respectively) and OS (HR 3.41, 95% CI 1.24-9.38, P = 0.017, and HR 5.06, 95% CI 1.46-17.60, P = 0.014, respectively). TMTV was able to separate patients with a high-risk NCCN-IPI of ≥4 (n = 62) into two groups with significantly different outcomes; patients with low TMTV (n = 16) had a 3-year PFS rate of 75% and an OS rate of 88%, while those with a high TMTV had a 3-year PFS rate of 32% and an OS rate of 47% (χ = 7.92, P = 0.005, and χ = 8.26, P = 0.004, respectively). However, regardless of TMTV, patients with a low-risk NCCN-IPI of <4 (n = 41) had excellent outcomes (3-year PFS and OS rates of 85% and 95%, respectively).Pretreatment TMTV was an independent predictor of survival in patients with DLBCL. Importantly, TMTV had an additive prognostic value in patients with a high-risk NCCN-IPI. Thus, the combination of baseline TMTV with NCCN-IPI may improve the prognostication and may be helpful guide the decision for intensive therapy and clinical trials, especially in DLBCL patients with a high-risk NCCN-IPI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30542078>Reduced TCA cycle rates at high hydrostatic pressure hinder hydrocarbon degradation and obligate oil degraders in natural, deep-sea microbial communities.</a></h2><p>Petroleum hydrocarbons reach the deep-sea following natural and anthropogenic factors. The process by which they enter deep-sea microbial food webs and impact the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and other elements is unclear. Hydrostatic pressure (HP) is a distinctive parameter of the deep sea, although rarely investigated. Whether HP alone affects the assembly and activity of oil-degrading communities remains to be resolved. Here we have demonstrated that hydrocarbon degradation in deep-sea microbial communities is lower at native HP (10 MPa, about 1000 m below sea surface level) than at ambient pressure. In long-term enrichments, increased HP selectively inhibited obligate hydrocarbon-degraders and downregulated the expression of beta-oxidation-related proteins (i.e., the main hydrocarbon-degradation pathway) resulting in low cell growth and CO production. Short-term experiments with HP-adapted synthetic communities confirmed this data, revealing a HP-dependent accumulation of citrate and dihydroxyacetone. Citrate accumulation suggests rates of aerobic oxidation of fatty acids in the TCA cycle were reduced. Dihydroxyacetone is connected to citrate through glycerol metabolism and , both upregulated with increased HP. High degradation rates by obligate hydrocarbon-degraders may thus be unfavourable at increased HP, explaining their selective suppression. Through lab-scale cultivation, the present study is the first to highlight a link between impaired cell metabolism and microbial community assembly in hydrocarbon degradation at high HP. Overall, this data indicate that hydrocarbons fate differs substantially in surface waters as compared to deep-sea environments, with in situ low temperature and limited nutrients availability expected to further prolong hydrocarbons persistence at deep sea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369364>Comparative proteomic analysis of plant-pathogen interactions in resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes infected with .</a></h2><p>Poplar are important forestry species in China, but the  pathogen causes serious economic losses worldwide.

We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype.

This includes a higher  than in healthy controls. Glucose transporters play an essential role in glucose metabolism by controlling glucose import into the cell from the extracellular environment. We have previously shown that treatment of lupus-prone mice with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which inhibits the first step of  was sufficient to prevent autoimmune activation. However, direct targeting of glucose transporters has never been tested in a mouse model of lupus. Here, we show that CG-5, a novel glucose transporter inhibitor, ameliorated autoimmune phenotypes in a spontaneous lupus-prone mouse model, B6.NZM2410. (Triple-congenic, TC), and in a chronic graft- vs. host-disease (cGVHD) model of induced lupus. , CG-5 blocked  in CD4 T cells, and limited the expansion of CD4 T cells induced by alloreactive stimulation. CG-5 also modulated CD4 T cell polarization by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 differentiation and promoting regulatory T (Treg) induction. Moreover, CG-5 treatment reduced lupus phenotypes including the expansion of germinal center  (GC ) cells, as well as the production of autoantibodies in both TC mice and cGVHD models. Finally, CG-5 blocked  in human T cells. Overall, our data suggest that blocking glucose uptake with a small molecule inhibitor ameliorates autoimmune activation, at least partially due to its inhibition of  in CD4 T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066170>c-MYB- and PGC1a-dependent metabolic switch induced by MYBBP1A loss in renal cancer.</a></h2><p>The tumor microenvironment may alter the original tumorigenic potential of tumor cells. Under harsh environmental conditions, genetic alterations conferring selective advantages may initiate the growth of tumor subclones, providing new opportunities for these tumors to grow. We performed a genetic loss-of-function screen to identify genetic alterations able to promote tumor cell growth in the absence of glucose. We identified that downregulation of MYBBP1A increases tumorigenic properties under nonpermissive conditions. MYBBP1A downregulation simultaneously activates PGC1α, directly by alleviating direct repression and indirectly by increasing PGC1α mRNA levels through c-MYB, leading to a metabolic switch from  to OXPHOS and increased tumorigenesis in low-glucose microenvironments. We have also identified reduced MYBBP1A expression in human renal tumor samples, which show high expression levels of genes involved in oxidative metabolism. In summary, our data support the role of MYBBP1A as a tumor suppressor by regulating c-MYB and PGC1α. Therefore, loss of MYBBP1A increases adaptability spanning of tumors through metabolic switch.© 2019 The Authors.

This potentially finds a field of application in the control of the T cell responses in autoimmune diseases, including in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of the possible metabolic targets, Glut1 gained considerable interest because of its pivotal role in glucose uptake to fuel  in activated T cells, and the recent development of a novel class of small molecules that act as selective inhibitor of Glut1. We believe we can foresee a possible application of pharmacological Glut1 blockade approach to control autoreactive T cells that destroy insulin producing beta cells. However, Glut1 is expressed in a broad range of cells in the body and off-target and side effect are possible complications. Moreover, the duration of the treatment and the age of patients are critical aspects that need to be addressed to reduce toxicity. In this paper, we will review recent literature to determine whether it is possible to design a pharmacological Glut1 blocking strategy and how to apply this to autoimmunity in T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673142>Grape berry position affects the diurnal dynamics of its metabolic profile.</a></h2><p>Solar irradiance and air temperature are characterized by dramatic circadian fluctuations and are known to significantly modulate fruit composition. To date, it remains unclear whether the abrupt, yet predictive, diurnal changes in radiation and temperature prompt direct metabolic turn-over in the fruit. We assessed the role of fruit insolation, air temperature, and source-tissue CO assimilation in the diurnal compositional changes in ripening grape berries. This was performed by comparing the diurnal changes in metabolite profiles of berries positioned such that they experienced (a) contrasting diurnal solar irradiance patterns, and () similar irradiance but contrasting diurnal CO assimilation patterns of adjacent leaves. Grape carbon levels increased during the morning and decreased thereafter. Sucrose levels decreased throughout the day and were correlated with air temperature, but not with the diurnal pattern of leaf CO assimilation. Tight correlation between sucrose and glucose-6-phosphate indicated the involvement of photorespiration/ in sucrose depletion. Amino acids, polyamines, and phenylpropanoids fluctuated diurnally, and were highly responsive to the diurnal insolation pattern of the fruit. Our results fill the knowledge gap regarding the circadian pattern of source-sink assimilate-translocation in grapevine. In addition, they suggest that short-term direct solar exposure of the fruit impacts both its diurnal and nocturnal metabolism.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563128>Comparative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Elevated Capacity for Photosynthesis in Polyphenol Oxidase Expression-Silenced  DC. Leaves.</a></h2><p>Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzes the o-hydroxylation of monophenols and oxidation of o-diphenols to quinones. Although the effects of PPO on plant physiology were recently proposed, little has been done to explore the inherent molecular mechanisms. To explore the in vivo physiological functions of PPO, a model with decreased PPO expression and enzymatic activity was constructed on  DC. using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology. Proteomics was performed to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the model (VC) and empty vector-carrying plants (VV) untreated or exposed to high levels of UV- and dark (HUV-+D). Following integration, it was concluded that the DEPs mainly functioned in photosynthesis, , and redox in the PPO silence plants. Mapman analysis showed that the DEPs were mainly involved in light reaction and Calvin cycle in photosynthesis. Further analysis illustrated that the expression level of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, the content of chlorophyll, and the photosynthesis rate were increased in VC plants compared to VV plants pre- and post HUV-+D. These results indicate that the silence of PPO elevated the plant photosynthesis by activating the  process, regulating Calvin cycle and providing ATP for energy metabolism. This study provides a prospective approach for increasing crop yield in agricultural production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154896>Proliferating tumor cells mimick glucose metabolism of mature human erythrocytes.</a></h2><p>Mature human erythrocytes are dependent on anerobic , i.e. catabolism (oxidation) of one glucose molecule to produce two ATP and two lactate molecules. Proliferating tumor cells mimick mature human erythrocytes to glycolytically generate two ATP molecules. They deliberately avoid or switch off their respiration, i.e. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery and consequently dispense with the production of additional 36 ATP molecules from one glucose molecule. This phenomenon is named aerobic  or Warburg effect. The present review deals with the fate of a glucose molecule after entering a mature human erythrocyte or a proliferating tumor cell and describes why it is useful for a proliferating tumor cell to imitate a mature erythrocyte. Blood consisting of plasma and cellular components (99% of the cells are erythrocytes) may be regarded as a mobile organ, constantly exercising a direct interaction with other organs. Therefore, the use of drugs, which influences the biological activity of erythrocytes, has an immediate effect on the entire organism. : TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; GSH: reduced state of glutathione; NFκ: Nuclear factor of kappa ; PKB (Akt): protein kinase ; NOS: nitric oxide synthase; IgG: immune globulin G; HS: hydrogen sulfide; slanDCs: Human 6-sulfo LacNAc-expressing dendritic cells; IL-8: interleukin-8; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen; R5P: ribose-5-phophate; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide; O: superoxide anion; G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; HbO: Oxyhemoglobin; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 1,3-BPG: 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate; 2,3-BPG: 2,3-bisphosphoglycerte; PGAM1: phosphoglycerate mutase 1; 3-PG: 3-phosphoglycerate; 2-PG: 2-phosphoglycerate; MIPP1: Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase; mTORC1: mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; Ru5P: ribulose 5-phosphate; ox-PPP: oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway; PGK: phosphoglycerate kinase; IFN-γ: interferon-γ; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in Brain; HO: hydrogen peroxide; ROOH: lipid peroxide; SOD: superoxide dismutase; MRC: mitochondrial respiratory chain; MbFe-O: methmyoglobin; RNR: ribonucleotide reductase; PRPP: phosphoribosylpyrophosphate; PP: pyrophosphate; GSSG: oxidized state of glutathione; non-ox-PPP: non-oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway; RPI: ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; RPE: ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase; X5P: xylulose 5-phosphate; TK: transketolase; TA: transaldolase; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; AR2: aldose reductase 2; SD: sorbitol dehydrogenase; HK: hexokinase; MG: mehtylglyoxal; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; TILs: tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; MCTs: monocarboxylate transporters; pHi: intracellular pH; Hif-1α: hypoxia-induced factor 1; NHE1: sodium/H (Na/H) antiporter 1; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type proton ATPase; CAIX: carbonic anhydrase; CO: carbon dioxide; HCO: bicarbonate; NBC: sodium/bicarbonate (Na/HCO) symporter; pHe: extracellular pH; GLUT-1: glucose transporter 1; PGK-1: phosphoglycerate kinase 1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781698>Chronic Hypoxia Enhances β-Oxidation-Dependent Electron Transport via Electron Transferring Flavoproteins.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia poses a stress to cells and decreases mitochondrial respiration, in part by electron transport chain (ETC) complex reorganization. While metabolism under acute hypoxia is well characterized, alterations under chronic hypoxia largely remain unexplored. We followed oxygen consumption rates in THP-1 monocytes during acute (16 h) and chronic (72 h) hypoxia, compared to normoxia, to analyze the electron flows associated with , glutamine, and fatty acid oxidation. Oxygen consumption under acute hypoxia predominantly demanded pyruvate, while under chronic hypoxia, fatty acid- and glutamine-oxidation dominated. Chronic hypoxia also elevated electron-transferring flavoproteins (ETF), and the knockdown of ETF⁻ubiquinone oxidoreductase lowered mitochondrial respiration under chronic hypoxia. Metabolomics revealed an increase in citrate under chronic hypoxia, which implied glutamine processing to α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Expression regulation of enzymes involved in this metabolic shunting corroborated this assumption. Moreover, the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 increased, thus pointing to fatty acid synthesis under chronic hypoxia. Cells lacking complex I, which experienced a markedly impaired respiration under normoxia, also shifted their metabolism to fatty acid-dependent synthesis and usage. Taken together, we provide evidence that chronic hypoxia fuels the ETC via ETFs, increasing fatty acid production and consumption via the glutamine-citrate-fatty acid axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511046>FUBP1 promotes neuroblastoma proliferation via enhancing -a new possible marker of malignancy for neuroblastoma.</a></h2><p>Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the deadliest paediatric solid tumours due to its rapid proliferative characteristics. Amplified copies of MYCN are considered the most important marker for the prediction of tumour relapse and progression in NB, but they were only detected in 20-30% of NB patients, indicating there might be other oncogenes in the development of NB. The far upstream element binding protein 1 (FUBP1) was first identified as a transcriptional regulator of the proto-oncogene MYC. However, the expression and role of FUBP1 in NB have not been documented.FUBP1 expression was analysed from GEO database and verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting (WB) in NB tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, Colony formation assay, EDU, TUNEL staining and flow cytometric analysis. Several glycolytic metabolites production was confirmed by ELISA and oxygen consuming rate (OCR). Luciferase assay, WB, chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) were used to explore the mechanisms of the effect of FUBP1 on NB.FUBP1 mRNA levels were increased along with the increase in International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stages. High expression of FUBP1 with low N-Myc expression accounted for 44.6% of NB patient samples (n = 65). In addition, FUBP1 protein levels were remarkably increased with NB malignancy in the NB tissue microarray (NB: n = 65; ganglioneuroblastoma: n = 31; ganglioneuroma: n = 27). Furthermore, FUBP1 expression was negatively correlated with patient survival rate but positively correlated with ki67 content. In vitro experiments showed that FUBP1 promotes NB cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis via enhancing  and ATP production. Mechanistically, FUBP1 inhibited the degradation of HIF1α via downregulation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), the E3 ligase for HIF1α, resulting in upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase isoform  (LDHB) expression to enhance . Overexpressed or silenced N-Myc could not regulate FUBP1 or LDHB levels.Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that elevated FUBP1 promotes NB  and growth by targeting HIF1α rather than N-Myc, suggesting that FUBP1 is a novel and powerful oncogene in the development of NB independent of N-Myc and may have potential in the diagnosis and treatment of NB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391192>6-Phosphofructo-2-Kinase/Fructose-2,6-Biphosphatase-2 Regulates TP53-Dependent Paclitaxel Sensitivity in Ovarian and Breast Cancers.</a></h2><p>Paclitaxel is an integral component of primary therapy for breast and epithelial ovarian cancers, but less than half of these cancers respond to the drug.

Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the /gluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a)  (8 proteins), ) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and ) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in  and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation.

Previous studies indicate tumor associated lymphocytes, including  cells and T cells, contribute to tumor angiogenesis and tumor progression. The present study aims to identify the function of Lymphotoxin-α (LT-α), which is secreted by the activated lymphocytes, in the tumor angiogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The coculture system between HNSCC cell line Cal27 and primary lymphocytes revealed that tumor cells promoted the LT-α secretion in the cocultured lymphocytes. In vitro data further demonstrated that LT-α promoted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by enhancing the PFKFB3-mediated glycolytic flux. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 suppressed the enhanced proliferation and migration of HUVECs. We further identified that LT-α induced PFKFB3 expression was dependent on the TNFR/NF-κ signaling pathway. In addition, we proved that PFKFB3 blockade decreased the density of CD31 positive blood vessels in HNSCC xenografts. Finally, the results from the human HNSCC tissue array revealed that the expression of LT-α in HNSCC samples positively correlated with microvessel density, lymphocytes infiltration and endothelial PFKFB3 expression. In conclusion, infiltrated lymphocyte secreted LT-α enhances the  of ECs in a PFKFB3-dependent manner through the classical NF-κ pathway and promotes the proliferation and migration of ECs, which may contribute to the aberrant angiogenesis in HNSCCs. Our study suggests that PFKFB3 blockade is a promising therapeutic approach for HNSCCs by targeting tumor angiogenesis.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941102>Bombyxin ( Insulin-Like Peptide) Increases the Respiration Rate Through Facilitation of Carbohydrate Catabolism in .</a></h2><p>Bombyxin-II, an insulin-like peptide of the silkmoth , has been shown to reduce both the trehalose concentration in the hemolymph and the glycogen content in some tissues of  larvae.

The present study aimed to investigate the possible effects of CIRP-mediated regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver following acute cold exposure. The livers and serum of male C57BL/6 mice were collected following cold exposure at 4 °C for 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h. Glucose metabolic markers and the expression of glucose metabolic-related proteins were detected in the liver. Acute cold exposure was found to increase the consumption of glycogen in the liver. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) and pyruvic acid (PA) were found to show a brief increase followed by a sharp decrease during cold exposure. Anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) expression was upregulated. CIRP protein expression displayed a sequential increase with prolonged acute cold exposure time. Acute cold exposure also increased the level of protein kinase  (AKT) phosphorylation, and activated the AKT-signaling pathway.

Clinicopathological parameters and imaging characteristics, including TMTV, TLG, and bone marrow (BM) involvement detected by PET/CT were compared to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).The median follow-up time was 31 months. Areas under the curve of TMTV and TLG to predict events were 0.820 and 0.816, respectively. The 2-year PFS and OS were 29% and 43% in 7 patients with high TLG (> 5797 g) vs. 93% and 96% in those with low TLG (P < 0.001).

Incubation with menadione in concentrations of up to 30 µM did not affect cell viability. In contrast, exposure of astrocytes to 100 µM menadione caused a time-dependent impairment of cellular metabolism and cell functions as demonstrated by impaired glycolytic lactate production and strong increases in the activity of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase and in the number of propidium iodide-positive cells within 4 h of incubation. In addition, already 5 min after exposure of astrocytes to menadione a concentration-dependent increase in the number of ROS-positive cells as well as a concentration-dependent and transient accumulation of cellular glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were observed. The rapid intracellular GSSG accumulation was followed by an export of GSSG that was prevented in the presence of MK571, an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (Mrp1). Menadione-induced glutathione (GSH) oxidation and ROS formation were found accelerated after glucose-deprivation, while the presence of dicoumarol, an inhibitor of the menadione-reducing enzyme NQO1, did not affect the menadione-dependent GSSG accumulation.

In recent years, plenty of studies have identified that immunometabolism affects survival status of certain cells, also cell activation, differentiation and effector functions. Conversely, immune cells with different functions or differentiational status upregulate specific metabolic pathways to maintain their identities. In response to outer stimulations, naive immune cells differentiate into activated cells, accompanied with a series of immunometabolism changes. Therefore, abnormal immunometabolism can induce global imbalance of immune homeostasis, which further results in the initiation and development of autoimmune diseases, including SLE. Multiple abnormalities of immunometabolism have been found in patients with SLE or mouse models of lupus. Immune cells involved in the development of SLE, such as T cells,  cells, dendritic cells and macrophages present various metabolic abnormalities and pathological phenotypes. Among these cells, CD4+ T cells play predominant roles in the pathogenesis of SLE. Lots of studies demonstrated that CD4+ T cells and their subsets were in abnormal immunometabolic status,which further resulted in the development of SLE. In CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE or mouse models of lupus, both levels of  and oxidative phosphorylation are significantly higher compared with healthy controls. However,mitochondrial abnormalities, decreased ATP production and increased level of oxidative stress also have been found in these cells, which play important roles in the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and autoantibodies. Aggregated lipids rafts and increased synthesis of glycosphingolipid and cholesterol also have been observed in the CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, leading to the abnormally elevated TCR signaling. Moreover, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is activated in the CD4+ T cells from both patients with SLE or mouse models of lupus and participate in the metabolic abnormalities of pathological CD4+ T cells. Progressive understanding of immunometabolism give us new insights of the pathogenesis of SLE and provide us with more therapeutic targets in the treatment of SLE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535784>Cytosolic lipid excess-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is the cause or effect of high fat diet-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance: a molecular insight.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria play a central role in the energy homeostasis in eukaryotic cells by generating ATP via oxidative metabolism of nutrients. Excess lipid accumulation and impairments in mitochondrial function have been considered as putative mechanisms for the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Accumulation of lipids in tissues occurs due to either excessive fatty acid uptake, decreased fatty acid utilization or both. Consequently, elevated levels cytosolic lipid metabolites, triglycerides, diacylglycerol and ceramides have been demonstrated to adversely affect glucose homeostasis. Several recent studies indicate that reduced insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis and reduced expression of mitochondrial enzymes and PPAR-γ coactivator, in high fat feeding (lipid overload) are associated with insulin resistance. Despite the fact, few notable studies suggest mitochondrial dysfunction is prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus; it is still not clear whether the defects in mitochondrial function are the cause of insulin resistance or the consequential effects of insulin resistance itself. Thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the intricacies of mitochondrial function and its association with cytosolic lipid excess. This review therefore critically examines the molecular cascades linking cytosolic lipid excess and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of high fat diet-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. The sequential processes following the excess intake of high fat diet in skeletal muscle includes, accumulation of cytosolic fatty acids, increased production of reactive oxygen species, mutations and ageing, and decreased mitochondrial biogenesis. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction is then leading to decreased β-oxidation, respiratory functions and  and increased glucolipotoxicity. These events collectively induce the insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937242>A Challenging Case of Coexisting Type A and Type  Lactic Acidosis: A Case Report.</a></h2><p>The etiology of lactic acidosis can potentially be misleading, especially in a critically ill patient with malignancy. Type  lactic acidosis represents a rare and often lethal complication of malignancy. When differentiating the types of lactic acidosis, Type A is due to marked tissue hypoperfusion and Type  is due to causes in the setting of a normal perfused state. We report the case of a 56-year-old male with newly diagnosed poorly differentiated neuroendocrine metastatic carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma who presented with a decreased level of consciousness and appetite. The patient was started on a sepsis protocol from an initial intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and despite management, his mentation and respiratory status worsened, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient continued to have elevated lactic acid and white count levels throughout the hospital course. After extensive workup and an ICU stay of 16 days, a decision was made to pursue comfort care measures and the patient passed away shortly thereafter. The patient's persistently elevated lactic acidosis may have resulted from the inherent malignancy. The literature mentions  with enhanced metabolism as a proposed mechanism. One theory states that these changes enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a way that favors proliferation over efficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, resulting in elevations of lactate production. Patients presenting to the ICU with elevated lactic acid levels need to be thoroughly worked up for all potential causes. In our case, the underlying malignancies likely caused the persistently elevated lactic acidosis, despite subtherapeutic treatment and resuscitative measures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976008>Impaired cellular energy metabolism in cord blood macrophages contributes to abortive response toward inflammatory threats.</a></h2><p>Neonatal sepsis is characterized by hyperinflammation causing enhanced morbidity and mortality compared to adults. This suggests differences in the response towards invading threats. Here we investigate activated cord blood macrophages (CBMΦ) in comparison to adult macrophages (PBMΦ), indicating incomplete interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin 10 (IL-10)-induced activation of CBMΦ. CBMΦ show reduced expression of phagocytosis receptors and cytokine expression in addition to altered energy metabolism. In particular, IFN-γ as well as IL-10-activated CBMΦ completely fail to increase  and furthermore show reduced activation of the mTOR pathway, which is important for survival in sepsis. MTOR inhibition by rapamycin equalizes cytokine production in CBMΦ and PBMΦ. Finally, incubation of PBMΦ with cord blood serum or S100A8/A9, which is highly expressed in neonates, suppresses mTOR activation, prevents  and the expression of an PBMΦ phenotype. Thus, a metabolic alteration is apparent in CBMΦ, which might be dependent on S100A8/A9 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30695991>Vitamin C as a Modulator of the Response to Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been gaining attention as a potential treatment for human malignancies. Various experimental studies have shown the ability of pharmacological doses of vitamin C alone or in combinations with clinically used drugs to exert beneficial effects in various models of human cancers. Cytotoxicity of high doses of vitamin C in cancer cells appears to be related to excessive reactive oxygen species generation and the resulting suppression of the energy production via . A hallmark of cancer cells is a strongly upregulated aerobic , which elevates its relative importance as a source of ATP (Adenosine 5'-triphosphate). Aerobic  is maintained by a highly increased uptake of glucose, which is made possible by the upregulated expression of its transporters, such as GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4. These proteins can also transport the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate, permitting its preferential uptake by cancer cells with the subsequent depletion of critical cellular reducers as a result of ascorbate formation. Ascorbate also has a potential to affect other aspects of cancer cell metabolism due to its ability to promote reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) in numerous cellular metalloenzymes. Among iron-dependent dioxygenases, important targets for stimulation by vitamin C in cancer include prolyl hydroxylases targeting the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1/HIF-2 and histone and DNA demethylases. Altered metabolism of cancer cells by vitamin C can be beneficial by itself and promote activity of specific drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511451>Flow Cytometry-Based Photodynamic Diagnosis with 5-Aminolevulinic Acid for the Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h2><p>Multiple myeloma is the cancer of plasma cells. Along with the development of new and effective therapies, improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma have increased the interest in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. However, the considerable heterogeneity of immunophenotypic and molecular markers of myeloma cells has limited its clinical application. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural compound in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Following ALA treatment, tumor cells preferentially accumulate porphyrins because of the differential activities of aerobic , known as Warburg effect. Among various porphyrins, protoporphyrine IX is a strong photosensitizer; thus, ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis has been widely used in various solid cancers. Here, the feasibility of flow cytometry-based photodynamic detection of MRD was tested in multiple myeloma. Among various human cell lines of hematological malignancies, including K562 erythroleukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, Nalm6 pre- cell leukemia, KG1a myeloid leukemia, and U937 monocytic leukemia, human myeloma cell line, KMS18, and OPM2 abundantly expressed ALA transporters, such as SLC36A1 and SLC15A2, and 1 mM ALA treatment for 24 h resulted in nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence expression, which could be competitively inhibited by ALA transport with gamma-aminobutyric acid. Titration studies revealed that the lowest ALA concentration required to achieve nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence in KMS18 cells was 0.25 mM, with an incubation period of 2 h. Under these conditions, incubation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in only 1.8 % of the cells exhibiting porphyrin fluorescence. Therefore, flow cytometry-based photodynamic diagnosis is a promising approach for detecting MRD in multiple myeloma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387898>Immunosuppressive Immature Myeloid Cell Generation Is Controlled by Glutamine Metabolism in Human Cancer.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated myeloid cells are one of the prominent components of solid tumors, serving as major immune regulators for the tumor microenvironment (TME) and an obstacle for immune-checkpoint blocking (ICB) therapy. However, it remains unclear how metabolic processes regulate the generation of suppressive myeloid cells in the TME. Here, we found that hematopoietic precursor cells are enriched in the tissues of several types of human cancer and can differentiate into immature myeloid cells (IMC). Tumor-infiltrating IMCs are highly immunosuppressive, glycolytic, and proliferative, as indicated by high levels of M-CSFR, Glut1, and Ki67. To elucidate the role of metabolism in regulating the generation of IMCs, we induced suppressive IMCs from hematopoietic precursor cells with GM-CSF and G-CSF  We found that the generation of suppressive IMCs was accompanied by increased , but not affected by glucose deprivation due to alternative catabolism. Generation of IMCs relied on glutaminolysis, regardless of glucose availability. Glutamine metabolism not only supported the expansion of IMCs with glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate but also regulated the suppressive capacity through the glutamate-NMDA receptor axis. Moreover, inhibition of glutaminase GLS1 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatment, with reduced arginase 1 myeloid cells, increased CD8, IFNγ and granzyme  T cells, and delayed tumor growth in an ICB-resistant mouse model. Our work identified a novel regulatory mechanism of glutamine metabolism in controlling the generation of suppressive IMCs in the TME.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911326>Combination of shikonin with paclitaxel overcomes multidrug resistance in human ovarian carcinoma cells in a P-gp-independent manner through enhanced ROS generation.</a></h2><p>Shikonin (SKN), a naphthoquinone compound, is isolated from Chinese herbal medicine  root and has been studied as an anticancer drug candidate in human tumor models. This study is designed to investigate whether SKN can sensitize the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel (PTX) in drug-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells.Human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell along with the paired PTX-resistant A2780/PTX cells were used. The effects of SKN, PTX or their combination on cell viability were conducted using Sulforhodamine  assay. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with P-gp-FITC anti-body. P-gp activity was determined by a fluorometric MDR assay kit or a rhodamine 123-based efflux assay, respectively. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI co-staining. The effect of SKN, PTX or their combination on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) were investigated using flow cytometry or western blotting, respectively. PKM2 activity was detected by a Pyruvate Kinase Assay Kit.SKN/PTX co-treatment led to synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells, indicating the circumvention of multidrug resistance (MDR) of PTX by SKN. Further study indicated that the MDR reversal effect of SKN was independent of inhibiting activity of the efflux transporter P-gp. Notably, SKN/PTX significantly increased the generation of intracellular ROS in A2780/PTX cells, and scavenging intracellular ROS blocked the sensitizing effects of SKN in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in A2780/PTX cells, but not in A2780 cells. Furthermore, SKN/PTX-induced downregulation of PKM2 (a key enzyme in ) and the suppression of its activity were inhibited by a ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), suggesting that the synergy of the SKN/PTX combination may be not rely on PKM2 suppression.These results reveal a P-gp-independent mechanism through ROS generation for the SKN/PTX combination to overcome MDR in ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655254>Glucose-Induced Cyclic Lipopeptides Resistance in Bacteria via ATP Maintenance through Enhanced .</a></h2><p>Cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) antibiotics have a mechanism that causes membrane malfunction. Thus mechanisms of bacterial resistance to CLPs are thought to modify cell surfaces. However, we found that bacterial resistance to CLPs was strongly related to energy metabolism. Using polymyxin  (PB) as a model of CLPs, we showed that PB causes malfunction of respiration and serious depletion of ATP, contributing to PB-induced cell death and carbon starvation. Glucose addition could maintain the intracellular ATP level and reverse the carbon starvation response resulting from PB treatment. Another study revealed that  was stimulated by the presence of PB and glucose. The mechanism underlying glucose-enabled CLPs' resistance suggests that glucose could maintain the ATP level in PB-treated bacteria by enhancing . Similar results were observed in Staphylococcus aureus, where daptomycin resistance was enhanced by glucose.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality, lesion detection rate, and quantitative values of fxPET compared with conventional bismuth germanium oxide (BGO)-based PET/CT without time-of-flight capability.Fifty-nine patients underwent whole-body (WB) PET/CT scans approximately 1 h after injection of 2-deoxy-2-[F]fluoro-D-glucose, followed by the fxPET scans with detectors located above and below the patients (layout A) and with detectors closer to the patients (layout ). Two readers assessed the image quality using a 4-point grade for each layout and reached a consensus. We evaluated the differences and/or correlations between fxPET and WB PET/CT, including the lesion detection rates, the standardized uptake value (SUV), the metabolic tumor volume (MTV), the total lesion  (TLG), the tumor-to-normal liver ratio (TLR), and the background liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).The image quality of layout  was better than layout A (p < 0.0001). Of 184 lesions, the detection rate of layout  was significantly higher than WB PET/CT (p = 0.041), while the detection rate of layout A was comparable to WB PET/CT. The SUVmax/mean/peak were larger, and the MTVs were smaller in fxPET than WB PET/CT, especially in the lesions smaller than 2 cm (p < 0.01). The SUVmax/mean/peak, the MTVs and the TLGs of fxPET had significant positive correlations with WB PET/CT (p < 0.0001).

The subsequent growth and survival of tumor metastases depend on different metabolic changes, which constitute one of the enigmatic properties of tumor cells. Aerobic , 'the Warburg effect', contributes to tumor energy supply, by oxidizing glucose in a faster manner compared to oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increased lactate production by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), which in turn affects the immune response. Surrounding stromal cells contribute to feedback mechanisms further prompting the acquisition of pro-invasive metabolic features. Hence, therapeutic strategies targeting the glycolytic pathway are intensively investigated, with a special interest on their anti-metastatic properties. Various small molecules, such as LDH-A inhibitors, have shown pre-clinical activity against different cancer types, and blocking LDH-A could also help in designing future complimentary therapies. Modulation of specific targets in cells with an altered glycolytic metabolism should indeed result in a milder and distinct toxicity profile, compared to conventional cytotoxic therapy, while a combination treatment with vitamin C leading to increasing reactive oxygen species levels, should further inhibit cancer cell survival and invasion. In this review we describe the impact of metabolic reprogramming in cancer metastasis, the contribution of lactate in this aberrant process and its effect on oncogenic processes. Furthermore, we discuss experimental compounds that target glycolytic metabolism, such as LDH-A inhibitors, and their potential to improve current and experimental therapeutics against metastatic tumors.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of the present study was to compare neutrophil proteome profiles between diabetic patients with good glycemic control and those with poor glycemic control to see whether there might be any differences that could be related to the cause of complications which are found more commonly in the latter. Using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), we identified 35 differentially expressed proteins, some of which were protein components of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in the poor glycemic control group compared to the good glycemic control group. The observed alterations of protein components of NETs included downregulation of myeloperoxidase, azurocidin (CAP37), and S100A9; and upregulation of the glycolytic enzymes transketolase and alpha-enolase. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), functioning in cellular response and defense, was also found downregulated in the poor control group.

To explore the possible functions of mammalian mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), an interactome of mouse Trx2 was initially created using (i) a monothiol mouse Trx2 species for capturing protein partners from different organs and (ii) yeast two hybrid screens on human liver and rat brain cDNA libraries. The resulting interactome consisted of 195 proteins (Trx2 included) plus the mitochondrial 16S RNA. 48 of these proteins were classified as mitochondrial (MitoCarta2.0 human inventory). In a second step, the mouse interactome was combined with the current four-membered mitochondrial sub-network of human Trx2 (BioGRID) to give a 53-membered human Trx2 mitochondrial interactome (52 interactor proteins plus the mitochondrial 16S RNA). Although thioredoxins are thiol-employing disulfide oxidoreductases, approximately half of the detected interactions were not due to covalent disulfide bonds. This finding reinstates the extended role of thioredoxins as moderators of protein function by specific non-covalent, protein-protein interactions. Analysis of the mitochondrial interactome suggested that human Trx2 was involved potentially in mitochondrial integrity, formation of iron sulfur clusters, detoxification of aldehydes, mitoribosome assembly and protein synthesis, protein folding, ADP ribosylation, amino acid and lipid metabolism, , the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain. The oxidoreductase functions of Trx2 were verified by its detected interactions with mitochondrial peroxiredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductase. Parkinson's disease, triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, and lactate dehydrogenase  deficiency are some of the diseases where the proposed mitochondrial network of Trx2 may be implicated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One problem is the special preparation and sterilization of these meshes-naturally, they should comply with international standards and demands, which is often difficult to achieve in Africa. Our primary approach was to determine whether there are differences in the biocompatibility of fibroblasts between non-sterile and sterile LCMs and commercial meshes (CM).Two polyester CMs with different pore size and a polyester LCM were examined as both sterile and non-sterile. LCM was plasma sterilized at 60 °C and steam sterilized at 134 °C. Sterile and non-sterile meshes were soaked with an antibiotic (penicillin/streptomycin) and antimycotic solution (amphotericin ). Human fibroblasts from healthy subcutaneous tissue were used. Various tests for evaluating the growth behavior and cell morphology of human fibroblasts were conducted. Semiquantitative (light microscopy) and qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) analyses were performed after 1 week and again after 12 weeks. The metabolism of fibroblasts was checked by pH measurements and glucose analyses. Biocompatibility of fibroblasts on sterile and non-sterile meshes was carried out by luminescence methods (cell viability and apoptosis) as well as calorimetric methods for proliferation determination (BrDU assay) and cytotoxicity (LDH assay).Light and electron microscopy revealed a moderate growth of fibroblasts on all investigated mesh types. The results of  and the pH value were within the normal range for all sterile and non-sterile meshes. In biocompatibility studies, no elevated level of apoptosis was detected. The viability measurement of mitochondrial activity of fibroblasts showed a 50% inhibition of mitochondria in all nets, with the exception of non-sterile CM, whereas mitochondrial activity was increased in the non-sterile CM. A proliferation measurement (BrdU test) revealed different growth inhibition in the sterile and non-sterile meshes. This growth inhibition was significantly stronger, particularly for non-sterile CM light meshes, than it was for the non-sterile LCM.Again, our studies show no significant differences in biocompatibility of fibroblasts between expensive and low-cost meshes. In addition, we detected fibroblast growth even in sterile meshes, independent of the mesh group. To our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind in terms of qualitative equivalence of sterile and non-sterile in vitro mesh samples. We do not wish to create future patient studies with non-sterilized meshes saturated with antibiotics/antimycotics. However, perhaps we can prove in future studies that under semi-sterile conditions with certain LCMs, wound infection rates can be acceptable.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952697>The Ser/Thr protein kinase PrkC imprints phenotypic memory in  spores by phosphorylating the glycolytic enzyme enolase.</a></h2><p> is the causative agent of anthrax in humans, bovine, and other animals.  pathogenesis requires differentiation of dormant spores into vegetative cells. The spores inherit cellular components as phenotypic memory from the parent cell, and this memory plays a critical role in facilitating the spores' revival. Because metabolism initiates at the beginning of spore germination, here we metabolically reprogrammed  cells to understand the role of glycolytic enzymes in this process. We show that increased expression of enolase (Eno) in the sporulating mother cell decreases germination efficiency. Eno is phosphorylated by the conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase PrkC which decreases the catalytic activity of Eno. We found that phosphorylation also regulates Eno expression and localization, thereby controlling the overall spore germination process. Using MS analysis, we identified the sites of phosphorylation in Eno, and substitution(s) of selected phosphorylation sites helped establish the functional correlation between phosphorylation and Eno activity. We propose that PrkC-mediated regulation of Eno may help sporulating  cells in adapting to nutrient deprivation. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence that in sporulating , PrkC imprints phenotypic memory that facilitates the germination process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225494>Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 and the response to cell stress.</a></h2><p>Expression of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is up-regulated by several types of cell stress, such as ischemia, radiation and hyperosmotic shock. The SGK1 protein is activated by a signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). SGK1 up-regulates Na/K-ATPase, a variety of carriers including Na-,K-,2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC), NaCl cotransporter (NCC), Na/H exchangers, diverse amino acid transporters and several glucose carriers such as Na-coupled glucose transporter SGLT1. SGK1 further up-regulates a large number of ion channels including epithelial Na channel ENaC, voltagegated Na channel SCN5A, Ca release-activated Ca channel (ORAI1) with its stimulator STIM1, epithelial Ca channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 and diverse K channels. Furthermore, SGK1 influences transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ), p53 tumor suppressor protein, cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and forkhead box O3 protein (FOXO3a). Thus, SGK1 supports cellular glucose uptake and , angiogenesis, cell survival, cell migration, and wound healing. Presumably as last line of defense against tissue injury, SGK1 fosters tissue fibrosis and tissue calcification replacing energy consuming cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655736>Effects of different doses of X-ray irradiation on cell apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage repair and  in HeLa cells.</a></h2><p>The present study examined the radiation biological response of cancer cells to different fractional irradiation doses and investigates the optimal fractional irradiation dose with improved biological effects. Radiobiological studies were performed at the molecular and cellular levels to provide insights into DNA damage and repair, and the apoptosis mechanism of cells that were exposed to different doses of X-ray irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy). Evidence of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cellular apoptosis, G2/M phase proportion and inhibition of cell proliferation were observed following irradiation. Differences in the ROS amount and apoptotic percentages of cells between the 2 and 4 Gy groups were insignificant. Compared with 0 Gy, the expression of the apoptosis suppression protein -cell lymphoma-2 was decreased following at increased irradiation doses. However, apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), caspase-9 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) were elevated following irradiation, compared with the control group (0 Gy). Furthermore, the expression levels of Bax in the 6, 8, 10 and 12.5 Gy groups were significantly increased, compared with the other groups. Caspase-9 expression with 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy were increased compared with other groups, and the Bid levels with 6 and 8 Gy were also increased compared with other groups. G2/M phase arrest was associated with the increase of checkpoint kinase 1 and reduction of cyclin dependent kinase 1. DNA damage repair was associated with the protein Ku70 in the 2, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy groups were less than other group. Compared with other group, Ku80 levels were reduced in the 6 and 8 Gy groups, and Rad51 levels were reduced in the 2, 8 and 10 Gy groups. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α, c-Myc and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) demonstrated an increasing trend following irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, but the expression of pyruvate kinase M2, in the 2-10 Gy irradiation groups, and GLUT1, in the 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy irradiation groups, were reduced, compared with the other groups. Considering the DNA damage repair and apoptosis mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels, it was concluded that 2, 6, 8 and 10 Gy may be the optimal fractional dose that can promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit DNA damage repair and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392189>Assessing metabolic profiles in human myoblasts from patients with late-onset Pompe disease.</a></h2><p>Pompe disease is a neuromuscular disease caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) which degrades glycogen, resulting in progressive accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, lysosomal swelling and rupture. In addition, mitochondrial abnormalities have been frequently observed in muscle biopsy specimens of Pompe patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA, is so far the only available therapy. We evaluated  and basal respiration in primary human myoblasts from patients with Pompe disease and in mouse myoblasts from GAA knockout mice before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment.We tested patient-derived primary human myoblasts and immortalized GAA mouse myoblasts for GAA activity, glycolytic activity, and mitochondrial respiration before and after alglucosidase alfa treatment using enzyme activity assays and SeaHorse measurements.A significant reduction in  (30%) and in mitochondrial respiration (50%) was observed in both, human and mouse GAA-deficient myoblasts.

Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, often used in the clinical treatment of T2DM. Baicalein which is considered to have anti-IR effects is one of its active ingredients. IR-induced HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of baicalein on glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling pathway, using metformin as a positive control. We found that the use of both baicalein and metformin increased the glucose consumption of IR cells, as well as increasing the pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucokinase (GCK) activity. Also increased was the expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase  (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Reduced expression levels were found in that of glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA. The results confirmed that baicalein (10 and 10 mol/L) promotes glucose uptake and , inhibits gluconeogenesis of hepatocytes to improve glucose metabolism, and may be as a result from regulation of InsR/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, baicalein has large concentration range on inhibiting IR, and at lower concentrations has strong anti-IR hepatocyte activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

We previously reported that human hepatoma cells with mitochondrial defects exhibit down-regulated lactate dehydrogenase subunit  (LDHB) expression. Here, using several molecular and biochemical assays and informatics analyses, we investigated how LDHB suppression regulates mitochondrial respiratory activity and contributes to liver cancer progression. We found that transcriptional  down-regulation is an upstream event during suppressed oxidative phosphorylation. We also observed that LDHB knockdown increases inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via lactate-mediated PDH kinase (PDK) activation and thereby attenuates oxidative phosphorylation activity. Interestingly, monocarboxylate transporter 1 was the major lactate transporter in hepatoma cells, and its expression was essential for PDH phosphorylation by modulating intracellular lactate levels. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that a low LDHB/LDHA ratio is statistically significantly associated with poor prognostic outcomes. A low ratio was also associated with a significant enrichment in  genes and negatively correlated with PDK1 and 2 expression, supporting a close link between LDHB suppression and the PDK-PDH axis. These results suggest that LDHB suppression is a key mechanism that enhances  and is critically involved in the maintenance and propagation of mitochondrial dysfunction via lactate release in liver cancer progression.© 2019 Hong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445515>Mesenchymal stem cells restore the sperm motility from testicular torsion-detorsion injury by regulation of glucose metabolism in sperm.</a></h2><p>Testicular torsion is an urological emergency that may lead to infertility due to ischemic injury. Promptly surgical correction by orchiopexy is the only way to avoid infertility and no effective treatment for restoration of spermatogenesis. We previously reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), through local injection upon testicular torsion-detorsion, restored the spermatogenesis without differentiation into sperm. In this study, molecular mechanisms of MSCs in regulating germ cell activity induced by testicular torsion-detorsion were investigated.Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats 6-8 weeks old received left testis 720° torsion for 3 h followed by detorsion with or without MSCs. Right inguinal skin incision without testicular torsion served as control. MSCs with 3 × 10 cells were locally injected into left testis 30 min before detorsion. Three days after the surgery, orchiectomy was executed and the testis, epididymis, and sperm were separated to each other. Functional assessments on sperm included counting sperm amount and sperm motility, staining F-actin, and quantifying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. The hallmarks of glycogenesis and  in each tissue segment were measured by Western blot.Testicular torsion-detorsion significantly decreased the amount of sperm, inhibited the motility, declined the F-actin expression, and reduced the content of ATP in sperm. Local injection of MSCs improved sperm function, particularly in sperm motility. With MSCs, ATP content and F-actin were preserved after testicular torsion-detorsion. MSCs significantly reversed the imbalance of  in sperm and testis induced by testicular torsion-detorsion, as evidenced by increasing the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase 2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-spermatogenic, activating Akt, and increasing glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which led to the increase in  cascades and ATP production. Human stem cell factor contributed the activation of Akt/GSK3 axis when sperm suffered from testicular torsion-detorsion-induced germ cell injury.Local injection of MSCs into a testis damaged by testicular torsion-detorsion restores sperm function mainly through the improvement of sperm motility and energy. MSCs reversed the imbalance of glycogenesis and  in sperm by regulating Akt/GSK3 axis. Thus, MSCs may potentially rescue torsion-detorsion-induced infertility via local injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626647>Failure to eliminate a phosphorylated glucose analog leads to neutropenia in patients with G6PT and G6PC3 deficiency.</a></h2><p>Neutropenia represents an important problem in patients with genetic deficiency in either the glucose-6-phosphate transporter of the endoplasmic reticulum (G6PT/SLC37A4) or G6PC3, an endoplasmic reticulum phosphatase homologous to glucose-6-phosphatase. While affected granulocytes show reduced glucose utilization, the underlying mechanism is unknown and causal therapies are lacking. Using a combination of enzymological, cell-culture, and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that G6PT and G6PC3 collaborate to destroy 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5AG6P), a close structural analog of glucose-6-phosphate and an inhibitor of low-  hexokinases, which catalyze the first step in  in most tissues. We show that 1,5AG6P is made by phosphorylation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, a compound normally present in human plasma, by side activities of ADP-glucokinase and low-  hexokinases. Granulocytes from patients deficient in G6PC3 or G6PT accumulate 1,5AG6P to concentrations (∼3 mM) that strongly inhibit hexokinase activity. In a model of G6PC3-deficient mouse neutrophils, physiological concentrations of 1,5-anhydroglucitol caused massive accumulation of 1,5AG6P, a decrease in glucose utilization, and cell death. Treating G6PC3-deficient mice with an inhibitor of the kidney glucose transporter SGLT2 to lower their blood level of 1,5-anhydroglucitol restored a normal neutrophil count, while administration of 1,5-anhydroglucitol had the opposite effect. In conclusion, we show that the neutropenia in patients with G6PC3 or G6PT mutations is a metabolite-repair deficiency, caused by a failure to eliminate the nonclassical metabolite 1,5AG6P.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

However, we lack a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the rate-yield relationship. Studies pairing computational predictions with experiments have shown the importance of maintenance energy and proteome allocation in explaining rate-yield tradeoffs and overflow metabolism. Recently, adaptive evolution experiments of Escherichia coli reveal a phenotypic diversity beyond what has been explained using simple models of growth rate versus yield. Here, we identify a two-dimensional rate-yield tradeoff in adapted E. coli strains where the dimensions are (A) a tradeoff between growth rate and yield and () a tradeoff between substrate (glucose) uptake rate and growth yield. We employ a multi-scale modeling approach, combining a previously reported coarse-grained small-scale proteome allocation model with a fine-grained genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model), to develop a quantitative description of the full rate-yield relationship for E. coli K-12 MG1655. The multi-scale analysis resolves the complexity of ME-model which hindered its practical use in proteome complexity analysis, and provides a mechanistic explanation of the two-dimensional tradeoff. Further, the analysis identifies modifications to the P/O ratio and the flux allocation between  and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) as potential mechanisms that enable the tradeoff between glucose uptake rate and growth yield. Thus, the rate-yield tradeoffs that govern microbial adaptation to new environments are more complex than previously reported, and they can be understood in mechanistic detail using a multi-scale modeling approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769193>Role of Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Predicting the Adverse Effects of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy in Patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h2><p>CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown great efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) but has been associated with serious adverse effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). It has been speculated that NHL baseline disease burden might affect clinical outcome and CRS, but this has not been explored in detail in any previous study. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG), as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET-CT), are quantitative indicators of baseline tumor burden. Using FDG PET-CT, we calculated baseline and post-CAR-T cell therapy MTV and TLG in 19 patients with NHL. The median MTV was 72 cm (range, .02 to 1137.7 cm), and the median TLG was 555.9 (range, .011 to 8990.3). After a median follow-up of 5 months (range, 1 to 12 months), the best overall response rate was 79.0%. The baseline MTV and TLG did not differ significantly between patients with response and those without response (P = .62 and .95, respectively). On Cox regression analysis, baseline MTV and TLG were not significantly associated with overall survival (P = .67 and .45, respectively). Patients with mild and moderate CRS (grade 0 to 2) had significantly lower MTV and TLG than those with severe CRS (grade 3 to 4) (P = .008 for MTV comparison, P = .011 for TLG comparison). Using FDG PET-CT, we also demonstrated that CAR-T cell therapy in patients with NHL was associated with pseudoprogression and local immune activation. Our data indicate that patients with higher baseline disease burden have more severe CRS, and that CAR-T cell therapy is associated with lymphoma pseudoprogression and local immune activation.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

To examine the relationship between energy metabolism and locomotor variation during osmoregulation, Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis were held at 30‰, 25‰, 20‰, 15‰, and 10‰ salinity for 15 days, after which the activities of key enzymes involved in , tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain in posterior gills, pleopods, and abdominal muscles were determined. Hemolymph osmolality, oxygen consumption rates, swimming and tail-flipping abilities were also obtained. Results showed that hemolymph of F. chinensis was isosmotic to brackish water at 25‰ salinity. The rate of oxygen consumption increased by 27.8% to 126.0% during osmoregulation. Activities of citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) increased in posterior gill rather than muscles during osmoregulation. In muscles, CS and COX activities decreased by 16.6% to 59.11% at 15‰ and 10‰ salinities, but phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities decreased by 13.2% to 44.5% at 10‰ salinity. Swimming abilities were positively correlative with CS and COX activities of pleopod muscle. Tail-flipping abilities increased with PFK and LDH activities of abdominal muscles. These findings suggest that shrimp increase reliance on aerobic metabolism for fueling osmoregulation. There is an energetic trade-off between gill and muscles under salinity exposure. The energetic depression of muscles results in the reduction of shrimp locomotion during osmoregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Seventy unresectable stage III-IV melanoma patients who underwent a baseline F-FDG PET/CT scan were identified. Patients were assigned to the BRAFV600 group or BRAF wild-type group according to mutational status. F-FDG uptake quantification was performed by semi-automatic lesion delineation. Four hundred eighty radiomics features and four conventional PET features (maximum, mean and peak standardized uptake value, and total lesion ) were extracted per lesion. Six different methods of feature selection were implemented and ten-fold cross validated predictive models were built for each. Model performances were evaluated with Area Under the Curves (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves.  Thirty-five BRAFV600 mutated patients (100 lesions) and thirty-five BRAF wild-type patients (79 lesions) were analyzed. AUCs predicting the BRAFV600 mutation varied from 0.54-0.62 and were susceptible to feature selection method. The best AUCs were achieved by feature selection based on literature, a penalized binary logistic regression model and random forest model. No significant difference was found between the BRAFV600 and BRAF wild-type group in conventional PET features, nor predictive value.  BRAFV600 mutation status is not associated with- nor can be predicted with conventional PET features, while radiomics features were of low predictive value (AUC=0.62). We showed feature selection methods influence predictive model performance, describing and evaluating six unique methods. Detecting BRAFV600 status in melanoma based on F-FDG PET/CT alone does not yet provide clinically relevant knowledge.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438528>Indole-4-carboxaldehyde Isolated from Seaweed, , Attenuates Methylglyoxal-Induced Hepatic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Glucose degradation is aberrantly increased in hyperglycemia, which causes various harmful effects on the liver. Glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1) is a ubiquitous cellular enzyme that participates in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MGO), a cytotoxic byproduct of  that induces protein modification (advanced glycation end-products, AGEs) and inflammation. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of indole-4-carboxaldehyde (ST-I4C), which was isolated from the edible seaweed , on MGO-induced inflammation in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocyte cell line. ST-I4C attenuated the MGO-induced expression of inflammatory-related genes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IFN-γ by activating nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) without toxicity in HepG2 cells. In addition, ST-I4C reduced the MGO-induced AGE formation and the expression of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). Interestingly, both the mRNA and protein expression levels of Glo-1 increased following ST-I4C treatment, and the decrease in Glo-1 mRNA expression caused by MGO exposure was rescued by ST-I4C pretreatment. These results suggest that ST-I4C shows anti-inflammatory activity against MGO-induced inflammation in human hepatocytes by preventing an increase in the pro-inflammatory gene expression and AGE formation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to regulate cancer metabolism by regulating genes involved in metabolic pathways. Understanding this layer of complexity could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.miRNAs are noncoding RNAs that have been implicated as master regulators of gene expression. Studies have revealed the role of miRNAs in the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells, with several miRNAs both positively and negatively regulating multiple metabolic genes. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, aerobic , de novo fatty acid synthesis, and altered autophagy allow tumor cells to survive under adverse conditions. In addition, major signaling molecules, hypoxia-inducible factor, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase /mammalian target of rapamycin/phosphatase and tensin homolog, and insulin signaling pathways facilitate metabolic adaptation in tumor cells and are all regulated by miRNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNA mimics or inhibitors could be used to modulate the activity of miRNAs that drive tumor progression via altering their metabolism. Currently, several clinical trials investigating the role of miRNA-based therapy for cancer have been launched that may lead to novel therapeutic interventions in the future.In this review, we summarize cancer-related metabolic pathways, including , TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other metabolism-related oncogenic signaling pathways, and their regulation by miRNAs that are known to lead to tumorigenesis.

Thousands of biomarkers related to the survival and prognosis of patients with this cancer type have been investigated through database mining; however, the prediction effect of a single gene biomarker is not satisfactorily specific or sensitive. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a novel gene signature of prognostic values for patients with LUAD. Using a data-mining method, we performed expression profiling of 1145 mRNAs in large cohorts with LUAD (n = 511) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we selected 198 genes related to , which is the most important enrichment gene set. Moreover, these genes were identified using Cox proportional regression modeling. We established a risk score staging system to predict the outcome of patients with LUAD and subsequently identified four genes (AGRN, AKR1A1, DDIT4, and HMMR) that were closely related to the prognosis of patients with LUAD. The identified genes allowed us to classify patients into the high-risk group (with poor outcome) and low-risk group (with better outcome). Compared with other clinical factors, the risk score has a better performance in predicting the outcome of patients with LUAD, particularly in the early stage of LUAD.

However, under these conditions, the production of l-valine by  is decreased mainly because of a redox cofactor imbalance and a decreased l-glutamate supply. The synthesis of one mole of l-valine from one mole of glucose generates two moles of NADH via  but consumes a total of two moles of NADPH, one in the ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) reaction and the other in the regeneration of l-glutamate as an amino group donor for the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) reaction. The improvement of l-valine synthesis under oxygen deprivation may be due to solving these problems. Increased l-valine synthesis under oxygen deprivation conditions was previously shown in  (Hasegawa et al., 2012). In this study, we have proposed the use of NADH-dependent leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH; EC 1.4.1.9) Bcd from  instead of the native NADPH-dependent pathway including aminotransferase encoded by  to improve l-valine production in  under microaerobic conditions. We have created l-valine-producing strains on the base of the aminotransferase -deficient strain V1 (-7 Δ Δ Δ:P   ) by introducing one chromosomal copy of the  gene or the  gene. Evaluation of the l-valine production by the obtained strains under microaerobic and aerobic conditions revealed that leucine dehydrogenase Bcd had a higher potential for l-valine production under microaerobic conditions. The Bcd-possessing strain exhibited 2.2-fold higher l-valine accumulation (up to 9.1 g/L) and 2.0-fold higher yield (up to 35.3%) under microaerobic conditions than the IlvEpossessing strain. The obtained results could be interpreted as follows: an altering of redox cofactor balance in the l-valine biosynthesis pathway increased the production and yield by  cells under microaerobic conditions. Thus, the effective synthesis of l-valine by means of "valine fermentation" was shown in .

We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane to identify studies assessing the effect of baseline TMTV and TLG on the survival of lymphoma patients. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Twenty-seven eligible studies including 2,729 patients were analysed. Patients with high baseline TMTV showed a worse prognosis with an HR of 3.05 (95% CI 2.55-3.64, p<0.00001) for PFS and an HR of 3.07 (95% CI 2.47-3.82, p<0.00001) for OS. Patients with high baseline TLG also showed a worse prognosis with an HR of 3.44 (95% CI 2.37-5.01, p<0.00001) for PFS and an HR of 3.08 (95% CI 1.84-5.16, p<0.00001) for OS. A high baseline TMTV was significantly associated with worse survival in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP (OS, pooled HR = 3.52; PFS, pooled HR = 2.93). A high baseline TLG was significantly associated with worse survival in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP (OS, pooled HR = 3.06; PFS, pooled HR = 2.93). The negative effect of high baseline TMTV on PFS was demonstrated in HL (pooled HR = 3.89). A high baseline TMTV was significantly associated with worse survival in ENKL patients (OS, pooled HR = 2.24; PFS, pooled HR = 3.25). A high baseline TLG was significantly associated with worse survival in ENKL patients (OS, pooled HR = 2.58; PFS, pooled HR = 2.99). High baseline TMTV or TLG predict significantly worse PFS and OS in patients with lymphoma.

Overall our data support the notion that the declining ability of aged  cells to increase their metabolism following activation contributes to the weakened antibody responses of the elderly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988188>Hypoxia-inducible factors in CD4 T cells promote metabolism, switch cytokine secretion, and T cell help in humoral immunity.</a></h2><p>T cell help in humoral immunity includes interactions of  cells with activated extrafollicular CD4 and follicular T helper (Tfh) cells. Each can promote antibody responses but Tfh cells play critical roles during germinal center (GC) reactions. After restimulation of their antigen receptor (TCR) by  cells, helper T cells act on  cells via CD40 ligand and secreted cytokines that guide Ig class switching. Hypoxia is a normal feature of GC, raising questions about molecular mechanisms governing the relationship between hypoxia response mechanisms and T cell help to antibody responses. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are prominent among mechanisms that mediate cellular responses to limited oxygen but also are induced by lymphocyte activation. We now show that loss of HIF-1α or of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α in CD4 T cells compromised essential functions in help during antibody responses. HIF-1α depletion from CD4 T cells reduced frequencies of antigen-specific GC  cells, Tfh cells, and overall antigen-specific Ab after immunization with sheep red blood cells. Compound deficiency of HIF-1α and HIF-2α led to humoral defects after hapten-carrier immunization. Further, HIF promoted CD40L expression while restraining the FoxP3-positive CD4 cells in the CXCR5 follicular regulatory population.  increases T helper cytokine expression, and HIF promoted  in T helper cells via TCR or cytokine stimulation, as well as their production of cytokines that direct antibody class switching. Indeed, IFN-γ elaboration by HIF-deficient in vivo-generated Tfh cells was impaired. Collectively, the results indicate that HIF transcription factors are vital components of the mechanisms of help during humoral responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545464>PTEN/AKT signaling mediates chemoresistance in refractory acute myeloid leukemia through enhanced .</a></h2><p>Primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and early recurrence of leukemic cells are among the most difficult hurdles to overcome in the treatment of AML. Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the molecular mechanism underlying refractory AML pose a challenge when it comes to developing novel therapeutic drugs. However, accumulating evidence suggests a contribution of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase  (AKT) signaling to the development of refractory AML. To assess PTEN/AKT signaling in AML, two types of AML cell lines were evaluated, namely control HL60 cells and KG1α cells, a refractory AML cell line that is resistant to idarubicin and cytarabine (AraC) treatment. Changes in the expression level of ‑ and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation‑related genes and proteins were evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using an XF24 analyzer. CCK8 assay and Annexin V/PI staining were used to analyze cell viability and cellular apoptosis, respectively. The PTEN protein was found to be depleted, whereas AKT phosphorylation levels were elevated in KG1α cells compared with HL60 cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase 2, and increased lactate production. AKT inhibition decreased the proliferation of KG1α cells and decreased extracellular acidification without affecting HL60 cells. Notably, AKT inhibition increased the susceptibility of KG1α cells to chemotherapy with idarubicin and AraC. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that activation of AKT by PTEN deficiency sustains the refractory AML status through enhancement of  and mitochondrial respiration, effects that may be rescued by inhibiting AKT activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524402>Flux Connections Between Gluconate Pathway, , and Pentose-Phosphate Pathway During Carbohydrate Metabolism in  QM B1551.</a></h2><p> is a bacterium of great importance as a plant-beneficial bacterium in agricultural applications and in industrial bioproduction of proteins. Understanding intracellular processing of carbohydrates in this species is crucial to predicting natural carbon utilization as well as informing strategies in metabolic engineering. Here, we applied stable isotope-assisted metabolomics profiling and metabolic flux analysis to elucidate, at high resolution, the connections of the different catabolic routes for carbohydrate metabolism immediately following substrate uptake in  QM B1551. We performed multiple C tracer experiments to obtain both kinetic and long-term C profiling of intracellular metabolites. In addition to the direct phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) prior to oxidation to 6-phosphogluconate (6P-gluconate), the labeling data also captured glucose catabolism through the gluconate pathway involving glucose oxidation to gluconate followed by phosphorylation to 6P-gluconate. Our data further confirmed the absence of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in  and showed that subsequent catabolism of 6P-gluconate was instead through the oxidative pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway. Quantitative flux analysis of glucose-grown cells showed equal partition of consumed glucose from G6P to the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway and from G6P to the PP pathway through 6P-gluconate. Growth on fructose alone or xylose alone was consistent with the ability of  to use each substrate as a sole source of carbon. However, a detailed C mapping during simultaneous feeding of  on glucose, fructose, and xylose indicated non-uniform intracellular investment of the different carbohydrate substrates. Flux of glucose-derived carbons dominated the gluconate pathway and the PP pathway, whereas carbon flux from both glucose and fructose populated the EMP pathway; there was no assimilatory flux of xylose-derived carbons. Collectively, our findings provide new quantitative insights on the contribution of the different catabolic routes involved in initiating carbohydrate catabolism in  and related  species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866469>Defining Metabolic Rewiring in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics based on untargeted flow infusion electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS) can provide a snap-shot of metabolism in living cells. Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is one of the predominant subtypes of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLCs), which usually shows a poor prognosis. We analysed lung SCC samples and matched histologically normal lung tissues from eight patients. Metabolites were profiled by FIE-HRMS and assessed using -test and principal component analysis (PCA). Differentially accumulating metabolites were mapped to pathways using the  algorithm in R, and biologically meaningful patterns were indicated by Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA). We identified metabolic rewiring networks, including the suppression of the oxidative pentose pathway and found that the normal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were decoupled from increases in  and glutamine reductive carboxylation. Well-established associated effects on nucleotide, amino acid and thiol metabolism were also seen. Novel aspects in SCC tissue were increased in Vitamin  complex cofactors, serotonin and a reduction of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our results show the value of FIE-HRMS as a high throughput screening method that could be exploited in clinical contexts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356092>Phosphoproteomics Reveals the Biosynthesis of Secondary Metabolites in  under Ultraviolet- Radiation.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV)- radiation acts as an elicitor to enhance the production of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. To investigate the mechanisms, which lead to secondary metabolites in  under UVB radiation, a phosphoproteomic technique was used. ATP content increased in the leaves of  under UVB radiation. Phosphoproteins related to calcium such as calmodulin, calcium-dependent kinase, and heat shock proteins increased. Phosphoproteins related to protein synthesis/modification/degradation and signaling intensively changed. Metabolomic analysis indicated that the metabolites classified with pentoses, aromatic amino acids, and phenylpropanoids accumulated under UVB radiation. Phosphoproteomic and immunoblot analyses indicated that proteins related to  and the reactive-oxygen species scavenging system were changed under UVB radiation. These results suggest that UVB radiation activates the calcium-related pathway and reactive-oxygen species scavenging system in . These changes lead to the upregulation of proteins, which are responsible for the redox reactions in secondary metabolism and are important for the accumulation of secondary metabolites in  under UVB radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343111>A better prediction of progression-free survival in diffuse large -cell lymphoma by a prognostic model consisting of baseline TLG and %ΔSUV.</a></h2><p>In the era of rituximab, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) has been inefficient in initial risk stratification for patients with R-CHOP-treated diffuse large -cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To estimate the predictive values of PET/CT quantitative parameters and three prognostic models consisting of baseline and interim parameters for three-year progression-free survival (PFS), we conducted an analysis of 85 patients in China with DLBCL underwent baseline and interim PET/CT scans and treated at the Department of Hematology of Peking University Third Hospital from November 2012 to November 2017. The PET/CT parameters, viz. the baseline and interim values of standardized uptake value (SUV ), total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV), and total lesion  (TLG), and their rates of change, were analyzed by a receiver operating characteristics curve, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank test. Besides, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (NCCN-IPI) was also included in the multivariate Cox hazards model. Owing to the strong correlation between TMTV and TLG at baseline and interim (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.823, P-value = 0.000, and 0.988, P-value = 0.000, respectively), only TLG was included in the multivariate Cox hazards model, where TLG  > 1036.61 g and %ΔSUV  < 86.02% showed predictive value independently (HR = 10.42, 95% CI 2.35-46.30, P = 0.002, and HR = 4.86, 95% CI 1.27-18.54, P = 0.021, respectively). Replacing TLG in the equation, TMTV and TMTV both showed significantly predictive abilities like TLG (HR = 8.22, 95% CI 1.86-32.24, P = 0.005, and HR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.16-7.54, P = 0.023, respectively). After dichotomy, NCCN-IPI also gave a significant performance (P = 0.035 and P = 0.010, respectively, in TLG and TMTV models). The baseline variables, that is, TMTV , TLG and dichotomized NCCN-IPI, and the interim variables TMTV and %ΔSUV , presented independent prognostic value for PFS. In prognostic model 2 (TLG  + %ΔSUV ), the group with TLG  > 1036.61 g and %ΔSUV  < 86.02% recognized 19 (82.6%) of the relapse or progression events, which showed the best screening ability among three models consisting of baseline and interim PET/CT parameters.© 2019 The Authors.

Renal carcinoma is characterized by mutations in target genes involved in metabolic pathways. Metabolic reprogramming covers different processes such as aerobic , fatty acid metabolism, and the utilization of tryptophan, glutamine, and arginine. In the era of the multi-omics approach (with integrated transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), discovering biomarkers for early diagnosis is gaining renewed importance.

However, little literature is available to illustrate its significance in cisplatin resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of ALC1 on cisplatin cytotoxicity of ESCC cells and to study the potential mechanisms.ALC1 at mRNA and protein levels were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell viability was evaluated using CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis was assessed using caspase-3/7 activity assay and flow cytometry analysis.  level was evaluated by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production. The protein levels of p-protein kinase  (Akt) and Akt were determined by western blot.ALC1 was highly expressed in ESCC cells compared with human normal esophageal epithelial Het-1A cells. ALC1 knockdown suppressed the viability, induced apoptosis and enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in ESCC cells. In addition, ALC1 knockdown inhibited  and inactivated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by 740Y-P blocked the effects of ALC1 knockdown on cisplatin cytotoxicity and  in ESCC cells. In contrast, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 or  by 2-deoxyglucose resisted the effect of ALC1 overexpression on cisplatin cytotoxicity in ESCC cells.ALC1 knockdown enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity of ESCC cells by inhibition of  through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Soybean WRINKLED1 (WRI1) a and , with their alternative splicing (AS) products a' and ', are highly expressed in developing seeds and nodules, but their functions in soybean nodulation are not known. GmWRI1a and  differently promoted triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in both Arabidopsis wild-type and wri1 mutant seeds and when they ectopically expressed in the soybean hairy roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 15 genes containing AW boxes in their promoters were targeted by GmWRI1s, including genes involved in , fatty acid (FA) and TAG biosynthesis. GmWRI1a, GmWRI1b and ' differentially transactivated most targeted genes. Overexpression of GmWRI1s affected phospholipid and galactolipid synthesis, soluble sugar and starch contents and led to increased nodule numbers, whereas GmWRI1 knockdown hairy roots interfered root  and lipid biosynthesis and resulted in fewer nodules. These phenomena in GmWRI1 mutants coincided with the altered expression of nodulation genes. Thus, GmWRI1-regulated starch degradation,  and lipid biosynthesis were critical for nodulation. GmWRI1 mutants also altered auxin and other hormone-related biosynthesis and hormone-related genes, by which GmWRI1s may affect nodule development.

Fish were fed six practical diets with graded leucine levels ranging from 0.90 to 2.94% of dry basis for 8 weeks. The trial results showed that, compared to the control group (0.90%), optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA expression related to insulin signaling pathway, including target of rapamycin (TOR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase  (Akt). However, an excessive leucine level (2.94%) led to protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) overexpression and inhibited TOR, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt mRNA expressions. The protein level of TOR, S6K1, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt showed a similar result with mRNA level of these genes. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) significantly improved plasma insulin content, while high level of leucine showed an inhibiting phenomenon. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) could reduce plasma glucose by enhancing the ability of glycometabolism including improving glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), glucokinase (GK) expressions and down-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. While an excessive leucine level (2.94%) resulted in high plasma glucose by inhibiting the ability of glycometabolism including lowering GLUT2 and GK expressions, and improving glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and PEPCK expressions. The relative expressions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and glycogen synthase (GS) were not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. Dietary leucine level of 1.33% could improve plasma triglyceride content (TG) by enhancing lipogenesis including improving sterol-response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) expressions compared to the control group (0.90%). Total cholesterol (TC) was not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. The present results indicate that optimal leucine level could improve  and fatty acid synthesis through improving insulin sensitivity in juvenile blunt snout bream. However, excessive dietary leucine level resulted in high plasma glucose, which led to insulin resistance by inhibiting the gene expressions of insulin signaling pathway and activating gluconeogenesis-related gene expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913395>Increased  mediates Wnt7b-induced bone formation.</a></h2><p>Wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling has emerged as a major mechanism for promoting bone formation and a target pathway for developing bone anabolic agents against osteoporosis. However, the downstream events mediating the potential therapeutic effect of Wnt proteins are not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated that increased  is associated with osteoblast differentiation in response to Wnt signaling, but direct genetic evidence for the importance of glucose metabolism in Wnt-induced bone formation is lacking. Here, we have generated compound transgenic mice to overexpress Wnt family member 7B (Wnt7b) transiently in the osteoblast lineage of postnatal mice, with or without concurrent deletion of the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), also known as solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 1. Overexpression of Wnt7b in 1-mo-old mice for 1 wk markedly stimulated bone formation, but the effect was essentially abolished without Glut1, even though transient deletion of Glut1 itself did not affect normal bone accrual. Consistent with the  results, Wnt7b increased Glut1 expression and glucose consumption in the primary culture of osteoblast lineage cells, and deletion of Glut1 diminished osteoblast differentiation . Thus, Wnt7b promotes bone formation in part through stimulating glucose metabolism in osteoblast lineage cells.-Chen, H., Ji, X., Lee, W.-C., Shi, Y., Li, ., Abel, E.

However, few investigations associated with the biological behavior of MTDH in CRC have been performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of modification of MTDH gene expression (knockdown and overexpression) on the biological behavior of CRC in vitro.MTDH gene expression was analyzed in two CRC cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT116) by qPCR. MTDH was down-regulated via siRNA-mediated knockdown of human MTDH in HCT116 cells, which express high endogenous levels of MTDH gene. Also, MTDH gene was up-regulated via transfection of Caco-2 cells, which express low endogenous levels of MTDH gene, with a plasmid carrying human MTDH gene.Knockdown of MTDH gene expression significantly decreased the gene expression of multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), Snail and NF-κ p65, but increased the gene expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, MTDH-knockdown significantly decreased anaerobic  (glucose consumption and lactate production), cell proliferation ability and transformation into cancer stem cell. Moreover, up-regulation of MTDH gene significantly increased the gene expression of MDR1, Snail and NF-κ p65, deceased the gene expression of E-cadherin, enhanced cell proliferation, and anaerobic  and activated transformation into cancer stem cells.MTDH has an important role in promoting CRC aggravation.

However, the regulatory role of Dppa4 in non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological function of Dppa4 in NSCLC and its underlying mechanism of action. Dppa4 expression was measured in NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines, and its effect on cell proliferation and the expression of glycolytic enzymes was determined. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of Dppa4‑induced alterations in  were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to analyze the prognostic significance of clinicopathological characteristics. Dppa4 was found to be highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, it was observed that Dppa4 was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation and TNM stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified Dppa4 expression and clinical stage as prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. Kaplan‑Meier analysis further revealed that patients with lower Dppa4 expression exhibited a better prognosis. In NSCLC cells, Dppa4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, while Dppa4 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, which was likely mediated by  promotion. Dppa4 knockdown had no evident effect on the majority of enzymes examined; however, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT‑4) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 were significantly upregulated, and hexokinase II (HK‑II) and lactate dehydrogenase  (LDHB) were downregulated following Dppa4 knockdown. By contrast, Dppa4 overexpression resulted in downregulation of GLUT‑4, and upregulation of HK‑II, enolase and LDHB, whereas it had no effect on other enzymes. Since the most evident effect was observed on LDHB, further functional experiments demonstrated that this enzyme reversed the promoting effects of Dppa4 in NSCLC. In conclusion, Dppa4 promotes NSCLC progression, partly through  by LDHB. Thus, the Dppa4‑LDHB axis critically contributes to  in NSCLC cells, thereby promoting NSCLC development and progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540443>Increased  and Higher Lactate Production in Hyperglycemic Myotubes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that chronic hyperglycemia impairs glucose and fatty acid oxidation in cultured human myotubes.

Adipocytes predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation, whereas osteoblasts use  to meet ATP demand. Here, we compared progenitor differentiation from the marrow of two inbred mouse strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6J (B6). These strains differ in both skeletal mass and bone marrow adiposity. We hypothesized that genetic regulation of metabolic programs controls skeletal stem cell fate. Our experiments identified Bcl-2-like protein 13 (Bcl2l13), a mitochondrial mitophagy receptor, as being critical for adipogenic differentiation. We also found that Bcl2l13 is differentially expressed in the two mouse strains, with C3H adipocyte progenitor differentiation being accompanied by a >2-fold increase in Bcl2l13 levels relative to B6 marrow adipocytes. Bcl2l13 expression also increased during adipogenic differentiation in mouse ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) and the murine preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. The higher Bcl2l13 expression correlated with increased mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Importantly,  knockdown significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-L1 cells and eMSCs. Mechanistically,  knockdown reprogrammed cells to rely more on  to meet ATP demand in the face of impaired oxidative phosphorylation.  knockdown in eMSCs increased mitophagy. Moreover, Bcl2l13 prevented apoptosis during adipogenesis. Our findings indicate that the mitochondrial receptor Bcl2l13 promotes adipogenesis by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, suppressing apoptosis, and providing mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. We conclude that genetic programming of metabolism may be important for lineage determination and cell function within the bone marrow.© 2019 Fujiwara et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616543>Loss of intestinal sympathetic innervation elicits an innate immune driven colitis.</a></h2><p>Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system exert control over innate immune responses. In inflammatory bowel disease, sympathetic innervation in intestinal mucosa is reduced. Our aim was to investigate the role of sympathetic innervation to the intestine on regulation of the innate immune responses.In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, we evaluated the effect of adrenergic receptor activation on cytokine production and metabolic profile. In vivo, the effect of sympathetic denervation on mucosal innate immune responses using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or using surgical transection of the superior mesenteric nerve (sympathectomy) was tested in Rag1 mice that lack T- and -lymphocytes.In murine macrophages, adrenergic β2 receptor activation elicited a dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokines, reduced LPS-induced  and increased maximum respiration. Sympathectomy led to a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in intestinal tissue. Within 14 days after sympathectomy, mice developed clinical signs of colitis, colon oedema and excess colonic cytokine production. Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136534>Prognostic and diagnostic value of [18F]FDG-PET/CT in restaging patients with small cell lung carcinoma: an Italian multicenter study.</a></h2><p>The presence of residual disease after initial treatment in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) influences prognosis and impacts patient management. To date, few data exist on the value of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT) in SCLC at restaging. Therefore, in restaging patients with SCLC, we aimed to (a) evaluate the prognostic value yielded by [F]FDG-PET/CT and () assess the diagnostic agreement between [F]FDG-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT).From a multicenter database, we evaluated 164 patients with SCLC who underwent [F]FDG-PET/CT for restaging purposes. PET scans were evaluated visually to identify the presence of recurrence. For each patient, the maximum and the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion  were calculated, taking into account the lesion with the highest [F]FDG uptake (namely, the index lesion) in the local recurrences, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis categories. Kaplan-Meier curves were computed to assess the effects of [F]FDG-PET/CT findings on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. Furthermore, the agreement between PET/CT and ceCT in detecting metastases was evaluated in 119 patients on a patient-based analysis (Cohen's κ; P < 0.05).The presence of metastatic lesions at [F]FDG-PET/CT was associated with a significantly shorter OS (P = 0.039) and progression-free survival (P < 0.001).

The cells were analyzed using mass spectrometry for proteomics/phosphoproteomics, AlamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity, time-lapse video for cell migration, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for gene expression, and immunofluorescence for protein expression.Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis showed inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin and casein kinase 2 pathways, cell motility-related networks, and multiple metabolic processes, including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid, /gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Functional analysis demonstrated inhibition of mitochondrial activities, cell migration, and mitosis. Expression of growth promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibrosis-related genes, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and collagen type 1 ɑ2 chain diminished. Protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin, an important regulator of myofibroblast functions, was also suppressed.Low-level blue light exerted suppressive effects on AMDFs, including suppression of mitochondrial activity, metabolism, cell motility, proliferation, TGFβ1 levels, and collagen I production. Low-level blue light can be a potential treatment for the prevention and reduction of tissue fibrosis, such as hypertrophic scar and keloids. Lasers Surg.

Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the tight junctions. However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin  reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1, 2 and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased , glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610899>The age-related changes and differences in energy metabolism and glutamate-glutamine recycling in the d-gal-induced and naturally occurring senescent astrocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>Previously, we successfully established a d-galactose (d-gal)-induced astrocyte aging model in vitro. However, whether the changes in the aged astrocytes induced by d-gal are similar to those occurred in naturally are unknown. Therefore, in current study, we simultaneously established d-gal-induced and naturally aged astrocyte aging models in vitro to explore the age-related changes and to compare the differences in these two astrocyte aging models. The Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer was used to examine the mitochondrial metabolism and  activities of the young and senescent astrocytes. The results showed that the mitochondrial ATP-linked oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) were decreased markedly both in the d-gal-induced and naturally occurring senescent astrocytes. The basal  activity was increased in the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes, whereas it was decreased in the d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes. Western blot analysis showed that isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were markedly decreased both in these two aging models, whereas the iron‑sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU) was up-regulated in the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes but was down-regulated in the d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes. The expression levels of glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), glutamine synthetase (GS) and γ-aminobutyric acid type  receptor subunit 2 (GABAR2) were also markedly decreased in these two aging models. In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was to be inactivated both in the d-gal-induced and naturally occurring senescent astrocytes. These results indicate that the age-related changes in d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes are not fully consistent with those in naturally occurring senescent astrocytes, and it may be not suitable to use d-gal-induced senescent astrocytes to replace the naturally occurring senescent astrocytes to explore the aging mechanisms under some circumstances.Copyright © 2018.

However, the regulatory role of mitochondria alone is difficult to elucidate due to the complex microenvironment. Currently, mitochondrial transplantation is an available approach for restoring mitochondrial function in mitochondrial diseases but remains unclear in breast cancer. Herein, effects of mitochondrial transplantation via different approaches in breast cancer were investigated.Whole mitochondria (approximately 10.5 μg/ml) were transported into MCF-7 breast cancer cells via passive uptake or Pep-1-mediated delivery. Fresh mitochondria isolated from homeoplasmic 143B osteosarcoma cybrids containing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) derived from health individuals (Mito) or mtDNA with the A8344G mutation (Mito) were conjugated with cell-penetrating peptide Pep-1 (P-Mito) or not conjugated prior to cell co-culture. Before isolation, mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker dye as the tracking label. After 3 days of treatment, cell viability, proliferation, oxidative stress, drug sensitivity to Doxorubicin/Paclitaxel and mitochondrial function were assessed.Compared with P-Mito, a small portion of Mito adhered to the cell membrane, and this was accompanied by a slightly lower fluorescent signal by foreign mitochondria in MCF-7 cells. Both transplantations induced cell apoptosis by increasing the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor; inhibited cell growth and decreased oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells; and increased the cellular susceptibility of both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines to Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel. Mitochondrial transplantation also consistently decreased Drp-1, which resulted in an enhancement of the tubular mitochondrial network, but a distinct machinery through the increase of parkin and mitochondrial fusion proteins was observed in the Mito and P-Mito groups, respectively. Furthermore, although there were no differences in energy metabolism after transplantation of normal mitochondria, metabolism was switched to the energetic and glycolytic phenotypes when the mitochondria were replaced with dysfunctional mitochondria, namely, Mito and P-Mito, due to dramatically induced  and reduced mitochondrial respiration, respectively. Consequently, transplant-induced growth inhibition was abolished, and cell growth in the Mito group was even higher than that in the control group.This study reveals the antitumour potential of mitochondrial transplantation in breast cancer via distinct regulation of mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30887722>Prognostic value of volumetric metabolic parameter changes determined by during and after radiotherapy-based  F-FDG PET/CT in stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prognostic value of volumetric metabolic parameters assessed by during and after radiation-based therapy  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We enrolled stage III NSCLC patients who had planned to receive definitive chemo-radiation or radiotherapy (RT) and underwent  F-FDG PET/CT before treatment (PET1), during RT (at the fifth week, PET2) and after treatment (3 months later, PET3). By comparing with PET1, percentage changes of metabolic tumor volume (ΔMTV) and tumor total lesion  (ΔTLG) of PET2 and PET3 were calculated. We used medians of ΔTLG and ΔMTV as cut-off values to stratify patients. Their prognostic values were evaluated by progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Thirty patients were enrolled initially. Five were excluded due to multiple metastases or double cancer. The remaining 25 patients had PET2 at a median of 46 Gy. Data on PET3 were available in 19 patients. During-RT ΔTLG (cut-off: 65%) was a significant prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P < 0.01). During-RT ΔMTV (cut-off: 42%) had marginal significance for PFS (P = 0.07) and was significant for OS (P = 0.02). Of the PET3 parameters, neither ΔTLG nor ΔMTV was a significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS. We conclude that ΔTLG of during-RT  F-FDG PET/CT may predict treatment response and thus provide opportunities to modify treatment for poor responders.© 2019 The Authors.

In this study, female SD rats were orally treated with 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg·bw AA for 3 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose after oral administration of glucose, plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured. The histology of the pancreas was observed, and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined. Compared with the control, exposure to 30 mg/kg·bw of AA significantly increased FBG level, reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg·bw AA-exposed groups. In addition, AA exposure significantly promoted gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (up-regulation of pc, g6p and gp) and decreased  (down-regulation of gck and pfk). Alternations in these processes may be associated with decreased plasma insulin levels and inhibited insulin-regulated IRS/PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 signaling transduction under AA exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AA disrupted glucose homeostasis and elevated FBG level in female rats possibly by interfering with glucose metabolism and hampering the physiological effect of insulin.Copyright © 2019.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in regulating various biological processes. However, the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in kenaf CMS occurrence remains largely unknown. In the present study, a comparative deep sequencing approach was used to investigate the miRNAs and their roles in regulating anther and pollen development during CMS occurrence. We identified 283 known and 46 new candidate miRNAs in kenaf anther. A total of 67 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were discovered between CMS and its maintainer line. Among them, 40 and 27 miRNAs were up- and downregulated, respectively. These 67 DEMs were predicted to target 189 genes. Validation of DEMs and putative target genes were confirmed by using real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, a potential miRNA-mediated regulatory network, which mainly involves the auxin signaling pathway, signal transduction,  and energy metabolism, gene expression, transmembrane transport, protein modification and metabolism, and floral development, that mediates anther development during CMS occurrence was proposed. Taken together, our findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation in pollen development and CMS occurrence in kenaf.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31248127>H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-Based Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Metabolomic Analysis in Type 2 Diabetic Patients and Risk Prediction for Diabetic Microangiopathy.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance and metabolic derangement are present in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the metabolomic signature of T2DM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been investigated thus far. In this prospective metabolomic study, fasting CSF and plasma samples from 40 T2DM patients to 36 control subjects undergoing elective surgery with spinal anesthesia were analyzed by H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra of CSF and plasma metabolites were analyzed and correlated with the presence of T2DM and diabetic microangiopathy (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) using an area under the curve (AUC) estimation. CSF metabolomic profiles in T2DM patients vs. controls revealed significantly increased levels of alanine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, lactate, pyruvate, and decreased levels of histidine. In addition, a combination of alanine, histidine, leucine, pyruvate, tyrosine, and valine in CSF showed a superior correlation with the presence of T2DM (AUC:0.951), diabetic retinopathy (AUC:0.858), nephropathy (AUC:0.811), and neuropathy (AUC:0.691). Similar correlations also appeared in plasma profiling. These metabolic alterations in CSF suggest decreasing aerobic metabolism and increasing anaerobic  in cerebral circulation of patients with T2DM. In conclusion, our results provide clues for the metabolic derangements in diabetic central neuropathy among T2DM patients; however, their clinical significance requires further exploration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932416>Time-dependent cytotoxicity of dichloroacetate and metformin against Lewis lung carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The use of inhibitors of energy metabolism of malignant cells is a new promising trend in the treatment of cancer patients, based on one of the unique features of the malignant cell, namely the dominance of  over oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen, the so-called Warburg effect.To study time-dependent cytotoxicity of sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) and metformin (MTF) against metastatic tumor cells and action of these agents on tumor cell migration.In the study low metastatic LLC/R9 variant of Lewis lung carcinoma was used. The number of living cells in the cytotoxic test was evaluated using sulforhodamine  after 1, 2 and 3 days of cell incubation in vitro. The parameters of the sensitivity of tumor cells to the action of DCA and MTF in vitro were calculated using nonlinear and linear regression of experimental data. The effect of DCA and MTF on cellular motility in vitro was evaluated using a Boyden chamber by calculation of the number of cells that migrated to the bottom side of the filter within 3 days of incubation. The statistical analysis of the data was carried out with the use of descriptive methods, Student's t-criterion, nonlinear, and linear regression analysis.IC50 of DCA was found to be equal to 50.8 ± 7.6 mM at the first day of incubation with LLC/R9 cells and decreased by 1.9 (p < 0.05) and 2.1 (p < 0.05) times at the 2nd and 3rd days, respectively. Despite the almost identical ІC50 at the 2nd and 3rd days, an increase in the incubation period of cells with DCA for up to 3 days increased the C0 parameter, which reflects the maximum concentration of the agent that does not exhibit cytotoxic effects, by 93% (p < 0.05) compared to this at the 2nd day (16.2 ± 1.4 mM vs 8.4 ± 1.0 mM, correspondently). Unlike DCA, the LLC/R9 cell population was not homogeneous by the sensitivity to the action of MTF; at least at the 3rd day, an appearance of MTF-resistant subpopulation was observed, accounting for 35% of all cells. IC50 of MTF was equal to 12.1 ± 0.6 mM, and unlike DCA, this index progressively decreased at the 2nd and 3rd days by 1.4 (p < 0.05) and 9.3 times (p < 0.05) respectively. Action of DCA at a concentration of 25 mM alone and in combination with MTF at the concentrations of 0.1 mM and 0.7 mM resulted in an increase in cell migration by 65% (p < 0.05), 63% (p < 0.05) and 78.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. There was no significant effect of MTF on the tumor cell migration.The sensitivity of the metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma cells to the action of the modifiers of the energy metabolism increased significantly with an increase in the incubation period, apparently, primarily due to the shortage of nutrient substrates and, in particular, glucose, indicating the relevance of their combined use as well as with other agents, which promote the deficiency of glucose in the tumor microenvironment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022352>Comparative genome analysis of completely sequenced  genomes provides insights into the biosynthetic potential and versatile applications of  ASC-732.</a></h2><p>The genome analysis of microorganisms provides valuable information to endorse more extensive research on their potential applications. In this paper, the genome of  ASC-732, isolated from agave rhizosphere in northeastern Mexico, was analyzed and compared with the genomes of other  species to gain better insight into the parts in the genetic makeup responsible for essential metabolic pathways and others of biotechnological importance. Here, the key genes related to , pentose phosphate, and the Entner-Doudoroff and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways were predicted. Comparative genome analysis revealed that the key genes for hydrogenotrophic growth and carbon fixation pathway, i.e., those coding for hydrogenase and enzymes Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, are absent in   ASC-732. Furthermore, capabilities for producing polyhydroxyalkanoates and extracellular polysaccharide matrix and degrading xenobiotics were found, and the related pathways are explained. Moreover, biofilm formation and the production of exopolysaccharides and polyhydroxyalkanoates were corroborated with crystal violet staining, calcofluor, and Nile red fluorochromes, confirming the presence of the products of the active genes in these pathways and their related metabolic routes, respectively. Additionally, a large group of genes essential for the resistance and detoxification of several heavy metals were also found. Thus, the present study demonstrates that this strain can respond to various environmental signals, such as energy source, nutrient limitations, virulence, and extreme metals concentration, indicating the possibility to foster  ASC-732 in diverse biotechnological applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598523>Akt2 mediates glucocorticoid resistance in lymphoid malignancies through FoxO3a/Bim axis and serves as a direct target for resistance reversal.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used drugs in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies; resistance of GCs in lymphocytes confers poor prognosis and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells acquire resistance to dexamethasone (DEX)-mediated killing through abnormal activation of Akt, resulting in inhibition of the FoxO3a/Bim pathway. The resistant state was reported to be associated with increased , NOTCH1 activating mutations and activated PI3K/ serum GS regulated kinases (SGK) pathway. Use of aforementioned pathway inhibitors blocked FoxO3a-phosphorylation and partially improved DEX-mediated killing of GC-resistant T-ALL cells, further revealing the essential role of the FoxO3a/Bim pathway in the development of GC resistance. Inhibition of Akt is most effective at restoring sensitivity to DEX of GC-resistant lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, but shows significant hepatotoxicity in vivo. A significantly elevated expression of Akt2 not Akt1 in intrinsically, secondarily GC-resistant lymphocytes and relapsed/refractory ALL patients implicates a more specific target for GC resistance. Mechanistically, Akt2 has a stronger binding capacity with FoxO3a compared to Akt1, and acts as a direct and major negative regulator of FoxO3a activity driving GC resistance. Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt2 more effectively restores sensitivity to GCs than inhibition of Akt1 in vitro, shows higher synergistic effect acting with DEX, and reverses GC resistance in GC-resistant T- or - lymphoid tumors in vivo with reduced liver toxicity. In summary, these results suggest that Akt2 might serve as a more direct and specific kinase mediating GC resistance through FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway, and Akt2 inhibition may be explored as a promising target for treating GC-resistant hematopoietic malignancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995317>Enhancing Retinal Endothelial  by Inhibiting UCP2 Promotes Physiologic Retinal Vascular Development in a Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity.</a></h2><p>We address the hypothesis that uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a cellular glucose regulator, delays physiologic retinal vascular development (PRVD) by interfering with glucose uptake through glucose transporter 1 (Glut1).In the rat 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, retinal Glut1 and UCP2 were measured and compared to room air (RA)-raised pups at postnatal day 14 (p14). Pups in OIR and RA received intraperitoneal genipin, an UCP2 inhibitor, or control every other day from p3 until p13. Analyses at p14 included avascular/total retinal area (AVA), Western blots of retinal UCP2 and Glut1, and immunostaining of Glut1 in retinal cryosections. Intravitreal neovascular/total retinal area (IVNV) was analyzed at p18, and electroretinograms were performed at p26. Glut1 and phosphorylated VEGFR2 (p-VEGFR2), glucose uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and cell proliferation were measured in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMVECs) pretreated with genipin or transfected with UCP2siRNA, Glut1siRNA, or control siRNA when incubated with VEGF or PBS.At p14, OIR pups had increased AVA with decreased Glut1 and increased UCP2 in the retina compared to RA retinas. Intraperitoneal genipin increased retinal Glut1 and reduced AVA. Compared to control, treatment with genipin or knockdown of UCP2 significantly increased Glut1, glucose uptake, ATP production, VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2 and cell proliferation in hRMVECs. Knockdown of Glut1 inhibited VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2. Genipin-treated OIR pups with decreased AVA at p14 had reduced IVNV at p18 and increased amplitudes in a- and -waves at p26.Extending PRVD by increasing retinal endothelial glucose uptake may represent a strategy to prevent severe retinopathy of prematurity and vision loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597698>β-Catenin mutations as  determinants of hepatoblastoma phenotypes in mice.</a></h2><p>Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver cancer. Although long-term survival of HB is generally favorable, it depends on clinical stage, tumor histology, and a variety of biochemical and molecular features. HB appears almost exclusively before the age of three years, is represented by seven histological subtypes, and is usually associated with highly heterogeneous somatic mutations in the catenin β 1 (CTNNB1) gene, which encodes β-catenin, a Wnt ligand-responsive transcriptional co-factor. Numerous recurring β-catenin mutations, not previously documented in HB, have also been identified in various other pediatric and adult cancer types. Little is known about the underlying factors that determine the above HB features and behaviors or whether non-HB-associated β-catenin mutations are tumorigenic when expressed in hepatocytes. Here, we investigated the oncogenic properties of 14 different HB- and non-HB-associated β-catenin mutants encoded by Sleeping Beauty vectors following their delivery into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection. We show that all β-catenin mutations, as well as wild-type β-catenin, are tumorigenic when co-expressed with a mutant form of yes-associated protein (YAP). However, tumor growth rates, histologies, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic partitioning, and metabolic and transcriptional landscapes were strongly influenced by the identities of the β-catenin mutations.

To hydrolyze the okara and enable nutrient release, a strategy to valorize okara using solid-state fermentation with food grade Bacillus subtilis (. subtilis) WX-17 was carried out. The study showed that fermentation of okara with . subtilis WX-17 improved its overall nutritional content. The total amino acids content increased from 3.04 ± 0.14 mg/g in unfermented okara to 5.41 ± 1.21 mg/g in okara fermented with . subtilis WX-17. Total fatty acids content increased from 153.04 ± 5.10 to 166.78 ± 2.41 mg/g okara, after fermentation. Antioxidant content (DPPH) also increased by 6.4 times after fermentation. To gain insight into the mechanism, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out. In total, 49 metabolites were detected, which could be classified mainly into carbohydrates, TCA cycle metabolites, amino acids and fatty acids. The decrease in carbohydrate metabolites, showed that  was upregulated. This would have provided the energy and metabolic flux towards the amino acid and fatty acid pathway. This is also in line with the increased amino acids and fatty acid production seen in okara fermented with . subtilis WX-17.

Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a tumor suppressor, modulates aerobic  of malignant cells and has an impact on tumorigenesis. This study focused on investigating SIRT6 expression in ACC and how it generates cancer phenotypes. SIRT6 expression was inhibited in ACC tissues according to western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. MTT assay, TUNEL assay, and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the contribution of SIRT6 to cell invasion, proliferation, death, and migration. It was shown that SIRT6 knockdown promoted cell invasion, proliferation, and migration, and inhibited cell death. Moreover, it was found that SIRT6 knockdown upregulated TLR4 and reinforced phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor-kappa  (NF-κ) subunit p65 as well as inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa- kinase. Additionally, SIRT6 knockdown significantly enhanced expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide as well as transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1.

SDHA gain-of-function led to an accumulation of fumarate in PPBL  cells, which engaged the KEAP1-Nrf2 system to drive the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. In a single patient trial, blocking the activity of the cytokine interleukin-6 in vivo prevented systemic inflammation and ameliorated clinical disease. Overall, our study has identified pathological mitochondrial retrograde signaling as a disease modifier in primary antibody deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318442>Functionally significant metabolic differences between  and T lymphocyte lineages.</a></h2><p>Activation of  and T lymphocytes leads to major remodelling of the metabolic landscape of the cells enabling their post-activation functions. However, naive  and T lymphocytes also show metabolic differences, and the genesis, nature and functional significance of these differences are not yet well understood. Here we show that resting -cells appeared to have lower energy demands than resting T-cells as they consumed lower levels of glucose and fatty acids and produced less ATP. Resting -cells are more dependent on OXPHOS, while T-cells show more dependence on aerobic . However, despite an apparently higher energy demand, T lineage cells showed lower rates of protein synthesis than equivalent  lineage stages. These metabolic differences between the two lineages were established early during lineage differentiation, and were functionally significant. Higher levels of protein synthesis in -cells were associated with increased synthesis of MHC class II molecules and other proteins associated with antigen internalization, transport and presentation. The combination of higher energy demand and lower protein synthesis in T-cells was consistent with their higher ATP-dependent motility. Our data provide an integrated perspective of the metabolic differences and their functional implications between the  and T lymphocyte lineages.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30829010>MiR-1180 from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells induces  and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells by upregulating the Wnt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) play an important role in cancer development and progression. However, the mechanism by which they enhance the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer is unknown.Conditioned media of BM-MSCs (BM-MSC-CM) were analyzed using a technique based on microRNA arrays. The most highly expressed microRNAs were selected for testing their effects on  and chemoresistance in SKOV3 and COC1 ovarian cancer cells. The targeted gene and related signaling pathway were investigated using in silico analysis and in vitro cancer cell models. Kaplan-Merier survival analysis was performed on a population of 59 patients enrolled to analyze the clinical significance of microRNA findings in the prognosis of ovarian cancer.MiR-1180 was the most abundant microRNA detected in BM-MSC-CM, which simultaneously induces  and chemoresistance (against cisplatin) in ovarian cancer cells. The secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) gene was identified as a major target of miR-1180. The overexpression of miR-1180 led to the activation of Wnt signaling and its downstream components, namely Wnt5a, β-catenin, c-Myc, and CyclinD1, which are responsible for -induced chemoresistance. The miR-1180 level was inversely correlated with SFRP1 mRNA expression in ovarian cancer tissue. The overexpressed miR-1180 was associated with a poor prognosis for the long-term (96-month) survival of ovarian cancer patients.BM-MSCs enhance the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer by releasing miR-1180. The released miR-1180 activates the Wnt signaling pathway in cancer cells by targeting SFRP1. The enhanced Wnt signaling upregulates the glycolytic level (i.e. Warburg effect), which reinforces the chemoresistance property of ovarian cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168651>Effect of ethanol supplementation on the transcriptional landscape of bionanocellulose producer Komagataeibacter xylinus E25.</a></h2><p>Ethanol exerts a strong positive effect on the cellulose yields from the widely exploited microbial producers of the Komagataeibacter genus. Ethanol is postulated to provide an alternative energy source, enabling effective use of glucose for cellulose biosynthesis rather than for energy acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the effect of ethanol supplementation on the global gene expression profile of Komagataeibacter xylinus E25 using RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq). We demonstrate that when ethanol is present in the culture medium, glucose metabolism is directed towards cellulose production due to the induction of genes related to UDP-glucose formation and the repression of genes involved in  and acetan biosynthesis. Transcriptional changes in the pathways of cellulose biosynthesis and c-di-GMP metabolism are also described. The transcript level profiles suggest that Schramm-Hestrin medium supplemented with ethanol promotes bacterial growth by inducing protein biosynthesis and iron uptake. We observed downregulation of genes encoding transposases of the IS110 family which may provide one line of evidence explaining the positive effect of ethanol supplementation on the genotypic stability of K. xylinus E25. The results of this study increase knowledge and understanding of the regulatory effects imposed by ethanol on cellulose biosynthesis, providing new opportunities for directed strain improvement, scaled-up bionanocellulose production, and wider industrial exploitation of the Komagataeibacter species as bacterial cellulose producers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864716>CD147‑mediated reprogrammed glycolytic metabolism potentially induces immune escape in the tumor microenvironment (Review).</a></h2><p>Impaired antitumor immunity or induced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy. It is becoming increasingly recognized that dynamic metabolic programming orchestrates appropriate immune responses, whereas incorrect metabolic reprogramming may underlie aberrant immune remodeling. Furthermore, pathways that control cellular metabolism and immune cell function by transcriptional and post‑transcriptional mechanisms are intimately interlinked, including hypo-xia‑inducible factor 1α, c‑Myc and phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase/protein kinase /mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Immunometabolism is an emerging research field involving investigation of the interaction between immunological and metabolic processes. It is likely that high levels of nutrient competition and metabolic interplay exist between tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells in the local tumor milieu, which consequently leads to a reduction in antitumor immunity or immune cell dysfunction. Recently, a metabolic molecular mechanism responsible for the tumorigenic capacity of cluster of differentiation (CD)147, which exhibits high expression on the surface of various malignant tumor cells and is associated with tumor progression via multiple non‑metabolic molecular mechanisms, was identified. The aim of the present review was to focus on the glycolytic mechanism mediated by the upregulation of CD147 in tumors and tumor‑imposed metabolic restrictions on tumor‑infiltrating immune cells, and the consequent immunological hyporesponsiveness. Cellular metabolism is becoming increasingly acknowledged as a key regulator of T‑cell function, specification and fate, and the manipulation of metabolic programming may elucidate therapeutic options for immunological disorders and tumor immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564074>Knockdown of Pyruvate Kinase M Inhibits Cell Growth and Migration by Reducing NF-kB Activity in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Altered genetic features in cancer cells lead to a high rate of aerobic  and metabolic reprogramming that is essential for increased cancer cell viability and rapid proliferation. Pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the final step of . Herein, we report that PKM is a potential therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We found that PKM1 or PKM2 is highly expressed in TNBC tissues or cells. Knockdown of PKM significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and strongly reduced S phase and induced G2 phase cell cycle arrest by reducing phosphorylation of the CDC2 protein in TNBC cells. Additionally, knockdown of PKM significantly suppressed NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells) activity by reducing the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536, and also decreased the expression of NF-kB target genes. Taken together, PKM is a potential target that may have therapeutic implications for TNBC cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30648343>Cryopreserved H O -preconditioned human adipose-derived stem cells exhibit fast post-thaw recovery and enhanced bioactivity against oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), despite being one of the most attractive cell populations for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, currently have certain limitations that reduce their therapeutic efficacy. One of the most serious problems is the poor engraftment of cryopreserved ASCs at injured tissue, attributed to the diminished biological activity of ASCs immediately post-thaw and their poor survival under harsh conditions of oxidative stress. Seeking to address these issues, we have developed a hormetic strategy to preadapt human ASCs to oxidative stress based on a new hydrogen peroxide preconditioning procedure, resulting in cells we call HC016. These cells rapidly recover their biological activity and functionality after cryopreservation while maintaining their mesenchymal stem cell status. Compared with non-preconditioned ASCs, HC016 cells showed (a) faster in vitro adhesion capacity and cell cycle progression immediately post-thaw, () enhanced cell survival under oxidative stress in a serum-free environment, and (c) heightened chemotaxis towards damage signals of oxidized glial cells. In addition, compared with ASC-conditioned medium, HC016-conditioned medium showed a greater cytoprotective and pro-recovery effect on oxidized fibroblasts under serum-free conditions. Consistent with these results, in HC016 cells exposed to oxidative stress, we observed markedly higher expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (a key factor in cell survival and migration) and of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (essential enzymes to upregulate  and downregulate oxidative phosphorylation) along with lower basal mitochondrial activity. Taking into account all the aforementioned advantages, HC016 cells might be considered an important breakthrough in ASC-based cell therapies.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585088>Integrated Proteogenomic Characterization of HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>We performed the first proteogenomic characterization of hepatitis  virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using paired tumor and adjacent liver tissues from 159 patients. Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed consistency and discordance among multi-omics, activation status of key signaling pathways, and liver-specific metabolic reprogramming in HBV-related HCC. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. Two prognostic biomarkers, PYCR2 and ADH1A, related to proteomic subgrouping and involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming, were identified. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutation-associated signaling and metabolic profiles were revealed, among which mutated CTNNB1-associated ALDOA phosphorylation was validated to promote  and cell proliferation. Our study provides a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of HBV-related HCC and may eventually benefit clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The general description of the bacteria included in the group is gram-positive, non-sporing, non-respiring cocci or rods. An overview of the genetics of lactococci, , lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostocs, enterococci and oenococciis presented with special reference to their metabolic traits. The three main pathways in which LAB are involved in the manufacture of fermented foods and the development of their flavour, are (a)  (fermentation of sugars), () lipolysis (degradation of fat) and (c) proteolysis (degradation of proteins). Although the major metabolic action is the production of lactic acid from the fermentation of carbohydrates, that is, the acidification of the food, LAB are involved in the production of many beneficial compounds such as organic acids, polyols, exopolysaccharides and antimicrobial compounds, and thus have a great number of applications in the food industry (i.e. starter cultures).

Therefore, high glucose (HG) concentration provides a favorable condition for increasing proliferation, angiogenesis and decreasing apoptosis, but its molecular mechanisms are still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate HG condition on tumor cells behavior including proliferation, apoptosis, and an angiogenesis mediator. In this study, MCF-7 derived from human breast adenocarcinoma, were cultured in DMEM with two different concentrations of glucose for 48 h (5.5 mM as normal glucose (NG) condition and 25 mM as HG condition). We used Zingiber officinale extraction for the inhibition of NF-κ. Cell proliferation assay was done by direct counting, cell viability by MTT method, bcl-2 by Immunocytochemistry, apoptosis by Hoechst/PI double staining and vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) by ELISA. Results showed that HG increased lactate production, significantly. HG increased cell proliferation, cell viability, VEGF secretion, and bcl-2 expression while it decreased apoptosis. However, when HG was combined with Zingiber officinale extraction, cell proliferation, cell viability, VEGF secretion and bcl-2 expression decreased and apoptosis increased significantly due to inhibition of NF-κ. Results revealed that HG increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and decreased apoptosis due to activation of NF-κ pathway. Moreover, the probable mechanism of the activation of NF-κ in HG is increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this condition that can activate NF-κ directly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611781>Comparative proteomic analysis of salt-responsive proteins in canola roots by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS.</a></h2><p>Salinity stress is a major abiotic stress that affects plant growth and limits crop production. Roots are the primary site of salinity perception, and salt sensitivity in roots limits the productivity of the entire plant. To better understand salt stress responses in canola, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of roots from the salt-tolerant genotype Safi-7 and the salt-sensitive genotype Zafar. Plants were exposed to 0, 150, and 300 mM NaCl. Our physiological and morphological observations confirmed that Safi-7 was more salt-tolerant than Zafar. The root proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to identify proteins regulated in response to salt stress. We identified 36 and 25 protein spots whose abundance was significantly affected by salt stress in roots of plants from the tolerant and susceptible genotype, respectively. Functional classification analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins from the tolerant genotype could be assigned to 14 functional categories, while those from the susceptible genotype could be classified into 9 functional categories. The most significant differences concerned proteins involved in  (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, Phosphoglycerate kinase 3), stress (heat shock proteins), Redox regulation (Glutathione S-transferase DHAR1, L-ascorbate peroxidase), energy metabolism (ATP synthase subunit ), and transport (V-type proton ATPase subunit B1) which were increased only in the tolerant line under salt stress. Our results provide the basis for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of salt-tolerance and will be helpful for breeding salt-tolerant canola cultivars.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

For this reason, inhibitory strategies for these microRNAs are currently being tested in clinical trials. Given the high metabolic demands of the heart and the abundant cardiac expression of miR-103/107, we questioned whether antagomiR-mediated inhibition of miR-103/107 in C57BL/6J mice impacts on cardiac function. Notably, fractional shortening decreased after 6 weeks of antagomiR-103 and -107 treatment. This was paralleled by a prolonged systolic radial and circumferential time to peak and by a decreased global strain rate. Histology and electron microscopy showed reduced cardiomyocyte area and decreased mitochondrial volume and mitochondrial cristae density following antagomiR-103 and -107. In line, antagomiR-103 and -107 treatment decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes' protein levels compared to scrambled, as assessed by mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics. MiR-103/107 inhibition in primary cardiomyocytes did not affect  rates, but it decreased mitochondrial reserve capacity, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and altered mitochondrial network morphology, as assessed by live-cell imaging. Our data indicate that antagomiR-103 and -107 decrease cardiac function, cardiomyocyte size, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the absence of pathological stimuli. These data raise concern about the possible cardiac implications of the systemic use of antagomiR-103 and -107 in the clinical setting, and careful cardiac phenotyping within ongoing trials is highly recommended.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Whether ATP depletion can enhance the efficacy and potency of anti-cancer effects of herbal compounds is so far unknown. We examined the enhancing effect of ATP depletion on anti-cancer actions of tetrandrine (TET) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. A 24-h incubation of A549 cells with tetrandrine caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect (LC = 66.1 μM). Co-incubation with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG,  inhibitor) caused only a very slight enhancement of tetrandrine cytotoxicity. By contrast, inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production with oligomycin (10 μM, ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (30 μM, uncoupling agent) (thus, oligo-FCCP) on its own caused only slight cell cytotoxicity but strongly potentiated tetrandrine cytotoxicity (tetrandrine LC = 15.6 μM). The stronger enhancing effect of oligo-FCCP than 2-DG on TET toxicity did not result from more severe overall ATP depletion, since both treatments caused a similar ATP level suppression. Neither oligo-FCCP nor 2-DG synergized with tetrandrine in decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. TET on its own triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and oligo-FCCP, but not 2-DG, potentiated TET in causing ROS production. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria, but not from , appears to be a very effective means in augmenting TET-triggered ROS production and hence toxicity in A549 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30725425>Homocysteine, Thioretinaco Ozonide, and Oxidative Phosphorylation in Cancer and Aging: A Proposed Clinical Trial Protocol.</a></h2><p>The objective of the proposed clinical interventional trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel therapeutic strategy in subjects with cancer and hyperhomocysteinemia. Following discovery of abnormal homocysteine thiolactone metabolism in cultured malignant cells, thioretinamide, the amide synthesized from retinoic acid and homocysteine thiolactone, and thioretinaco, the complex formed from cobalamin and thioretinamide, were demonstrated to have antineoplastic, anticarcinogenic, and anti-atherogenic properties in animal models. Retinol, ascorbate, and homocysteine thiolactone are necessary for biosynthesis of thioretinamide and thioretinaco by cystathionine synthase and for formation of thioretinaco ozonide from thioretinamide, cobalamin, and ozone. Thioretinaco ozonide is required for prevention of abnormal oxidative metabolism, aerobic , suppressed immunity, and hyperhomocysteinemia in cancer.The pancreatic enzyme therapy of cancer promotes catabolism of proteins, nucleic acids, and glycosaminoglycans with excess homocysteinylated amino groups resulting from abnormal accumulation of homocysteine thiolactone in malignant cells. Dietary deficiencies of pyridoxal, folate, cobalamin, and nitriloside contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia in cancer, and in protein energy malnutrition. A deficiency of dietary sulfur amino acids downregulates cystathionine synthase, causing hyperhomocysteinemia.The organic sulfur compound diallyl trisulfide increases hydrogen sulfide production from homocysteine in animal models, inhibits Stat3 signaling in cancer stem cells, and produces apoptosis of malignant cells. The furanonaphthoquinone compound napabucasin inhibits Stat3 signaling and causes mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis of malignant cells. The protocol of the proposed clinical trial in subjects with myelodysplasia consists of thioretinamide and cobalamin as precursors of thioretinaco ozonide, combined with pancreatic enzyme extracts, diallyl trisulfide, napabucasin, nutritional modification to minimize processed foods, vitamin supplements, essential amino acids, and beneficial dietary fats and proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446011>Characterization of filarial phosphoglycerate kinase.</a></h2><p>Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a key enzyme of  which also acts as a mediator of DNA replication and repair in the nucleus. We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino acid residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. . malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino acids. In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) with CaMBD was confirmed using calmodulin agarose binding pull down assay, which showed that the rBmPGK binds to CaM agarose-calcium dependent manner. The effect of CaM-Caon the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-5.0 μM) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 μM). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 μM and 10 μM concentration of CaCl. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 ± 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl at 1.0 μM and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK. Bioinformatics studies have also confirmed the interaction between CaMBD and CaM which showed CaM interacted to Phe 206, Gln 220, Arg 223 and Asn 224 of rBmPGK CaM binding domain. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the activity of filarial PGK could be regulated in cells by Ca-CaM depending upon the concentration of calcium.

Wild type and Δpyk cells were cultivated in chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by H-NMR, GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the perturbation created in the pyruvate node drove an adaptation to new conditions by altering the nutritional compounds' consumption. In Δpyk, pyruvate, which is subject to glucose-dependent carbon catabolite repression, did not comply with the hierarchy in carbon source utilization. Other metabolic alterations were observed such as the higher secretion of the overflow metabolites acetoin and 2,3-butanediol by Δpyk.

We investigated the enzymatic properties and posttranslational modification state of purified LDH from the skeletal muscle of control and dehydrated (30% total body water loss) X. laevis. LDH from the muscle of dehydrated frogs showed a 93% reduction in phosphorylation on threonine residues and an 80% reduction of protein nitrosylation. LDH from dehydrated muscle also showed a 74% lower V in the pyruvate oxidizing direction and a 78% decrease in V in the lactate reducing direction along with a 33% lower K for pyruvate and a 40% higher K for lactate. In the presence of higher levels of urea and molecular crowding by polyethylene glycol, used to mimic conditions in the cells of dehydrated animals, the K values of control and dehydrated LDH demonstrated opposite responses. In the pyruvate oxidizing direction, control muscle LDH was unaffected by these additives, whereas the affinity for pyruvate dropped further for LDH from dehydrated muscle. The opposite effect was more pronounced in the lactate reducing direction as control LDH showed an increased affinity for lactate, whereas LDH from dehydrated animals showed a further reduction in affinity. The physiological consequences of dehydration-induced LDH regulation appear to poise the enzyme towards lactate production when urea levels are high and lactate catabolism when urea levels are low, perhaps helping to maintain  under dehydrating conditions whilst providing for the ability to recycle lactate upon rehydration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669571>Fucoidan⁻Fucoxanthin Ameliorated Cardiac Function via IRS1/GRB2/ SOS1, GSK3β/CREB Pathways and Metabolic Pathways in Senescent Mice.</a></h2><p>The effects of low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF) in combination with high-stability fucoxanthin (HSFUCO) on cardiac function and the metabolic pathways of aging mice () were investigated.

He attributed this metabolic trait to a respiratory injury and considered this a universal metabolic alteration in carcinogenesis. This interpretation of the data was questioned since the early 1950s. Realistic causative mechanisms and consequences of the Warburg effect were described only during the past 15 years and are summarized in this article. There is clear evidence that mitochondria are not defective in most cancers. Aerobic , a key metabolic feature of the Warburg phenotype, is caused by active metabolic reprogramming required to support sustained cancer cell proliferation and malignant progression. This metabolic switch is directed by altered growth factor signaling, hypoxic or normoxic activation of HIF-1α- transcription, oncogene activation or loss-of-function of suppressor genes, and is implemented in the hostile tumor microenvironment. The 'selfish' reprogramming includes (a) overexpression of glucose transporters and of key glycolytic enzymes, and an accelerated glycolytic flux with subsequent accumulation and diversion of glycolytic intermediates for cancer biomass synthesis, () high-speed ATP production that meets the energy demand, and (c) accumulation of lactate which drives tumor progression and largely contributes to tumor acidosis, which in turn synergistically favors tumor progression and resistance to certain antitumor therapies, and compromises antitumor immunity. Altogether, the Warburg effect is the central contributor to the cancer progression machinery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31043571>Teriflunomide treatment for multiple sclerosis modulates T cell mitochondrial respiration with affinity-dependent effects.</a></h2><p>Interference with immune cell proliferation represents a successful treatment strategy in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS). One prominent example is pharmacological inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which mediates de novo pyrimidine synthesis in actively proliferating T and  lymphocytes. Within the TERIDYNAMIC clinical study, we observed that the DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide caused selective changes in T cell subset composition and T cell receptor repertoire diversity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In a preclinical antigen-specific setup, DHODH inhibition preferentially suppressed the proliferation of high-affinity T cells. Mechanistically, DHODH inhibition interferes with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and aerobic  in activated T cells via functional inhibition of complex III of the respiratory chain. The affinity-dependent effects of DHODH inhibition were closely linked to differences in T cell metabolism. High-affinity T cells preferentially use OXPHOS during early activation, which explains their increased susceptibility toward DHODH inhibition. In a mouse model of MS, DHODH inhibitory treatment resulted in preferential inhibition of high-affinity autoreactive T cell clones. Compared to T cells from healthy controls, T cells from patients with RRMS exhibited increased OXPHOS and , which were reduced with teriflunomide treatment. Together, these data point to a mechanism of action where DHODH inhibition corrects metabolic disturbances in T cells, which primarily affects profoundly metabolically active high-affinity T cell clones. Hence, DHODH inhibition may promote recovery of an altered T cell receptor repertoire in autoimmunity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Compelling evidence has also revealed that altered metabolic energetics in HSCs underlies the onset of certain blood diseases; however, the mechanisms responsible for energetic reprogramming remain elusive. We recently found that Fanconi anemia (FA) HSCs in their resting state are more dependent on mitochondrial respiration for energy metabolism than on . In the present study, we investigated the role of deficient  in FA HSC maintenance. We observed significantly reduced glucose consumption, lactate production, and ATP production in HSCs but not in the less primitive multipotent progenitors or restricted hematopoietic progenitors of Fanca and Fancc mice compared with that of wild-type mice, which was associated with an overactivated p53 and TP53-induced  regulator, the TIGAR-mediated metabolic axis. We utilized Fanca HSCs deficient for p53 to show that the p53-TIGAR axis suppressed  in FA HSCs, leading to enhanced pentose phosphate pathway and cellular antioxidant function and, consequently, reduced DNA damage and attenuated HSC exhaustion. Furthermore, by using Fanca HSCs carrying the separation-of-function mutant p53 transgene that selectively impairs the p53 function in apoptosis but not cell-cycle control, we demonstrated that the cell-cycle function of p53 was not required for glycolytic suppression in FA HSCs. Finally, ectopic expression of the glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme PFKFB3 specifically antagonized p53-TIGAR-mediated metabolic reprogramming in FA HSCs. Together, our results suggest that p53-TIGAR metabolic axis-mediated glycolytic suppression may play a compensatory role in attenuating DNA damage and proliferative exhaustion in FA HSCs.

Excessive angiogenesis is a hallmark of several diseases, including cancer. The number of studies in endothelial cell metabolism has increased in recent years, and new metabolic targets for pharmacological treatment of pathological angiogenesis are being proposed. In this work, we wanted to address experimental evidence of substrate (namely glucose, glutamine and palmitate) dependence in immortalized dermal microvascular endothelial cells in comparison to primary endothelial cells. In addition, due to the lack of information about lactate metabolism in this specific type of endothelial cells, we also checked their capability of utilizing extracellular lactate. For fulfilling these aims, proliferation, migration, Seahorse, substrate uptake/utilization, and mRNA/protein expression experiments were performed. Our results show a high glycolytic capacity of immortalized dermal microvascular endothelial cells, but an early independence of glucose for cell growth, whereas a total dependence of glutamine to proliferate was found. Additionally, in contrast with reported data in other endothelial cell lines, these cells lack monocarboxylate transporter 1 for extracellular lactate incorporation. Therefore, our results point to the change of certain metabolic features depending on the endothelial cell line.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160974>Therapeutic effects of ethanolic extract from the green cocoon shell of silkworm  on type 2 diabetic mice and its hypoglycaemic mechanism.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a clinically complex disease characterized by hyperglycaemia with disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm  on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied . The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote . The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between  and gluconeogenesis, which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661165>Why Do Intravascular Schistosomes Coat Themselves in Glycolytic Enzymes?</a></h2><p>Schistosomes are intravascular parasitic helminths (blood flukes) that infect more than 200 million people globally. Proteomic analysis of the tegument (skin) of these worms has revealed the surprising presence of glycolytic enzymes on the parasite's external surface. Immunolocalization data as well as enzyme activity displayed by live worms confirm that functional glycolytic enzymes are indeed expressed at the host-parasite interface. Since these enzymes are traditionally considered to function intracellularly to drive , in an extracellular location they are hypothesized to engage in novel "moonlighting" functions such as immune modulation and blood clot dissolution that promote parasite survival. For instance, several glycolytic enzymes can interact with plasminogen and promote its activation to the thrombolytic plasmin; some can inhibit complement function; some induce  cell proliferation or macrophage apoptosis. Several pathogenic bacteria and protists also express glycolytic enzymes externally, suggesting that moonlighting functions of extracellular glycolytic enzymes can contribute broadly to pathogen virulence.© 2019 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627130>Phosphofructokinases Axis Controls Glucose-Dependent mTORC1 Activation Driven by E2F1.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells rely on mTORC1 activity to coordinate mitogenic signaling with nutrients availability for growth. Based on the metabolic function of E2F1, we hypothesize that glucose catabolism driven by E2F1 could participate on mTORC1 activation. Here, we demonstrate that glucose potentiates E2F1-induced mTORC1 activation by promoting mTORC1 translocation to lysosomes, a process that occurs independently of AMPK activation. We showed that E2F1 regulates glucose metabolism by increasing aerobic  and identified the PFKFB3 regulatory enzyme as an E2F1-regulated gene important for mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, PFKFB3 and PFK1 were found associated to lysosomes and we demonstrated that modulation of PFKFB3 activity, either by substrate accessibility or expression, regulates the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes by direct interaction with Rag  and subsequent mTORC1 activity. Our results support a model whereby a glycolytic metabolon containing phosphofructokinases transiently interacts with the lysosome acting as a sensor platform for glucose catabolism toward mTORC1 activity.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Among the enzymes mediating this plasticity through bidirectional conversion of pyruvate and lactate, the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and lactate dehydrogenase  (LDHB), are indicated. LDHA has a higher affinity for pyruvate, preferentially converting pyruvate to lactate, and NADH to NAD in anaerobic conditions, whereas LDHB possess a higher affinity for lactate, preferentially converting lactate to pyruvate, and NAD to NADH, when oxygen is abundant. Apart from the undisputed role of LDHA and LDHB in tumor cell metabolism and adaptation to unfavorable environmental or cellular conditions, these enzymes participate in the regulation of cell death. This review presents the latest progress made in this area on the roles of LDHA and LDHB in apoptosis and autophagy of tumor cells. Several examples of how LDHA and LDHB impact on these processes, as well as possible molecular mechanisms, will be discussed in this article. The information included in this review points to the legitimacy of modulating LDHA and/or LDHB to target tumor cells in the context of human and veterinary medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352837>Prolonged functional life span of artificial red cells in blood circulation by repeated methylene blue injections.</a></h2><p>Hemoglobin-vesicles (HbVs) are artificial oxygen carriers encapsulating purified and concentrated hemoglobin solution in phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) and their safety and efficacy as a transfusion alternative have been evaluated. Because of the absence of enzymatic methemoglobin reduction system in HbV, the level of ferric methemoglobin (metHb) increases gradually after intravenous administration. Our previous studies clarified that the glycolytic electron energies, charged as NAD(P)H in red blood cells (RBC), are donated to reduce metHb compartmentalized in HbV via a water-soluble electron mediator such as methylene blue [MB; 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazinium chloride], which freely shuttle across both RBC biomembrane and HbV lipid membrane. Herein, we tried to test repeated injections of MB after the massive HbV administration (28 mL/kg) to hemorrhagic shocked Wistar rats ( = 3). MB was injected (3.1 mg/kg) at 7, 24 and 48 h after HbV administration. Every MB injection showed rapid reduction of metHb and gradual reversal increase. As a result, the functional life span of HbV was significantly extended over 60 h. It is expected that further optimization of injection scheduling will decrease the total amount of MB and prolong the functional life span of HbV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705866>Sirtuins in  lymphocytes metabolism and function.</a></h2><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD-dependent histone deacetylases and play a role in virtually all cell biological processes. As SIRTs functions vary according to their subtypes, they can either activate or inhibit signaling pathways upon different conditions or tissues. Recent studies have focused on metabolic effects performed by SIRTs in several cell types since specific metabolic pathways (., aerobic , oxidative phosphorylation, β-oxidation, glutaminolysis) are used to determine the cell fate. However, few efforts have been made to understand the role of SIRTs on  lymphocytes metabolism and function. These cells are associated with humoral immune responses by secreting larger amounts of antibodies after differentiating into antibody-secreting cells. Besides, both the SIRTs and  lymphocytes are potential targets to treat several immune-mediated disorders, including cancer.

The aim of the current work was to understand the role of an isoform of RAS-like protein (RAL), RALBP1, in mediating squamous cell tumorigenesis. The study also aims to understand epigenetic modifications of RALBP1 mediated through microRNA-148a/-3p.Biopsies of tumor and healthy tissues from 25 patients with OSCC were collected and subjected to RNA and protein extraction to confirm upregulation of RLBP1 in tumor tissues. Expression of RLBP1 was silenced in SCC-9, using shRNA, and HN6 was transfected with plasmid bearing genes for RLBP1 over expression. Tumorigenic traits such as increased glucose uptake, aerobic , enhanced cellular survival, cell migration, and invasion were assessed. Probable, molecular machinery involved in the upregulation was also assessed using Western blots. Using Target Scan tool, the miRNAs targeting RLBP1 were identified. Rescue of phenotypes in presence of miRNAs were also evaluated.Over expression of RLBP1 was associated with increased glucose uptake and aerobic  mediated ATP synthesis. The cells divided at a faster rate with a higher rate of migration and invasion phenotype. miR-148a/-3p were found to target RLBP1 and rescued RLBP1 mediated phenotype.RLBP1 may mediate squamous cell tumorigenesis in oral cavity, independently of the RAS protein and through Akt. miR-148a/-3p functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting RLBP1.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TRAP-positive stained cells were counted, and osteoclastogenic marker genes expression were evaluated by qPCR. Osteoclasts resorption capacity was evaluated by the expression of specific enzymes and capacity to resorb a mineralized matrix.

The treatment of preosteoclasts with FBP attenuated osteoclast fusion and formation, without affecting cell viability. Moreover, the inhibition of several osteoclastogenic marker genes expression (TRAP, OSCAR, DC-STAMP, Integrin αv, NFATc1) by FBP correlates with a reduction of mineralized matrix resorption capacity.

Here we show that instantaneous physical stress in a homogeneous environment (without concentration gradient) induces fast adaptation of Escherichia coli. We exposed E. coli to a large number of collisions of around 10 per bacterium per second with sharp ZnO nanorods. The pressure exerted on the bacterial cell wall was up to 10 GPa and induced phenotype changes. The bacteria's shape became more spherical, the density of their periplasm increased by around 15% and the average thickness of the cell wall by 30%. Such E. coli cells appeared almost as Gram-positive bacteria in the standard Gram staining. Additionally, we observed a combination of changes occurring at the genomic level (mutations identified in form of single nucleotide polymorphisms) and down-regulation of expression of 61 genes encoding proteins involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, , the citric acid cycle, as well as uptake of amino acids and enzyme cofactors.

Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) experimental diets were designed, with 100% fish oil (FO), 50% fish oil and 50% soybean oil (FS) and 100% soybean oil (SO), respectively. After a 12-week growth trial, the results showed that compared with FO group, contents n-6 PUFAs increased while the n-3 PUFAs decreased significantly both in liver and muscle in FS and SO groups. Concentrations of blood glucose, leptin, free fatty acid and total triglyceride reached the highest values in SO group, while blood insulin showed no significant difference among all groups.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The  and gluconeogenesis pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection.

In WAT sites, the proportions and functions of NSC change under diverse physiological or pathologic conditions. We had previously observed the massive anaerobic wasting of glucose to lactate and glycerol in rat epididymal adipocytes. To test site variability, and whether the adipocyte extensive anaerobic metabolism of glucose was found in NSC, we analyzed, in parallel, subcutaneous, mesenteric and epididymal WAT of male adult Wistar rats. Adipocytes and NSC fractions, were isolated, counted and incubated (as well as red blood cells: RBC) with glucose, and their ability to use glucose and produce lactate, glycerol, and free fatty acids was measured. Results were computed taking into account the number of cells present in WAT samples. Cell numbers were found in proportions close to 1:13:100 (respectively, for adipocytes, NSC and RBC) but their volumes followed a reversed pattern: 7,500:10:1. When counting only non-fat cell volumes, the ratios changed dramatically to 100:10:1. RBC contribution to lactate production was practically insignificant. In most samples, NSC produced more lactate than adipocytes did, but only adipocytes secreted glycerol (and fatty acids in smaller amounts). Glucose consumption was also highest in NSC, especially in mesenteric WAT. The heterogeneous NSC showed a practically anaerobic metabolism (like that already observed in adipocytes). Thus, NSC quantitative production of lactate markedly contributed (i.e. more than adipocytes) to WAT global use (wasting) of glucose. We also confirmed that glucose-derived glycerol is exclusively produced by adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363904>Reprogramming of gene expression in Escherichia coli cultured on pyruvate versus glucose.</a></h2><p>Previous studies revealed important roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in regulation of bacterial metabolism, stress responses and virulence. However, only a minor fraction of sRNAs is well characterized with respect to the spectra of their targets, conditional expression profiles and actual mechanisms they use to regulate gene expression to control particular biological pathways. To learn more about the specific contribution of sRNAs to the global regulatory network controlling the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism (CCM), we employed microarray analysis and compared transcriptome profiles of E. coli cells grown on two alternative minimal media supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose, respectively. Microarray analysis revealed that utilization of these alternative carbon sources led to profound differences in gene expression affecting all major gene clusters associated with CCM as well as expression of several known (CyaR, RyhB, GcvB and RyeA) and putative (C0652) sRNAs. To assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression on E. coli protein abundance, we also employed two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. Our experimental data made it possible to determine the major pathways for pyruvate assimilation when it is used as a sole carbon source and reveal the impact of other key processes (i.e., energy production, molecular transport and cell resistance to stress) associated with the CCM in E. coli. Moreover, some of these processes were apparently controlled by GcvB, RyhB and CyaR at the post-transcriptional level, thus indicating the complexity and interconnection of the regulatory networks that control CCM in bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760861>Accumulation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate protects clear cell renal cell carcinoma from oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors and enhanced aerobic . In our previous study, metabolic profiling revealed a threefold increase of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) in ccRCC tissue compared with normal kidney tissue. As an important intermediate metabolite, its role in cancer development remains unknown. We found that high levels of FBP were required for cancer growth because of its ability to affect the redox status. Mechanistically, FBP regulated the redox status partially by suppressing NADPH oxidase isoform NOX4 activity in ccRCC cells. ccRCC maintained high levels of FBP through the downregulation of aldolase  (ALDOB). Reduction of FBP levels in cancer cells by the ectopic expression of ALDOB disrupted redox homeostasis, arrested cancer proliferation, and sensitized ccRCC cells to a chemotherapy agent (paclitaxel). Furthermore, low expression of ALDOB portended significantly worse disease-free survival and overall survival in ccRCC patients.

We measured levels and stability of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), endothelial PAS domain 1 protein (EPAS1, also called HIF2A), CA9, solute carrier family 16 member 4 (SLC16A4, also called MCT4), and SLC2A1 (also called GLUT1) by immunoblot analyses. We analyzed intracellular pH (pHi) and extracellular metabolic flux. We knocked down expression of CA9 in PDAC cells, or inhibited CA9 with SLC-0111, incubated them with gemcitabine, and assessed pHi, metabolic flux, and cytotoxicity under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Cells were also injected into either immune-compromised or immune-competent mice and growth of xenograft tumors was assessed. Tumor fragments derived from patients with PDAC were surgically ligated to the pancreas of mice and the growth of tumors was assessed. We performed tissue microarray analyses of 205 human PDAC samples to measure levels of CA9 and associated expression of genes that regulate hypoxia with outcomes of patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas database.Under hypoxic conditions, PDAC cells had increased levels of HIF1A and HIF2A, upregulated expression of CA9, and activated . Knockdown of KRAS in PDAC cells, or incubation with trametinib, reduced the posttranscriptional stabilization of HIF1A and HIF2A, upregulation of CA9, pHi, and  in response to hypoxia. CA9 was expressed by 66% of PDAC samples analyzed; high expression of genes associated with metabolic adaptation to hypoxia, including CA9, correlated with significantly reduced survival times of patients. Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of CA9 in PDAC cells significantly reduced pHi in cells under hypoxic conditions, decreased gemcitabine-induced , and increased their sensitivity to gemcitabine. PDAC cells with knockdown of CA9 formed smaller xenograft tumors in mice, and injection of gemcitabine inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased survival times of mice. In mice with xenograft tumors grown from human PDAC cells, oral administration of SLC-0111 and injection of gemcitabine increased intratumor acidosis and increased cell death. These tumors, and tumors grown from PDAC patient-derived tumor fragments, grew more slowly than xenograft tumors in mice given control agents, resulting in longer survival times. In Kras/Pdx1-Cre/Tp53/Rosa genetically modified mice, oral administration of SLC-0111 and injection of gemcitabine reduced numbers of  cells in tumors.In response to hypoxia, PDAC cells that express activated KRAS increase expression of CA9, via stabilization of HIF1A and HIF2A, to regulate pH and . Disruption of this pathway slows growth of PDAC xenograft tumors in mice and might be developed for treatment of pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pathogenic effects].</a></h2><p>Certain organoleptic modifications by way of processing and cooking foods at high temperatures in dry heat, make them especially appetizing and objects of addiction. It results from Maillard reaction, or glycation, consisting of the non-enzymatic union between carbonyl groups, mainly from reducing sugars as glucose and fructose, with the amino group of proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to physical changes, also the chemical structure and function of these compounds are changed. Besides exogenous glycation generated during the cooking of foods, recently in situ glycation has been reported in the intestinal lumen during digestion, when certain non-glycated foods are combined with fructose at the time of ingestion. In addition, endogenous glycation, which correlates in the extracellular mainly with blood glucose and in the intracellular with  metabolites and fructose, is specially significant. Since the 70s, with the frequent sucrose replacement by fructose, much more reactive than glucose, the presence of glycation products in processed foods and soft drinks increased.Pathogenic effects of these compounds, also called glycotoxins, are known to contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation. This increases progression of chronic diseases, well documented in diabetes, renal insuficiency, cardiovascular disease and aging process, and are being explore d in many other chronic diseases as neurodegenerative disorders and early aging. Based on the knowledge achieved so far, measures to preserve health are described by attending ways of cooking and processing foods, besides recommendations for life habits and antioxidants dietary intakes for inhibition or antagonism on glycotoxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560931>Glycolytic enzyme hexokinase II is a putative therapeutic target in -cell malignant lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Hexokinase II (HXKII) is a key regulator of glucose metabolism that converts glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. Furthermore, HXKII blocks mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c. HXKII overexpression is frequently observed in several types of cancer and confers chemoresistance to cancer cells. In the present study, we found that compared with cell lines generated from diffuse large--cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, cell lines with features of Burkitt lymphoma have higher levels of HXKII because of the activation of both c-MYC and HIF-1. Under normoxia, HXKII levels were correlated with the growth ability of each -cell lymphoma cell line. HXKII levels were further enhanced when the -cell lymphoma cells were cultured under hypoxia. The high levels of HXKII induced by hypoxia conferred cisplatin resistance in all tested -cell lymphoma cell lines. The HDAC inhibitor panobinostat significantly suppressed HXKII expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Importantly, panobinostat reversed the anti-lymphoma action of cisplatin, and this effect was diminished by hypoxia. These data suggest that HXKII plays different roles, including in the regulation of  and inhibition of apoptosis, depending on its expression levels. Furthermore, inhibition of HXKII expression by panobinostat may represent a new and attractive strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance.Copyright © 2019 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The disease is endemic within Latin America and prevalent in Brazil. The treatment is based on azoles, sulfonamides and amphotericin . The seeking for new treatment approaches is a real necessity for neglected infections. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an essential glycolytic enzyme, well known for its multitude of functions within cells, therefore categorized as a moonlight protein. To our knowledge, this is the first approach performed on the  genus regarding the description of PPIs having GAPDH as a target. Here, we show an overview of experimental GAPDH interactome in different phases of  and an  analysis of 18 proteins partners. GAPDH interacted with 207 proteins in . Several proteins bound to GAPDH in mycelium, transition and yeast phases are common to important pathways such as  and TCA. We performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to validate the complex formed by GAPDH with triose phosphate isomerase, enolase, isocitrate lyase and 2-methylcitrate synthase. We found GAPDH participating in complexes with proteins of specific pathways, indicating the existence of a glycolytic and a TCA metabolon in . GAPDH interacted with several proteins that undergoes regulation by nitrosylation. In addition, we modeled the GAPDH 3-D structure, performed molecular dynamics and molecular docking in order to identify the interacting interface between GAPDH and the interacting proteins. Despite the large number of interacting proteins, GAPDH has only four main regions of contact with interacting proteins, reflecting its ancestrality and conservation over evolution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989953>[Study on proteins in Guangdilong by nano LC/orbitrap fusion lumos HR-MS].</a></h2><p>In the present study,fresh Guangdilong( GD),originating from Pheretima aspergillum,was taken as the object.

Glycolytic enzymes enable the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  and allow resistance to anoikis of shed tumour cells. These enzymes also have moonlighting activities as protein kinases and transcription factors. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and pyruvate kinase are the only glycolytic enzymes generating ATP in the hexokinase pathway. Hypoxia, EGFR activation, expression of K-Ras G12V and -Raf V600E induce mitochondrial translocation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1). Mitochondrial PGK1 acts as a protein kinase to phosphorylate pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), reducing mitochondrial pyruvate utilization, suppressing reactive oxygen species production, increasing lactate production and promoting tumourigenesis. PGK1 also plays a role as a transcription factor once transported into the nucleus. Resistance to anoikis is also facilitated by metabolic support provided by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our series of experiments in-vitro and in the animal model showed that PGK1 knock-out or inhibition is effective in controlling development and growth of peritoneal metastasis (PM) of gastric origin, establishing a causal role of PGK1 in this development. PGK1 also increases CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression, which is associated with a metastatic phenotype and plays a role in the metastatic homing of malignant cells. Thus, PGK1, its modulators and target genes may be exploited as therapeutic targets for preventing development of PM and for enhancing cytotoxic effects of conventional systemic chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538285>By reducing global mRNA translation in several ways, 2-deoxyglucose lowers MCL-1 protein and sensitizes hemopoietic tumor cells to BH3 mimetic ABT737.</a></h2><p>Drugs targeting various pro-survival BCL-2 family members (''BH3 mimetics'') have efficacy in hemopoietic malignancies, but the non-targeted pro-survival family members can promote resistance. Pertinently, the sensitivity of some tumor cell lines to BH3 mimetic ABT737, which targets BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W but not MCL-1, is enhanced by 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). We found that 2DG augmented apoptosis induced by ABT737 in 3 of 8 human hemopoietic tumor cell lines, most strongly in pre- acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line NALM-6, the focus of our mechanistic studies. Although 2DG can lower MCL-1 translation, how it does so is incompletely understood, in part because 2DG inhibits both  and protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Its  inhibition lowered ATP and, through the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway, markedly reduced global protein synthesis, as did an ER integrated stress response. A dual reporter assay revealed that 2DG impeded not only cap-dependent translation but also elongation or cap-independent translation. MCL-1 protein fell markedly, whereas 12 other BCL-2 family members were unaffected. We ascribe the MCL-1 drop to the global fall in translation, exacerbated for mRNAs with a structured 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) containing potential regulatory motifs like those in MCL-1 mRNA and the short half-life of MCL-1 protein. Pertinently, 2DG downregulated two other short-lived oncoproteins, MYC and MDM2. Thus, our results support MCL-1 as a critical 2DG target, but also reveal multiple effects on global translation that may well also affect its promotion of apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075501>Hypoxia enhances blood O affinity and depresses skeletal muscle O consumption in zebrafish (Danio rerio).</a></h2><p>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used animal models. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in this species have remained poorly understood. In the present study, we have determined the effects of hypoxia on blood-O transport properties and mitochondrial respiration rate in permeabilized muscle fibres of adult zebrafish exposed to either 1) a gradual decrease in O levels until fish lost equilibrium (~1 h, acute hypoxia), or 2) severe hypoxia (PO ∼ 15 Torr) for 48 h (prolonged hypoxia). Acute, short-term hypoxia caused an increase in hemoglobin (Hb) O affinity (decrease in P), due to a decrease in erythrocyte ATP after erythrocyte swelling. No changes in isoHb expression patterns were observed between hypoxic and normoxic treatments. Prolonged hypoxia elicited additional reponses on O consumption: lactate accumulated in the blood, indicating that zebrafish relied on  for ATP production, and mitochondrial respiration of skeletal muscle was overall significantly inhibited. In addition, male zebrafish had higher hypoxia tolerance (measured as time to loss of equilibrium) than females. The present study contributes to our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms that allow zebrafish, and by inference other fish species, to cope with low O levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Proteomic analysis revealed a selective induction of the ribosomal proteins RSSA, an inhibitor of cell proliferation and inducer of differentiation, HSP 60, a protein folding chaperone and GRP78, an unfolding protein response signal. Additionally, we observed an induction of EF1D, a transcription factor for genes that contain heat-shock responsive elements. Conversely, RAD23, a protein involved in regulating ER-associated protein degradation was down-regulated. All these modifications indicated an ER stress response, which in turn activated the unfolded protein response signaling pathway through ATF4, as confirmed both by the modulation of amino acids metabolism genes, such as XBP1, PDI and GPR78, and by the metabolomic analysis. Finally, we detected a reduction of PDI protein, as confirmed by the increase of oxidized glutathione. Metabolome analysis indicated that  failed to fuel the Krebs cycle, which continued to decrease during differentiation, at glance with the PPP pathway, allowing NADH production and glutathione reduction.

We determined the ICT-GEP of Follicular Lymphoma (FL), and compared it with that of the more aggressive Diffuse Large  Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). cDNA microarray data were collected both from patients enrolled for this study, and from public datasets. In FL the ICT-GEP indicated the overexpression of both the K channel encoding gene KCNN4, and SLC2A1, which encodes the Glut1 glucose transporter. SLC2A1 turned out to represent the hub of a functional network, connecting channels and transporters in FL. Relapsed FL patients were characterised by 38 differentially expressed ICT genes, among which ATP9A, SLC2A1 and KCNN4 were under-expressed, indicating a down-regulation of both excitability and . A completely different profile of K channel encoding genes emerged in DLBCL accompanied by the over-expression of the fatty acid transporter-encoding gene SLC27A1 as well as of the metabolism regulator NCoR1. This indicates a change in excitability and a shift towards an oxidative metabolism in DLBCL.

Aldolase  (ALDOB) is well known for its role in metabolism and . The expression of ALDOB in colon adenocarcinoma and the relationship between its expression and colon adenocarcinoma prognosis remain controversial; in addition, the potential role of ALDOB in DNA MMR has not yet been reported. In this study, we identified a cluster of DNA repair-related proteins that interact with ALDOB in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT116. Expression analysis of colon adenocarcinoma data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COAD data, n = 551) indicated that ALDOB mRNA expression was significantly higher in specimens with microsatellite instability (MSI) than in specimens with microsatellite stability (MSS). Regarding prognosis, colon adenocarcinoma patients with high ALDOB mRNA expression had longer overall survival (OS). Higher expression of ALDOB protein was significantly correlated with MMR deficiency (d-MMR) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient specimens. The expression of ALDOB was significantly elevated in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Further evidence indicated that rather than affecting proliferation, ALDOB overexpression induced the functional loss of MMR proteins and in turn caused irreversible DNA damage via disrupting EZH2-Rad51 expression and then caused apoptosis by ERK inactivation. Overall, our study demonstrates that high ALDOB expression impairs DNA MMR and induces apoptosis in colon adenocarcinoma. ALDOB may be a new biomarker associated with d-MMR and an independent prognostic factor for colon adenocarcinoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) during diet-induced obesity in mice. miR-146a is reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic patients and our results reveal that miR-146a-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have exaggerated weight gain, increased adiposity, hepatosteatosis, and dysregulated blood glucose levels compared to wild-type controls. Pro-inflammatory genes and NF-κ activation increase in miR-146a-/- mice, indicating a role for this miRNA in regulating inflammatory pathways. RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue macrophages demonstrated a role for miR-146a in regulating both inflammation and cellular metabolism, including the mTOR pathway, during obesity.

In this study, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), bone marrow differentiation factor 88 (MYD88), and phosphorylated nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) was consistent with fluctuations in insulin in fasted cold-exposed mice. We also found up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) in acute cold exposure with a decrease in core body temperature. RBM3 transcription and translation were activated 2 h after cold exposure. The anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2/Bax ratio also increased, while expression of apoptosis factors: cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) was unchanged. Liver glycogen was depleted after 2 h of cold exposure, and blood glucose decreased after 4 h. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation continued to increase to promote hepatic glycogen synthesis. We found a high level of protein kinase  (AKT) phosphorylation after 6 h of cold exposure. In addition, we demonstrated that after cold exposure for 2 h, in the liver, continued phosphorylation of fructose-2,6-diphosphate (PFKFB2) and decreased accumulation of glycogen intermediates fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) and pyruvic acid (PA). In summary, the liver responds to cold exposure through a number of different pathways, including activation of HSP70/TLR4 signaling pathways, up-regulation of RBM3 expression, and increased  and glycogen synthesis. We propose a possible signaling pathway in which regulation of RBM3 expression by the liver affects the AKT metabolic signaling pathway.

Because of the paucity of studies regarding the effects of MDSCs in general on  cells, we focused on these understudied  cell targets for M-MDSC effects on  cell phenotypic and functional parameters. M-MDSCs specifically decreased the proliferation of transitional type 2 (T2)  cells in response to polyclonal stimulation but increased germinal center and Ab-secreting  cell proportions and class-switched Ig production. Additionally, M-MDSCs inhibited the expression of CD40 and MHC class II on stimulated  cells and suppressed Ag presentation to Ag-specific CD4 T cells. These alterations of the  cell compartment coincided with decreases in aerobic , mitochondrial respiration, and glucose consumption; the latter specifically decreased in the T2 subset. To compare  cell targets of ex vivo M-MDSC suppression with the status of  cells during the course of LP-BM5-induced pathogenesis, including immunodeficiency in vivo,  cells from LP-BM5-infected mice were collected and analyzed. LP-BM5 infection resulted in several analogous alterations of  cells, as were observed with retrovirally expanded M-MDSC suppression in vitro, including decreased proliferation of T2  cells, an increased proportion of germinal center and Ab-secreting  cells, increased production of class-switched Abs, decreased expression of CD40, and decreased metabolic activity upon stimulation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042421>MicroRNA-140 inhibits skeletal muscle  and atrophy in endotoxin-induced sepsis in mice via the WNT signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulting from infection. This study aimed at exploring the role of microRNA-140 (miR-140) in septic mice. Wnt family member 11 (WNT11) was verified to be a target gene of miR-140 after bioinformatic prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Importantly, miR-140 negatively regulated WNT11. We initially induced the model of sepsis by endotoxin, and then ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were performed to explore the functional role of miR-140 in sepsis. Additionally, cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber, lactic acid production, 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and tyrosine (Tyr) production in extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscles, and serum levels of inflammatory factors were examined. The effect of miR-140 on the expression of WNT signaling pathway-related and apoptosis-related factors in skeletal muscle tissue was determined. The experimental results indicated that upregulated miR-140 or silenced WNT11 increased cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber while decreasing lactic acid production, skeletal muscle cell apoptosis [corresponding to downregulated  cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3 and upregulated Bcl-2], and the proteolytic rate of Tyr and 3-MH. Also, overexpressed miR-140 or silenced WNT11 reduced inflammation as reflected by decreased serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-140 was shown to suppress the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, accompanied by decreased expression of WNT11, β-catenin, and GSK-3β.

These organs were selected due to their close relationship with calcium signaling and metabolism (e.g., , oxidative phosphorylation, muscle contraction). Differential expression between smolt and parr specimens and between organs was observed.

In addition to ketoacidosis that is frequently associated with diabetes, other important and more complex factors are involved in this delicate feedback mechanism. Among these, in this review we discussed the acid-mediated inhibiting effects on insulin binding affinity to its receptor, on , on the recycling of glucose transporters, and on insulin secretion via transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) activity by pancreatic β-cells. Finally, we revised current data available on the mutual interaction between insulin signaling and the activity of ion/proton transporters and pH sensors, and on how acidosis may enhance insulin resistance through the Nuclear Factor kappa  (NF-κ) inflammatory pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639654>Inhibitory effects of arylcoumarin derivatives on Bacteroides fragilisd‑lactate dehydrogenase.</a></h2><p>Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic bacterium naturally hosted in the human colon flora. . fragilisd‑lactate dehydrogenase (Bfd‑LDH) is an important enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of d‑lactate to pyruvate and regulates anaerobic . In this study Bfd‑LDH has been targeted for structure based drug design. . fragilisd‑lactate dehydrogenase has been expressed, purified and inhibitory activities of 25 coumarin derivatives previously synthetize for their antioxidant activity were evaluated.

The results indicate that the mechanism by which 6a, 5l and 6b coumarin derivatives inhibit Bfd‑LDH by reversible non-competitive inhibition. Docking experiments were carried out to further explain the results and compare the theoretical and experimental affinity of these compounds to the Bfd‑LDH protein. According to docking results, all coumarins bind to the site occupied by pyruvate and the nicotinamide ring of NADH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Because neuroimmune signaling is altered by alcohol, immune cells are a logical, accessible choice to study and may provide biomarkers. RNAseq was used to study the effects of 48-h exposure to ethanol on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 alcoholic subjects and 20 control subjects. Ethanol exposure resulted in differential expression of 4456 of the 12,503 genes detectably expressed in the LCLs (FDR [false discovery rate] ≤ 0.05); 52% of these showed increased expression. Cells from alcoholic subjects and control subjects responded similarly. The genes whose expression changed fell into many pathways: NFκ, neuroinflammation, IL6, IL2, IL8, and dendritic cell maturation pathways were activated, consistent with increased signaling by NFκ, TNF, IL1, IL4, IL18, TLR4, and LPS. Signaling by Interferons A and  decreased, as did EIF2 signaling, phospholipase C signaling, and . Baseline gene expression patterns were similar in LCLs from alcoholic subjects and control subjects. At relaxed stringency (p < 0.05), 465 genes differed, 230 of which were also affected by ethanol. There was a suggestion of compensation because baseline differences (no ethanol) were in the opposite direction of differences due to ethanol exposure in 78% of these genes. Pathways with IL8, phospholipase C, and α-adrenergic signaling were significant. The pattern of expression was consistent with increased signaling by several cytokines, including interferons, TLR2, and TLR3 in alcoholics. Expression of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR, was lower in alcoholic subjects. LCLs show many effects of ethanol exposure, some of which might provide biomarkers for alcohol use disorders. Identifying genes and pathways altered by ethanol can aid in interpreting which genes within loci identified by GWAS might play functional roles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether surveillance imaging predicts survival after AHCT.At the University of Minnesota, serial imaging for early relapse detection has been used prospectively for all consecutive AHCT recipients treated since 2010. This analysis included 91 AHCT recipients with DLBCL who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET at day +100 post-AHCT. (18)F-FDG-PET parameters included the Deauville (D) five-point scale, peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax), total legion  (TLG) and total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV). Survival of patients with clinically symptomatic versus asymptomatic radiographically detected relapsed DLBCL after AHCT was compared.Sixty patients experienced relapse; 35% was detected on day +100 surveillance PET scan. 5-year overall survival (OS) by (18)F-FDG-PET scan at day +100 post-AHCT was significantly lower in D4 and D5 patients (37%, 95% CI=14-100 and 25%, 95%CI=43-89) as compared to patients with D1 and D2 (62%, 95% CI=43-89 and 62%, 95% CI=46-84). TLG and TMTV were not prognostic. SUVmax at day +100 varied 1.5 (D1) to 17.9 (D5). In multivariate analysis, only SUVmax was predictive of relapse and OS; mortality increased 1.8-fold with each SUVmax doubling (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3; p<0.01). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range 1-12 years), lymphoma-related mortality was 1.8-fold higher among patients whose relapse was detected clinically (symptomatic) versus radiographically on surveillance scan (HR 1.8 [95% CI 0.9 to 3.4]; p=0.08).In patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, a routine PET imaging at day +100 post-AHCT detects asymptomatic relapse and high SUVmax identifies patients with poor expected survival of less than 1 year. Identifying this high-risk cohort can potentially highlight patients that might benefit from preemptive interventions to prevent or delay relapse.Copyright © 2019.

However, the role of T cell autophagy in regulating antitumor immune responses is less clear. In a recent study, we showed that deletion of the essential autophagy genes , or  in host tissues dramatically impairs growth of autophagy-competent syngeneic tumors. We further demonstrated that CD8 T cells lacking  acquire an effector memory phenotype and produce more IFNG/IFN-γ (interferon gamma) and TNF/TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor). These phenotypic changes are accompanied by enhanced glucose metabolism that results in alterations in histone methylation, and upregulation of glycolytic and immune response genes. In accordance with this, we observed control of tumor growth in autophagy-competent mice after adoptive transfer with a sub-therapeutic dose of  T cells. Collectively, we discovered a unique, cell-autonomous role for T cell autophagy in the metabolic control of antitumor immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086659>Characterization of the molecular changes associated with the overexpression of a novel epithelial cadherin splice variant mRNA in a breast cancer model using proteomics and bioinformatics approaches: identification of changes in cell metabolism and an increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase .</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Alterations in epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) expression and functions are associated to BC, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We have previously reported a novel human E-cadherin splice variant (E-cadherin variant) mRNA. Stable transfectants in MCF-7 human BC cells (MCF7Ecadvar) depicted fibroblast-like cell morphology, E-cadherin wild-type downregulation, and other molecular changes characteristic of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, reduced cell-cell adhesion, and increased cell migration and invasion. In this study, a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) protein identification and bioinformatics analyses were done to characterize biological processes and canonical pathways affected by E-cadherin variant expression.By 2D-DIGE and MS analysis, 50 proteins were found differentially expressed (≥ Δ1.5) in MCF7Ecadvar compared to control cells. Validation of transcript expression was done in the ten most overexpressed and underexpressed proteins. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that 39 of the 50 proteins identified had been previously associated to BC. Moreover, metabolic processes were the most affected, and  the canonical pathway most altered. The lactate dehydrogenase  (LDHB) was the highest overexpressed protein, and transcript levels were higher in MCF7Ecadvar than in control cells. In agreement with these findings, MCF7Ecadvar conditioned media had lower glucose and higher lactate levels than control cells. MCF7Ecadvar cell treatment with 5 mM of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-glucose led to decreased cell viability, and modulation of LDHB expression in MCF7Ecadvar cells with a specific small interfering RNA resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Finally, a positive association between expression levels of the E-cadherin variant and LDHB transcripts was demonstrated in 21 human breast tumor tissues, and breast tumor samples with higher Ki67 expression showed higher LDHB mRNA levels.Results from this investigation contributed to further characterize molecular changes associated to the novel E-cadherin splice variant expression in BC cells. They also revealed an association between expression of the novel variant and changes related to BC progression and aggressiveness, in particular those associated to cell metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071366>Glycolytic activation of peritumoral monocytes fosters immune privilege via the PFKFB3-PD-L1 axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on antigen-presenting cells is essential for T cell impairment, and PD-L1-expressing macrophages may mechanistically shape and therapeutically predict the clinical efficacy of PD-L1 or programmed cell death 1 blockade. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying PD-L1 upregulation in human tumor microenvironments, which remain poorly understood despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors.Monocytes/macrophages were purified from peripheral blood, non-tumor, or paired tumor tissues of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and their possible glycolytic switch was evaluated. The underlying regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance of metabolic switching were studied with both ex vivo analyses and in vitro experiments.We found that monocytes significantly enhanced the levels of  at the peritumoral region of human HCC. The activation of  induced PD-L1 expression on these cells and subsequently attenuated cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in tumor tissues. Mechanistically, tumor-derived soluble factors, including hyaluronan fragments, induced the upregulation of a key glycolytic enzyme, PFKFB3, in tumor-associated monocytes. This enzyme not only modulated the cellular metabolic switch but also mediated the increased expression of PD-L1 by activating the nuclear factor kappa  signaling pathway in these cells. Consistently, the levels of PFKFB3CD68 cell infiltration in peritumoral tissues were negatively correlated with overall survival and could serve as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with HCC.Our results reveal a mechanism by which the cellular metabolic switch regulates the pro-tumor functions of monocytes in a specific human tumor microenvironment. PFKFB3 in both cancer cells and tumor-associated monocytes is a potential therapeutic target in human HCC.Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on antigen-presenting cells, rather than tumor cells, has been reported to play an essential role in checkpoint blockade therapy. A fundamental understanding of mechanisms that regulate the expression of PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages will undoubtedly lead to the possibility of developing novel PD-L1 blockade strategies with high specificity and efficiency. The current study unveils a novel mechanism by which metabolic switching links immune activation responses to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu, identifying potential targets for future immune-based anti-cancer therapies.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Aldolase C (ALDOC), which belongs to the aldolase family, is found in normal brain tissue and is responsible for the repair of injured tissue. However, the role of ALDOC in glioblastoma remains unclear. In this study, we data-mined in silico databases to evaluate aldolase family members' mRNA expression in glioblastoma patient cohorts for determining its prognostic values. After that, we also performed immunohistochemical stain (IHC) analysis to evaluate protein expression levels of ALDOC in glioblastoma tissues. From The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analyses, higher mRNA expression levels in normal brain tissue compared to glioblastoma was observed. In addition, compared to low-grade glioma, ALDOC expression was significantly downregulated in high-grade glioblastoma. Besides, the expression level of ALDOC was associated with molecular subtypes of glioblastomas and recurrent status in several data sets. In contrast, aldolase A (ALDOA) and aldolase  (ALDOB) revealed no significant prognostic impacts in the glioblastoma cohorts. Furthermore, we also proved that ALDOC mRNA and protein expression inversely correlated with non-mutated IDH1 expressions in glioblastoma patient cohorts. Additionally, the concordance of low ALDOC and high non-mutated IDH1 expressions predicted a stronger poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients compared to each of above tests presented alone. The plausible ALDOC and IDH1 regulatory mechanism was further elucidated. Our results support high ALDOC expression in glioblastomas that might imply the mutated status of IDH1, less possibility of mesenchymal subtype, and predict a favorable prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281575>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Knockdown Plus Glutamine Supplementation Attenuates the Predominance of Necrosis over Apoptosis by Relieving Cellular Energy Stress in Acute Pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effect and potential mechanism of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) genetic inhibition plus glutamine (Gln) supplementation on necrosis-apoptosis imbalance during acute pancreatitis (AP), with a specific focus on the regulations of intracellular energy metabolism status. Wistar rats and AR42J cells were used to establish AP models. When indicated, a HIF-1 knockdown with or without a Gln supplementation was administered. , local and systemic inflammatory injuries were assessed by serum cytokine measurement, H&E staining, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation of pancreatic tissue. , intracellular energy metabolism status was evaluated by measuring the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactic acid, and Ca concentrations and the mitochondrial potential. In addition, changes in the apoptotic activity were analyzed using TUNEL staining  and an apoptosis assay  HIF-1 knockdown alleviated AP-related inflammatory injury as indicated by the measurements of serum cytokines and examinations of TEM and H&E staining of pancreatic tissues. HIF-1 knockdown played an antioxidative role against AP-related injuries by preventing the increase in the intracellular Ca concentration and the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently by suppressing the  pathway and increasing energy anabolism in AR42J cells after AP induction. Apoptosis was significantly upregulated when HIF-1 was knocked down before AP induction due to an attenuation of the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa  to the nuclei. Furthermore, these merits of HIF-1 knockdown in the relief of the metabolic stress and upregulation of apoptosis were more significant when Gln was administered concomitantly. In conclusion, Gln-supplemented HIF-1 knockdown might be promising for the future management of AP by relieving the intracellular energy stress, thereby attenuating the predominance of necrosis over apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920655>High metabolic rate and stem cell characteristics of esophageal cancer stem-like cells depend on the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway.</a></h2><p>Tumor progression with chemoresistance and local recurrence is commonly happened during treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Cancer stem cells (CSC) may respond for tumor progression. However, there are few reports regarding metabolism of esophageal CSCs with clinical correlation. In this work, we demonstrated that ESCC cell lines in spheroid culture display CSC phenotypes, including increased ALDH activity, chemoresistance and tumor initiation, which are dependent on Hsp27 activation. Esophageal CSCs also exhibit reprogrammed metabolic features particularly higher  and oxidative phosphorylation, which are regulated via the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway. Moreover, HK2 is required for maintenance of CSC phenotypes. Inhibition of CSC metabolism reduces cell growth and tumor formation. Clinically, patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal cancer, and displayed overexpression of both Hsp27 and HK2, had the worst prognosis of all expression types. In conclusion, stem cells features and aberrant metabolic reprogramming of esophageal CSCs depend on the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway. Targeting Hsp27 and HK2 could be novel therapeutic strategy for treating esophageal cancer and warrants further investigation.© 2019 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566836>Estrogen-related receptor participates in regulating  and influences embryonic development in silkworm Bombyx mori.</a></h2><p>Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) play indispensable roles in development, energy metabolism, and cancers and are metabolic switches in Drosophila. However, the mechanism underlying their metabolic role is unknown in insects. This study analysed the expression profiles of Bombyx mori ERR (BmERR), hexokinase (BmHK), pyruvate kinase (BmPK) and phosphofructokinase (BmPFK) during embryonic development. The expression of BmERR tended to be similar to that of the other genes. We observed a regulatory association between BmERR and glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes by BmERR overexpression, RNA interference (RNAi), and ERR inhibitors in . mori embryo cells. Subsequently, ERR cis-regulation elements (ERREs) were predicted and identified in the BmPFK promoter. Transfection assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that BmERR can bind to one of these elements to regulate the expression of BmPFK. ERREs were also predicted in the BmHK and BmPK promoters. In the eggs, the expression of glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme genes was suppressed when the expression of BmERR was interference by double-stranded BmERR, the glucose levels also was increased. Meanwhile, the development of silkworm embryos was delayed by about 1 day. These results indicate that BmERR can bind to the ERREs of glycolytic gene promoters and regulate the expression of glycolytic genes, ultimately affecting embryonic development in silkworms.© 2019 The Royal Entomological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555797>Reversal of the Warburg phenomenon in chemoprevention of prostate cancer by sulforaphane.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of metabolic re-programming represents an attractive approach for prevention of prostate cancer. Studies have implicated increased synthesis of fatty acids or  in pathogenesis of human prostate cancers. We have shown previously that prostate cancer prevention by sulforaphane (SFN) in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model is associated with inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. This study utilized human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3), two different transgenic mouse models (TRAMP and Hi-Myc), and plasma specimens from a clinical study to explore the  inhibition potential of SFN. We found that SFN treatment: (a) decreased real-time extracellular acidification rate in LNCaP, but not in PC-3 cell line ; () significantly downregulated expression of hexokinase II (HKII), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and/or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro in cells and in vivo in neoplastic lesions in the prostate of TRAMP and Hi-Myc mice; and (c) significantly suppressed  in prostate of Hi-Myc mice as measured by ex vivo1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SFN treatment did not decrease glucose uptake or expression of glucose transporters in cells. Overexpression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred protection against SFN-mediated downregulation of HKII and LDHA protein expression and suppression of lactate levels. Examination of plasma lactate levels in prostate cancer patients following administration of a SFN-rich broccoli sprout extract failed to show declines in its levels. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether SFN treatment can decrease lactate production in human prostate tumors.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Betulinic acid (BA) is a natural pentacyclic terpene that has been reported to be active in inhibiting various malignancies. Here, we showed that BA could inhibit aerobic  activity in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 by hampering lactate production, glucose uptake and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as well as suppressing aerobic -related proteins including c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and p-PDK1/PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1). Mechanistic studies validated Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as one of key targets of BA in suppressing aerobic , as BA administration resulted in Cav-1 upregulation, whereas silencing Cav-1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of BA on aerobic .

The metabolic transition from aerobic  to oxidative phosphorylation has been regarded as a hallmark of neuronal differentiation. Understanding what triggers metabolism reprogramming and how glucose metabolism directs NSC differentiation may provide new insight into the regenerative potential of the brain. TP53 inducible  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of  and is highly expressed in mature neurons. However, its function in embryonic NSCs has not yet been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the precise roles of TIGAR in NSCs and the possible involvement of metabolic reprogramming in the TIGAR regulatory network. We observed that TIGAR is significantly increased during brain development as neural differentiation proceeds, especially at the peak of NSC differentiation (E14.5-E16.5). In cultured NSCs, knockdown of TIGAR reduced the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ngn1, and NeuroD1, and enhanced the expression of REST, suggesting that TIGAR is an important regulator of NSC differentiation. Furthermore, TIGAR enhanced the expression of lactate dehydrogenase  (LDHB) and the mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) markers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor (NRF1), and MitoNEET during NSC differentiation. TIGAR can decrease lactate production and accelerate oxygen consumption and ATP generation to maintain a high rate of OXPHOS in differentiated NSCs. Interestingly, knockdown of TIGAR decreased the level of acetyl-CoA and H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of Ngn1, Neurod1, and Gfap. Acetate, a precursor of acetyl-CoA, increased the level of H3K9 acetylation and rescued the effect of TIGAR deficiency on NSC differentiation. Together, our data demonstrated that TIGAR promotes metabolic reprogramming and regulates NSC differentiation through an epigenetic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307539>Molecular and metabolic pathways mediating curative treatment of a non-Hodgkin  cell lymphoma by Sindbis viral vectors and anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody.</a></h2><p>Limitations to current therapies for treating non-Hodgkin  cell lymphoma include relapse, toxicity and high cost. Thus, there remains a need for novel therapies. Oncolytic viral (OV) therapy has become a promising cancer immunotherapy because of its potential effectiveness, specificity and long-lasting immunity. We describe and characterize a novel cancer immunotherapy combining Sindbis virus (SV) vectors and the agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the T cell costimulatory receptor, 4-1BB (CD137).A20 lymphoma was transfected with luciferase and tumor cells were inoculated to BALB/c mice. Tumor growth was monitored by IVIS imaging. Tumor bearing mice were treated with Sindbis virus, α4-1BB Ab or SV plus α4-1BB Ab. On day 7 after treatment, splenocytes were harvested and surface markers, cytokines, and transcription factors were measured by flow cytometry or Elispot. Splenic T cells were isolated and RNA transcriptome analysis was performed. Tumor cured mice were rechallenged with tumor for testing immunological memory.SV vectors in combination with α4-1BB monoclonal antibody (mAb) completely eradicated a -cell lymphoma in a preclinical mouse model, a result that could not be achieved with either treatment alone. Tumor elimination involves a synergistic effect of the combination that significantly boosts T cell cytotoxicity, IFNγ production, T cell proliferation, migration, and . In addition, all mice that survived after treatment developed long lasting antitumor immunity, as shown by the rejection of A20 tumor rechallenge. We identified the molecular pathways, including upregulated cytokines, chemokines and metabolic pathways in T cells that are triggered by the combined therapy and help to achieve a highly effective anti-tumor response.Our study provides a novel, alternative method for  cell lymphoma treatment and describes a rationale to help translate SV vectors plus agonistic mAb into clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691320>Myricetin nanoliposomes induced SIRT3-mediated glycolytic metabolism leading to glioblastoma cell death.</a></h2><p>As the most aggressive and malignant glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) abnormally expresses genes that mediate glycolytic metabolism and tumour cell growth.

BOLA3 (BolA Family Member 3) regulates Fe-S biogenesis, and mutations in BOLA3 result in multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome, a fatal disorder associated with PH. The mechanistic role of BOLA3 in PH remains undefined.In vitro assessment of BOLA3 regulation and gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells using siRNA and lentiviral vectors expressing the mitochondrial isoform of BOLA3. Polymeric nanoparticle 7C1 was used for lung endothelium-specific delivery of BOLA3 siRNA oligonucleotides in mice. Overexpression of pulmonary vascular BOLA3 was performed by orotracheal transgene delivery of adeno-associated virus in mouse models of PH.In cultured hypoxic pulmonary artery endothelial cells, lung from human patients with Group 1 and 3 PH, and multiple rodent models of PH, endothelial BOLA3 expression was downregulated, which involved hypoxia inducible factor-2α-dependent transcriptional repression via histone deacetylase 1-mediated histone deacetylation. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that BOLA3 regulated Fe-S integrity, thus modulating lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases with consequent control over  and mitochondrial respiration. In contexts of siRNA knockdown and naturally occurring human genetic mutation, cellular BOLA3 deficiency downregulated the glycine cleavage system protein H, thus bolstering intracellular glycine content. In the setting of these alterations of oxidative metabolism and glycine levels, BOLA3 deficiency increased endothelial proliferation, survival, and vasoconstriction while decreasing angiogenic potential. In vivo, pharmacological knockdown of endothelial BOLA3 and targeted overexpression of BOLA3 in mice demonstrated that BOLA3 deficiency promotes histological and hemodynamic manifestations of PH. Notably, the therapeutic effects of BOLA3 expression were reversed by exogenous glycine supplementation.BOLA3 acts as a crucial lynchpin connecting Fe-S-dependent oxidative respiration and glycine homeostasis with endothelial metabolic reprogramming critical to PH pathogenesis. These results provide a molecular explanation for the clinical associations linking PH with hyperglycinemic syndromes and mitochondrial disorders. These findings also identify novel metabolic targets, including those involved in epigenetics, Fe-S biogenesis, and glycine biology, for diagnostic and therapeutic development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287846>Metabolic requirements of human pro-inflammatory  cells in aging and obesity.</a></h2><p>The subset of pro-inflammatory  cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN  cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with obesity. Results show that DN  cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic requirements, DN  cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic  to support their function. DN  cells from the SAT have the highest metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic  and fatty acid oxidation. DN  cells from the SAT also show the highest levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK (5'-AMP activated kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic advantage drives DN  cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune antibodies).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214790>F-FDG PET metabolic-to-morphological volume ratio predicts PD-L1 tumour expression and response to PD-1 blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity and is an emerging therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the correlation between F-FDG PET/CT-based markers and tumour tissue expression of PD-L1, necrosis and clinical outcome in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor treatment.PD-Li expression in biopsy or resection specimens from 49 patients with confirmed NSCLC was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG) were obtained from F-FDG PET/CT images. The ratio of metabolic to morphological lesion volumes (MMVR) and its association with PD-L1 expression in each lesion were calculated. The associations between histologically reported necrosis and F-FDG PET imaging patterns and radiological outcome (evaluated by iRECIST) following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy were also analysed. In 14 patients, the association between necrosis and MMVR and tumour immune contexture were analysed by multiple immunofluorescent (IF) staining for CD8, PD-1, granzyme  (GrzB) and NFATC2.In total, 25 adenocarcinomas and 24 squamous cell carcinomas were analysed. All tumours showed metabolic F-FDG PET uptake. MMVR was correlated inversely with PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression and low MMVR were significantly correlated with clinical benefit. Necrosis was correlated negatively with MMVR. Multiplex IF staining showed a greater frequency of activated CD8 cells in necrotic tumours than in nonnecrotic tumours in both stromal and epithelial tumour compartments.This study introduces MMVR as a new imaging biomarker and its ability to noninvasively capture increased PD-L1 tumour expression and predict clinical benefit from checkpoint blockade in NSCLC should be further evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694700>Genomic comparison of facultatively anaerobic and obligatory aerobic  strains GB1 and Tf helps explain physiological differences.</a></h2><p> strains GB1 and Tf display distinct phenotypes.  GB1 is capable of anaerobic growth and can synthesize ethanol while  Tf cannot. Comparison of the GB1 and Tf genome sequences revealed that the genomes were highly similar in gene content and showed a high level of synteny. At the genome scale, there were several large sections of DNA that appeared to be from lateral gene transfer into the GB1 genome. Tf did have unique genetic content but at a much smaller scale: 300 genes in Tf verses 857 genes in GB1 that matched at ≤90% sequence similarity. Gene complement and copy number of genes for the , tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain pathways were identical in both strains. While Tf is an obligate aerobe, it possesses the gene complement for an anaerobic lifestyle (, , , , ). As a species, other strains of  should be expected to have the potential for anaerobic growth. Assaying the whole cell lysate for alcohol dehydrogenase activity revealed an approximately 2-fold increase in the enzymatic activity in GB1 when compared with Tf.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800223>Repurposing old carbon monoxide-releasing molecules towards the anti-angiogenic therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of expression of the oestrogen and progesterone receptors and HER-2. Recently, carbon monoxide (CO) was found to behave as an important endogenous signalling molecule and to suppress VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and protein kinase  phosphorylation. Given that anti-angiogenic drugs exist as one of the few available targeted therapies against TNBC, the aim of this project was to study the effects of CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) on TNBC cell lines and the associated endothelial cells and characterise their anti-angiogenic properties that can be used for the reduction of cancer-driven angiogenesis. Four commercially available CORMs were screened for their cytotoxicity, their effects on cell metabolism, migration, VEGF expression, tube formation and VEGFR-2 activation. The most important result was the reduction in VEGF levels expressed by CORM-treated TNBC cells, along with the inhibition of phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and downstream proteins. The migration and tube formation ability of endothelial cells was also decreased by CORMs, justifying a potential re-purposing of old CORMs towards the anti-angiogenic therapy of TNBC. The additional favourable low cytotoxicity, reduction in the  levels and downregulation of haem oxygenase-1 in TNBC cells enhance the potential of CORMs against TNBC. In this study, CORM-2 remained the most effective CORM and we propose that CORM-2 may be pursued further as an additional agent in combination with existing anti-angiogenic therapies for a more successful targeting of malignant angiogenesis in TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607627>Tumor pH and metastasis: a malignant process beyond hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Tumors often show, compared to normal tissues, a markedly decreased extracellular pH resulting from anaerobic or aerobic  in combination with a reduced removal of acidic metabolites. Several studies indicate that acidosis induces (independently from hypoxia) hematogenous and lymphatic spread of tumor cells worsening the long-term prognosis of tumor patients. This review gives an overview on the impact of low pH on different steps of metastasis including (a) local tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis, () intravasation of tumor cells and detachment into the circulation, and (c) adherence of circulating tumor cells, transmigration and invasion in the new host tissue. The review describes pH-dependent cellular mechanisms fostering these steps such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activation of cell migration, degradation of the extracellular matrix, or angiogenesis. The review discusses mechanisms of tumor cells for proton sensing including acid-sensitive ion channels (ASICs, TRPs) or ion transporters (NHE1) and G protein coupled H-sensors. Finally, the review describes several intracellular signaling cascades activated by H sensing mechanisms leading to transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or functional changes in the cell relevant for the metastatic spread. From these studies, different therapeutical approaches are described to overcome tumor acidosis or to interfere with the signaling cascades to reduce the metastatic potential of tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454887>Tumor Metabolism as a Regulator of Tumor-Host Interactions in the -Cell Lymphoma Microenvironment-Fueling Progression and Novel Brakes for Therapy.</a></h2><p>Tumor metabolism and its specific alterations have become an integral part of understanding functional alterations leading to malignant transformation and maintaining cancer progression. Here, we review the metabolic changes in -cell neoplasia, focusing on the effects of tumor metabolism on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Particularly, innate and adaptive immune responses are regulated by metabolites in the TME such as lactate. With steadily increasing therapeutic options implicating or utilizing the TME, it has become essential to address the metabolic alterations in -cell malignancy for therapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss metabolic alterations of -cell lymphoma, consequences for currently used therapy regimens, and novel approaches specifically targeting metabolism in the TME.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310736>Breast cancer: Occluded role of mitochondria N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio in co-ordinating pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>A plethora of factors contribute to the biochemical underpinnings of breast cancer, in the absence of any clear, integrative framework. This article proposes that melatonergic pathway regulation within mitochondria provides an integrative framework for the wide array of data driving breast cancer pathophysiology. As melatonin is toxic to breast cancer cells, its production within mitochondria poses a significant challenge to breast cancer cell survival. Consequently, the diverse plasticity in breast cancer cells may arise from a requirement to decrease mitochondria melatonin synthesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor role in breast cancer pathophysiology may be mediated by an increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1 in mitochondria, leading to the backward conversion of melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS has distinct effects to melatonin, including its activation of the tyrosine receptor kinase  (TrkB) receptor. TrkB activation significantly contributes to breast cancer cell survival and migration. However, the most important aspect of NAS induction by CYP1b1 in breast cancer cells is the prevention of melatonin effects in mitochondria. Many of the changes occurring in breast cancer cells arise from the need to regulate this pathway in mitochondria, allowing this to provide a framework that integrates a host of previously disparate data, including: microRNAs, estrogen, 14-3-3 proteins, sirtuins, , oxidative phosphorylation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the kynurenine pathways. It is also proposed that this framework provides a pathoetiological model incorporating the early developmental regulation of the gut microbiome that integrates breast cancer risk factors, including obesity. This has significant treatment, prevention and research implications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the effects of US on the synovial fluid (SF) proteome in a rabbit knee osteoarthritis (KOA) model to explore its therapeutic mechanisms.Sixteen healthy 6-month-old New Zealand white rabbits (eight male, eight female), weighing 2.5-3.0 kg, were randomly divided into groups A and  with eight rabbits per group. Both groups were subjected to right anterior cruciate ligament transaction. Six weeks after surgery, we treated the operated knee joint of group A rabbits with US and of group  rabbits with sham US for 2 weeks. The proteomes of knee joint SF from groups A and  rabbits were then analyzed using a label-free mass spectrometry (MS) quantification method.We identified 19 protein sequences annotated by 361 Gene Ontology (GO) items. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database of rabbit protein sequences, we then annotated the KO numbers of homologous/similar proteins to 32 relevant KEGG pathways. We extracted 10 significantly differentially expressed proteins among the 32 relevant KEGG messages/metabolism pathways. The proteins whose levels were decreased were apolipoprotein A-I (AopA-1), transferrin (TF), carboxypeptidase B2 (CBP2), arylesterase/paraoxonase (PON), fibrinogen alpha chain, and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). The proteins whose levels were increased were molecular chaperone HtpG/heat shock proteins (htpG, HSP90A), decorin (DCN), pyruvate kinase (PK, pyk), and fatty acid-binding protein 4/adipocyte (FABP4, aP2).US therapy can alter protein levels in SF, which can decrease AopA-1, TF, CBP2, PON, fibrinogen alpha chain and A2M protein levels, and increase HtpG/HSP90A, DCN, PK/PKY, and FABP4/aP2 protein levels in SF of KOA, suggesting that the therapeutic mechanisms of US therapy on KOA may occur through changes in the SF proteome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402948>TIGAR promotes growth, survival and metastasis through oxidation resistance and AKT activation in glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma has a poor prognosis and is one of the most lethal types of cancer in the world. TP53 induced  regulatory phosphatase (TIGAR) is upregulated in various types of cancer. Therefore, the present study investigated the role of TIGAR in glioblastoma. TIGAR expression was measured in glioma samples and cell lines using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), glutathione, malondialdehyde and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were detected to measure oxidative stress in U-87MG cells following short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of TIGAR. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay for TIGAR-overexpression vector- and TIGAR-shRNA-transfected U-87MG cells. Apoptosis was assessed to evaluate whether TIGAR knockdown sensitized cells to the antitumor effects of temozolomide (TMZ). Migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were further assessed using Transwell and western blotting assays. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the interaction between TIGAR and protein kinase  (AKT). The results of the present study revealed that TIGAR was positively associated with poor survival and was upregulated in glioblastoma. TIGAR knockdown significantly increased oxidative stress, decreased cell proliferation and exacerbated TMZ-induced apoptosis in U-87MG cells. Additionally, TIGAR knockdown decreased migration, invasion and EMT, and treatment of TIGAR-shRNA-transfected cells with NADPH had no effect on metastasis. In addition, TIGAR promoted AKT activation and bound to AKT. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TIGAR may promote glioblastoma growth and progression through oxidation resistance and AKT activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31229799>The NIR inspired nano-CuSMn(II) composites for lactate and  attenuation.</a></h2><p>The level of lactate and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in cells has effect on tumor growth and drug resistance. The  of tumors could be inhibited by reducing the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) or the mutual conversion of lactic acid and pyruvic acid. To develop a bifunctional nanoparticle as both the cleaner of lactate and attenuator of , a NIR (near infrared) responsive nanoparticle (Mn-CuS@BSA-FA) was synthesized and characterized. The Mn-CuS@BSA-FA catalyzed the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate under NIR irradiation. In vitro assay results demonstrate that Mn-CuS@BSA-FA can decrease the activity of LDHA and attenuate the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. Moreover, Mn-CuS@BSA-FA can inhibit the expression of HIF-1 and decrease the ATP level in HepG-1 cells. Our work demonstrates that Mn-CuS@BSA-FA can be a NIR enhanced glycolytic inhibitor for cancer interventional treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

It has been well studied in many species, however, there is far less information about this family in pear. To investigate the roles of HXK in the growth and development of pear fruit, we performed a genome-wide analysis and identified the HXK gene family members in pear. In addition, we functionally characterized a glucose sensor gene, PbHXK1, in P. bretschneideri. In total, 10 HXK genes were identified in pear, and a multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that PbHXK1 is a Type  HXK that contains four conserved domains, phosphate 1 and 2, sugar binding and adenosine, which are specific to plant HXKs and essential for enzymatic functions. A qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the relative expression levels of PbHXK1 were negatively correlated with sugar content but significantly positively correlated with HXK activity during pear fruit development. Furthermore, the overexpression of PbHXK1 in tomatoes significantly enhanced the HXK activity and decreased the sugar content. In addition, the growth of transgenic tomato plants overexpressing PbHXK1 was inhibited, leading to shortened internodes and smaller leaves. Thus, in pear, PbHXK1 encodes HXK, which regulated the sugar content in fruit and affected the growth and development of plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Although high PKM2 expression is observed in various cancer tissues, its functional role in cancer metabolism is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PKM2 in regulating autophagy and its associated pathways in prostate cancer cells.Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression level of PKM2 in prostate cancer patients and normal human, whereas expression of PKM2 in several cell lines was also examined by using western blot. PKM2 expression was silenced using various small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was examined using IncuCyte ZOOM™ live cell imaging system. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the PKM2 knockdown on other cellular signaling molecules. Acridine orange and Monodansylcadaverine staining was performed to check effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy induction. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out to quantify the level of different cellular metabolites (pyruvate and lactate). Colony formation assay was performed to determine the ability of a cells to form large colonies.PKM2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer patients as compared to normal human. PKM2 siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells showed significantly reduced viability. Acridine orange, Monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 downregulation markedly increased autophagic cell death. Results of western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 knockdown affected protein kinase /mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which consequently downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1. Knockdown of PKM2 also reduced the colony formation ability of human prostate cancer cell DU145.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that PKM2 inhibition alters prostate cancer cell metabolism and induces autophagy, thus providing new perspectives for developing PKM2-targeting anticancer therapies for treating prostate cancer.© Copyright by the Author(s).
