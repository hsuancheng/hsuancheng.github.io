NK cells bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system; they are primed for immediate anti-tumour function but can also have prolonged actions alongside the adaptive T cell response. However, the key signals and cellular processes that are required for extended NK cell responses are not fully known. Herein we show that murine NK cell interaction with tumour cells induces the expression of CD25, the high affinity IL2 receptor, rendering these NK cells highly sensitive to the T cell-derived cytokine IL2. In response to IL2, CD25 NK cells show robust increases in metabolic signalling pathways (mTORC1, cMyc), nutrient transporter expression (CD71, CD98), cellular growth and in NK cell effector functions (IFNγ, granzyme B). Specific ligation of an individual activating NK cell receptor, NK1.1, showed similar increases in CD25 expression and IL2-induced responses. NK cell receptor ligation and IL2 collaborate to induce mTORC1/cMyc signalling leading to high rates of  and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and prolonged NK cell survival. Disrupting mTORC1 and cMyc signalling in CD25 tumour interacting NK cells prevents IL2-induced cell growth and function and compromises NK cell viability. This study reveals that tumour cell interactions and T cell-derived IL2 cooperate to promote robust and prolonged NK cell anti-tumour metabolic responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466233>A Cyclic Pentamethinium Salt Induces Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity through Mitochondrial Disintegration and Metabolic Collapse.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells preferentially utilize  for ATP production even in aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) and adapt mitochondrial processes to their specific needs. Recent studies indicate that altered mitochondrial activities in cancer represent an actionable target for therapy. We previously showed that salt 1-, a quinoxaline unit (with cytotoxic activity) incorporated into a meso-substituted pentamethinium salt (with mitochondrial selectivity and fluorescence properties), displayed potent cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, without significant toxic effects to normal tissues. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of salt 1- compared to its analogue, salt 1-, with an extended side carbon chain. Live cell imaging demonstrated that salt 1-, but not 1-, is rapidly incorporated into mitochondria, correlating with increased cytotoxicity of salt 1-. The accumulation in mitochondria led to their fragmentation and loss of function, accompanied by increased autophagy/mitophagy. Salt 1- preferentially activated AMP-activated kinase and inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, sensors of cellular metabolism, but did not induce apoptosis. These data indicate that salt 1- cytotoxicity involves mitochondrial perturbation and disintegration, and such compounds are promising candidates for targeting mitochondria as a weak spot of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427247>Global heterogeneity assessed with F-FDG PET/CT. Relation with biological variables and prognosis in locally advanced breast cancer.</a></h1><p>To analyze the relationship between measurements of global heterogeneity, obtained from F-FDG PET/CT, with biological variables, and their predictive and prognostic role in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).68 patients from a multicenter and prospective study, with LABC and a baseline F-FDG PET/CT were included. Immunohistochemical profile [estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), expression of the HER- oncogene, Ki-67 proliferation index and tumor histological grade], response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were obtained as clinical variables. Three-dimensional segmentation of the lesions, providing SUV, volumetric [metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion  (TLG)] and global heterogeneity variables [coefficient of variation (COV) and SUVmean/SUVmax ratio], as well as sphericity was performed. The correlation between the results obtained with the immunohistochemical profile, the response to NC and survival was also analyzed.Of the patients included, 62 received NC. Only 18 responded. 13 patients relapsed and 11 died during follow-up. ER negative tumors had a lower COV (p=0.018) as well as those with high Ki-67 (p=0.001) and high risk phenotype (p=0.033) compared to the rest. No PET variable showed association with the response to NC nor OS. There was an inverse relationship between sphericity with DFS (p=0.041), so, for every tenth that sphericity increases, the risk of recurrence decreases by 37%.Breast tumors in our LABC dataset behaved as homogeneous and spherical lesions. Larger volumes were associated with a lower sphericity. Global heterogeneity variables and sphericity do not seem to have a predictive role in response to NC nor in OS. More spherical tumors with less variation in gray intensity between voxels showed a lower risk of recurrence.Copyright © 2019 Sociedad Española de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

Striatal neurons and astrocytes derived from iPSCs from unaffected individuals (Ctrl) and Huntington's disease (HD) patients with HTT gene containing increased number of CAG repeats were used to assess the effect of mHTT on bioenergetics and mitochondrial superoxide anion production. The human neurons were thoroughly characterized and shown to express MAP2, DARPP32, GABA, synapsin, and PSD95. In human neurons and astrocytes expressing mHTT, the ratio of mHTT to wild-type huntingtin (HTT) was 1:1. The human neurons were excitable and could generate action potentials, confirming successful conversion of iPSCs into functional neurons. The neurons and astrocytes from Ctrl individuals and HD patients had similar levels of ADP and ATP and comparable respiratory and glycolytic activities. The mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, and superoxide anion production in human neurons appeared to be similar regardless of mHTT presence. The present results are in line with the results obtained in our previous studies with isolated brain mitochondria and cultured striatal neurons from YAC128 and R6/ mice, in which we demonstrated that mutant huntingtin at early stages of HD pathology does not deteriorate mitochondrial functions. Overall, our results argue against bioenergetic deficits as a factor in HD pathogenesis and suggest that other detrimental processes might be more relevant to the development of HD pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495556>In vitro cytotoxicity screening to identify novel anti-osteosarcoma therapeutics targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase .</a></h1><p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) act as negative modulator of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and play a crucial role in the regulation of oxidative , which recently have been considered as a potential drug target for varying types of cancer and diabetes. Herein, we describe the discovery and biological validation of novel anti-osteosarcoma therapeutics targeting PDK2. We identified 14 anti-osteosarcoma compounds from an in-house small molecule library, which were then evaluated in a PDK2 kinase inhibition assay. We found that compounds with -((4-oxo-6-((4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)-4H-pyran-3-yl)oxy)acetamide moiety showed promising inhibitory potencies to PDK2. Especial for 12, which bound to PDK2 with a K value of .3 µM, and inhibited PDK2 activity with an EC value of 1.1 µM. In addition, 12 selectively inhibited PDK2, the selectivity indexes are 10.6, 22.0, and 60.9 for PDK2 as compared to PDK1,  and 4, respectively. The MTT assay suggested that 12 reduced MG-63 cancer cell proliferation with an IC value of 4.7 µM. All these observations indicated that 12 was a novel anti-osteosarcoma therapeutic, which deserved for further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Zinc protects chondrocytes from MIA-induced damage. Here, we explored the protective effects of 25 μM zinc on 5 μM MIA-treated SW1353 cells (human chondrosarcoma cell line) through the analysis of energy metabolism- and autophagy-related parameters. We found that the exposure of SW1353 cells to MIA decreased ATP levels, expression of -related proteins, including glucose transporter 1, hexokinase , and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, and the levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and V subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. MIA treatment also decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including autophagic elongation protein 5 (ATG5), ATG7, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3-II) and mitophagy-related proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), ubiquitin, and p62. These results indicate that MIA interferes with energy metabolism and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (so called mitophagy). Interestingly, zinc exposure could almost completely reverse the effects of MIA, suggesting its potential protective role against OA progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, /gluconeogenesis, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Herein, we aimed to explore whether lncRNAs and miRNAs are involved in the glycolytic reprogramming under hypoxic conditions. The levels of HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP), miR-615-3p and high mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) mRNA were assessed by qRT-PCR. Western blot was performed to determine the protein expression of hexokinase  (HK-) and HMGB3. Glucose consumption and lactate production were analyzed using a respective assay kit. The targeted correlation between miR-615-3p and HOTTIP or HMGB3 was verified using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipition assays. Our data revealed that HOTTIP was upregulated and miR-615-3p was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. Hypoxia induced , increased HOTTIP and HMGB3 mRNA levels and repressed miR-615-3p expression in NSCLC cells. HOTTIP deficiency or miR-615-3p expression restoration repressed hypoxia-induced . Moreover, HOTTIP acted as a molecular sponge for miR-615-3p and HMGB3 was a direct target of miR-615-3p. The inhibitory effect of HOTTIP deficiency on  under hypoxic exposure was reversed by miR-615-3p restoration. Additionally, HOTTIP regulated HMGB3 expression by acting as a molecular sponge of miR-615-3p in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our study suggested that HOTTIP might promote  under hypoxic conditions at least partly through regulating miR-615-3p/HMGB3 axis in NSCLC cells. Targeting HOTTIP might be a promising therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

One difficulty is the paucity of clinical grade manufacturing platforms to support the large scale expansion of highly active NK cells. We created an NK cell feeder cell line termed 'NKF' through overexpressing membrane bound IL-21 that is capable of inducing robust and sustained proliferation (>10,000-fold expansion at 5 weeks) of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The expanded NK cells exhibit increased cytotoxic function against a panel of blood cancer and solid tumor cells as compared to IL--activated non-expanded NK cells. The NKF-expanded NK cells also demonstrate efficacy in mouse models of human sarcoma and T cell leukemia. Mechanistic studies revealed that membrane-bound IL-21 leads to an activation of a STAT3/c-Myc pathway and increased NK cell metabolism with a shift towards aerobic . The NKF feeder cell line is a promising new platform that enables the large scale proliferation of highly active NK cells in support of large scale third party NK cell clinical studies that have been recently intiatied. These results also provide mechanistic insights into how membrane-bound IL-21 regulates NK cell expansion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554135>Hepatic transcriptome and proteome analyses provide new insights into the regulator mechanism of dietary avicularin in diabetic mice.</a></h1><p>Many dietary flavonoids existing as glycosides in fruits and vegetables are considered bioactive food components with various potential health benefits. Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type  diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the , gluconeogenesis, and arachidonic acid pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) promotes the synthesis of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD along with its reducing equivalent, NADH, is an essential co-factor needed for energy production from  and oxidative phosphorylation. Yet, NAD/NADH are impermeable to the inner mitochondrial membrane and their import into the mitochondria requires the activity of specific shuttles. The most important neuronal NAD/NADH shuttle is the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). The MAS has been implicated in synaptic function and is potentially dysregulated during cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to determine if metabolic changes induced by PKCε preconditioning involved regulation of the MAS. Using primary neuronal cultures, we observed that the activation of PKCε enhanced mitochondrial respiration and  in vitro. Conversely, inhibition of the MAS resulted in decreased oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic capacity. We further demonstrated that activation of PKCε increased the phosphorylation of key components of the MAS in rat brain synaptosomal fractions. Additionally, PKCε increased the enzyme activity of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase  (GOT2), an effect that was dependent on the import of PKCε into the mitochondria and phosphorylation of GOT2. Furthermore, PKCε activation was able to rescue decreased GOT2 activity induced by ischemia. These findings reveal novel protective targets and mechanisms against ischemic injury, which involves PKCε-mediated phosphorylation and activation of GOT2 in the MAS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611016>Metagenomic analysis of the biotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to microbial nitrogen transformation in constructed wetlands.</a></h1><p>Extensive use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO NPs) in various products has increased the release of these particles into wastewater, posing potential environmental risks. As an ecological wastewater treatment facility, constructed wetland (CW) is an important sink of NPs. However, little is known about the effects of NPs on microbial nitrogen transformation and related genes in CWs. In this study, short-term (5 days) and long-term (60 days) exposure experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of TiO NPs (0, 1, and 50 mg/L) on microbial nitrogen removal in CWs. The results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was decreased by 35%-51% after long-term exposure to TiO NPs. Metagenomic analysis further confirmed that TiO NPs declined the relative abundance of functional genes and those enzyme encoding genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism pathway and  metabolism process. Furthermore, our data proved that the indigent  metabolism process resulted in the shortage of electron (NADH) and energy sources (ATP), causing inefficient nitrogen removal. Overall, these results revealed that the accumulation of TiO NPs altered the genetic expression of biofilm in CWs, which had significant impacts on biological nitrogen transformation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in biological processes. We have previously shown that hyperthermia (43°C, 30 min) promotes lactate secretion by inhibiting phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cultured immature boar SCs. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs are involved in AMPK-modulated  in SCs. In the present study, we identified 349 miRNAs (227 upregulated and 122 downregulated) in hyperthermia-treated boar SCs by next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing. MiR-8-3p, which was found to be a novel upregulated miRNA in hyperthermia-treated SCs, suppressed the expression of AMPK upstream genes (protein phosphatase  subunit B, PPP2R5B), and further downregulated the expression of p-AMPK. The miR-8-3p mimic upregulated expression of glucose transporter 3, lactate dehydrogenase A and monocarboxylate transporter 1, and increased lactic acid dehydrogenase activity, lactate secretion, and ATP depletion in SCs; the miR-8-3p inhibitor had the opposite effects on these parameters. Our findings indicate that miR-8-3p acts as a novel regulator of AMPK-modulated lactate secretion by targeting PPP2R5B in hyperthermic boar SCs.© 2019 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668072>Glechomanamides A-C, Germacrane Sesquiterpenoids with an Unusual Δ-7,12-Lactam Moiety from  and Their Antiangiogenic Activity.</a></h1><p>Three new germacrane sesquiterpenoid-type alkaloids with an unusual Δ-7,12-lactam moiety, glechomanamides A-C (-), and two pairs of 7,12-hemiketal sesquiterpenoid epimers (/, /) were isolated from .

Pharmacological (PFK158 treatment) and genetic inhibition of 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a critical control point in the glycolytic pathway, decreases glucose uptake, ATP production, and lactate dehydrogenase activity and arrests malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells in the G0/G1 phase to induce cell death. To overcome this nutrient stress, inhibition of PFKFB3 activity led to an escalation in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activity and aggravated ER stress mostly by upregulating BiP and GADD153 expression and activation of the endocytic Rac1-Rab5-Rab7 pathway resulting in a unique form of cell death called "methuosis" in both the sarcomatoid (H28) and epithelioid (EMMeso) cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed the formation of nascent macropinocytotic vesicles, which rapidly coalesced to form large vacuoles with compromised lysosomal function. Both immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that upon PFKFB3 inhibition, two crucial biomolecules of each pathway, Rac1 and Calnexin interact with each other. Finally, PFK158 alone and in combination with carboplatin-inhibited tumorigenesis of EMMeso xenografts in vivo. Since most cancer cells exhibit an increased glycolytic rate, these results provide evidence for PFK158, in combination with standard chemotherapy, may have a potential in the treatment of MPM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507433>Interrelationship Between Contractility, Protein Synthesis and Metabolism in Mantle of Juvenile Cuttlefish ().</a></h1><p>Young juvenile cuttlefish () can grow at rates as high as 12% body weight per day. How the metabolic demands of such a massive growth rate impacts muscle performance that competes for ATP is unknown. Here, we integrate aspects of contractility, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism in mantle of specimens weighing 1.1 g to lend insight into the processes. Isolated mantle muscle preparations were electrically stimulated and isometric force development monitored. Preparations were forced to contract at 3 Hz for 30 s to simulate a jetting event. We then measured oxygen consumption, glucose uptake and protein synthesis in the hour following the stimulation. Protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide and  was inhibited with iodoacetic acid in a subset of samples. Inhibition of protein synthesis impaired contractility and decreased oxygen consumption. An intact protein synthesis is required to maintain contractility possibly due to rapidly turning over proteins. At least, 41% of whole animal O is used to support protein synthesis in mantle, while the cost of protein synthesis (50 μmol O mg protein) in mantle was in the range reported for other aquatic ectotherms. A single jetting challenge stimulated protein synthesis by approximately 25% (.51-3.12% day) over a 1 h post contractile period, a similar response to that which occurs in mammalian skeletal muscle. Aerobic metabolism was not supported by extracellular glucose leading to the contention that at this life stage either glycogen or amino acids are catabolized. Regardless, an intact  is required to support contractile performance and protein synthesis in resting muscle. It is proposed that  is needed to maintain intracellular ionic gradients. Intracellular glucose at approximately 3 mmol L was higher than the 1 mmol L glucose in the bathing medium suggesting an active glucose transport mechanism. Octopine did not accumulate during a single physiologically relevant jetting challenge; however, octopine accumulation increased following a stress that is sufficient to lower Arg-P and increase free arginine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668919>Tristetraprolin posttranscriptionally downregulates PFKFB3 in cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The enzyme 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-bisphosphatases 3 (PFKFB3) catalyzes the first committed rate-limiting step of  and is upregulated in cancer cells. The mechanism of PFKFB3 expression upregulation in cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. The PFKFB3 3'-UTR is reported to contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are important for regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms by which PFKFB3 mRNA stability is determined by its 3'-UTR are not well known. We demonstrated that tristetraprolin (TTP), an ARE-binding protein, has a critical function regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. Our results showed that PFKFB3 mRNA contains three AREs in the 3'-UTR. TTP bound to the 3rd ARE and enhanced the decay of PFKFB3 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased PFKFB3 expression and ATP levels but increased GSH level in cancer cells. Overexpression of PFKFB3 cDNA without the 3'-UTR rescued ATP level and GSH level in TTP-overexpressing cells. Our results suggested that TTP post-transcriptionally downregulated PFKFB3 expression and that overexpression of TTP may contribute to suppression of  and energy production of cancer cells in part by downregulating PFKFB3 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed at investigating absolute expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) and genes involved in stress responses and muscle repair using a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from pectoralis major collected from male 6-week-old medium (carcass weight ≤ .5 kg) and heavy (carcass weight > .5 kg) broilers. Samples were classified as "non-defective" (n = 4), "medium-WS" (n = 6), "heavy-WS" (n = 7) and "heavy-WS+WB" (n = 3) based on abnormality scores. The HIF1A transcript was up-regulated in all of the abnormal groups. Transcript abundances of genes encoding 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA), and phosphorylase kinase beta subunit (PHKB) were increased in heavy-WS but decreased in heavy-WS+WB. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was up-regulated in non-defective samples. The muscle-specific mu- isoform of glutathione S-transferases (GSTM2) was up-regulated in the abnormal samples, particularly in the heavy groups. The genes encoding myogenic differentiation (MYOD1) and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) exhibited similar expression pattern, of which medium-WS and heavy-WS significantly increased compared to non-defective whereas expression in heavy-WS+WB was not different from either non-defective or WS-affected group. The greatest and the lowest levels of calpain-3 (CAPN3) and delta-sarcoglycan (SCGD) were observed in heavy-WS and heavy-WS+WB, respectively. Based on micrographs, the abnormal muscles primarily comprised fibers with cross-sectional areas ranging from ,000 to 3,000 μm2. Despite induced  at the transcriptional level, lower stored glycogen in the abnormal muscles corresponded with the reduced lactate and higher pH within their meats. The findings support hypoxia within the abnormal breasts, potentially associated with oversized muscle fibers. Between WS and WB, divergent glucose metabolism, cellular detoxification and myoregeneration at the transcriptional level could be anticipated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463638>The tumor suppressor NDRG2 cooperates with an mTORC1 inhibitor to suppress the Warburg effect in renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and metabolic reprogramming has a profound effect on RCC tumorigenesis. mTORC1 inhibitors are widely used in RCC treatment, yet some types of RCC cells are resistant to these compounds. Thus, clarification of the metabolic mechanism of mTORC1 inhibitors and exploration of new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In this study, we found that the mTORC1 pathway was hyperactive in RCC. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed that phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 at threonine 37/46 increased in RCC tissues compared with that in normal renal tissues. It was also found that mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus suppressed glucose consumption, lactate production, and multiple catalytic enzymes involved in  in 786-O and ACHN cells, but the accumulation of HIF1α induced by CoCl blocked the inhibitory effect of everolimus on aerobic . Interestingly, western blot and metabolite analysis showed that the tumor suppressor NDRG2 (N-Myc downstream regulated gene ) was able to inhibit mTORC1 activity and cooperate with an mTOR inhibitor to decrease aerobic  in 786-O and ACHN cells.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the -derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595421>Long non-coding RNA LINC00243 promotes proliferation and  in non-small cell lung cancer cells by positively regulating PDK4 through sponging miR-507.</a></h1><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main subtype of lung cancer. The overall survival of NSCLC patients is relatively low even after various treatments. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) plays crucial roles in different biological process. However, the role of a novel LncRNA, LINC00243, in NSCLC remains unclear. We aimed to explore the biological role of LINC00243 in NSCLC. The mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell viability in vitro was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony-formation assay. Reporter assay was used to detect the interactions between molecules, and the interaction was assessed by RNA pull-down assay. LINC00243 expression increased in human NSCLC tissues and associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. LINC00243 knockdown inhibited proliferation and  of NSCLC cells. Mechanically, LINC00243 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-507, and miR-507 reversed the effect of LINC00243 on promoting proliferation and  of NSCLC cells. Moreover, LINC00243 modulated expression of endogenous miR-507-targeted PDK4. LINC00243 promotes proliferation and  in NSCLC cells by positively regulating PDK4 through sponging miR-507.

To suppress lactate production, it is necessary to regenerate NAD consumed by  with alternative pathways other than lactate dehydrogenase. In a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112, suppression of lactate production by regenerating NAD when producing 1,3-propanediol from glycerol was investigated. The bacterium produced lactate with a yield of 4.7 ± 0.8 g·g-cell in a batch culture using glucose as the sole carbon source. When glycerol was added to glucose at a molar ratio (r) of three in the batch culture, the bacterium produced 1,3-propanediol at 1.6 ± 0.7 g·g-cell·h and the lactate yield decreased to 3.6 ± 0.5 g·g-cell. When glycerol was co-fed with glucose exponentially to give a target specific growth rate of 0.1 h (r = 3), the lactate yield decreased to 1.5 ± 0. g·g-cell. The lactate production when glycerol was added together with glucose was reduced to one-third of that observed in the batch culture using glucose as a carbon source.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, the precise mechanism of the matrine antihuman chronic myeloid leukemia remains unclear. In this study, we showed that matrine significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by regulating Warburg effect through controlling hexokinases  (HK2) expression in myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, matrine inhibited the expression of HK2 mediated by reduction in c-Myc binding to HK2 gene intron and led to downregulation of HK2, which upregulated proapoptotic protein Bad and then induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that matrine could synergize with lonidamine, an inhibitor of HK2, for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, both  and .

Inadequate NAD  availability is proposed to contribute to pathophysiology by impairing metabolic energy pathway use. Despite the importance of NAD  as a vital redox cofactor in energy production pathways being well-established, the wider impact of disrupted NAD  homeostasis on these pathways is unknown.  We utilised skeletal muscle myotube models to induce NAD  depletion, repletion and excess and conducted metabolic tracing to provide comprehensive and detailed analysis of the consequences of altered NAD  metabolism on central carbon metabolic pathways. We used stable isotope tracers, [1,-13C] D-glucose and [U- C] glutamine, and conducted combined 2D-1H,13C-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis.  NAD  excess driven by nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation within skeletal muscle cells resulted in enhanced nicotinamide clearance, but had no effect on energy homeostasis or central carbon metabolism. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition induced NAD  depletion and resulted in equilibration of metabolites upstream of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Aspartate production through  and TCA cycle activity was increased in response to low NAD , which was rapidly reversed with repletion of the NAD  pool using NR. NAD  depletion reversibly inhibits cytosolic GAPDH activity, but retains mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, suggesting differential effects of this treatment on sub-cellular pyridine pools. When supplemented, NR efficiently reversed these metabolic consequences. However, the functional relevance of increased aspartate levels after NAD  depletion remains unclear, and requires further investigation.  These data highlight the need to consider carbon metabolism and clearance pathways when investigating NAD  precursor usage in models of skeletal muscle physiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537452>Comparison of metabolic profiles of yeasts based on the difference of the Crabtree positive and negative.</a></h1><p>The Crabtree effect involves energy management in which yeasts utilize  as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen, despite the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen, when oxygen concentrations exceed a certain limit. The Crabtree effect is detrimental to bakery yeast production, because it results in lower cellular glucose yields. Batch culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a Crabtree positive yeast, decreased the cell yield of glucose and produced large amounts of ethanol despite a high specific glucose consumption rate compared to Candida utilis, a Crabtree negative yeast. This study investigated the effect of these characteristics on metabolite levels. We performed metabolome analysis of both yeasts during each growth phase of batch culture using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principle component analysis of metabolome data indicated that the Crabtree effect affected metabolites related to NADH synthesis in central metabolism. The amount of these metabolites in S. cerevisiae was lower than that in C. utilis. However, to maintain the specific glucose consumption rate at high levels, yeasts must avoid depletion of NAD, which is essential for glucose utilization. Our results indicated that NADH was oxidized by converting acetaldehyde to ethanol in S. cerevisiae, which is in accordance with previous reports. Therefore, the specific NADH production rates of S. cerevisiae and C. utilis did not show a difference. This study suggested that NAD/NADH ratio is disrupted by the Crabtree effect, which in turn influenced central metabolism and that S. cerevisiae maintained the NAD/NADH ratio by producing ethanol.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

PSTi8 (PEGKGEQEHSQQKEEEEEMAV-amide) is a pancreastatin inhibitor peptide which showed potent antidiabetic activity in genetic and lifestyle induced type  diabetic mice. In the present work, we have investigated the antidiabetic activity of PSTi8 in rat models of peri-/post-menopausal IR. 4-vinylcyclohexenediepoxide treated and ovariectomized rats were fed with high fat diet for 12 weeks to develop the peri-/post-menopausal IR. PSTi8 peptide was administered after the development of peri-/post-menopausal IR rats. PSTi8 (1 mg/kg, i.p) improved the glucose homeostasis which is characterized by elevated glycogenesis, enhanced  and reduced gluconeogenesis. PSTi8 suppressed palmitate- and PST- induced IR in HepG2 cells. PSTi8 treatment enhanced energy expenditure in peri-/post-menopausal IR rats. PSTi8 treatment increased insulin sensitivity in peri-/post-menopausal IR rats, may be mediated by modulating IRS1--phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT-GSK3β and IRS1--phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-PKCλ/ζ-SREBP1c signaling pathways in the liver.

This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by , and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous 'lactate clock' in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447604>Dietary Carbohydrate Promotes Cell Survival in Cancer Via the Up-Regulation of Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Gene Expression Level.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells are mainly dependent on  for their growth and survival. Dietary carbohydrates play a critical role in the growth and proliferation of cancer and a low-carbohydrate diet may help slow down the growth of tumours. However, the exact mechanisms behind this effect are unclear. This review study aimed to investigate the effect of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene in the association between dietary carbohydrates and cancer. This study was carried out using keywords such as polymorphism and/or cancer and/or dietary carbohydrate and/or FTO gene. PubMed and Science Direct databases were used to collect all related articles published from 1990 to 2018. Recent studies showed that the level of FTO gene expression in cancer cells is dramatically increased and may play a role in the growth of these cells through the regulation of the cellular metabolic pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinaseB (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Dietary carbohydrate may influence the FTO gene expression by eliminating the inhibitory effect of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on the FTO gene expression. This review summarised what has been recently discovered about the effects of dietary carbohydrate on cancer cells and tried to determine the mediating role of the FTO gene in these effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412639>Polyphenols and Metabolites Enhance Survival in Rodents and Nematodes-Impact of Mitochondria.</a></h1><p>(1) Background: Polyphenols (PP) play an important role in the prevention of non-communicable diseases and may contribute to healthy aging. To investigate the molecular and cellular aspects of PP metabolites on longevity with a focus on mitochondrial function, we applied a pre-fermented mixture of polyphenols (Rechtsregulat, RR) to rodents and nematodes. () Methods: The lifespans of Navar Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice and  were recorded. The heat-stress resistance (37 °C) of  N2 was measured using nucleic staining. Respiration and membrane potential (ΔΨm) were measured in isolated mitochondria. The energetic metabolites adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate, and pyruvate were determined in lysates.

Here, we sought to investigate whether the combination of different molecular imaging parameters may improve outcome prediction in this patient group.Patients with pathologically proven hypopharyngeal carcinoma scheduled to undergo chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were deemed eligible. Besides clinical data, parameters obtained from pretreatment -deoxy--[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-FDG PET/CT), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and diffusion-weighted MRI were analyzed in relation to treatment response, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).A total of 61 patients with advanced-stage disease were examined. After CRT, 36% of the patients did not achieve a complete response. Total lesion  (TLG) and texture feature entropy were found to predict treatment response. The transfer constant (K), TLG, and entropy were associated with RFS, whereas K, blood plasma volume (Vp), standardized uptake value (SUV), and entropy were predictors of OS. Different scoring systems based on the sum of PET- or MRI-derived prognosticators enabled patient stratification into distinct prognostic groups (P <.0001). The complete response rate of patients with a score of  was significantly lower than those of patients with a score 1 or 0 (14.7% vs 58.9% vs 75.7%, respectively, P = .007, respectively). The combination of PET- and DCE-MRI-derived independent risk factors allowed a better survival stratification than the TNM staging system (P <.0001 vs .691, respectively).Texture features on F-FDG PET/CT and DCE-MRI are clinically useful to predict treatment response and survival in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Their combined use in prognostic scoring systems may help these patients benefit from tailored treatment and obtain better oncological results.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645487>[Effect of diethylnitrosamine on renal metabolic pathway in rats].</a></h1><p>To explore the renal metabolic markers relavant to the renal toxicity of diethylnitrosamine and the metabolic pathways involved in the renal metabolic markers.  Methods: Nineteen Sprague Dawley rats were assigned into  groups: A normal control group (n=9) and a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administration group (n=10).

The TCGA-bladder cancer (BLCA) database contains clinicopathological, genomic and survival data from over 400 muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. In this study, using data from this database, we performed a systematic screening of gene expression to identify the protein-coding gene that might have prognostic value in papillary and non-papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The data of patients with primary MIBC in TCGA-BLCA was acquired from the UCSC Xena project (http://xena.ucsc.edu) for re-analysis. By setting |log2 fold change|≥ and adjusted p value <0.01 as the screening criteria, we found 751 significantly dysregulated genes, including 183 overexpressed and 568 downregulated genes. HMMR was identified as a potential prognostic marker with unique expression. Multivariate analysis showed that its expression was an independent prognostic indicator of shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 1.400, 95%CI: 1.021-1.920, p = 0.037) in the papillary subtype. ENST00000393915.8 and ENST00000358715.3, two transcripts that contain all 18 exons and encode the full length of HMMR, were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal bladder tissues. None of the 17 CpG sites in its DNA locus was relevant to HMMR expression. 26/403 (6.5%) MIBC cases had HMMR gene-level amplification, which was associated with upregulated HMMR expression compared with the copy-neutral and deletion groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in papillary MIBC found that the high HMMR expression group was associated with upregulated genes enriched in multiple gene sets with well-established role in BC development, including G2M checkpoint, E2 F Targets, Myc Targets V1, Myc Targets V2 and . Based on these findings, we infer that HMMR expression might be a specific prognostic marker in terms of PFS in papillary MIBC. DNA amplification might be an important mechanism of its elevation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced by enteroendocrine cells in the gastric mucosa with known immunoregulatory roles. The mechanism behind the function of ghrelin in immune cells, such as macrophages, is still poorly understood. Here, we explored the hypothesis that ghrelin leads to alterations in macrophage metabolism thus modulating macrophage function. We demonstrated that ghrelin exerts an immunomodulatory effect over LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages, as evidenced by inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β secretion and increased IL-12 production. Concomitantly, ghrelin increased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased respiratory rate. In agreement, ghrelin prevented LPS-induced ultrastructural damage in the mitochondria. Ghrelin also blunted LPS-induced . In LPS-activated macrophages, glucose deprivation did not affect ghrelin-induced IL-12 secretion, whereas the inhibition of pyruvate transport and mitochondria-derived ATP abolished ghrelin-induced IL-12 secretion, indicating a dependence on mitochondrial function. Ghrelin pre-treatment of metabolic activated macrophages inhibited the secretion of TNF-α and enhanced IL-12 levels. Moreover, ghrelin effects on IL-12, and not on TNF-α, are dependent on mitochondria elongation, since ghrelin did not enhance IL-12 secretion in metabolic activated mitofusin- deficient macrophages. Thus, ghrelin affects macrophage mitochondrial metabolism and the subsequent macrophage function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the oxygen-glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from 5.0 to .8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic , not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410981>MicroRNA-488 inhibits proliferation and  in human prostate cancer cells by regulating PFKFB3.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States, and its molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of  with glucose analog, -desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of  inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and  dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The glucose analog -deoxyglucose (2DG) is imported into cells and, after phosphorylation, becomes 2DG-6-phosphate, a toxic by-product that inhibits . Using yeast as a model, we performed an unbiased mass spectrometry-based approach to probe the cellular effects of 2DG on the proteome and study resistance mechanisms to 2DG. We found that two phosphatases that target 2DG-6-phosphate were induced upon exposure to 2DG and participated in 2DG detoxification. Dog1 and Dog2 are HAD (haloacid dehalogenase)-like phosphatases, which are evolutionarily conserved. 2DG induced Dog2 by activating several signaling pathways, such as the stress response pathway mediated by the p38 MAPK ortholog Hog1, the unfolded protein response (UPR) triggered by 2DG-induced ER stress, and the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway mediated by the MAPK Slt2. Loss of the UPR or CWI pathways led to 2DG hypersensitivity. In contrast, mutants impaired in the glucose-mediated repression of genes were 2DG resistant because glucose availability transcriptionally repressed  by inhibiting signaling mediated by the AMPK ortholog Snf1. The characterization and genome resequencing of spontaneous 2DG-resistant mutants revealed that  overexpression was a common strategy underlying 2DG resistance. The human Dog2 homolog HDHD1 displayed phosphatase activity toward 2DG-6-phosphate in vitro and its overexpression conferred 2DG resistance in HeLa cells, suggesting that this 2DG phosphatase could interfere with 2DG-based chemotherapies. These results show that HAD-like phosphatases are evolutionarily conserved regulators of 2DG resistance.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Its control principles, however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a method that combines H and C tracers to determine glycolytic thermodynamics. Using this method, we show that, in conditions and organisms with relatively slow fluxes, multiple steps in  are near to equilibrium, reflecting spare enzyme capacity. In Escherichia coli, nitrogen or phosphorus upshift rapidly increases the thermodynamic driving force, deploying the spare enzyme capacity to increase flux. Similarly, respiration inhibition in mammalian cells rapidly increases both glycolytic flux and the thermodynamic driving force. The thermodynamic shift allows flux to increase with only small metabolite concentration changes. Finally, we find that the cellulose-degrading anaerobe Clostridium cellulolyticum exhibits slow, near-equilibrium  due to the use of pyrophosphate rather than ATP for fructose-bisphosphate production, resulting in enhanced per-glucose ATP yield. Thus, near-equilibrium steps of  promote both rapid flux adaptation and energy efficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428167>Costunolide reduces -associated activation of hepatic stellate cells via inhibition of hexokinase-.</a></h1><p>Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is a central event during hepatic fibrosis. Aerobic  is one of its metabolic hallmarks. Blocking  is a novel therapeutic option for liver fibrosis. This study investigated the effects of costunolide, a natural product demonstrated to have hepatoprotective effects, on HSC activation and .Primary HSCs were isolated from rats and cultured through 5 to 6 passages. Cell viability, activation markers, and glycolytic metabolism were examined in primary HSCs using various cellular and molecular approaches.At 30 μM, costunolide reduced the viability of HSCs and inhibited the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I, two key markers of HSC activation. It also decreased glucose uptake and consumption, and reduced the intracellular levels of lactate in HSCs. At 10 mM, the  inhibitor -DG had a similar impact to costunolide at 30 μM: it significantly downregulated the expression of HSC activation markers. The combination of the two compounds produced more remarkable effects. Furthermore, costunolide repressed the expression and activity of hexokinase  (HK2), a pivotal rate-limiting enzyme that regulates . However, overexpression of HK2 via plasmid transfection significantly reversed the costunolide-mediated downregulation of activation markers in HSCs, indicating that suppression of HK2 was required for costunolide to inhibit -associated HSC activation.Our results show that costunolide can suppress HSC activation, and this is associated with inhibition of HK2, which blocks aerobic . This suggests that costunolide is an antifibrotic candidate with potential for further development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562244>Enhancing cardiac  causes an increase in PDK4 content in response to short term high fat diet.</a></h1><p>The healthy heart has a dynamic capacity to respond and adapt to changes in nutrient availability. Metabolic inflexibility, such as occurs with diabetes, increases cardiac reliance on fatty acids to meet energetic demands and this results in deleterious effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction, that contribute to pathophysiology. Enhancing glucose usage may mitigate metabolic inflexibility and be advantageous under such conditions. Here, we sought to identify how mitochondrial function and cardiac metabolism are affected in a transgenic mouse model of enhanced cardiac  (GlycoHi) basally and following a short-term (7d) high fat diet (HFD). GlycoHimice constitutively express an active form of phosphofructokinase-, resulting in elevated levels of the PFK-1 allosteric activator fructose-,6-bisphosphate. We report that basally GlycoHi mitochondria exhibit augmented pyruvate supported respiration relative to fatty acids. Nevertheless, both wild type and GlycoHi mitochondria had a similar shift towards increased rates of fatty acid supported respiration following HFD. Metabolic profiling by GC-MS revealed distinct features based on both genotype and diet, with a unique increase in branched chain amino acids in the GlycoHi HFD group. Targeted quantitative proteomics analysis also supported both genotype and diet-dependent changes in protein expression and uncovered an enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in the GlycoHiHFD group.  These results support a newly identified mechanism whereby the levels of fructose-,6-bisphosphate promote mitochondrial PDK4 levels and identifies a secondary adaptive response that prevents excessive mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation when  is sustained after a high fat dietary challenge.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509426>Prognostic Value of the Volumetric Parameters of Dual-Time-Point F-FDG PET/CT in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiation Therapy.</a></h1><p> The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the volumetric parameters of dual-time-point imaging (DTPI) with F-FDG PET (DTPI FDG PET) in predicting the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT).  The records of consecutive patients who received definitive RT for NSCLC from April 2010 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Pretreatment DTPI FDG PET images were routinely obtained as part of the PET/CT examination. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG) of the primary tumor (SUV-T, MTV-T, and TLG-T, respectively) and those of the primary tumor and lymph nodes (N) combined (SUV-TN, MTV-TN, and TLG-TN, respectively) were used as variables, and the percentage change in these parameters (change in SUV [ΔSUV], change in MTV [ΔMTV], and change in TLG [ΔTLG]) on DTPI FDG PET were analyzed.  Of the 118 patients identified and reviewed, 59 met the study eligibility criteria. After a median follow-up of 23.3 months, the 3-year local control rate (LCR) and disease-specific survival rates were 53.5% and 45.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of LCR were TLG-T and change in TLG-TN (ΔTLG-TN), and significant predictors of disease-specific survival were adjuvant chemotherapy, treatment response, TLG-T, and change in TLG-T (ΔTLG-T). Low percentage changes in ΔTLG (< 41.0% for ΔTLG-T and < 32.0% for ΔTLG-TN) correlated with poor LCR and disease-specific survival. SUV and MTV were not significant predictors of both LCR and disease-specific survival.  TLG and ΔTLG were significant prognostic factors in patients with NSCLC treated with definitive RT. In particular, a relatively low ΔTLG resulted in poor outcomes in terms of LCR and disease-specific survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31377389>Synthesis of novel methyl jasmonate derivatives and evaluation of their biological activity in various cancer cell lines.</a></h1><p>Warburg hypothesized that the energy consumption of cancer cells is different than the normal cells.

The first step in  is the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the hexokinase-II enzyme (HK-II) which is known to be overexpressed in tumor cells. The feeding of cancer cells can be prevented by inhibiting the hexokinase-II enzyme in the first step of aerobic . In literature, Methyl Jasmonate (MJ) is known as a Hexokinase-II inhibitor since it disposes VDAC and HK-II interaction on mitochondrial membrane. In our study, we aimed to increase the activity by synthesizing the novel MJ analogues with appropriate modifications. Here we report Hexokinase- enzyme and cell viability study results in different cancer cells. Based on the three different cancer cell lines we investigated, our novel MJ analogues proved to be more potent than the original molecule. Thus this research may provide more efficacious/novel HK-II inhibitors and may shed light to develop new anti-cancer agents.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The beneficial actions of metformin have been found even beyond diabetes management and it has been considered as one of the most promising drugs that could potentially slow down aging. Surprisingly, the effect of metformin on brain function and metabolism has been less explored given that brain almost exclusively uses glucose as substrate for energy metabolism. We determined the effect of metformin on locomotor and cognitive function in normoglycemic mice. Metformin enhanced locomotor and balance performance, while induced anxiolytic effect and impaired cognitive function upon chronic treatment. We conducted  assays and metabolomics analysis in mice to evaluate metformin's action on the brain metabolism. Metformin decreased ATP level and activated AMPK pathway in mouse hippocampus. Metformin inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and elevated  by inhibiting mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH)  at therapeutic doses. In summary, our study demonstrated that chronic metformin treatment affects brain bioenergetics with compound effects on locomotor and cognitive brain function in non-diabetic mice.Copyright: © 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675219>Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic responses induced by cecal infusion of sodium propionate in a fistula pig model.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the major products of the microbial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates. SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased . Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446858>Assessment of biological parameters in head and neck cancer based on in vivo distribution of F-FDG-FLT-FMISO-PET/CT images.</a></h1><p>Several genetic analyses have identified tumor diversity not only among tumors from different patients (intertumor heterogeneity) but also within individual tumors (intratumor heterogeneity). The aim of this study was to analyze the intratumor heterogeneity and other biological parameters based on in vivo distribution in triple-tracer positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) study in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck (H&N) cancer.Thirty-six patients with newly diagnosed H&N cancer were included in the study. Institutional Bioethical Committee approved the study protocol and informed consent was received from every participant. All patients underwent series of 3 PET/CT scans with [F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG-PET), [F]Fluorothymidine (F-FLT-PET), and [F]Fluoromisonidazole (F-FMISO-PET) before treatment. Scans were performed on separate days, within a timeframe of  weeks. Several PET/CT parameters grading tumor biology including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), total lesion  (TLG), its equivalent (total hypoxic lesion [TLH] and total proliferative lesion [TLP]), and heterogeneity (area under the curve-cumulative SUV histogram) for the primary tumor were compared.All patients showed increased uptake of F-FDG in primary tumor, ranging from .29 to 14.89 SUV. Respectively, SUV values for F-FLT ranged from 0.93 to 16.11 and for F-FMISO 0.36-4.07. Based on 3-year follow-up, we divided patients in terms of survival forecasts (first with good prognosis and second with worse). Higher values of TLG/TLP/TLH and SUV were observed in the second group in all 3 tracers (for F-FDG: 167.40 vs 100.32, 11.15 vs 8.95; for F-FLT: 116.61 vs 60.67, 7.09 vs 5.47; for F-FMISO: 37.34 vs 22.30, 1.70 vs 1.61 respectively). Statistically significant differences were shown in SUV in F-FDG and F-FLT (<0.034, <0.034, respectively; in TLG, =0.05; TLP, =0.04; and TLH, =0.05).Our preliminary results suggest worse prognosis in patients with higher heterogeneity values of primary tumor in proliferation and hypoxia images and combination of metabolic and volumetric parameters in TLG and its equivalent and heterogeneity of primary tumor seems to be a prognostic factor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511451>Flow Cytometry-Based Photodynamic Diagnosis with 5-Aminolevulinic Acid for the Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h1><p>Multiple myeloma is the cancer of plasma cells. Along with the development of new and effective therapies, improved outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma have increased the interest in minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. However, the considerable heterogeneity of immunophenotypic and molecular markers of myeloma cells has limited its clinical application. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural compound in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Following ALA treatment, tumor cells preferentially accumulate porphyrins because of the differential activities of aerobic , known as Warburg effect. Among various porphyrins, protoporphyrine IX is a strong photosensitizer; thus, ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis has been widely used in various solid cancers. Here, the feasibility of flow cytometry-based photodynamic detection of MRD was tested in multiple myeloma. Among various human cell lines of hematological malignancies, including K562 erythroleukemia, Jurkat T-cell leukemia, Nalm6 pre-B cell leukemia, KG1a myeloid leukemia, and U937 monocytic leukemia, human myeloma cell line, KMS18, and OPM2 abundantly expressed ALA transporters, such as SLC36A1 and SLC15A2, and 1 mM ALA treatment for 24 h resulted in nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence expression, which could be competitively inhibited by ALA transport with gamma-aminobutyric acid. Titration studies revealed that the lowest ALA concentration required to achieve nearly 100% porphyrin fluorescence in KMS18 cells was 0.25 mM, with an incubation period of  h. Under these conditions, incubation of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in only 1.8 % of the cells exhibiting porphyrin fluorescence. Therefore, flow cytometry-based photodynamic diagnosis is a promising approach for detecting MRD in multiple myeloma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606631>Delaying the biosynthesis of aromatic secondary metabolites in postharvest strawberry fruit exposed to elevated CO atmosphere.</a></h1><p>Aromatic secondary metabolites are closely related to quality attributes of postharvest fruit. In the present study, 20% CO was applied to strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of elevated CO on aromatic secondary metabolites. The results showed that elevated CO delayed accumulations of anthocyanins, eugenol and lignin. Phenylalanine and tyrosine, the precursors of the above secondary metabolites, were 18.90% and 35.61%, respectively, lower in CO-treated fruit compared with the control on day 6. Furthermore, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles analysis showed pentose phosphate pathway and  were activated by elevated CO whereas the aromatic amino acids (AAAs) pathway was inhibited. These results indicated that elevated CO restricted carbon flux into aromatic secondary metabolism by inhibiting the AAAs pathway, leading to the decrease of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and thus, delayed the accumulation of aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, the effect of elevated CO was eliminated after transferred CO-treated fruit to air.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, accurate quantification of 11 glycolytic metabolites was done. We detected a significant reduction of five of them, namely phosphoenolpyruvate, -phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the AD CSF compared to controls. These results correlate with the known reduction of glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with AD and indicate that metabolic analysis of the central carbon metabolism can be a potential tool in AD diagnostic. Although the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the metabolites do not reach the level of the diagnostic informativity of AD biomarkers, the combination of specific  metabolites with the established biomarkers may lead to an improvement in sensitivity and specificity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456257>Study on the effect of CaMKKβ-mediated AMPK activation on the  and the quality of different altitude postmortem bovines longissimus muscle.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), , and meat quality index in three altitude bovines during postmortem aging process. Local cattle (altitude:1,500 m), Gannan yak (3,000 m), and Yushu yak (4,500 m) postmortem Longissimus Dorsi (LD) muscle were used. Results indicated that CaCl significantly increased the AMPK activity by increasing the calcium-regulated protein kinase kinase (CaMKKβ) activity. Besides, AMPK activation enhanced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Ca -ATPase and accelerated the rate of muscle maturation during postmortem aging. Moreover, the expression of HIF-1, PRKAA2, and GLUT4 genes in high-altitude Yushu yak was higher than that of low-altitude bovines. CaCl activates AMPK by activating CaMKKβ cascade and accelerates postmortem  affecting the intramuscular environment, color, and muscle protein degradation to accelerate postmortem muscle maturation, suggesting that AMPK has essential effects on postmortem muscle  and quality, and can regulate muscle quality by regulating postmortem muscle AMPK activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Insufficient postmortem  usually leads to DFD (dark, firm, and dry) meat. Beef have relatively high incidences of DFD meat, which has an unattractive dark color and causes significant loss to the meat industry. Therefore, AMPK, which can regulate postmortem  to affect meat quality, is a valid research target.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31497345>HSF2 regulates aerobic  by suppression of FBP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Heat shock factors (HSFs) are essential for all organisms to survive exposures to acute stress. Recent years have witnessed the progress in uncovering the importance of HSFs in cancer cell oncogenesis, progression and metastasis. However, their roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and the underlying mechanism have seldom been discussed. The present study aims to uncover the two important HSFs members HSF1 and HSF2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset analysis, we investigated the prognosis value of HSF1 and HSF2 in HCC and identified HSF2 as a prediction factor of overall survival of HCC.  cell line studies demonstrated that silencing HSF2 expression could decrease the proliferation in HCC cells. In depth mechanism analysis demonstrated that HSF2 promoted cell proliferation via positive regulation of aerobic , and HSF2 interacted with euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase  (EHMT2) to epigenetically silence fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), which is a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of aerobic  in HCC. HSF2 expression indicated unfavorable prognosis of HCC patients and it could regulate aerobic  by suppression of FBP1 to support uncontrolled proliferation of HCC cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662957>Computational Identification of Metabolic Pathways of  using the -Shortest Path Algorithm.</a></h1><p>, a malaria pathogen, has shown substantial resistance to treatment coupled with poor response to some vaccines thereby requiring urgent, holistic, and broad approach to prevent this endemic disease. Understanding the biology of the malaria parasite has been identified as a vital approach to overcome the threat of malaria. This study is aimed at identifying essential proteins unique to malaria parasites using a reconstructed  genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the 3D7 strain of  by filling gaps in the model with nineteen (19) metabolites and twenty-three (23) reactions obtained from the MetaCyc database.

Heuristic function was introduced for the optimal performance of the algorithm. To validate the prediction, the essentiality of the reactions in the reconstructed network was evaluated using betweenness centrality measure, which was applied to every reaction within the pathways considered in this study. Thirty-two (32) essential reactions were predicted among which our method validated fourteen (14) enzymes already predicted in the literature. The enzymatic proteins that catalyze these essential reactions were checked for homology with the host genome, and two () showed insignificant similarity, making them possible drug targets.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the volumetric metabolic activity parameters according to the morphologic parameters of the nodules.In this retrospective study, F-FDG positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans performed between 2011 and 2018 were evaluated by a nuclear and diagnostic radiologist. One hundred thirteen patients with SPNs with biopsy-proven diagnosis were included. SPNs were classified as solid, partially solid (PS), and ground glass opacity (GGO).SPN diameter, SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion  (TLG), and density were significantly higher in the malignant group. SUV, MTV, TLG increased in direct proportion to the diameter. There was no a significant difference between GGO, PS, and solid nodules in terms of SUV values. MTV and TLG values increased in parallel with the density of the nodules, but this increase was only significant in the malignant group. There was a significant difference between SPNs < cm and SPNs ≥ cm in terms of MTV, while there was no difference in terms of SUV. The cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was found to be 4.39 for SUV, 7.33 mL for MTV and 31.88 g for TLG. The cut-off values for SUV of solid and subsolid nodules were close to each other, but cut-off values for MTV and TLG were higher in solid nodules.SUV, MTV, and TLG are affected by diameter and attenuation. We suggest using different MTV and TLG cut-off values for solid and subsolid nodules, but we suggest using same SUV values. MTV can be a more reliable parameter than SUV in prediction of malignancy in smaller nodules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623506>Sixteen-Week Physical Activity Intervention in Subjects With Increased Cardiometabolic Risk Shifts Innate Immune Function Towards a Less Proinflammatory State.</a></h1><p>Background Low-grade inflammation, largely mediated by monocyte-derived macrophages, contributes to atherosclerosis. Sedentary behavior is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We examined whether reducing sedentary behavior and improving walking time improves monocyte inflammatory phenotype in subjects with increased cardiovascular risk. Methods and Results Across  waves, 16 individuals with increased cardiovascular risk performed a 16-week intervention study (age 64±6 years, body mass index 29.9±4.3 kg/m), using a device with vibration feedback to promote physical activity. Before and after intervention, we objectively examined physical activity (ActivPAL), cytokine production capacity after ex vivo stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, metabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating cytokine concentrations, and monocyte immunophenotype. Overall, no significant increase in walking time was found (1.9±0.7 to .±1. h/day, =0.07). However, strong, inverse correlations were observed between the change in walking time and the change in production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 after lipopolysaccharide stimulation (=-0.655, -0.844, -0.672, and -0.781, respectively, all <0.05). After intervention optimization based on feedback from wave 1, participants in wave  (n=8) showed an increase in walking time (.±0.8 to 3.0±1.3 h/day, =0.001) and attenuated cytokine production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 (all <0.05).  (=0.08) and maximal OXPHOS (=0.04) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased after intervention. Lower IL-6 concentrations (=0.06) and monocyte percentages (<0.05), but no changes in monocyte subsets were found. Conclusions Successfully improving walking time shifts innate immune function towards a less proinflammatory state, characterized by a lower capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines, in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk.

Emerging evidence supports an obligatory metabolic shift from  to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during stem cells differentiation, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of metabolism may improve CPC differentiation and, potentially, healing properties. In this study, we investigated the metabolic transition underlying CPC differentiation toward cardiac myocytes. In addition, we tested whether activators of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), known to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in other cell types would also improve CPC differentiation. Stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1) CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts and their phenotype compared with more mature neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs). Under normoxia, glucose consumption and lactate release were significantly higher in CPCs than in NRCMs. Both parameters were increased in hypoxia together with increased abundance of Glut1 (glucose transporter), of the monocarboxylic transporter Mct4 (lactate efflux mediator) and of Pfkfb3 (key regulator of glycolytic rate). CPC proliferation was critically dependent on glucose and glutamine availability in the media. Oxygen consumption analysis indicates that, compared with NRCMs, CPCs exhibited lower basal and maximal respirations with lower Tomm20 protein expression and mitochondrial DNA content. This CPC metabolic phenotype profoundly changed upon in vitro differentiation, with a decrease of glucose consumption and lactate release together with increased abundance of Tnnt2, Pgc-1α, Tomm20, and mitochondrial DNA content. Proliferative CPCs express both alpha1 and - catalytic subunits of AMPK that is activated by A769662. However, A769662 or resveratrol (an activator of Pgc-1α and AMPK) did not promote either mitochondrial biogenesis or CPC maturation during their differentiation. We conclude that although CPC differentiation is accompanied with an increase of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, this is not potentiated by activation of AMPK in these cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515527>Ouabain impairs cancer metabolism and activates AMPK-Src signaling pathway in human cancer cell lines.</a></h1><p>In addition to the well-known cardiotonic effects, cardiac glycosides (CGs) produce potent anticancer effects with various molecular mechanisms. We previously show that ouabain induces autophagic cell death in human lung cancer cells by regulating AMPK-mediated mTOR and Src-mediated ERK1/ signaling pathways. However, whether and how AMPK and Src signaling interacts in ouabain-treated cancer cells remains unclear. Given the pivotal role of AMPK in metabolism, whether ouabain affects cancer cell metabolism remains elusive. In this study we showed that treatment with ouabain (25 nM) caused simultaneous activation of AMPK and Src signaling pathways in human lung cancer A549 cells and human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Cotreatment with AMPK inhibitor compound C or siRNA greatly abrogates ouabain-induced Src activation, whereas cotreatment with Src inhibitor PP2 has little effect on ouabain-induced AMPK activity, suggesting that AMPK served as an upstream regulator of the Src signaling pathway. On the other hand, ouabain treatment greatly depletes ATP production in A549 and MCF7 cells, and supplement of ATP (100 μM) blocked ouabain-induced AMPK activation. We further demonstrated that ouabain greatly inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cancer cells, and exerted differential metabolic effects on  depending on cancer cell type. Taken together, this study reveals that the altered cancer cell metabolism caused by ouabain may contribute to AMPK activation, as well as its cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536301>Biochemistry, Anaerobic .</a></h1><p>Through the process of , one molecule of glucose is broken down to form two molecules of pyruvate.

Aptly named due to its dependence on oxygen as the final electron acceptor, oxidative phosphorylation cannot take place in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, as the enzymes of both the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain are within the mitochondria, cells lacking mitochondria (e.g., erythrocytes) cannot rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. In erythrocytes and oxygen-deprived tissue, pyruvate remains within the cytoplasm and converts to lactate, a process referred to as .

Blocking the glycolytic pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to impair the proliferation of tumor cells. Metformin, a widely used anti-diabetes drug, exhibits anti-tumor properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of its action linking glucose metabolism with the suppression of proliferation has not been fully clarified.Stable isotope tracing technology and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method were utilized to analyze the effect of metformin on glycolytic flux in HCC cells. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze the expression of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in HCC cells or xenograft tumor tissues. Lactate measurement and glucose uptake assay were used to analyze the level of lactate and glucose in the presence of frucose-,6-diphosphate (F2,6BP) in HCC cells treated with metformin.We found that metformin significantly impaired hepatoma cell proliferation by inhibiting the glycolytic flux via PFK1 blockade. Interestingly, activation of PFK1 by F2,6BP reverses the inhibitory effect of metformin on hepatoma cell proliferation and . Mechanistically, PFKFB3，a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, was markedly suppressed through inhibiting hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1α) accumulation mediated by metformin.Taken together these data indicate that HIF-1α/PFKFB3/PFK1 regulatory axis is a vital determinant of glucose metabolic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma, which gives new insights into the action of metformin in combatting liver cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We wanted to investigate how Hsp20 affects sporulation and production of insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs) in  (Bt) at the stationary growth phase when cells are starved. The  gene was knocked out in Bt4.0718 (wide type), which is a  strain screened in our laboratory, using endonuclease I-SceI mediated unmarked gene replacement method. Deletion of Hsp20 resulted in a decrease in both sporulation and ICPs production. Bt4-Δ cells and its ICP did not have a significant difference in shape and size but entered the decline phase  h earlier than the Bt4.0718. In order to find the mechanism that underlies these phenotypes, we completed a proteomic study of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). In Bt4-Δ cells, 11 DEPs were upregulated and 184 DEPs downregulated. These affected DEPs are involved in multiple metabolic pathways: (1) six DEPs (two upregulated and four downregulated) are directly related to the sporulation and ICPs synthesis; () supply of amino acids including amino acid synthesis and protein recycling; (3) the energy supplementation (the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ); (4) purine metabolism and mRNA stability.

This is controlled by 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), the pro-glycolytic enzyme that forms fructose-,6-bisphosphate, a powerful allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In neurons, PFKFB3 protein is physiologically inactive due to its proteasomal degradation. However, upon an excitotoxic stimuli, PFKFB3 becomes stabilized to activate , thus hampering PPP mediated protection of redox status leading to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that selective inhibition of PFKFB3 activity by the small molecule AZ67 prevents the NADPH oxidation, redox stress and apoptotic cell death caused by the activation of  triggered upon excitotoxic and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation models in mouse primary neurons. Furthermore, in vivo administration of AZ67 to mice significantly alleviated the motor discoordination and brain infarct injury in the middle carotid artery occlusion ischemia/reperfusion model. These results show that pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 is a suitable neuroprotective therapeutic strategy in excitotoxic-related disorders such as stroke.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662475>An allosteric PGAM1 inhibitor effectively suppresses pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) plays a critical role in cancer metabolism by coordinating  and biosynthesis. A well-validated PGAM1 inhibitor, however, has not been reported for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. By uncovering the elevated PGAM1 expressions were statistically related to worse prognosis of PDAC in a cohort of 50 patients, we developed a series of allosteric PGAM1 inhibitors by structure-guided optimization. The compound KH3 significantly suppressed proliferation of various PDAC cells by down-regulating the levels of  and mitochondrial respiration in correlation with PGAM1 expression. Similar to PGAM1 depletion, KH3 dramatically hampered the canonic pathways highly involved in cancer metabolism and development. Additionally, we observed the shared expression profiles of several signature pathways at 12 h after treatment in multiple PDAC primary cells of which the matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models responded similarly to KH3 in the  wk treatment. The better responses to KH3 in PDXs were associated with higher expression of PGAM1 and longer/stronger suppressions of cancer metabolic pathways. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a strategy of targeting cancer metabolism by PGAM1 inhibition in PDAC. Also, this work provided "proof of concept" for the potential application of metabolic treatment in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409279>Novel reference genes in colorectal cancer identify a distinct subset of high stage tumors and their associated histologically normal colonic tissues.</a></h1><p>Reference genes are often interchangeably called housekeeping genes due to 1) the essential cellular functions their proteins provide and ) their constitutive expression across a range of normal and pathophysiological conditions. However, given the proliferative drive of malignant cells, many reference genes such as beta-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) which play critical roles in cell membrane organization and , may be dysregulated in tumors versus their corresponding normal controls METHODS: Because Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has several advantages over hybridization-based technologies, such as independent detection and quantitation of transcription levels, greater sensitivity, and increased dynamic range, we evaluated colorectal cancers (CRC) and their histologically normal tissue counterparts by NGS to evaluate the expression of 21 "classical" reference genes used as normalization standards for PCR based methods. Seventy-nine paired tissue samples of CRC and their patient matched healthy colonic tissues were subjected to NGS analysis of their mRNAs.We affirmed that 17 out of 21 classical reference genes had upregulated expression in tumors compared to normal colonic epithelial tissue and dramatically so in some cases. Indeed, tumors were distinguished from normal controls in both unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA). We then identified 42 novel potential reference genes with minimal coefficients of variation (CV) across 79 CRC tumor pairs. Though largely consistently expressed across tumors and normal control tissues, a subset of high stage tumors (HSTs) as well as some normal tissue samples (HSNs) located adjacent to these HSTs demonstrated dysregulated expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors with a potentially distinct and aggressive biological profile.While classical CRC reference genes were found to be differentially expressed between tumors and normal controls, novel reference genes, identified via NGS, were more consistently expressed across malignant and normal colonic tissues. Nonetheless, a subset of HST had profound dysregulation of such genes as did many of the histologically normal tissues adjacent to such HSTs, indicating that the HSTs so distinguished may have unique biological properties and that their histologically normal tissues likely harbor a small population of microscopically undetected but metabolically active tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409523>Predictive and Prognostic Role of Metabolic Response in Patients With Stage III NSCLC Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive and prognostic role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in candidates with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Sixty-six patients with stage III NSCLC treated with induction chemotherapy from March 2013 to December 2017 were retrospectively identified. Response assessment were evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters were analyzed as absolute values as well as percentage changes (Δ) between  consecutive scans, for primary tumor (T) and for regional lymph nodes (N). All clinical variables and metabolic parameters were compared with treatment response and correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), based on a median follow-up of 9.4 months.Post-induction therapy standardized uptake value (SUV)max_T, SUVmean_T, metabolic tumor volume (MTV_T), and total lesion  of the tumor (TLG_T) varied significantly between responders and non-responders (6.6 vs. 13.8; P = .001; 4. vs. 8.1; P < .001; 6 vs. 17.9; P = .002; and 24.1 vs. 136.3; P < .001, respectively). Likewise, percentage changes (Δ_T) were significantly different between the  groups (P < .001). Along with primary tumor, also post-SUVmax_N, post-SUVmean_N, and post-TLG_N (P = .024, P = .015, and P = .024, respectively), as well as all percentage changes (Δ_N) were different between responders and non-responders. RECIST 1.1 and EORTC response classifications were discordant in 27 patients (40.9%; κ = 0.265; P = .003). On multivariate analysis, post-TLG_N was an independent predictor for both PFS and OS, whereas RECIST 1.1 was a predictor only for OS.Several metabolic parameters may differentiate responders from non-responders following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage III NSCLC. As compared with RECIST 1.1, EORTC seems to be more appropriate for evaluation therapeutic response. Finally, post-TLG_N has significant prognostic information.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite over a century of research, aspirin/SA's mechanism(s) of action is still only partially understood. Here we report the results of a genome-wide, high-throughput screen to identify potential SA-binding proteins (SABPs) in human HEK293 cells. Following photo-affinity crosslinking to 4-azidoSA and immuno-selection with an anti-SA antibody, approximately ,000 proteins were identified. Among these, 95 were enriched more than 10-fold. Pathway enrichment analysis with these 95 candidate SABPs (cSABPs) revealed possible involvement of SA in multiple biological pathways, including (i) , (ii) cytoskeletal assembly and/or signaling, and (iii) NF-κB-mediated immune signaling. The two most enriched cSABPs, which corresponded to the glycolytic enzymes alpha-enolase (ENO1) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), were assessed for their ability to bind SA and SA's more potent derivative amorfrutin B1 (amoB1). SA and amoB1 bound recombinant ENO1 and PKM2 at low millimolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively, and inhibited their enzymatic activities in vitro. Consistent with these results, low millimolar concentrations of SA suppressed glycolytic activity in HEK293 cells. To provide insights into how SA might affect various human diseases, a cSABP-human disorder/disease network map was also generated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647966>PM2.5 disturbs the balance of Th17/T cells by targeting Got1 and HIF-1α in an asthma model.</a></h1><p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to particulate matter ≤.5 μm (PM2.5) aggravates asthma.Investigate the underlying mechanisms between PM2.5 exposure and asthma severity.The relationship between PM2.5 exposure and asthma severity was investigated in an asthma model with CD4 T cell-specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) null mice. Effects of PM2.5 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on differentiation of T-helper 17/T-regulatory (Th17/T) cells were investigated by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mechanisms were investigated by mRNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, bisulfite sequencing and  rates.PM2.5 impaired differentiation of T cells, promoted differentiation of Th17 cells, and aggravated asthma in an AhR-dependent manner. PM2.5 and one of its prominent PAHs, indeno[1,,3-cd]pyrene (IP), promoted differentiation of Th17 cells by up-regulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression and enhancing  via AhRs. Exposure to PM2.5 and IP enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (Got)1 expression via AhRs and accumulation of R--hydroxyglutarate, which inhibited ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase- activity, resulting in hypermethylation in the forkhead box p3 locus and impaired differentiation of T cells. A Got1 inhibitor, (aminooxy)acetic acid, ameliorated asthma by shifting differentiation of Th17 cells to T cells. Similar regulatory effects of exposure to PM2.5 or IP on Th17/T imbalance were noted in human T cells and, in a case-control design, PAH exposure appeared to be a potential risk factor for asthma.The molecular pathways AhR-HIF-1α and AhR-Got1 mediate pulmonary responses upon exposure to PM2.5 through their ability to disturb the balance of Th17/T cells.Copyright © 2019.

It has been reported that ubiquitination may be important in the regulation of ChREBP protein levels and activities. However, the ChREBP-specific E3 ligase and molecular mechanism of ChREBP ubiquitination remains unclear. Using database exploration and expression analysis, we found here that levels of the E3 ligase SMURF2 (Smad-ubiquitination regulatory factor ) negatively correlate with those of ChREBP in cancer tissues and cell lines. We observed that SMURF2 interacts with ChREBP and promotes ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway. Interestingly, ectopic SMURF2 expression not only decreased ChREBP levels but also reduced aerobic , increased oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, SMURF2 knockdown increased aerobic , decreased oxygen consumption, and enhanced cell proliferation in these cells, mostly because of increased ChREBP accumulation. Furthermore, we identified Ser/Thr kinase AKT as an upstream suppressor of SMURF2 that protects ChREBP from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Taken together, our results indicate that SMURF2 reduces aerobic  and cell proliferation by promoting ChREBP ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway in colorectal cancer cells. We conclude that the SMURF2-ChREBP interaction might represent a potential target for managing colorectal cancer.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413633>Prognostic values of baseline, interim and end-of therapy F-FDG PET/CT in patients with follicular lymphoma.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baseline, interim and end-of treatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in assessing the prognosis of follicular lymphoma (FL).A total of 84 FL patients were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Baseline (n=59), interim (n=24, after -4 cycles) and end-of treatment (n=43) PET/CT images were re-evaluated, and baseline maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), total metabolic tumor volume (tMTV) and total lesion  (TLG) were recorded. Interim (I-PET) and end-of treatment (E-PET) PET/CT responses were interpreted by Deauville five-point scale (D-5PS) and International Harmonization Project criteria (IHP). Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between groups were compared by log-rank test.The -year progression-free survival (PFS) of the high- and low-TLG groups was 57.14% and 95.56%, respectively (=0.0001). The -year overall survival (OS) of the high- and low-TLG groups was 62.50% and 100%, respectively (<0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that TLG was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (=0.001, HR=6.577, 95% CI=.167-19.960) and OS (=0.030, HR=19.291, 95% CI =.689-137.947).

Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was used to analyze the correlation of PET parameters cutoff values with deep myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space involvement and LNM for prognostic values in risk stratification.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for detection of LNM are 83.3%, 99.7%, 90.9%, 99.5% and 99.%, respectively. The MTV and TLG of primary lesion of EC in the patients with LNM are notably higher than those in patients without LNM, p<0.010. The MTV and TLG of the EC primary lesions in high-risk patients are significantly higher than those in low-risk patients (p<0.010), but the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) is not. The MTV and TLG of primary lesions were superior to SUVmax for predicting of deep MI, LNM and high-risk of EC (p<0.005).MTV and TLG of primary lesions are more valuable in predicting risk stratification of EC patients.

Promptly surgical correction by orchiopexy is the only way to avoid infertility and no effective treatment for restoration of spermatogenesis. We previously reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), through local injection upon testicular torsion-detorsion, restored the spermatogenesis without differentiation into sperm. In this study, molecular mechanisms of MSCs in regulating germ cell activity induced by testicular torsion-detorsion were investigated.Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats 6-8 weeks old received left testis 720° torsion for 3 h followed by detorsion with or without MSCs. Right inguinal skin incision without testicular torsion served as control. MSCs with 3 × 10 cells were locally injected into left testis 30 min before detorsion. Three days after the surgery, orchiectomy was executed and the testis, epididymis, and sperm were separated to each other. Functional assessments on sperm included counting sperm amount and sperm motility, staining F-actin, and quantifying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. The hallmarks of glycogenesis and  in each tissue segment were measured by Western blot.Testicular torsion-detorsion significantly decreased the amount of sperm, inhibited the motility, declined the F-actin expression, and reduced the content of ATP in sperm. Local injection of MSCs improved sperm function, particularly in sperm motility. With MSCs, ATP content and F-actin were preserved after testicular torsion-detorsion. MSCs significantly reversed the imbalance of  in sperm and testis induced by testicular torsion-detorsion, as evidenced by increasing the expression of phosphoglycerate kinase  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-spermatogenic, activating Akt, and increasing glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which led to the increase in  cascades and ATP production. Human stem cell factor contributed the activation of Akt/GSK3 axis when sperm suffered from testicular torsion-detorsion-induced germ cell injury.Local injection of MSCs into a testis damaged by testicular torsion-detorsion restores sperm function mainly through the improvement of sperm motility and energy. MSCs reversed the imbalance of glycogenesis and  in sperm by regulating Akt/GSK3 axis. Thus, MSCs may potentially rescue torsion-detorsion-induced infertility via local injection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546785>Regulation of Ketogenic Enzyme HMGCS2 by Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ Pathway in Intestinal Cells.</a></h1><p>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a crucial role in development and renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase  (HMGCS2), a rate-limiting ketogenic enzyme in the synthesis of ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), contributes to the regulation of intestinal cell differentiation. Here, we have shown that HMGCS2 is a novel target of Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling in intestinal epithelial cancer cell lines and normal intestinal organoids. Inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway resulted in increased protein and mRNA expression of HMGCS2 and βHB production in human colon cancer cell lines LS174T and Caco2. In addition, Wnt inhibition increased expression of PPARγ and its target genes,  and , in these cells. Conversely, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling decreased protein and mRNA levels of HMGCS2, βHB production, and expression of PPARγ and its target genes in LS174T and Caco2 cells and mouse intestinal organoids. Moreover, inhibition of PPARγ reduced HMGCS2 expression and βHB production, while activation of PPARγ increased HMGCS2 expression and βHB synthesis. Furthermore, PPARγ bound the promoter of HMGCS2 and this binding was enhanced by β-catenin knockdown. Finally, we showed that HMGCS2 inhibited, while Wnt/β-catenin stimulated, , which contributed to regulation of intestinal cell differentiation. Our results identified HMGCS2 as a downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling regulates intestinal cell differentiation, at least in part, through regulation of ketogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572179>Effects of Tianshu Capsule on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats as Revealed by H-NMR-Based Metabolic Profiling.</a></h1><p>Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, resulting in serious complications such as cardiovascular damage and chronic kidney disease. Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to , and perturb the levels of a series of amino acids (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and pathways. Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to metabolic biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537380>Metabolomic analysis revealed mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant choline metabolism in MPP-exposed SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h1><p>1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells have been generally accepted as a cellular model for Parkinson's disease. To understand comprehensive metabolic disturbances in this model, both cell lysates and culture supernatants were subjected to metabolomic analysis. As expected from the fact that MPP inhibits mitochondrial complex I, a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to  was indicated by an increase in extracellular lactic acid and a parallel depletion of pyruvic acid. In cell lysates, the metabolic shift was supported by consistent decreases in TCA cycle intermediates. Metabolomic analysis also revealed aberrant choline metabolism. Choline in the culture supernatant was elevated 8.5- and 17-fold by 30 and 300 μM MPP exposure, respectively; therefore, extracellular choline might be a metabolic biomarker for Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Potential mechanisms of CI-AKI may involve diminished renal hemodynamics, inflammatory responses, and direct cytotoxicity. The hypothesis for this study is that diatrizoic acid (DA) induces direct cytotoxicity to human proximal tubule (HK-) cells via calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. HK- cells were exposed to 0-30 mg I/mL DA or vehicle for -24 h. Conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and trypan blue exclusion indicated a decrease in mitochondrial and cell viability within  and 24 h, respectively. Mitochondrial dysfunction was apparent within 8 h post exposure to 15 mg I/mL DA as shown by Seahorse XF cell mito and  Stress tests. Mitophagy was increased at 8 h by 15 mg I/mL DA as confirmed by elevated LC3BII/I expression ratio. HK- cells pretreated with calcium level modulators BAPTA-AM, EGTA, or -aminophenyl borinate abrogated DA-induced mitochondrial damage. DA increased oxidative stress biomarkers of protein carbonylation and 4-hydroxynonenol (4HNE) adduct formation. Caspase 3 and 12 activation was induced by DA compared to vehicle at 24 h.

Tumor weight and body weight were calculated. experiments demonstrated that high dose VC significantly inhibited cell proliferation in Bcap37 and MDA-MB-453 cells (all <0.01); the expressions of Glut1 and mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins were decreased (all <0.05); and the secretion of lactic acid was also markedly reduced (all <0.05).  experiment showed that the tumor weight was decreased in mice treated with high-dose VC as compared with control group (<0.05), but no difference in body weights between two groups was observed.High dose VC may inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells both  and  through reducing  and protein synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655344>Culm transcriptome sequencing of Badila (Saccharum officinarum L.) and analysis of major genes involved in sucrose accumulation.</a></h1><p>Sugarcane is an important sugar and energy crop worldwide. It utilises highly efficient C4 photosynthesis and accumulates sucrose in its culms. The sucrose content in sugarcane culms is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The regulatory mechanism underlying the maximum sucrose level in sugarcane culms remains unclear. We used transcriptome sequences to identify the potential regulatory genes involved in sucrose accumulation in Saccarum officinarum L. cv. Badila. The sucrose accumulating internodes at the elongation and mature growth stage and the immature internodes with low sucrose content at the mature stage were used for RNA sequencing. The obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to sucrose accumulation were analysed. Results showed that the transcripts encoding invertase (beta-fructofuranosidase, EC: 3..1.26) which catalyses sucrose hydrolysis and 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK, EC: .7.1.11), a key  regulatory enzyme, were downregulated in the high sucrose accumulation internodes. The transcripts encoding key enzymes for ABA, gibberellin and ethylene synthesis were also downregulated during sucrose accumulation. Furthermore, regulated protein kinase, transcription factor and sugar transporter genes were also obtained. This research can clarify the molecular regulation network of sucrose accumulation in sugarcane.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty acid oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of , was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty acid oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466915>Dysregulated miR-125a promotes angiogenesis through enhanced .</a></h1><p>Although neoangiogenesis is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory arthritis and many cancers, therapeutic agents targeting the vasculature remain elusive. Here we identified miR-125a as an important regulator of angiogenesis.MiRNA levels were quantified in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) synovial-tissue by RT-PCR and compared to macroscopic synovial vascularity. HMVEC were transfected with anti-miR-125a and angiogenic mechanisms quantified using tube formation assays, transwell invasion chambers, wound repair, RT-PCR and western blot. Real-time analysis of EC metabolism was assessed using the XF-24 Extracellular-Flux Analyzer. Synovial expression of metabolic markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining. MiR-125a CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-out zebrafish were generated and vascular development assessed. Finally, glycolytic blockade using 3PO, which inhibits Phosphofructokinase-fructose-,6-bisphophatase 3 (PFKFB3), was assessed in miR-125a-/- ECs and zebrafish embryos.MiR-125a is significantly decreased in PsA synovium and inversely associated with macroscopic vascularity. In-vivo, CRISPR/cas9 miR-125a zebrafish displayed a hyper-branching phenotype. In-vitro, miR-125a inhibition promoted EC tube formation, branching, migration and invasion, effects paralleled by a shift in their metabolic profile towards . This metabolic shift was also observed in the PsA synovial vasculature where increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), PFKFB3 and Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) were demonstrated. Finally, blockade of PFKFB3 significantly inhibited anti-miR-125a-induced angiogenic mechanisms in-vitro, paralleled by normalisation of vascular development of CRISPR/cas9 miR-125a zebrafish embryos.Our results provide evidence that miR-125a deficiency enhances angiogenic processes through metabolic reprogramming of endothelial cells.

Molecular characterization now plays a pivotal role, and IDH mutations are key characteristics and the subject of active debate. IDH-mutant tumors produce the 'onco-metabolite', -hydroxyglutarate. Metabolic changes have become central to the understanding of tumor biology, and tumors display a fundamental metabolic change called the Warburg Effect. The Warburg Effect represents a preference for , as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation. The present review details the clinical context and discusses clinical and preclinical metabolic imaging tools to characterize the Warburg Effect.A clinical Warburg Index is proposed, defined as the lactate concentration measured by H-MRSI over the SUV measured by FDG-PET, to measure the Warburg Effect. A preclinical technique called deuterium metabolic imaging has successfully imaged the Warburg Effect in vivo in glioblastoma.Metabolic imaging provides an opportunity to measure the Warburg Effect and other metabolic changes in brain tumors. An increased understanding of metabolic shifts integral to brain cancer has the potential to address multiple contemporary debates on glioma pathophysiology and treatment. Metabolic imaging tools thus have the potential to advance research findings, clinical trial development, and clinical care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545464>PTEN/AKT signaling mediates chemoresistance in refractory acute myeloid leukemia through enhanced .</a></h1><p>Primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and early recurrence of leukemic cells are among the most difficult hurdles to overcome in the treatment of AML. Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the molecular mechanism underlying refractory AML pose a challenge when it comes to developing novel therapeutic drugs. However, accumulating evidence suggests a contribution of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to the development of refractory AML. To assess PTEN/AKT signaling in AML, two types of AML cell lines were evaluated, namely control HL60 cells and KG1α cells, a refractory AML cell line that is resistant to idarubicin and cytarabine (AraC) treatment. Changes in the expression level of ‑ and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation‑related genes and proteins were evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The mitochondrial oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using an XF24 analyzer. CCK8 assay and Annexin V/PI staining were used to analyze cell viability and cellular apoptosis, respectively. The PTEN protein was found to be depleted, whereas AKT phosphorylation levels were elevated in KG1α cells compared with HL60 cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and hexokinase , and increased lactate production. AKT inhibition decreased the proliferation of KG1α cells and decreased extracellular acidification without affecting HL60 cells. Notably, AKT inhibition increased the susceptibility of KG1α cells to chemotherapy with idarubicin and AraC. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that activation of AKT by PTEN deficiency sustains the refractory AML status through enhancement of  and mitochondrial respiration, effects that may be rescued by inhibiting AKT activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554233>Vacuolar H-ATPase Subunit V0C Regulates Aerobic  of Esophageal Cancer Cells via PKM2 Signaling.</a></h1><p>The vacuolar H-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit V0C (ATP6V0C), a proton-conducting, pore-forming subunit of vacuolar ATPase, maintains pH homeostasis and induces organelle acidification. The intracellular and extracellular pH of cancer cells affects their growth; however, the role of ATP6V0C in highly invasive esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ATP6V0C in glucose metabolism in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion attenuated ECC proliferation, invasion, and suppressed glucose metabolism, as indicated by reduced glucose uptake and decreased lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cells. Consistent with this, expression of glycolytic enzyme and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were also decreased by ATP6V0C knockdown. Mechanistically, ATP6V0C interacted with pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a key regulator of  in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion reduced PKM2 phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 105 (Tyr), leading to inhibition of nuclear translocation of PKM2. In addition, ATP6V0C was recruited at hypoxia response element (HRE) sites in the lactate dehydrogenase A () gene for . Thus, our data suggest that ATP6V0C enhances aerobic  and motility in ECCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435020>Skp2-mediated ubiquitination and mitochondrial localization of Akt drive tumor growth and chemoresistance to cisplatin.</a></h1><p>The E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein (Skp2) is overexpressed in human cancers and correlated with poor prognosis, but its contributions to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are not evident. Herein we show that Skp2 is highly expressed in NPC tumor tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of Skp2 suppresses tumor cell growth, colony formation, , and in vivo tumor growth. Skp2 promotes Akt K63-mediated ubiquitination and activation, which is required for EGF-induced Akt mitochondrial localization. Importantly, K63-linked ubiquitination enhances the interaction between Akt and HK2 and eventually increases HK2 phosphorylation on Thr473 and mitochondrial localization. Overexpression of Skp2 impaired the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and confers cisplatin resistance. Moreover, ectopic expression of Myr-Akt1 or phosphomimetic HK2-T473D rescued cisplatin-induced tumor suppression in Skp2 knockdown stable cells. Also, depletion of Akt ubiquitination enhances the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that Skp2 is positively correlated with p-Akt and HK2 in NPC tumor tissues. This study highlights the clinical value of Skp2 targeting in NPC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572169>Developmental Aspects of Glucose and Calcium Availability on the Persistence of Memory Function Over the Lifespan.</a></h1><p>An important aspect concerning the underlying nature of memory function is an understanding of how memories are acquired and lost. The stability, and ultimate demise, of memory over the lifespan of an organism remains a critical topic in determining the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate memory representations. This has important implications for the elucidation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). One important question in the context of preserving functional plasticity over the lifespan is the determination of the neurobiological structural and functional changes that contribute to the formation of memory during the juvenile time frame that might provide protection against later memory dysfunction by promoting the establishment of redundant neural pathways. The main question being, if memory formation during the juvenile period does strengthen and preserve memory stability over the lifespan, what are the neurobiological structural or functional substrates that mediate this effect? One neural attribute whose function may be altered with early life experience and provide a mechanism to preserve memory through the lifespan is glucose transport-linked calcium (Ca) buffering. Because peak increases in glucose utilization overlap with a timeframe during which spatial training can enhance later memory processing, it might be the case that learning-associated changes in glucose utilization would provide an important neural functional change to preserve memory function throughout the lifespan. The glucose transporters are proteins that are reduced in AD pathology and there is evidence that glucose reductions can impair Ca buffering. In the absence of an appropriate supply of ATP, provided via glucose transport and , Ca levels can rise leading to neural vulnerability with ensuing pathological outcomes. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that enhancing glucose utilization with spatial training during the preadolescent period will provide a functional enhancement that regulates glucose-dependent Ca signaling during aging or neurodegeneration and provide essential neural resources to preserve functional plasticity and memory function.Copyright © 2019 Holahan, Tzakis and Oliveira.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668836>A high energy phosphate jump - From pyrophospho-inositol to pyrophospho-serine.</a></h1><p>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) are a class of energy rich metabolites present in all eukaryotic cells. The hydroxyl groups on these water soluble derivatives of inositol are substituted with diphosphate and monophosphate moieties. Since the discovery of PP-IPs in the early 1990s, enormous progress has been made in uncovering pleiotropic roles for these small molecules in cellular physiology. PP-IPs exert their effect on proteins in two ways - allosteric regulation by direct binding, or post-translational regulation by serine pyrophosphorylation, a modification unique to PP-IPs. Serine pyrophosphorylation is achieved by Mg-dependent, but enzyme independent transfer of a β-phosphate from a PP-IP to a pre-phosphorylated serine residue located in an acidic motif, within an intrinsically disordered protein sequence. This distinctive post-translational modification has been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes, including rRNA synthesis, , and vesicle transport. However, our understanding of the molecular details of this phosphotransfer from pyrophospho-inositol to generate pyrophospho-serine, is still nascent. This review discusses our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, and recent advances in understanding the mechanism of this important yet overlooked post-translational modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to enlarge our knowledge about the role of mitochondria in cardiac toxicity of sunitinib in vitro and in vivo. For this reason, we studied the toxicity of sunitinib on cardiac H9c2 cells exposed for 24 h, permeabilized rat cardiac fibers exposed for 15 min and in mice treated orally with sunitinib for  weeks (7.5 mg/kg/day). In H9c2 cells exposed for 24 h, sunitinib was more cytotoxic under galactose (favoring mitochondrial metabolism) compared to glucose conditions (favoring ). Sunitinib dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential starting at 10 μM under glucose and at 5 μM under galactose conditions. Sunitinib reduced activities of mitochondrial enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC), increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation and decreased the cellular GSH pool. Electron microscopy revealed swollen mitochondria with loss of cristae. Accordingly, sunitinib caused caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation in H9c2 cells. Co-exposure with mito-TEMPO (mitochondrial-specific ROS scavenger) for 24 h prevented ATP and GSH depletion, as well as the increases in HO and caspase 3/7 activity observed with sunitinib. In mice, treatment with sunitinib for two weeks increased plasma concentrations of troponin I and creatine kinase MB, indicating cardiomyocyte damage. The activity of enzyme complexes of the ETCwas decreased, mitochondrial ROS were increased and cleavage of caspase 3 was increased, suggesting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, mitochondrial damage with ROS accumulation appears to be an important mechanism of cardiotoxicity associated with sunitinib, eventually leading to apoptotic cell death.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Other Francisella species are known but less is understood about their virulence factors. The role of environmental amoebae in the life-cycle of Francisella is still under discussion. Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 (F-W12) is an environmental Francisella isolate recently identified in Germany which is negative for the Francisella pathogenicity island, but exhibits a putative alternative type VI secretion system. Putative virulence factors have been identified in silico in the genome of F-W12. In this work, we established a "scatter screen", used earlier for pathogenic Legionella, to verify experimentally and identify candidate fitness factors using a transposon mutant bank of F-W12 and Acanthamoeba lenticulata as host organism. In these experiments, we identified 79 scatter clones (amoeba sensitive), which were further analyzed by an infection assay identifying 9 known virulence factors, but also candidate fitness factors of F-W12 not yet described as fitness factors in Francisella. The majority of the identified genes encoded proteins involved in the synthesis or maintenance of the cell envelope (LPS, outer membrane, capsule) or in the metabolism (, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway). Further C-flux analysis of the Tn5 glucokinase mutant strain revealed that the identified gene indeed encodes the sole active glucokinase in F-W12. In conclusion, candidate fitness factors of the new Francisella species F-W12 were identified using the scatter screen method which might also be usable for other Francisella species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) could regulate such metabolic reprogramming. Our microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR validation revealed that miR-885-5p was strongly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. To investigate miR-885-5p's biological functions in HCC progression, malignant phenotypes were analyzed in different types of hypoxic model and indicated that overexpression of miR-885-5p significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Subsequent investigations of whether miR-885-5p regulated the glycometabolic activity of cancer cells demonstrated that forced expression of miR-885-5p in SMMC-7721 cells significantly reduced glucose uptake and lactate production by repressing several key enzymes related to . Particularly, miR-885-5p directly targets the 3' UTR of hexokinase  (HK2), which is a key enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible first step of  and associates with poor patient outcomes. The miR-885-5p/HK2 axis strongly links aerobic  to carcinogenesis and may become a promising therapeutic target and prognostic predictor for HCC patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A thermodynamic analysis of the bifurcating, [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, using electron path-independent variables, quantified potential biological roles of the reaction without requiring enzyme details. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction, like all bifurcating reactions, can be written as a sum of two non-bifurcating reactions. Therefore, the thermodynamic properties of the bifurcating reaction can never exceed the properties of the individual, non-bifurcating, reactions. The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction has three competitive properties: 1) enabling NAD(P)H-driven proton reduction at pH higher than the concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions, ) oxidation of NAD(P)H and ferredoxin simultaneously in a 1:1 ratio, both are produced during typical glucose fermentations, and 3) enhanced energy conservation (~10 kJ mol H) relative to concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions. Our analysis demonstrated ferredoxin E°' largely determines the sensitivity of the bifurcating reaction to pH, modulation of the reduced/oxidized electron carrier ratios contributed less to equilibria shifts. Hydrogenase thermodynamics data were integrated with typical and non-typical  pathways to evaluate achieving the 'Thauer limit' (4 H per glucose) as a function of temperature and pH. For instance, the bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction permits the Thauer limit at 60 °C if pH  ≤ ~10 mbar. The results also predict Archaea, expressing a non-typical  pathway, would not benefit from a bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction; interestingly, no Archaea have been observed experimentally with a [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme.Copyright © 2019.

Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino acids transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler ,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482306>Independent expression of circulating and tissue levels of PD-L1: correlation of clusters with tumor metabolism and outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the clinical-pathological and prognostic significance of the circulating PD-L1 level in patients with surgically treated NSCLC, by combining data for PD-L1 expression with other immune-related markers and tumor metabolism.Overall, 40 patients with resected NSCLC (stage Ia-IIIa) who had preoperative blood storage and underwent staging PET/CT were enrolled for the study. In all cases, we determined plasma levels of PD-L1 (pg/ml), immune-reactive areas (IRA %) covered by CD3, CD68, CD20, CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 in the tumor specimen, and metabolic parameters on PET, i.e., SUV, SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG). Variables were statistically analyzed to establish their association with disease-free survival (DFS).The circulating levels of PD-L1 in the bloodstream could be determined in 38/40 (95%) samples. The mean and median expression levels were 34.86 pg/ml and 24.83 pg/ml, respectively. We did not find any statistically significant correlation between circulating PD-L1 and tissue expression of PD-L1/PD-1. Some mild degree of positive correlation was determined between tissue PD-L1 and SUV (ρ = 0.390; p = 0.0148).

Many advanced cancers are characterized by glucose dependency, leading to oxidative stress and cellular proliferation. Therefore, we sought to determine if a low glucose environment (in vitro) or a ketogenic diet (in vivo) could inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer tumor growth when combined with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.In vivo, nude mice were injected with the anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line 8505C (n = 6/group). Group 1 was fed a standard diet; Group  was fed a ketogenic diet; Group 3 was given standard diet with N-acetylcysteine (40 mM in the drinking water); and Group 4 was fed ketogenic diet with N-acetylcysteine. Tumor volumes, ketones, and glucose were measured. H&E stains and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and Caspase 3 were performed on the tumors. In vitro, 8505C cells were cultured in high glucose (25 mM), low glucose (3 mM), high glucose plus N-acetylcysteine (200 uM), or low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine for 96 hours. We performed CyQUANT proliferation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Seahorse glycolytic stress (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and reactive oxidative stress assays.Ketogenic diet plus N-acetylcysteine decreased in vivo tumor volume compared to standard diet (22.5 ± 12.4 mm vs 147 ± 54.4 mm, P < .05) and standard diet plus N-acetylcysteine (P < .05). Blood ketone levels were significantly higher for the mice in the ketogenic diet group compared to standard diet (1.74 mmol/L vs 0.38 mmol/L at week 5, P < .001). However, blood glucose levels were not significantly different between ketogenic diet and standard diet groups. Cells cultured in low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine had significantly reduced proliferation compared to high glucose (98.1 ± 5.0 relative fluorescence units vs 157.8 ± .1 relative fluorescence units, P < .001). Addition of N-acetylcysteine to low glucose lowered  function compared to high glucose (39.0 ± . mpH/min/cell vs 89.1 ± 13. mpH/min/cell, P < .001) and high glucose plus N-acetylcysteine (37.4 ± .5 mpH/min/cell vs 70.3 ± 3.3 mpH/min/cell, P < .001). Low glucose plus N-acetylcysteine decreased reactive oxidative stress compared to high glucose (119 ± 34.7 relative fluorescence units vs 277 ± 16.0 relative fluorescence units, P = .014).The combination of a ketogenic diet or glucose restriction with the antioxidant- N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo and in vitro.

The storage time under these conditions may have an impact on platelets and their releasate leading to potential adverse reactions following transfusion to patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the proteome of extracellular vesicles generated by platelets at different storage days ( and 7) to gain deeper information on the platelet concentrates state at those moments. EVs were isolated by a centrifugation-based approach and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Proteomic analysis was by LC-MS/MS and quantification by SWATH. In this way, 151 proteins were found up-regulated at day 7 of storage. This group includes CCL5 and Platelet Factor 4, chemokines with power to attract neutrophils and monocytes, which could generate transfusion adverse reactions. In addition, other glycoproteins and platelet activation markers were also found elevated at day 7. Proteins related to  and lactate production were found altered with high fold changes, showing a deregulation of platelet metabolism at day 7. The obtained results provide novel information about possible effects of platelet-derived EVs on transfusion adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE: We performed the first proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles derived from platelets upon storage at different time points on blood bank conditions after Mirasol® treatment.

Here, the effect of BHA on astaxanthin and lipid accumulation and physiological and metabolomic profiles was investigated. These results suggested that astaxanthin content was increased by .17-fold compared to the control. The lipid content was enhanced by 1.22-fold. BHA treatment simultaneously reduced carbohydrates and protein and delayed the decay of chlorophyll. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis demonstrated that BHA upregulated and activated the bioprocesses involved in cellular basal metabolism and signalling systems, such as , the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and the phosphatidylinositol signalling system, thus enhancing astaxanthin and lipid accumulation. Altogether, this research shows the dramatic effects of BHA on algal metabolism in the regulation of key metabolic nodes and provides novel insights into microalgal regulation and metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Overexpression of Glo-I has been linked to multi-drug resistance in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to analyze Glo-I in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the effect of the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib on Glo-I.  Expression and specific activity of Glo-I was measured in human HCC samples, HCC-cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) and a hepatocyte cell line (AML 12). Cells were either treated with Glo-I inhibitors, ethyl pyruvate (EP, 1-20 mM) and BrBzGSHCp2 (1-10 μM), or sorafenib (.5-10 μM) and protein expression (Western Blot), proliferation (WST-assay), migration (scratch assay), and colony formation (clonogenic assay) were assessed.  High expression of Glo-I was detected in human HCC tissue samples. Huh7 showed highest expression and activity of Glo-I and revealed highest proliferation compared to AML 12 and HepG2. Targeting Glo-I by EP or BrBzGSHCp led to significantly reduced proliferation (20 mM EP 24 h: 57 ± 12%), migration and colony formation. Glo-I inhibition by 20 mM EP resulted in reduced expression of PDGFR-β (18 ± 10%), VEGFR2 (46 ± 11%), VEGF (61 ± 10%), pERK/ERK (62 ± 6%), NF-κB (44 ± 12%) as well as stimulation of Nrf2 (243 ± 36%). Similar results were seen with BrBzGSHCp2. Sorafenib treatment revealed elevation of Glo-I (10 μM: 209 ± 25%) and MGO. Co-treatment of EP and sorafenib led to an additional reduction of proliferation compared to sorafenib alone.  Glo-I is positively correlated with HCC proliferation. Inhibition of Glo-I reduced proliferation, migration, and colony formation. In turn, sorafenib increases Glo-I. Co-treatment using Glo-I inhibitors could enhance susceptibility of HCC to sorafenib.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573512>Adaptation to mutational inactivation of an essential gene converges to an accessible suboptimal fitness peak.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms of adaptation to inactivation of essential genes remain unknown. Here we inactivate  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by introducing D27G,N,F chromosomal mutations in a key catalytic residue with subsequent adaptation by an automated serial transfer protocol. The partial reversal G27->C occurred in three evolutionary trajectories. Conversely, in one trajectory for D27G and in all trajectories for D27F,N strains adapted to grow at very low metabolic supplement (folAmix) concentrations but did not escape entirely from supplement auxotrophy. Major global shifts in metabolome and proteome occurred upon DHFR inactivation, which were partially reversed in adapted strains. Loss-of-function mutations in two genes,  and , ensured adaptation to low folAmix by rerouting the -Deoxy-D-ribose-phosphate metabolism from  towards synthesis of dTMP. Multiple evolutionary pathways of adaptation converged to a suboptimal solution due to the high accessibility to loss-of-function mutations that block the path to the highest, yet least accessible, fitness peak.© 2019, Rodrigues & Shakhnovich.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612140>-Deoxyglucose and Newcastle Disease Virus Synergize to Kill Breast Cancer Cells by Inhibition of  Pathway Through Glyceraldehyde3-Phosphate Downregulation.</a></h1><p>Targeting cancer cells metabolism is promising strategy in inhibiting cancer cells progression that are known to exhibit increased aerobic . We used the glucose analog -Deoxyglucose (-DG) as a competitor molecule of glucose. To further enhance the effectiveness of -DG, the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was used as a combination virotherapy to enhance the anti-tumor effect. Human and mouse-breast cancer cells were treated by NDV and/or -DG. The effect was analyzed by study cell viability, apoptosis and level of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate (GAPDH) by ELISA and QPCR assays. Synergistic cytotoxicity was found after a 72-h treatment of human- and mouse-breast cancer cells with -DG in combination with NDV at different concentrations. The synergistic cytotoxicity was accompanied by apoptotic cell death and GAPDH downregulation and inhibition to  product pyruvate. The combination treatment showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared to single treatments . Our results suggest the effectiveness of a novel strategy for anti-breast cancer therapy through  inhibition and GAPDH downregulation.Copyright © 2019 Al-Shammari, Abdullah, Allami and Yaseen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433692>Effective glucose metabolism maintains low intracellular glucose in airway epithelial cells after exposure to hyperglycaemia.</a></h1><p>The airway epithelium maintains differential glucose concentrations between the airway surface liquid (ASL, ~0.4mM) and the blood/interstitium (5-6mM) which is important for defence against infection. Glucose primarily moves from the blood to the ASL via paracellular movement, down its concentration gradient, across the tight junctions. However, there is evidence that glucose can move transcellularly across epithelial cells. Using a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor for glucose, we investigated intracellular glucose concentrations in airway epithelial cells and the role of hexokinases in regulating intracellular glucose concentrations in normo- and hyperglycaemic conditions. Our findings indicated that in airway epithelial cells (H441 or primary human epithelial cells HBEC) exposed to 5mM glucose (normoglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration is in the mM range. Inhibition of facilitative glucose transport (GLUT) with Cytochalasin B reduced intracellular glucose concentration. When cells were exposed to 15mM glucose (hyperglycaemia), intracellular glucose concentration reduced. Airway cells expressed hexokinases 1,  and 3. Inhibition with 3-bromopyruvate decreased hexokinase activity by ~25% and elevated intracellular glucose concentration but levels remained in the mM range. Exposure to hyperglycaemia increased , glycogen and sorbitol. Thus, glucose enters the airway cell via GLUT transporters and is then rapidly processed by hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent metabolic pathways to maintain low intracellular glucose concentrations. We propose this prevents transcellular transport, aids the removal of glucose from the ASL and that the main route of entry for glucose into the ASL is via the paracellular pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428701>Compression-induced expression of  genes in CAFs correlates with EMT and angiogenesis gene expression in breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Tumor growth increases compressive stress within a tissue, which is associated with solid tumor progression. However, very little is known about how compressive stress contributes to tumor progression. Here, we show that compressive stress induces  in human breast cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) cells and thereby contributes to the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)- and angiogenesis-related genes in breast cancer cells. Lactate production was increased in compressed CAF cells, in a manner dependent on the expression of metabolic genes , , and . Conditioned medium from compressed CAFs promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells and the expression of EMT and/or angiogenesis-related genes. In patient tissues with high compressive stress, the expression of compression-induced metabolic genes was significantly and positively correlated with EMT and/or angiogenesis-related gene expression and metastasis size.

This fungus possesses the cyanide (CN)-insensitive respiration pathway consisting of alternative oxidase (EC 1.10.3.11; AOX), in addition to the cytochrome pathway. Since this CN-insensitive respiration pathway reoxidizes NADH without ATP production, it contributes to continuous  in A. niger. In this study, to show the availability of aoxA gene encoding AOX as a tool for metabolic engineering, we generated efficient oxalic acid (OA)-producers by genetic engineering of A. niger using aoxA gene. The OA-producing strain EOAH-1, generated by overexpression of the oxaloacetate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.1; OAH) gene oahA in A. niger WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA from 30 g/L glucose during the 9-day cultivation period. Moreover, the strain EAOXOAH-1, generated by overexpression of both aoxA and oahA genes in strain WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA during the 7-day cultivation period. Strain EAOXOAH-1 showed higher glucose consumption rate than EOAH-1 did, indicating that overexpression of aoxA contributed to the acceleration of glucose consumption, and that the OA production period was shortened by  days. Thus, we clearly show that AOX gene must be an effective tool in metabolic engineering for efficient organic acids production from carbohydrates.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The present study revealed that the expression of miR‑185 was downregulated in OS tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR‑185 significantly suppressed the proliferation and migration of OS cells. To further investigate the functional roles of miR‑185 in OS, the downstream targets of miR‑185 were predicted using the microRNA.org database. The results revealed that in cancer cells, hexokinase  (HK2), the rate‑limiting enzyme of , was a potential target of miR‑185. Molecular analysis indicated that miR‑185 binds to the 3'‑untranslated region of HK2 mRNA. Overexpressed miR‑185 downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of HK2 in OS cells. In addition, an inverse correlation between the expression of miR‑185 and HK2 was reported in OS. Consistent with the downregulation of HK2 induced by miR‑185, overexpression of HK2 in OS cells significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR‑185 on glucose consumption and lactate production, while depletion of miR‑185 promoted the  of OS cells. Additionally, restoration of HK2 abolished the inhibitory effects of miR‑185 on the proliferation of OS cells. In summary, these results revealed that miR‑185 suppressed the glucose metabolism of OS cells; thus, miR‑185 may be considered as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of OS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443567>Dietary Fructose and the Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h1><p>: Consumption of fructose, the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates, has increased dramatically in the last 40 years and is today commonly used commercially in soft drinks, juice, and baked goods. These products comprise a large proportion of the modern diet, in particular in children, adolescents, and young adults. A large body of evidence associate consumption of fructose and other sugar-sweetened beverages with insulin resistance, intrahepatic lipid accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia. In the long term, these risk factors may contribute to the development of type  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine and metabolized in the liver where it stimulates fructolysis, , lipogenesis, and glucose production. This may result in hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying intestinal and hepatic fructose metabolism is important.

We show that metabolic alterations in hematopoietic cells are fundamental to the pathogenesis of mutant JAK2 driven myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We found that expression of mutant JAK2 augmented and subverted metabolic activity of MPN cells resulting in systemic metabolic changes in vivo, including hypoglycemia, adipose tissue atrophy and early mortality. Hypoglycemia in MPN mouse models correlated with hyperactive erythropoiesis and was due to a combination of elevated  and increased oxidative phosphorylation. Modulating nutrient supply through high fat diet improved survival, while high glucose diet augmented the MPN phenotype. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses identified numerous metabolic nodes in JAK2 mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that were altered in comparison with wildtype controls. We studied the consequences of elevated levels of Pfkfb3, a key regulatory enzyme of , and found that pharmacological inhibition of Pfkfb3 with the small molecule 3PO reversed hypoglycemia and reduced hematopoietic manifestations of MPN. These effects were additive with the JAK1/ inhibitor, Ruxolitinib, in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of  by 3PO altered the redox homeostasis, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species and augmented apoptosis rate. Our findings reveal the contribution of metabolic alterations to the pathogenesis of MPN and suggest that metabolic dependencies of mutant cells represent vulnerabilities that can be targeted for treating MPN.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416219>Expression of Alpha-Enolase (ENO1), Myc Promoter-Binding Protein-1 (MBP-1) and Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP- and MMP-9) Reflect the Nature and Aggressiveness of Breast Tumors.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease: Several molecular alterations cause cell proliferation and the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is considered essential for sustaining tumor growth and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified as drivers of many aspects of the tumor phenotype. Mounting evidence indicates that both α-enolase (ENO1) and Myc promoter-binding protein-1 (MBP-1) also played pivotal roles in tumorigenesis, although as antagonists. ENO1 is involved in cell growth, hypoxia tolerance and autoimmune activities besides its major role in the  pathway. On the contrary, MBP-1, an alternative product of ENO1, suppresses cell proliferation and the invasive ability of cancer cells. Since an important task in personalized medicine is to discriminate a different subtype of patients with different clinical outcomes including chances of recurrence and metastasis, we investigated the functional relationship between ENO1/MBP-1 expression and MMP- and MMP-9 activity levels in both tissues and sera of breast cancer patients. We focused on the clinical relevance of ENO1 and MMPs (MMP- and MMP-9) overexpression in breast cancer tissues: The association between the higher ENO1, MMP- and MMP-9 expression with a worse prognosis suggest that the elevated ENO1 and MMPs expression are promising biomarkers for breast cancer. A relationship seems to exist between MBP-1 expression and the decrease in the activity levels of MMP-9 in cancer tissues and MMP- in sera. Moreover, the sera of breast cancer patients grouped for MBP-1 expression differentially induced, in vitro, cell proliferation and migration. Our findings support the hypothesis of patient's stratification based on ENO1, MBP-1 and MMPs expression. Elucidating the molecular pathways through which MBP-1 influences MMPs expression and breast cancer regression can lead to the discovery of new management strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533338>-Deoxy-d-Glucose-Induced Metabolic Alteration in Human Oral Squamous SCC15 Cells: Involvement of N-Glycosylation of Axl and Met.</a></h1><p>One of the most prominent hallmarks of cancer cells is their dependency on the glycolytic pathway for energy production. As a potent inhibitor of , -deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) has been proposed for cancer treatment and extensively investigated in clinical studies. Moreover, 2DG has been reported to interfere with other biological processes including glycosylation. To further understand the overall effect of and metabolic alteration by 2DG, we performed biochemical and metabolomics analyses on oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we found that 2DG more effectively reduced glucose consumption and lactate level in SCC15 cells than in SCC4 cells, which are less dependent on . Coincidentally, 2DG impaired N-linked glycosylation of the key oncogenic receptors Axl and Met in SCC15 cells, thereby reducing the cell viability and colony formation ability. The impaired processes of  and N-linked glycosylation were restored by exogenous addition of pyruvate and mannose, respectively. Additionally, our targeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant alterations in the metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, caused by the impairment of  and N-linked glycosylation. These observations suggest that alterations of these metabolites may be responsible for the phenotypic and metabolic changes in SCC15 cells induced by 2DG. Moreover, our data suggest that N-linked glycosylation of Axl and Met may contribute to the maintenance of cancer properties in SCC15 cells.

However, the background of the antifungal effect remains unknown, especially in the case of non- species such as  We examined the effect of tyrosol on growth, adhesion, redox homeostasis, virulence, as well as fluconazole susceptibility. To gain further insights into the physiological consequences of tyrosol treatment, we also determined genome-wide gene expression changes using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). A concentration of 15 mM tyrosol caused significant growth inhibition within  h of the addition of tyrosol, while the adhesion of yeast cells was not affected. Tyrosol increased the production of reactive oxygen species remarkably, as revealed by a dichlorofluorescein test, and it was associated with elevated superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities. The interaction between fluconazole and tyrosol was antagonistic. Tyrosol exposure resulted in 261 and 181 differentially expressed genes with at least a 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression, respectively, which were selected for further study. Genes involved in ribosome biogenesis showed downregulation, while genes related to the oxidative stress response and ethanol fermentation were upregulated.

Thus, folates are critical for establishing and preserving epigenetic programming. Folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) is known to play a crucial role in the maintenance of intracellular folate levels. Therefore, any modulation in FPGS is expected to alter DNA methylation and numerous other metabolic pathways. To explore the role of polyglutamylation of folate, we eliminated both isoforms of FPGS in human cells (293T), producing FPGS knockout (FPGS) cells. The elimination of FPGS significantly decreased cell proliferation, with a major effect on oxidative phosphorylation and a lesser effect on . We found a substantial reduction in global DNA methylation and noteworthy changes in gene expression related to C1 metabolism, cell division, DNA methylation, pluripotency, Glu metabolism, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. The expression levels of , octamer-binding transcription factor 4, and sex-determining region Y-box  levels were increased in the mutant, consistent with the transition to a stem cell-like state.

To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and -related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase).

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of . Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

Subsequently, H NMR-based metabolomics was applied to comprehensively investigate the underlying mechanism, and a clear separation of FIP-nha-treated and untreated groups was achieved using pattern recognition analysis. Four potential pathways associated with the anti-tumor effect of FIP-nha on A549 cells were identified, and these were mainly involved in , taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Metabolic pathway analysis demonstrated that FIP-nha could induce A549 cell apoptosis partly by regulating the p53 inhibition pathway, which then disrupted the Warburg effect, as well as through other metabolic pathways.

However, whether these two different pathogeny induced same pathological outcomes contain common genetic targets or signaling pathway, the current research has not paid great attention. GSE121190 and GSE35257 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. While GSE121190 represents a differential expression profile in kidney of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model, GSE35257 represents cisplatin nephrotoxicity model. By using GEO2R, 965 differential expression genes (DEGs) in GSE121190 and 930 DEGs in GSE35257 were identified. 43 co-DEGs were shared and were extracted for protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Subsequently, three shared pathways including /gluconeogenesis, fatty acid degradation and pathways in cancer were involved in two models with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. We reconfirmed that these three pathways have relatively high scores by using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Additionally, further bioinformatic analysis showed that Aldehyde dehydrogenase- (Aldh2) involved in the progression of renal fibrosis by mediating  pathway Then real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to validate the expression of Aldh2 in kidney tissue after three different etiologies that caused renal fibrosis. Basically consistent with our bioinformatics results, our experiment showed that the expression of Aldh2 is the most significantly decreased in the UUO model, followed by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model and finally the cisplatin-induced model.

We hypothesized that antibiotics cause mammalian mitochondrial damage while causing bacterial lethality. Mitochondrial toxicity of azithromycin in human mammary epithelia MCF-12A and fibroblasts were tested by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression and DNA damage were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. We found azithromycin suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient of MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Ultrastructure exams showed that the antibiotic caused vacuolated and swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts compared to the morphology of mitochondria in the cells without antibiotic treatment. Fluorescent microscopy also showed azithromycin-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, after 3 h of culture. The DNA oxidative damage product, 8-hydroxy-'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, significantly increased in the media after MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts were cultured in the media containing azithromycin for 24 h. Azithromycin upregulated gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (), glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase  (), phosphofructokinase 1 (), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (), and glucose transporters in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Lactate production also increased in the culture media. After treatment with azithromycin, healthy MCF-12A and fibroblast cells increased aerobic -the "Warburg Effect"-to generate energy. In summary, azithromycin caused mitochondrial toxicity, ROS overproduction, DNA oxidative damage, upregulation of the  gene, and aerobic  in healthy mammalian cells. Over-usage of antibiotics could contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration and aggravate existing mitochondria-associated diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513389>Inorganic Selenium Induces Nonapoptotic Programmed Cell Death in PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells Associated with Inhibition of .</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown that selenite, a representative of inorganic form selenium, exerts its anticancer effect by inducing apoptosis in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, but few studies have determined the nature of cell death induced by selenite in metastatic androgen-refractory PC-3 cells. Our study showed that necrosis-like cell death rather than apoptosis, pyroptosis, or autophagic cell death was caused by selenite in PC-3 cells. Mechanistically, this type of cell death was caused by ATP depletion (26.28 ± 3.39 nmol/mg of control versus 9.12 ± .44 nmol/mg of 10 μM selenite treatment) that resulted from phosphofructokinase activity reduction (100.17 ± 0.17% of control versus 21.74 ± 6.65% of 10 μM selenite treatment). Our study also showed that ROS production is necessary for the decrease in cellular ATP levels and in phosphofructokinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that selenite can induce necrosis-like cell death in PC-3 cells. Our findings support selenite as an effective compound for the therapy of apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532192>Repolarization of M2 to M1 Macrophages Triggered by Lactate Oxidase Released from Methylcellulose Hydrogel.</a></h1><p>Deregulated proliferation of tumors is generally associated with altered energy metabolism. A high rate of anaerobic  in solid tumors contributes to an acidification of pH to ∼6.7-7. in the tumor microenvironment and lactate accumulation. Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment can be educated by tumor cells. Tumor-derived lactate induces the polarization of M2 macrophages and promotes tumor invasion and metastasis. However, a particular challenge is to sustain lactate depletion.

Because of widespread drug resistance, the effect is limited. Therefore, it is urgent to reveal the underlying mechanism.  is the most remarkable character of tumor aberrant metabolism, which plays vital roles on tumor drug resistance. Hexokinase  (HK2), as the key enzyme regulating the first-step reaction of , is overexpressed in many kinds of tumors. The putative role of HK2 resisting GEM therapy was investigated in this study. We found that HK2 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and associated with poor prognosis. HK2 knockdown decreased pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration viability, and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. HK2 high expression in pancreatic cancer showed GEM resistance. HK2 knockdown increased the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell to GEM, the growth of xenograft tumor with HK2 knockdown was also further decreased with the GEM treatment compared with control in vivo. GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer showed the increase of HK2 dimer rather than HK2 mRNA or protein. Our study revealed that the ROS derived from GEM promoted HK2 dimerization combining with voltage-dependent anion channel, which resulted in the resistance to GEM. Meanwhile, our study established a new sight for GEM resistance in pancreatic cancer.© 2019 The Authors.

The secondary metabolites in L. japonica are diverse and vary in levels during development, leading to the ambiguous evaluation for its medical value. In order to reveal the regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolites during the flowering stages, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were performed. The integration analysis of omic-data illustrated that the metabolic changes over the flower developmental stages were mainly involved in sugar metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, carbon conversion, and secondary metabolism. Further proteomic analysis revealed that uniquely identified proteins were mainly involved in /phenylpropanoids and tricarboxylic acid cycle/terpenoid backbone pathways in early and late stages, respectively. Transketolase was commonly identified in the 5 developmental stages and -fold increase in gold flowering stage compared with juvenile bud stage. Simple phenylpropanoids/flavonoids and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate were accumulated in early stages and upregulated in late stages, respectively. These results indicate that phenylpropanoids were accumulated attributing to the activated  process in the early stages, while the terpenoids biosynthetic pathways might be promoted by the transketolase-contained regulatory circuit in the late stages of L. japonica flower development.

In this study, the effects of ammonia on the activation of HIF-1 pathway and  in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were investigated and the underlying mechanisms involved were elucidated. The results showed that NHCl concentration-dependently increased the protein level of HIF-1α and enhanced the transactivation activity of HIF-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, NHCl increased the expression of GluT1 and LDHA and promoted aerobic  by activating the HIF-1 pathway. Further study revealed that NHCl increased the mitochondrial ROS level and decreased the cellular Fe level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Activation of the HIF-1 pathway induced by NHCl was inhibited by addition of the antioxidant NAC or the NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor apocynin, indicating the involvement of the NOX-induced ROS generation. When MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with NHCl, the oxygen consumption of cells increased, followed by the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP level, indicating the uncoupling of mitochondria. In conclusion, NHCl activated the HIF-1 signaling pathway and promoted aerobic  in MDA-MB-231 cells, likely through the promotion of mitochondrial ROS release and mitochondrial uncoupling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

FOLFOX4 chemotherapy is one of the most widely used adjuvant therapies in patients with stage III colon cancer after surgical resection. However, chemotherapy resistance is associated with a poor prognosis. The prognostic impact of high blood sugar levels on oxaliplatin resistance in CRC patients is an unexplored topic.In total, 157 patients with stage III CRC were classified according to their fasting blood sugar level (⩾126 or <126 mg/dl). Clinicopathological features and oxaliplatin chemoresistance/survival outcome of the two groups were compared.  cell proliferation assay was performed through d-(+)-glucose administration.Multivariate analysis results revealed that high blood sugar level was a significantly independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival and overall survival (both  < 0.05), but not DM history. After metformin administration, enhanced proliferation of CRC cells (HT-29, HCT-116, SW480, and SW620) with d-(+)-glucose administration could be reversed and oxaliplatin chemosensitivity considerably increased ( < 0.05). Furthermore, phosphorylation of two -related target proteins, SMAD3 and MYC, notably increased under high glucose concentration.Hyperglycemia can affect clinical outcomes in stage III CRC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, and the mechanism underlying oxaliplatin resistance is possibly associated with increased phosphorylation of SMAD3 and MYC and upregulation of EHMT2 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555280> Is Required for LPS-Induced Activation and Adhesion of Human CD14CD16 Monocytes.</a></h1><p>Monocytes in humans consist of 3 subsets; CD14CD16 (classical), CD14CD16 (intermediate) and CD14CD16 (non-classical), which exhibit distinct and heterogeneous responses to activation. During acute inflammation CD14CD16 monocytes are significantly elevated and migrate to the sites of injury via the adhesion cascade. The field of immunometabolism has begun to elucidate the importance of the engagement of specific metabolic pathways in immune cell function. Yet, little is known about monocyte metabolism and the role of metabolism in mediating monocyte activation and adherence to vessels.

Although the TLR-driven metabolic reprogramming events are well documented, fungal-mediated metabolic regulation via C-type lectin receptors such as Dectin-1 and Dectin- is not clearly understood. Here, we show that activation of DCs with fungal-associated β-glucan ligands induces acute glycolytic reprogramming that supports the production of IL-1β and its secretion subsequent to NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. This acute glycolytic induction in response to β-glucan ligands requires spleen tyrosine kinase signaling in a TLR-independent manner, suggesting now that different classes of innate immune receptors functionally induce conserved metabolic responses to support immune cell activation.

Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed consistency and discordance among multi-omics, activation status of key signaling pathways, and liver-specific metabolic reprogramming in HBV-related HCC. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. Two prognostic biomarkers, PYCR2 and ADH1A, related to proteomic subgrouping and involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming, were identified.

Microbial production of 2PE by phenylalanine bioconversion or de novo biosynthesis from sugar offer sustainable, reliable and natural production processes compared to chemical synthesis. Despite the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to naturally synthesize 2PE, de novo synthesis in high concentration and yield remains a metabolic engineering challenge. Here, we demonstrate that improving phosphoenolpyruvate supply by expressing pyruvate kinase variants and eliminating the formation of p-hydroxy-phenylethanol without creating tyrosine auxotrophy significantly contributed to improve 2PE production in S. cerevisiae. In combination with the engineering of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and Ehrlich pathway, these mutations enabled better connection between  and pentose phosphate pathway optimizing carbon flux towards 2PE. However, attempts to further connect these two parts of central carbon metabolism by redirecting fructose-6P towards erythrose-4P by expressing a phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway did not result in improved performance. The best performing strains were capable of producing 13mM of 2PE at a yield of 0.113 mol mol, which represents the highest yield for de novo produced 2PE in S. cerevisiae and other yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, iPSC-CMs exhibit immature fetal CM-like characteristics that are different from adult CMs in several aspects, including cellular structure and metabolism. As an example,  is a major energy source for immature CMs. As CMs mature, the mitochondrial oxidative capacity increases, with fatty acid β-oxidation becoming a key energy source to meet the heart's high energy demand. The immaturity of iPSC-CMs thereby limits their applications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the energy substrate fatty acid-treated iPSC-CMs exhibit adult CM-like metabolic properties. After 20 days of differentiation from human iPSCs, iPSC-CMs were sequentially cultured with CM purification medium (lactate+/glucose-) for 7 days and maturation medium (fatty acids+/glucose-) for 3-7 days by mimicking the adult CM's preference of utilizing fatty acids as a major metabolic substrate. The purity and maturity of iPSC-CMs were characterized via the analysis of: (1) Expression of CM-specific markers (e.g., troponin T, and sodium and potassium channels) using RT-qPCR, Western blot or immunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy imaging; and () cell energy metabolic profiles using the XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. iPSCs-CMs (98% purity) cultured in maturation medium exhibited enhanced elongation, increased mitochondrial numbers with more aligned Z-lines, and increased expression of matured CM-related genes, suggesting that fatty acid-contained medium promotes iPSC-CMs to undergo maturation. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) linked to basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity (representing mitochondrial function) was increased in matured iPSC-CMs. Mature iPSC-CMs also displayed a larger change in basal and maximum respirations due to the utilization of exogenous fatty acids (palmitate) compared with non-matured control iPSC-CMs. Etomoxir (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitor) but not -deoxyglucose (an inhibitor of ) abolished the palmitate pretreatment-mediated OCR increases in mature iPSC-CMs. Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time that fatty acid treatment promotes metabolic maturation of iPSC-CMs (as evidenced by enhanced mitochondrial oxidative function and strong capacity of utilizing fatty acids as energy source).

Investigation of proteome profiles of disease specific cells facilitates our understanding of the processes and related molecular pathways, especially in disorders like BS with complex inheritance pattern and clinical heterogeneity. In the current study, we evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proteome of 59 patients with BS (33 in active and 26 in inactive phases) and of 28 healthy controls using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed protein spots with at least twofold and/or statistically significant change (p ≤ 0.05) between active BS vs inactive BS, and also active BS vs healthy controls were identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF). Bioinformatic analyses revealed 16 differentially expressed proteins (12 of them in active vs inactive BS comparison, whereas 11 of them for active BS vs healthy control comparison) belonging to , cytoskeleton organization, protein folding, and regulation of blood coagulation pathways.

In highly polarized neurons, about 10-50% of mitochondria are transported along microtubules using mitochondrial-born ATP to locations with high energy requirements. In this report, we have investigated the impact of Aralar deficiency on mitochondrial transport in cultured cortical neurons. Aralar/slc25a12/AGC1 is the neuronal isoform of the aspartate-glutamate mitochondrial carrier, a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) which plays an important role in redox balance, which is essential to maintain glycolytic pyruvate supply to neuronal mitochondria. Using live imaging microscopy we observed that the lack of Aralar does not affect the number of moving mitochondria nor the Ca-induced stop, the only difference being a 10% increase in mitochondrial velocity in Aralar deficient neurons. Therefore, we evaluated the possible fuels used in each case by studying the relative contribution of oxidative phosphorylation and  to mitochondrial movement using specific inhibitors. We found that the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin caused a smaller inhibition of mitochondrial movement in Aralar-KO than control neurons, whereas the  inhibitor iodoacetate had similar effects in neurons from both genotypes. In line with these findings, the decrease in cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio caused by oligomycin was more pronounced in control than in Aralar-KO neurons, but no differences were observed with iodoacetate. Oligomycin effect was reverted by aralar re-expression in knock out cultures. As mitochondrial movement is not reduced in Aralar-KO neurons, these results suggest that these neurons may use an additional pathway for mitochondria movement and ATP/ADP ratio maintenance.Copyright © 2019.

Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem metabolic disorder who inherited two copies of chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKM) gene, and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) gene (both on chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in  and is linked to Tarui syndrome. The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM, revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1 while levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease, and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626563>18F-FDG PET/CT in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:Quantifying Inflammation by the TLG index.</a></h1><p>: In sarcoidosis progressive pulmonary disease affects prognosis.

The main upstream phosphorylase has AMP-dependent LKB1 and Ca-dependent CaMKK beta. AMPK also includes an auto-inhibitory domain and a region associated with beta and gamma subunits, which regulate a variety of cellular activities and energy metabolism. The increase in the ratio of AMP/ATP can stimulate the activation of AMPK. Once AMPK is activated, pathways to ATP consumption (e.g., fat, cholesterol, and protein synthesis) will be shut down. The pathway to ATP generation (e.g., oxidation of fat and  pathway) will be activated. AMPK genes have not been systematically characterized in marine invertebrates.In this study, we identified and characterized three AMPK genes, AMPK-α, AMPK-β, and AMPK-γ, in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). To gain insight into the role of AMPK genes during clam energy metabolism, quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate the expression profiles in the different stages of clam development, in healthy adult tissues, and after air exposure at two different temperatures.Phylogenetic and protein structural analyses were conducted to determine the identity and evolutionary relationships of these genes. The structural features of the genes were relatively well-conserved, relative to the AMPK genes of other vertebrates. The expression of genes was significantly induced 3-48 h after air exposure.AMPK-α, AMPK-β and AMPK-γ are involved in clam energy metabolism.

We have cloned and expressed PGK in Brugia malayi. The rBmPGK was found to be 415 amino acid residues long having 45 kDa subunit molecular weight. This enzyme was also identified in different life stages of bovine filarial parasite Setaria cervi. The enzyme activity was highest in microfilarial stage followed by adult female and male as also shown by real time PCR in the present study. Further using BmPGK primers the cDNA prepared from S. cervi was amplified and sequenced which showed 100% homology with Brugia malayi PGK. B. malayi and S. cervi, PGK consists of conserved calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) having 21 amino acids. In the present study we have shown the CaMBD binds to calcium-calmodulin and regulates its activity. The binding of calmodulin (CaM) with CaMBD was confirmed using calmodulin agarose binding pull down assay, which showed that the rBmPGK binds to CaM agarose-calcium dependent manner. The effect of CaM-Caon the activity of rBmPGK was studied at different concentration of CaM (0.01-5.0 μM) and calcium chloride (0.01-100 μM). The rBmPGK was activated up to 85% in the presence of CaM at 1 μM and 10 μM concentration of CaCl. Interestingly this activation was abrogated by metal chelator EDTA. Similar results were shown in case of Setaria cervi PGK. A significant increase (90 ± 10) % in ScPGK activity was observed in the presence of CaM and CaCl at 1.0 μM and 1.0 mM respectively, further increase in the conc. of CaCl, the activity of ScPGK was found to be decreased like rBmPGK.

In addition to being the end product of , pyruvate is an essential carbon distribution point to oxidative metabolism, amino acid and fatty acid syntheses, and overflow metabolite production. Hence, a tight regulation of pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity is of great importance. This study aimed to analyze targeted metabolites from several pathways and possible changes in  lacking Pyk. Wild type and Δpyk cells were cultivated in chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by H-NMR, GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the perturbation created in the pyruvate node drove an adaptation to new conditions by altering the nutritional compounds' consumption. In Δpyk, pyruvate, which is subject to glucose-dependent carbon catabolite repression, did not comply with the hierarchy in carbon source utilization. Other metabolic alterations were observed such as the higher secretion of the overflow metabolites acetoin and ,3-butanediol by Δpyk.

We hypothesize that high glucose drives cancer progression and cell aggressiveness by decreasing actin expression, increasing NFkB, and kinesin expressions, and by activating Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Using lowly metastatic MCF-7 and highly metastatic MDA-MB231 (MB231) breast cancer cells - highly incident cancer types - we establish how glucose metabolism regulates actin and the biochemical changes that lead to alterations of cell mechanical properties. We find that higher glucose (15 and 30 mM) increases glycolytic enzymes, glucose uptake, migration speed, kinesin, Ki-67, and NFkB expressions (biomarkers), and hybrid EMT phenotype activation (adhesion molecules/cadherins). Downregulation of actin, increased expressions of motor protein and NFkB, and decreased nuclear stiffness - induced by higher glucose - result in a significant increase in the migration speed.

Thus, higher glucose promotes a more aggressive phenotype that promises to be a new target for cancer therapy and can help prevent cancer progression in diabetic patients by inhibiting glucose activated mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473121>Importance of Multiparametric Evaluation of Immune-Related T-Cell Markers in Renal-Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Immunotherapeutic therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To overcome therapeutic resistance or identify predictive markers, a comprehensive understanding of the immunologic condition in the tumor microenvironment is important. We reviewed the latest scientific findings on the comprehensive immunologic condition within the tumor microenvironment in patients with RCC and its clinical significance. The immunologic condition evaluated by 3 different methods (flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and next-generation sequencing) in 4 different cohorts of patients with RCC could commonly divide the immunologic condition into  or 3 groups, all of which were significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis. In particular, patients with high T-cell infiltration and immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells had the worst prognosis in each cohort. This classification correlated with angiogenesis and metabolism and , and it suggested that distinct biology exists in each immunologic classification. Moreover, around 20% to 30% of the RCC patients had intratumor immunologic diversity within each individual; this might help in understanding the presence of radiologic heterogeneity for immunotherapies. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the immune condition is needed for the upcoming era of novel cancer immunotherapy using not only genetic but also phenotypic and functional classifications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate that Foxp3 deficiency dysregulates metabolic checkpoint kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex  (mTORC2) signaling and gives rise to augmented aerobic  and oxidative phosphorylation. Specific deletion of the mTORC2 adaptor gene Rictor in Foxp3-deficient T cells ameliorated disease in a Foxo1 transcription factor-dependent manner. Rictor deficiency re-established a subset of T cell genetic circuits and suppressed the T cell-like glycolytic and respiratory programs, which contributed to immune dysregulation. Treatment of T cells from patients with FOXP3 deficiency with mTOR inhibitors similarly antagonized their T cell-like program and restored suppressive function. Thus, regulatory function can be re-established in Foxp3-deficient T cells by targeting their metabolic pathways, providing opportunities to restore tolerance in T cell disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555131>Cigarette Smoke Reduces Fatty Acid Catabolism, Leading to Apoptosis in Lung Endothelial Cells: Implication for Pathogenesis of COPD.</a></h1><p>Endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis contributes to cigarette smoke (CS)-induced pulmonary emphysema. Metabolism of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid is dysregulated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Whether CS causes metabolic dysregulation in ECs leading to development of COPD remains elusive. We hypothesized that CS alters metabolism, resulting in apoptosis in lung ECs. To test this hypothesis, we treated primary mouse pulmonary microvascular ECs (PMVECs) with CS extract (CSE) and employed PMVECs from healthy subjects and COPD patients. We found that mitochondrial respiration was reduced in CSE-treated PMVECs and in PMVECs from COPD patients. Specifically, oxidation of fatty acids (FAO) was reduced in these cells, which linked to reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), an essential enzyme for carnitine shuttle. CSE-induced apoptosis was further increased when cells were treated with a specific Cpt1 inhibitor etomoxir or transfected with Cpt1a siRNA. L-Carnitine treatment augmented FAO but attenuated CSE-induced apoptosis by upregulating Cpt1a. CSE treatment increased palmitate-derived ceramide synthesis, which was reduced by L-carnitine. Although CSE treatment increased , inhibiting  with -deoxy-d-glucose had no effects on CSE-mediated apoptosis in lung ECs. Conclusively, FAO reduction increases ceramide and apoptosis in lung ECs treated with CSE, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD/emphysema.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668020>Glucose and glutamine metabolism in relation to mutational status in NSCLC histological subtypes.</a></h1><p>Both hypoxia and oncogenic mutations rewire tumor metabolism. In this study, glucose and glutamine metabolism-related markers were examined in stage I - resectable stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Furthermore, expression of metabolism-related markers was correlated with mutational status to examine mutations associated with rewired tumor metabolism.Mutation analysis was performed for 97 tumors. Glucose and glutamine metabolism-related marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and qPCR (mRNA) (n = 81).Glutamine metabolism-related markers were significantly higher in adeno- than squamous cell NSCLCs. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression was higher in solid compared to lepidic adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). In adenocarcinomas, mRNA expression of glutamine transporter SLC1A5 correlated with tumor size (r(p) = 0.41, P = 0.005). Furthermore, SLC1A5 protein expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas with worse pTNM stage (r(s) = 0.39, P = 0.009). EGFR-mutated tumors showed lower GLUT1 protein (P = 0.017), higher glutaminase  (GLS2) protein (P = 0.025) and higher GLS2 mRNA expression (P = 0.004), compared to EGFR wild-type tumors. GLS mRNA expression was higher in KRAS-mutated tumors (P = 0.019). TP53-mutated tumors showed higher GLUT1 expression (P = 0.009).NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease, with differences in mutational status and metabolism-related marker expression between adeno- and squamous cell NSCLCs, and also within adenocarcinoma subtypes. GLUT1 and SLC1A5 expression correlate with aggressive tumor behavior in adenocarcinomas but not in squamous cell NSCLCs. Therefore, these markers could steer treatment modification for subgroups of adenocarcinoma patients. TP53, EGFR and KRAS mutations are associated with expression of glucose and glutamine metabolism-related markers in NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic activity of the axillary LNs in relation to that of the upper limb joints and the clinical assessment of disease activity in RA patients treated with biologic therapies. : F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-FDG-PET/CT) scans were acquired for 64 patients with RA at baseline and after 6 months of biologic therapy, and the patients' clinical status was evaluated. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic active volume, and total lesion  (TLG) were used to assess glucose metabolism in the LNs and 12 joints. Clinical evaluations included serum markers and the Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR). : Changes in the SUV and TLG for the axillary LNs correlated significantly with those of the ipsilateral wrist joints. There was a positive correlation between the changes in the three metabolic parameters of the axillary LNs and the changes in disease activity after treatment. After 6 months of biologic therapy, all metabolic parameters for the axillary LNs in patients with a DAS28-ESR < 3. were significantly lower than those of patients with a DAS28-ESR ≥ 3.. : A relationship between the glucose metabolism of the axillary LNs and the ipsilateral wrist joints was demonstrated by the F-FDG-PET/CT parameters. The metabolic activity and active volume of axillary LNs may reflect the therapeutic response to the biologic treatment of RA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632919>Dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL) Suppresses the Proliferation of Glioblastoma Cells via Targeting Pyruvate Kinase  (PKM2) and Rewiring Aerobic .</a></h1><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Aerobic , featured with elevated glucose consumption and lactate production, confers selective advantages on GBM by utilizing nutrients to support rapid cell proliferation and tumor growth. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), the last rate-limiting enzyme of , is known to regulate aerobic , and considered as a novel cancer therapeutic target. Herein, we aim to describe the cellular functions and mechanisms of a small molecular compound dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), which has been used in clinical trials for recurrent GBM in Australia. Our results demonstrate that DMAMCL is effective on the inhibition of GBM cell proliferation and colony formation. MCL, the active metabolic form of DMAMCL, selectively binding to monomeric PKM2 and promoting its tetramerization, was also found to improve the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2 in GBM cells. In addition, non-targeting metabolomics analysis reveals multiple metabolites involved in , including lactate and glucose-6-phosphate, are decreased with DMAMCL treatment. The inhibitory effects of DMAMCL are observed to decrease in GBM cells upon PKM2 depletion, further confirming the importance of PKM2 in DMAMCL sensitivity. In conclusion, the activation of PKM2 by DMAMCL results in the rewiring aerobic , which consequently suppresses the proliferation of GBM cells. Hence, DMAMCL represents a potential PKM2-targeted therapeutic agent against GBM.Copyright © 2019 Guo, Xue, Liu, Ge, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Li, Cai, Shan, Zhang, Liu and Li.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476661>Liver-targeted Nano-MitoPBN normalizes glucose metabolism by improving mitochondrial redox balance.</a></h1><p>Recent advances in Nanomedicine provide promising disease treatment through improved drug delivery efficiency, but clinical applications have encountered difficulties, largely due to the majority of injected nanoparticle is sequestered in liver. In contrast, liver cells seem to be a perfect target for nanoparticles. Here we generated a new formula of liposome encapsulated Nano-MitoPBN as a liver mitochondrial-targeting free radical scavenger. We found that Nano-MitoPBN mainly accumulated in hepatocytes and scavenged hepatic mitochondrial superoxide/hydrogen peroxide generated from mono-electron leak of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I and III. Due to micro-compartmentalization, Nano-MitoPBN increased mitochondrial state 3 respiratory rate and respiratory control ratio (RCR), resulting in decreased NADH:NAD ratio, improved mitochondrial oxidative energy coupling and ATP synthesis, thus alleviating ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. The functional mitochondria promoted the substrate oxidation by the liver, resulting in increased  and TCA cycle, which directly speeds glucose decomposition, thus decreasing the peripheral blood glucose level and improving the impaired glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. Our study suggests the potential of liver mitochondrial targeting antioxidative nanomedicines for diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Shikonin (SKN), a natural naphthoquinone with anti-inflammatory activity, has shown to exert cardioprotective effects, but the effect of SKN on atherosclerosis is unclear. In addition, SKN was found to inhibit  via targeting pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (PKM2). In the present study, we investigated the effects of SKN on hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis and T cell inflammatory activation in ApoE mice and the metabolic mechanisms in this process. Drinking water supplemented with Hcy (1.8 g/L) was administered to ApoE mice for  weeks and the mice were injected with SKN (1. mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle every 3 days. We showed that SKN treatment markedly attenuated HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE mice and significantly decreased inflammatory activated CD4 T cells and proinflammatory macrophages in plaques. In splenic CD4 T cells isolated from HHcy-ApoE mice, SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated PKM2 activity, interferon-γ secretion and the capacity of these T cells to promote macrophage proinflammatory polarization. SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated CD4 T cell  and oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic profiling analysis of CD4 T cells revealed that Hcy administration significantly increased various glucose metabolites as well as lipids and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which were reversed by SKN treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that SKN is effective to ameliorate atherosclerosis in HHcy-ApoE mice and this is at least partly associated with the inhibition of SKN on CD4 T cell inflammatory activation via PKM2-dependent metabolic suppression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620662>Altered metabolism for neuroprotection provided by mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h1><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells which have become popular research targets for their use in cellular therapy for tissue repair. While recent advancements in research have shown the MSCs have immunomodulatory functions which are altered in response to host inflammatory molecules, how these stimuli produce different functional outcomes is not understood. Here, we evaluate research examining how the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) affects the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs by altering their metabolism. This study indicates that IFN-γ causes an increase in glycolytic activity and uncoupling of  to tricarboxylic acid cycle and hence, the glycolytic metabolites and intermediates can be funneled toward the production of anti-inflammatory modulators indoleamine-,3-dioxygenase and PGE2. A complete understanding of how MSCs' cellular metabolism affects their function is necessary for their employment in cellular therapy, as MSCs have been demonstrated to have pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. These findings are a large step forward in the understanding of the regulation of MSCs and toward their eventual use in cellular therapy, specifically for stroke recovery, in which MSCs have been shown to have powerful neuroprotective and neurogenerative effects.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31434645>A Tumor Agnostic Therapeutic Strategy for Hexokinase 1-Null/Hexokinase -Positive Cancers.</a></h1><p>Since Warburg's observation that most cancers exhibit elevated , decades of research have attempted to reduce tumor glucose utilization as a therapeutic approach. Hexokinase (HK) activity is the first glycolytic enzymatic step; despite many attempts to inhibit HK activity, none has reached clinical application. Identification of HK isoforms, and recognition that most tissues express only HK1 while most tumors express HK1 and HK2, stimulated reducing HK2 activity as a therapeutic option. However, studies using HK2 shRNA and isogenic HK1HK2 and HK1HK2 tumor cell pairs demonstrated that tumors expressing only HK1, while exhibiting reduced glucose consumption, progressed  as well as tumors expressing both HK1 and HK2. However, HK1HK2 tumor subpopulations exist among many cancers. shRNA HK2 suppression in HK1HK2 liver cancer cells reduced xenograft tumor progression, in contrast to HK1HK2 cells. HK2 inhibition, and partial inhibition of both oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation using HK2 shRNA and small-molecule drugs, prevented human liver HK1HK2 cancer xenograft progression. Using human multiple myeloma xenografts and mouse allogeneic models to identify potential clinical translational agents, triple therapies that include antisense HK2 oligonucleotides, metformin, and perhexiline prevent progression. These results suggest an agnostic approach for HK1HK2 cancers, regardless of tissue origin.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553812>Subcellular NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathways and their roles in bioenergetics and neuronal protection after ischemic injury.</a></h1><p>NAD is a cofactor required for , tricarboxylic acid cycle, and complex I enzymatic reaction. In mammalian cells, NAD is predominantly synthesized through the salvage pathway, where nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme. Previously, we demonstrated that NAMPT exerts a neuroprotective effect in ischemia through the suppression of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mammalian cells maintain distinct NAD pools in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nuclei. However, it is unknown whether mitochondria have an intact machinery for NAD salvage, and if so, whether it plays a dominant role in bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and neuronal protection after ischemia. Here, using mouse primary cortical neuron and cortical tissue preparations, and multiple technologies including cytosolic and mitochondrial subfractionation, viral over-expression of transgenes, molecular biology, and confocal microscopy, we provided compelling evidence that neuronal mitochondria possess an intact machinery of NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage pathway, and that NAMPT and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 (NMNAT3) are localized in the mitochondrial matrix. By knocking down NMNAT1-3 and NAMPT with siRNA, we found that NMNAT3 has a larger effect on basal and ATP production-related mitochondrial respiration than NMNAT1- in primary cultured neurons, while NMNAT1- have a larger effect on glycolytic flux than NMNAT3. Using an oxygen glucose deprivation model, we found that mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and non-subcellular compartmental over-expressions of NAMPT have a comparable effect on neuronal protection and suppression of apoptosis-inducing factor translocation. The current study provides novel insights into the roles of subcellular compartmental NAD salvage pathways in NAD homeostasis, bioenergetics, and neuronal protection in ischemic conditions.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619960>Brain Senescence Caused by Elevated Levels of Reactive Metabolite Methylglyoxal on D-Galactose-Induced Aging Mice.</a></h1><p>Aging is a complex natural phenomenon that is manifested by degenerative changes in the structure and function of cells and tissues. D-Galactose-induced aging mice are an artificial accelerated aging model that causes memory and learning impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism of an aging mouse model induced by D-galactose. Our behavioral Morris water maze results revealed that D-galactose administration for  months significantly induced memory and learning impairment in C57BL/6J mice. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results showed elevated levels of the metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) in D-galactose-induced aging mice. Whether and how D-galactose induces senescence by elevated levels of reactive metabolite MG remain unclear. In our study, MG mainly accumulated through the following two aspects: to increase its source, namely, the triose phosphate produced by the  pathway, and to reduce its detoxification system, namely, the glyoxalase system. Therefore, elevated MG levels may be one of the causes of brain senescence in D-galactose-induced mice. However, the molecular mechanism of the increased level of the reaction metabolite methylglyoxal requires further exploration.Copyright © 2019 Li, Zheng, Chen, Liu and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440463>Dodecyl-TPP Targets Mitochondria and Potently Eradicates Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs): Synergy With FDA-Approved Drugs and Natural Compounds (Vitamin C and Berberine).</a></h1><p>Elevated mitochondrial biogenesis and/or metabolism are distinguishing features of cancer cells, as well as Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), which are involved in tumor initiation, metastatic dissemination, and therapy resistance. In fact, mitochondria-impairing agents can be used to hamper CSCs maintenance and propagation, toward better control of neoplastic disease. Tri-Phenyl-Phosphonium (TPP)-based mitochondrially-targeted compounds are small non-toxic and biologically active molecules that are delivered to and accumulated within the mitochondria of living cells. Therefore, TPP-derivatives may represent potentially "powerful" candidates to block CSCs. Here, we evaluate the metabolic and biological effects induced by the TPP-derivative, termed Dodecyl-TPP (d-TPP) on breast cancer cells. By employing the 3D mammosphere assay in MCF-7 cells, we demonstrate that treatment with d-TPP dose-dependently inhibits the propagation of breast CSCs in suspension. Also, d-TPP targets adherent "bulk" cancer cells, by decreasing MCF-7 cell viability. The analysis of metabolic flux using Seahorse Xfe96 revealed that d-TPP potently inhibits the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), while simultaneously shifting cell metabolism toward . Thereafter, we exploited this ATP depletion phenotype and strict metabolic dependency on  to eradicate the residual glycolytic CSC population, by using additional metabolic stressors. More specifically, we applied a combination strategy based on treatment with d-TPP, in the presence of a selected panel of natural and synthetic compounds, some of which are FDA-approved, that are known to behave as  (Vitamin C, -Deoxy-Glucose) and OXPHOS (Doxycyline, Niclosamide, Berberine) inhibitors. This two-hit scheme effectively decreased CSC propagation, at concentrations of d-TPP toxic only for cancer cells, but not for normal cells, as evidenced using normal human fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) as a reference point. Taken together, d-TPP halts CSCs propagation and targets "bulk" cancer cells, without eliciting the relevant undesirable off-target effects in normal cells. These observations pave the way for further exploring the potential of TPP-based derivatives in cancer therapy. Moreover, TPP-based compounds should be investigated for their potential to discriminate between "normal" and "malignant" mitochondria, suggesting that distinct biochemical, and metabolic changes in these organelles could precede specific normal or pathological phenotypes. Lastly, our data validate the manipulation of the energetic machinery as useful tool to eradicate CSCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474665>Phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose bisphosphatase-1 in canine liver and kidney.</a></h1><p>In healthy individuals, plasma glucose levels are maintained within a normal range. During fasting, endogenous glucose is released either through glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis involves the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from a variety of precursors followed by its subsequent hydrolysis to glucose. Gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and the kidney. In order to compare gluconeogenesis in canine liver and kidney, the activity and expression of the rate limiting enzymes that catalyze the fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate steps, namely, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) () and fructose bisphosphatase-1 (FBP-1) (gluconeogenesis), were examined. Healthy male and female beagle dogs aged 1- years were euthanized humanely, and samples of their liver and kidney were obtained for analysis. The levels of PFK-1 and FBP-1 in canine liver and kidney were assessed by enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR. Enzyme assays showed that, in dogs, the kidney had higher specific activity of PFK-1 and FBP-1 than the liver. Western blotting and RT-qPCR data demonstrated that of the three different subunits (PFK-M, PFK-L, and PFK-P) the PFK-1 in canine liver mainly comprised PFK-L, whereas the PFK-1 in the canine kidney comprised all three subunits. As a result of these differences in the subunit composition of PFK-1, glucose metabolism might be regulated differently in the liver and kidney.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412251>Drp1 Promotes KRas-Driven Metabolic Changes to Drive Pancreatic Tumor Growth.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria undergo fission and fusion to maintain homeostasis, and tumors exhibit the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics. We recently demonstrated that ectopic HRas promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and tumor growth through Erk phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). However, the role of Drp1 in the setting of endogenous oncogenic KRas remains unknown. Here, we show that Drp1 is required for KRas-driven anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts and patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines, and it promotes glycolytic flux, in part through the regulation of hexokinase  (HK2). Furthermore, Drp1 deletion imparts a significant survival advantage in a model of KRas-driven pancreatic cancer, and tumors exhibit a strong selective pressure against complete Drp1 deletion. Rare tumors that arise in the absence of Drp1 have restored  but exhibit defective mitochondrial metabolism. This work demonstrates that Drp1 plays dual roles in KRas-driven tumor growth: supporting both  and mitochondrial function through independent mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we use genome edited human embryonic stem cells to understand the most common form of monogenic diabetes, MODY3, caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A. We found that HNF1A is necessary to repress an alpha cell gene expression signature, maintain endocrine cell function, and regulate cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified the human-specific long non-coding RNA, LINKA, as an HNF1A target necessary for normal mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide a possible explanation for the species difference in disease phenotypes observed with HNF1A mutations and offer mechanistic insights into how the HNF1A gene may also influence type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore to investigate, we treated Raw264.7 cells with IL-6 (1hr prior to irradiation) and examined the glycolytic flux. Increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of key glycolytic enzymes was observed after IL-6 treatment, which conferred  dependent resistance from radiation induced cell death. We further established that IL-6 induced  is activated by Akt signaling and knocking down Akt or inhibition of pan Akt phosphorylation significantly abrogated the IL-6 induced radio-resistance. Moreover, reduction of IL-6 induced pAkt level suppressed the expression of Hexokinase- and its translocation to the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the  induced resistance to radiation. IL-6 induced  also minimized the radiation induced mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that IL-6 induced  observed in cells may be responsible for IL-6 mediated therapeutic radio-resistance in cancer cells, partly by activation of Akt signaling.© The Author(s) 2019.

The most challenging aspect associated with tamoxifen therapy is the development of resistance in initially responsive breast tumors. We applied a parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM)-based quantitative proteomic method to examine the differential expression of kinase proteins in MCF-7 and the isogenic tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cells. We were able to quantify the relative protein expression levels of 315 kinases, among which hexokinase  (HK2) and mTOR were up-regulated in TamR MCF-7 cells. We also observed that the TamR MCF-7 cells exhibited elevated rate of  than the parental MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that phosphorylation of S6K - a target of mTOR - was much lower in TamR MCF-7 cells, and this phosphorylation level could be restored upon genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of HK2. Reciprocally, the level of S6K phosphorylation was diminished upon overexpression of HK2 in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we observed that HK2 interacts with mTOR, and this interaction inhibits mTOR activity. Lower mTOR activity led to augmented autophagy, which conferred resistance of MCF-7 cells toward tamoxifen. Together, our study demonstrates that elevated expression of HK2 promotes autophagy through inhibiting the mTOR-S6K signaling pathway and results in resistance of MCF-7 breast cancer cells toward tamoxifen; thus, our results uncovered, for the first time, HK2 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming tamoxifen resistance.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653173>Single-stage astaxanthin production enhances the non-mevalonate pathway and photosynthetic central metabolism in  sp. PCC 7002.</a></h1><p>The natural pigment astaxanthin is widely used in aquaculture, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic industries due to superior antioxidant properties. The green alga  is currently used for commercial production of astaxanthin pigment. However, slow growing  requires a complex two-stage stress-induced process with high light intensity leading to increased contamination risks. In contrast, the fast-growing euryhaline cyanobacterium  sp. PCC 7002 ( 7002) is able to reach high density under stress-free phototrophic conditions, and is therefore a promising metabolic engineering platform for astaxanthin production. In the present study, genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylase and β-carotene ketolase, from the marine bacterium  sp. SD212, are integrated into the endogenous plasmid of  7002, and then expressed to biosynthesize astaxanthin. Although  7002 does not inherently produce astaxanthin, the recombinant ZW strain yields 3 mg/g-dry cell weight astaxanthin from CO as the sole carbon source, with significantly higher astaxanthin content than previous cyanobacteria reports.  7002 astaxanthin productivity reached 3.35 mg/L/day after just  days in a continuous autotrophic process, which is comparable to the best  astaxanthin productivities when factoring in growth times. Metabolomics analysis reveals increases in fractions of hexose-, pentose- and triose phosphates along with intermediates involved in the non-mevalonate pathway. Dynamic metabolomics analysis of C labeled metabolites clearly indicates flux enhancements in the Calvin cycle and  resulting from the overexpression of astaxanthin biosynthetic genes.

Th17 function requires fatty acid uptake, and our new data show that blockade of CPT1A inhibits Th17-associated cytokine production by cells from people with type  diabetes (T2D). A low CACT:CPT1A ratio in immune cells from T2D subjects indicates altered mitochondrial function and coincides with the preference of these cells to generate ATP through  rather than fatty acid oxidation. However,  was not critical for Th17 cytokines. Instead, β oxidation blockade or CACT knockdown in T cells from lean subjects to mimic characteristics of T2D causes cells to utilize C-fatty acylcarnitine to support Th17 cytokines.

Identification of genetic targets that induce or mimic HR deficiencies will extend the clinical utility of PARP inhibitors. Here we perform a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-scale loss-of-function screen, using the sensitivity of PARP inhibitor olaparib as a surrogate. We identify , encoding TP53 induced  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), as a modifier of PARP inhibitor response. We show that TIGAR is amplified in several cancer types, and higher expression of TIGAR associates with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer. TIGAR knockdown enhances sensitivity to olaparib in cancer cells via downregulation of BRCA1 and the Fanconi anemia pathway and increases senescence of these cells by affecting metabolic pathways and increasing the cytotoxic effects of olaparib. Our results indicate TIGAR should be explored as a therapeutic target for treating cancer and extending the use of PARP inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647926>Empagliflozin reduces the levels of CD36 and cardiotoxic lipids while improving autophagy in the hearts of Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h1><p>The EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in patients with Type  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)) trial made evident the potentiality of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter  (SGLT2) inhibition for treating patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking insulin resistance to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty acid transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential  intermediaries ,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino acids of relevance as tricarboxylic acid suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and sarcosine. Empagliflozin treatment activated the cardioprotective master regulator of cellular energyhomeostasis AMP-activatedproteinkinase (AMPK) and enhanced autophagy at cardiac level, while it decreased significantly the cardiac mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemerin, TNF-α and MCP-1, reinforcing the hypothesis of a direct role for empagliflozin in attenuating cardiac inflammation. Our results provide an advancement on the knowledge of the mechanisms linking the therapy with empagliflozin with protective effects on the development of cardiometabolic diseases whose course is associated with remarkable cardiac bioenergetics dysregulation and disarrangement in cardiac metabolome and lipidome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we reported that Hexokinase  (HK2) is overexpressed in human CRC tissues and cell lines, knockout of HK2 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth. We demonstrated that the natural compound, xanthohumol, has a profound anti-tumor effect on CRC via down-regulation of HK2 and . Xanthohumol suppressed CRC cell growth both  and .

The IR has a predominant metabolic role in physiology, but the potential role of IR-A in cancer metabolic reprogramming is unknown. We aimed to characterize the metabolic impact of IR-A and its ligand insulin like growth factor  (IGF2) in human breast cancer (BC) cells. To establish autocrine IGF2 action, we generated human BC cells MCF7 overexpressing the human IGF2, while we focused on the metabolic effect of IR-A by stably infecting -ablated MCF7 (MCF7) cells with a human IR-A cDNA. We then evaluated the expression of key metabolism related molecules and measured real-time extracellular acidification rates and oxygen consumption rates using the Seahorse technology. MCF7/IGF2 cells showed increased proliferation and invasion associated with aerobic  and mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. In MCF7/IR-A cells insulin and IGF2 stimulated similar metabolic changes and were equipotent in eliciting proliferative responses, while IGF2 more potently induced invasion. The combined treatment with the  inhibitor -deoxyglucose (2DG) and the mitochondrial inhibitor metformin blocked cell invasion and colony formation with additive effects. Overall, these results indicate that IGF2 and IR-A overexpression may contribute to BC metabolic reprogramming.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506054>Paternal chronic folate supplementation induced the transgenerational inheritance of acquired developmental and metabolic changes in chickens.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence indicates that paternal diet can result in metabolic changes in offspring, but the definite mechanism remains unclear in birds. Here, we fed breeder cocks five different diets containing 0, 0.25, 1.25, .50 and 5.00 mg kg folate throughout life. Paternal folate supplementation (FS) was beneficial to the growth and organ development of broiler offspring. Most importantly, the lipid and glucose metabolism of breeder cocks and broiler offspring were affected by paternal FS, according to biochemical and metabolomic analyses. We further employed global analyses of hepatic and spermatozoal messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA). Some key genes involved in the  or gluconeogenesis pathway and the PPAR signalling pathway, including ,  and , were regulated by differentially expressed hepatic and spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs in breeder cocks and broiler offspring. Moreover, the expression of  could also be regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in spermatozoa via competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms. Overall, this model suggests that paternal folate could transgenerationally regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in broiler offspring and the epigenetic transmission may involve altered spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530294>Ketosis and bipolar disorder: controlled analytic study of online reports.</a></h1><p>Members of online bipolar disorder forums often report experiences of mood-stabilisation on the ketogenic diet, which has traditionally been used in the treatment of epilepsy. We examined the nature and extent of such reports.To investigate associations between a ketogenic diet and mood stabilisation among individuals with bipolar disorder.We undertook an observational analytic study of free-text comments in online forums about mood effects of dietary interventions (ketogenic, omega-3 enriched or vegetarian) classified by a priori categories of change in mood stabilisation in 274 people with bipolar disorder.There were 141 (85.5%) free-text comments on ketogenic diets that reported a positive impact on mood stabilisation. Reports of significant mood stabilisation or remission of symptoms over a period were substantially higher for a ketogenic diet than for other diets (93/165, 56.4%, 95% CI 48.4-64.1) v. 14/94, 14.9%, 95% CI 8.4-23.7), odds ratio 7.4, 95% CI 3.8-14.1, P < 0.0001), many with detailed reports of the improvements experienced and several lasting for extended periods (months to years). Other reported associations included fewer episodes of depression (in 41.%, 95% CI 30.6-52.4 of individuals); improved clarity of thought and speech (28.%, 95% CI 19.0-39.0); increased energy (25.9, 95% CI 17.0-36.5); and weight loss (25.9%, 95% CI 17.0-36.5).Despite the inherent limitations of the observational data based on self-reports posted online, the association strength and reports of sustained benefit support a hypothesis of a ketogenic diet being associated with beneficial effects on mood stabilisation. Caution should be exercised in interpreting this data until a controlled trial can be carried out to examine this hypothesis.

In addition, we evaluated the value of FDG uptake in predicting treatment response and prognosis when combined with TS expression in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We measured the maximum standard uptake value, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion  (TLG) of tumor lesions on pretreatment scan in 234 patients (age: 60.1 ± 9.4 years; males: 56.4%) with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC who were enrolled in the prospective phase II clinical trial. We investigated the correlation of the parameters with TS expression and the predictive values of the parameters compared with other clinical factors. Among these parameters, TLG was the most relevant parameter that had a significant correlation with TS expression (ρ = 0.192, P = 0.008). A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model revealed that high TLG was a significant independent predictor for treatment response (hazard ratio [HR]: .05; P = 0.027), progression-free survival (HR: 1.39; P = 0.043), and overall survival (HR: 1.65; P = 0.035) with other factors.

GSTZ1 is dysregulated in cancers; however, its role in tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic  in HCC cells on the basis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic  in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression. Targeting the NRF2 signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic approach for this subset of HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639424>SIK2 promotes reprogramming of glucose metabolism through PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in ovarian cancer.</a></h1><p>Salt-inducible kinase  (SIK2), which belongs to the AMP-activated protein kinase family, modulates various biological functions including fatty acid oxidation. However, the role of SIK2 in glucose metabolism reprogramming remains unclear in ovarian cancer (OC) cells. Here, we found that SIK2 significantly enhanced the Warburg effect of OC cells mainly through two mechanisms. On the one hand, SIK2 upregulated the expression of HIF-1α by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which directly upregulated the transcription of major glycolytic genes to promote . On the other hand, SIK2 promoted mitochondrial fission through phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 site, which inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, SIK2 promoted growth and metastasis of OC cells by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis, as well as enhancing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, the SIK2-mediated reprogramming of glucose metabolism played a critical role in growth and metastasis of OC cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SIK2 is a crucial regulator of glucose metabolism in OC cells through activation of PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1 phosphorylation-mediated mitochondrial fission, which plays a critical oncogenic role in OC cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MGO is mainly formed as a byproduct of  and, under physiological circumstances, detoxified by the glyoxalase system. MGO is the major precursor of non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and DNA, subsequently leading to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). MGO and MGO-derived AGEs can impact on organs and tissues affecting their functions and structure. This review summarizes the mechanisms through which MGO is formed, its detoxification by the glyoxalase system, and its effect on biochemical pathways in relation to the development of diabetes, vascular complications of diabetes and other age-related diseases. Although therapies to treat MGO-associated complications are not yet available for application in clinical practice, several strategies to lower MGO have been developed over the years. We will summarize several new directions to target MGO stress including glyoxalase inducers and MGO scavengers.

Early mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are linked to impaired glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. In this study, we investigated the effects of BPA on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. L6 myotubes were treated with BPA (1 nM-10 nM) during the last 24 h of differentiation. Following exposure to 10 nM of BPA, resting and maximal oxygen consumption rates were decreased, whereas mitochondrial proton leak was increased. Overall metabolic activity, measured by redox ability, was decreased in L6 myotubes exposed to 10 nM of BPA. At this concentration, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was increased, which corresponded to an increased phosphorylation of the insulin signaling protein Akt, and increased  measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Acute BPA exposure did not alter levels of oxidative stress markers in muscle cells, but significantly increased mitochondrial proton leak, which is known to be involved in decreased ROS production. The effects of BPA on glucose uptake, but not mitochondrial function, were reversed by the use of an estrogen receptor antagonist. These results suggest that acute exposure of L6 myotubes at only high concentrations of BPA alters glucose metabolism, which is likely a compensatory response to reduced mitochondrial energy production capacity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after  hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, .5±1.0 for the stomach, .±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain). In conclusion, [18F]FBQ-C2 can be used to perform high-contrast Gln imaging of tumors and can serve as a PET tracer for clinical research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524631>Enhancing  attenuates Parkinson's disease progression in models and clinical databases.</a></h1><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that lacks therapies to prevent progressive neurodegeneration. Impaired energy metabolism and reduced ATP levels are common features of PD. Previous studies revealed that terazosin (TZ) enhances the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), thereby stimulating  and increasing cellular ATP levels. Therefore, we asked whether enhancement of PGK1 activity would change the course of PD. In toxin-induced and genetic PD models in mice, rats, flies, and induced pluripotent stem cells, TZ increased brain ATP levels and slowed or prevented neuron loss. The drug increased dopamine levels and partially restored motor function. Because TZ is prescribed clinically, we also interrogated  distinct human databases. We found slower disease progression, decreased PD-related complications, and a reduced frequency of PD diagnoses in individuals taking TZ and related drugs. These findings suggest that enhancing PGK1 activity and increasing  may slow neurodegeneration in PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469916>CRAF methylation by PRMT6 regulates aerobic  driven hepatocarcinogenesis via ERK-dependent PKM2 nuclear relocalization and activation.</a></h1><p>Most tumor cells use aerobic  (the Warburg effect) to support anabolic growth and promote tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. In this work, using gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies in patient-derived organoid and cell cultures as well as in vivo PET-MRI animal models, we showed that PRMT6 regulates aerobic  in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through nuclear relocalization of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), a key regulator of the Warburg effect. We found PRMT6 to methylate CRAF at arginine 100, interfere with its RAS/RAF binding potential and as a result alter ERK-mediated PKM2 translocation into the nucleus. This altered PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 signaling axis was further confirmed in both a HCC mouse model with endogenous knockout of PRMT6 as well as in HCC clinical samples. We also identified PRMT6 as a novel target of hypoxia via the transcriptional repressor REST, linking PRMT6 with hypoxia in driving glycolytic events. Finally, we showed as a proof-of-concept the therapeutic potential of using -deoxyglucose (2DG), a  inhibitor, to reverse tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance mediated by PRMT6 deficiency in HCC. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 regulatory axis is an important determinant of the Warburg effect in tumor cells and provide a mechanistic link between tumorigenicity, sorafenib resistance and glucose metabolism.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544106>Metabolic Insights Into the Effects of Nutrient Stress on  B21.</a></h1><p> B21 is a strain of lactic acid bacteria first isolated from a fermented meat product from Vietnam. It is also a promising biopreservative with potential use in the food industry as it is a source of a novel bacteriocin (Plantacyclin B21AG) which has inhibitory effects against a wide range of species, including several pathogenic and spoilage strains. Nutrient stress is known to increase the survivability, storage stability, and bacteriocin production capability of  B21 during industrial processing. It is however, unknown what the underlying biochemical responses that control these abilities are. This study therefore investigates the metabolite profiles of  B21 using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS to further understand the biochemical responses of this strain to various stress events. Unstressed cells were found to use glucose as their primary energy source with high concentrations of metabolites involved in  and organic acid synthesis, such as lactic acid, acetic acid, propanoic acid, malic acid, and -butenedioic acid being present in these cells. In contrast, large numbers of metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism including alanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine, proline, and norleucine were upregulated in glucose stressed cells, indicating that they were using amino acids as their main source of energy. Differences in levels of fatty acids, particularly octadecenoic acid, tetracosanoic acid, and 7-hexadecenoic acid were also observed between stressed and unstressed cells.

All these processes require energy, and the predominant ATP generation route in endothelial cells is . However, it remains unclear how ATP reaches the plasma membrane and intercellular junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is required for sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the regulation of endothelial cell-junction dynamics and collective migration. We show that PKM2-silencing decreases ATP required for proper VE-cadherin internalization/traffic at endothelial cell-cell junctions.

The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated insulin renders neurons resistant to insulin. This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal insulin resistance reduces hexokinase , thus impairing . This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Previously, we established a database cataloging the transcriptional progression profile of oral carcinogenesis and identified several candidate genes with continuously increasing or decreasing expression, which specifically promote the transition of oral premalignant lesions to invasive carcinomas. In this study, using our microarray database, we attempted to determine significant genes that may contribute to metabolic alterations during oral carcinogenesis. After performing a literature survey, we focused on 15 candidate genes associated with glucose metabolism changes, particularly the tri-carboxylic acid cycle, and investigated the mRNA-expression status of these genes with our database. Only the solute carrier family  member 1 gene (also known as GLUT1), showed significantly increased mRNA expression during oral tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that GLUT1 protein expression significantly increased during oral carcinogenesis. In addition, tumors with high expression of this protein significantly correlated with nodal status (P=0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival curves clearly demonstrated the adverse impact of high GLUT1 protein expression on disease-free survival (P=0.004). GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression increased in the order of normal mucosal tissues, epithelial dysplastic lesions and invasive carcinomas. Therefore, metabolic alterations, especially in glucose metabolism, occurred at the very early stage of development of oral malignancies.

BIRC4/XIAP is the most potent anti-apoptotic IAP-member and it physically interacts with caspases  its BIR2 and its BIR3 domain. These domains are also critical for the interaction with mitochondria-derived SMAC/Diablo and with the IAP protein survivin. Survivin is frequently overexpressed in neuroblastoma due to a gain of 17q and we have demonstrated that survivin confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and reprograms metabolism of neuroblastoma cells towards . As regulator of mitochondrial fission and autophagy survivin acts at the crossroads of mitochondrial architecture, autophagy and cellular energy metabolism. : We tested the effect of SMAC-mimetics on the XIAP/survivin axis as modulator of cellular metabolism analysing mitochondrial morphology, metabolic intermediates and cellular survival. Finally, the impact of the combined treatment was evaluated in a xenograft neuroblastoma mouse model assessing the therapy effect on tumour size and volume. : Here we demonstrated that XIAP sequesters significant amounts of survivin within the cell that can be mobilized by so called SMAC-mimetics. SMAC-mimetics are drugs that are designed to bind with high affinity to XIAP-BIR2 / BIR3 domains to release caspases and re-sensitize XIAP-overexpressing tumors for chemotherapy. However, SMAC-mimetic treatment releases also survivin from XIAP and thereby induces mitochondrial fragmentation, prevents ROS accumulation and leads to the Warburg effect, an unwanted side effect of this therapy. Importantly, cells that drift into a highly glycolytic state due to SMAC-mimetic treatment become also highly sensitive to non-genotoxic treatment with  inhibitors such as -Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)  and . : A combinational therapy of non-genotoxic SMAC-mimetics and -inhibitors overcomes IAP-mediated cell survival in cancer and provides therefore an attractive usage of SMAC-mimetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494243>Mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mitochondrial superoxide and respiratory supercomplexes disassembly is connected with the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype of breast cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Tamoxifen resistance remains a clinical obstacle in the treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. It has been reported that tamoxifen is able to target respiratory complex I within mitochondria. Therefore, we established two tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, MCF7 Tam5R and T47D Tam5R resistant to 5 μM tamoxifen and investigated whether tamoxifen-resistant cells exhibit mitochondrial changes which could help them survive the treatment. The function of mitochondria in this experimental model was evaluated in detail by studying i) the composition and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes; ii) respiration and glycolytic status; iii) mitochondrial distribution, dynamics and reactive oxygen species production. We show that Tam5R cells exhibit a significant decrease in mitochondrial respiration, low abundance of assembled mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, a more fragmented mitochondrial network connected with DRP1 Ser637 phosphorylation, higher  and sensitivity to -deoxyglucose. Tam5R cells also produce significantly higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide but at the same time increase their antioxidant defense (CAT, SOD2) through upregulation of SIRT3 and show phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser 485/491. Importantly, MCF7 ρ0 cells lacking functional mitochondria exhibit a markedly higher resistance to tamoxifen, supporting the role of mitochondria in tamoxifen resistance. We propose that reduced mitochondrial function and higher level of reactive oxygen species within mitochondria in concert with metabolic adaptations contribute to the phenotype of tamoxifen resistance.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The physicochemical parameters such as titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) increased, whereas the pH slightly decreased during the ripening process. The highest contents of polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, tannins, vitamin C and the antioxidant capacities, measured by radical scavenging assays, were found in ripe and overripe fruits. The structural properties of extracted polyphenols were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The interaction of polyphenols with the main drug carrier in blood human serum albumin (HSA) showed decrease in its fluorescence intensity. The binding properties of polyphenols were in direct correlation with the antioxidant capacities of the investigated fruits. HepG2 cells evaluated cytotoxic effect and the mechanism of cell death after treatment with durian. The metabolism of carbohydrates was examined on the expression of -related genes (hexokinase  (HK2); 6-phosphofructo--kinase 4 (PFKFB4); facilitated glucose transporter member 1 (SLC2A1 (Glut1)) and lactate dehydrogenase A and utilization of glucose in the hepatocytes with durian treatment. Durian in immature stage had stronger cytotoxic effect and weak proapoptotic potential on HepG2 cells than the mature and overripe ones. The ripe and overripe fruits increased the expression of hepatic HK2 and PFKFB4 glycolytic genes and stimulated glucose utilization in HepG2 cells. The present results indicate that durians reveal different biological activity and may provide their broad and extensive use as medicinal or functional foods.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei survives low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions by adjusting its energy metabolism. In vertebrates, the transcription factor p53 regulates glucose metabolism under stress through diverse target genes like the Tp53-induced  and apoptotic regulator (TIGAR), a protein similar to fructose-,6-bisphosphatase that has a pro-survival role in cells participating in the defense against oxidative damage. Until now, TIGAR has been not reported in any invertebrate species, including crustaceans. In this work, we report the molecular cloning of the white shrimp TIGAR. The cDNA sequence is 765 bp encoding a 254 amino acid protein. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that although the overall sequence identities of L. vannamei TIGAR and vertebrate proteins are not very high (33.61%-35.34%), they have a remarkable predicted structural similarity with full conservation of catalytic residues, secondary and three-dimensional structures. Gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR revealed that the mRNA abundance of TIGAR in white shrimp is tissue-specific under normal oxygen conditions, with higher expression in gills than hepatopancreas and muscle. Also, gene expression in gills and hepatopancreas is modified by environmental hypoxia, suggesting that TIGAR participates in the cellular tolerance of L. vannamei to this stressor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether surveillance imaging predicts survival after AHCT.At the University of Minnesota, serial imaging for early relapse detection has been used prospectively for all consecutive AHCT recipients treated since 2010. This analysis included 91 AHCT recipients with DLBCL who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET at day +100 post-AHCT. (18)F-FDG-PET parameters included the Deauville (D) five-point scale, peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax), total legion  (TLG) and total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV). Survival of patients with clinically symptomatic versus asymptomatic radiographically detected relapsed DLBCL after AHCT was compared.Sixty patients experienced relapse; 35% was detected on day +100 surveillance PET scan. 5-year overall survival (OS) by (18)F-FDG-PET scan at day +100 post-AHCT was significantly lower in D4 and D5 patients (37%, 95% CI=14-100 and 25%, 95%CI=43-89) as compared to patients with D1 and D2 (62%, 95% CI=43-89 and 62%, 95% CI=46-84). TLG and TMTV were not prognostic. SUVmax at day +100 varied 1.5 (D1) to 17.9 (D5). In multivariate analysis, only SUVmax was predictive of relapse and OS; mortality increased 1.8-fold with each SUVmax doubling (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to .3; p<0.01). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range 1-12 years), lymphoma-related mortality was 1.8-fold higher among patients whose relapse was detected clinically (symptomatic) versus radiographically on surveillance scan (HR 1.8 [95% CI 0.9 to 3.4]; p=0.08).In patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, a routine PET imaging at day +100 post-AHCT detects asymptomatic relapse and high SUVmax identifies patients with poor expected survival of less than 1 year. Identifying this high-risk cohort can potentially highlight patients that might benefit from preemptive interventions to prevent or delay relapse.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic reprogramming directly controls T-cell function, imprinting distinct functional fates. However, its contribution to T-cell dysfunction and the immunopathogenesis of DCM is unknown. Here, we found that in DCM patients, CD4 T-cells exhibited immune dysfunction and glycolytic metabolic reprogramming based on extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption rates. Similar results were observed in splenic and cardiac CD4 T-cells from autoimmune-induced DCM mice. In vitro, the  inhibitor -deoxy-d-glucose (-DG) reversed T-cell dysfunction; thus, heightened metabolic activity directly controls CD4 T-cell immunological status. Adoptive transfer of CD4 T-cells from DCM mice to normal recipients induced cardiac remodeling and cardiac T-cell dysfunction. Strikingly, these effects were abolished by preconditioning cells with -DG, indicating that CD4 T-cell dysfunction partially induced by metabolic reprogramming contributes to cardiac remodeling. Moreover, the microRNA let-7i modulated the metabolism and function of T-cells from DCM mice by directly targeting Myc. Collectively, our results show that metabolic reprogramming occurs in T-cells of autoimmune-induced DCM mice and patients. Further, our findings highlight that glycolytic metabolism is a critical contributor to T-cell dysfunction and DCM immunopathogenesis. Our data position the modulation of the metabolism as a central integrator for T-cell function, representing a promising strategy against autoimmune-mediated DCM progression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Endpoints analyzed included activity of enzymes involved in  (pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), Krebs cycle (citrate synthase, CS; isocitrate dehydrogenase; IDH), electron transport chain (electron transport system, ETS) and pentose phosphate pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH). Coral polyps were kept under control conditions (25.0 ± 0.1 °C; .9 ± 0.7 μg/L Cu) or exposed to combined treatments of increasing temperature (26.6 ± 0.1 °C and 27.3 ± 0.1 °C) and concentrations of dissolved Cu (5.4 ± 0.9 and 8.6 ± 0.3 μg/L) for 4 and 12 days using a mesocosm system. PK activity was not affected by stressors. LDH, CS, IDH, ETS and G6PDH activities were temporally inhibited by stressors alone. CS, ETS and G6PDH activities remained inhibited by the combination of stressors after 12 days. Furthermore, all combinations between increasing temperature and exposure Cu were synergistic after prolonged exposure. Taken together, stressors applied alone led to temporary inhibitory effects on energy metabolism enzymes of the coral M. harttii, however, prolonged exposure reveals strong deleterious effects over the metabolism of corals due to the combination of stressors. The present study is the first one to give insights into the combined effects of increasing temperature and Cu exposure in the energy metabolism enzymes of a scleractinian coral.

However, little is known about how this vital ATP transport occurs across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca-antagonized mechanism, or  (-ntagonized ransport nto ). Significantly, we show that mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and a SERCA-dependent Ca gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER, through SLC35B1/AXER. We propose that under physiological conditions, increases in cytosolic Ca inhibit ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation () inhibitors and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP uptake from mitochondria into the ER.

During early osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and aggrecan loss are a first sign of tissue damage. However, our recent attempts to mimic hyaluronan loss with the hyaluronan inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) did not exacerbate arthritis-like features of in vitro models of arthritis, but surprisingly, caused the reverse, namely, provided potent chondroprotection. Moreover, the protective effects of 4MU did not depend on its role as a hyaluronan inhibitor. To understand the molecular mechanism in 4MU-mediated chondroprotection, we considered recent studies suggesting that shifts in intracellular UDP-hexose pools promote changes in metabolism. To determine whether such metabolic shifts are associated with the mechanism of 4MU-mediated pro-catabolic inhibition, using molecular and metabolomics approaches, we examined whether bovine and human chondrocytes exhibit changes in the contribution of  and mitochondrial respiration to ATP production rates as well as in other factors that respond to or might drive these changes. Both overexpression of HA synthase- and 4MU effectively reduced dependence on  in chondrocytes, especially enhanced  use by interleukin-1β (IL1β)-activated chondrocytes. The reduction in  secondarily enhanced mitochondrial respiration in chondrocytes, which, in turn, rescued phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels in the activated chondrocytes. Other  inhibitors, unrelated to hyaluronan biosynthesis, namely -deoxyglucose and dichloroacetate, caused metabolic changes in chondrocytes equivalent to those elicited by 4MU and similarly protected both chondrocytes and cartilage explants. These results suggest that fluxes in UDP-hexoses alter metabolic energy pathways in cartilage.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586055>Mitochondrial calcium exchange links metabolism with the epigenome to control cellular differentiation.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation is crucial for the initial healing response but excessive myofibroblast activation leads to pathological fibrosis. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying myofibroblast formation. Here we report that mitochondrial calcium (Ca) signaling is a regulatory mechanism in myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. We demonstrate that fibrotic signaling alters gating of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) in a MICU1-dependent fashion to reduce Ca uptake and induce coordinated changes in metabolism, i.e., increased  feeding anabolic pathways and glutaminolysis yielding increased α-ketoglutarate (αKG) bioavailability. Ca-dependent metabolic reprogramming leads to the activation of αKG-dependent histone demethylases, enhancing chromatin accessibility in loci specific to the myofibroblast gene program, resulting in differentiation. Our results uncover an important role for the mtCU beyond metabolic regulation and cell death and demonstrate that Ca signaling regulates the epigenome to influence cellular differentiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428230>Oleuropein-Induced Apoptosis Is Mediated by Mitochondrial Glyoxalase  in NSCLC A549 Cells: A Mechanistic Inside and a Possible Novel Nonenzymatic Role for an Ancient Enzyme.</a></h1><p>Oleuropein (OP) is a bioactive compound derived from plants of the genus Oleaceae exhibiting antitumor properties in several human cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent evidence suggests that OP has proapoptotic effects on NSCLC cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind the apoptogenic action of OP in NSCLC are still largely unknown. Glyoxalase  (Glo2) is an ancient enzyme belonging to the glyoxalase system involved in the detoxification of -derived methylglyoxal. However, emerging evidence suggests that Glo2 may have also nonenzymatic roles in some malignant cells. In the present study, we evaluated whether and how Glo2 participated in the proapoptotic effects of OP in NSCLC A549 cells. Our results indicate that OP is able to induce apoptosis in A549 cells through the upregulation of mitochondrial Glo2 (mGlo2), mediated by the superoxide anion and Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, our data shows that the proapoptotic role of mGlo2, observed following OP exposure, occurs via the interaction of mGlo2 with the proapoptotic Bax protein. Conversely, OP does not alter the behavior of nonmalignant human BEAS-2B cells or mGlo2 expression, thus suggesting a specific anticancer role for this bioactive compound in NSCLC. Our data identify a novel pathway through which OP exerts a proapoptotic effect in NSCLC and suggest, for the first time, a novel, nonenzymatic antiapoptotic role for this ancient enzyme in NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395059>Volumetric parameters on F-FDG PET/CT predict the survival of patients with gastric cancer associated with their expression status of c-MET.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of volumetric parameters on F- fluoro--deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in gastric-cancer patients, according to the expression status of c-MET (MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), which was previously unclear.The study included 61 patients with advanced gastric cancer. Data on the baseline F-FDG PET/CT, clinical-pathological information, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were collected. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), peak SUV (SUV), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG) of gastric tumors in situ were measured on PET/CT. The expression status of c-MET was recorded based on immunohistochemical staining. Associations between the parameters on PET/CT and patients' survival outcomes were analyzed in relation to expression status of c-MET.Patients with positive c-MET expression had significantly shorter PFS (11.5 vs. 17.6 months, P = 0.039) and OS (17.0 vs. 24.3 months, P = 0.043), and had gastric tumors with a larger MTV (70.8 ± 53.11 vs. 41.1 ± 52.32, P = 0.034) and TLG (428.39 ± 442.95 vs. 205.7 ± 354.40, P = 0.039), compared with those with negative c-MET expression. However, SUV (9.6 ± 7.40 vs. 8.0 ± 4.91, P = 0.335) and SUV (7.7 ± 5.99 vs. 6.62 ± 4.08, P = 0.438) were similar between these two patient groups. In patients with c-MET-positive tumors, MTV and TLG were independent factors in predicting patient OS after correction by distant metastasis (hazards ratio = 1.014 and 1.002, respectively; P = 0.024 and 0.027, respectively), while these associations were not significant in patients with c-MET-negative tumors.Patients with c-MET-positive gastric cancer had higher MTV and TLG values compared to those with c-MET-negative gastric cancer.

It frequently occurs in breast cancer, which is the leading form of malignant tumor among females worldwide. Although there are therapies that provide a possible method for this challenge, such as chemotherapy, the tumoral metabolic pathway is unconventional and favors metastasis and proliferation. This magnifies the difficulty of treating breast cancer. In this study, we identified -deoxyglucose ( DG) as an important  suppressor that can potentiate sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to inhibit migration and invasion. In addition, disruptions of the cell membrane microstructure were captured by a scanning electron microscope in cells treated with the co-therapy. Similarly, we detected blockages of the cell cycle process, using flow cytometry. Of note, we observed that hexokinase II (HK2), the rate-limiting enzyme of , was notably uncoupled from the mitochondria in SDT +  DG co-therapy group. Furthermore, there was altered expression of HK2 and Glut1, which control . Simultaneously, the in vivo results revealed that pulmonary metastasis was also seriously suppressed by SDT +  DG co-therapy. These results demonstrate this co-therapy is a promising strategy for breast cancer inhibition through metastasis and proliferation.Copyright © 2019 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

However, the molecular mechanism by which cardamonin inhibits breast cancer progression largely remains to be determined.CCK-8 and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect cell growth and apoptosis, respectively. HIF-1α driven transcription was measured by luciferase reporter assay. Glucose uptake and lactate content were detected with -NBDG and L-Lactate Assay Kit. Cell metabolism assays were performed on Agilent's Seahorse Bioscience XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with JC-1 probe. DCFH-DA was used to measure ROS level. Protein expression was detected by western blotting assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure the expression of HIF-1α, LDHA and CD31 in tumor tissues.Cardamonin inhibited growth of the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo by suppressing HIF-1α mediated cell metabolism. Cardamonin inhibited the expression of HIF-1α at mRNA and protein levels by repressing the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, and subsequently enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We also found that cardamonin inhibited the Nrf2-dependent ROS scavenging system which further increased intracellular ROS levels. Eventually, accumulation of the intracellular ROS induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, cardamonin treatment reduced glucose uptake as well as lactic acid production and efflux, suggesting its function in repressing the  process.These results reveal novel function of cardamonin in modulating cancer cell metabolism and suppressing breast cancer progression, and suggest its potential for breast cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551134>Development of a Novel Prognostic Risk Classification System for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to assess prognostic factors to better understand malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and to develop a new classification protocol beyond the standard tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 188 patients with MPM who had not undergone surgical resection. For each patient, we calculated the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion  (TLG) on pretreatment F-fluoro--deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we evaluated the relationships among potential MPM predictors, including age, gender, performance status, histologic type, stage, possible serum markers, and volume-based positron emission tomography parameters, as well as overall survival.The median survival was 461 days, and the 1- and -year overall survival rates were 60.70% and 31.10%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the significant independent predictors of poor survival outcomes were the non-epithelioid histologic type, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of ≥ 5.0, and a TLG of ≥ 525 g. We then used these results to develop a prognostic risk classification system. From the resulting survival curve, we found a significant difference among the 3 risk groups of independent variables. Moreover, there were significant differences between all pairs of  separated risk groups.Pathologic subtypes, serum lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and TLG in F-fluoro--deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography were independent and significant prognostic factors of MPM.

Complete glucose oxidation, non-oxidized  rates, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial network morphology, and the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics were determined in differentiated human myotubes.Myotubes derived from severely obese humans exhibited enhanced glucose oxidation (13.5%; 95% CI [7.6, 19.4], P = 0.043) and reduced non-oxidized  (-1.3%; 95% CI [-11.1, 8.6]) in response to insulin stimulation at 7 months after RYGB when compared with the presurgery state (-0.6%; 95% CI [-5., 4.0] and 19.5%; 95% CI [4.0, 35.0], P = 0.006), and were not different from the lean controls (16.7%; 95% CI [11.8, 21.5] and 1.9%; 95% CI [-1.6, 5.4], respectively).

This study aimed to assess the effects of a compressive load on cartilage using optical redox imaging.Cartilage samples were excised from porcine femoral condyles. To validate this imaging modality in cartilage,  was inhibited via -deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited by rotenone. Optical redox images were collected pre- and post-inhibition. To assess the effects of mechanical loading, samples were subjected to a compressive load and imaged for approximately 30 min. Load and strain parameters were determined using high-speed camera images in Matlab. A range of loading magnitudes and rates were applied across samples.2DG and rotenone demonstrated the expected inhibitory effects on fluorescence intensity in the channels corresponding to NAD(P)H and FAD, respectively. Mechanical loading induced an increase in NAD(P)H channel fluorescence which subsided by 30 min post-loading. Magnitude of loading parameters had mixed effects on metabolites.Optical redox imaging provides an opportunity to assess real-time metabolic activity in cartilage. This approach revealed a metabolic response to a single load and can be used to provide insight into the role of metabolism in mechanically-mediated cartilage degradation.Copyright © 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Although 18F-fluoro--deoxy-d-glucose is by far the most frequently used radiopharmaceutical in head and neck imaging,  is not the only metabolic process or biochemical pathway that can be visualized. In addition, 18F-fluoro--deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography can be limited due to the nonspecific nature of alterations in glucose metabolism. In this review, we will cover multiple of the emerging radiotracers that have been applied clinically or are in development as promising tools to better image certain malignancies and delineate disease from treatment effects. The potential advantages and disadvantages of these radiopharmaceuticals will also be discussed.Copyright © 2019.

This prognosis necessitates improved therapies for the disease. A target of interest for novel chemotherapies is the Warburg Effect, which describes the tumor's shift away from oxidative phosphorylation towards . Here, we elucidate GLUT1 (Glucose transporter 1) and one of its associated binding partners, TUBB4 (Tubulin 4), as potentially druggable targets in GBM. Using data mining approach, we demonstrate that GLUT1 is overexpressed as a function of tumor grade in astrocytoma's and that its overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis. Using both mass spectrometry performed on hGBM (human glioblastoma patient specimen) and in silico modeling, we show that GLUT1 interacts with TUBB4, and more accurately demonstrates GLUT1's binding with fasentin. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) and immunoprecipitation studies confirm GLUT1 interaction with TUBB4. Treatment of GSC33 and GSC28 cells with TUBB4 inhibitor, CR-42-24, reduces the expression of GLUT1 however, TUBB4 expression is unaltered upon fasentin treatment. Using human pluripotent stem cell antibody array, we demonstrate reduced levels of Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox2, Sox17, Snail and VEGFR2 (Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ) upon CR-42-24 treatment. Overall, our data confirm that silencing TUBB4 or GLUT1 reduce GSC tumorsphere formation, self-renewal and proliferation in vitro. These findings suggest GLUT1 and its binding partner TUBB4 as druggable targets that warrant further investigation in GBM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429924>Light-inducible flux control of triosephosphate isomerase on  in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>An engineering tool for controlling flux distribution on metabolic pathways to an appropriate state is highly desirable in bioproduction. An optogenetic switch, which regulates gene expression by light illumination is an attractive on/off switchable system, and is a promising way for flux control with an external stimulus. We demonstrated a light-inducible flux control between  and the methylglyoxal (MGO) pathway in Escherichia coli using a CcaS/CcaR system. CcaR is phosphorylated by green light and is dephosphorylated by red light. Phosphorylated CcaR induces gene expression under the cpcG2 promoter. The tpiA gene was expressed under the cpcG2 promoter in a genomic tpiA deletion strain. The strain was then cultured with glucose minimum medium under green or red light. We found that tpiA messenger RNA level under green light was four times higher than that under red light. The repression of tpiA expression led to a decrease in glycolytic flux, resulting in slower growth under red light (0.25 hr  ) when compared to green light (0.37 hr  ). The maximum extracellular MGO concentration under red light (0. mM) was higher than that under green light (0.05 mM). These phenotypes confirm that the MGO pathway flux was enhanced under red light.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p></html>
