Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics method was adopted to evaluate the effects of Phoenix dactylifera seeds, in particular the Algerian date variety of Deglet on the metabolome of the LPS-IFN-γ-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Variations in the extracellular and intracellular profiles emphasized the differences in the presence of , phenylalanine, alanine, proline, asparagine, isocitrate, inosine and lysine. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed noticeable clustering patterns between the treated and induced RAW cells based on the metabolic profile of the extracellular metabolites. However, the effects of treatment on the intracellular metabolites appears to be less distinct as suggested by the PCA and heatmap analyses. A clear group segregation was observed for the intracellular metabolites from the treated and induced cells based on the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plot. Likewise, 11 of the metabolites in the treated cells were significantly different from those in the induced groups, including amino acids and succinate. The enrichment analysis demonstrated that treatment with Deglet seed extracts interfered with the  and of amino acids metabolism. Overall, the obtained data reinforced the possible application of Deglet seeds as a functional food with anti-inflammatory properties.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

CS-GalN composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and contact angle goniometry. It was observed that CS-GalN composite exhibited different binding ability for Tyr enantiomers. Under optimized experimental conditions, the oxidation peak current ratio of L-Tyr to D-Tyr (I/I) and the difference between their peak potentials (ΔEp = E-E) were 1.70 and 28 mV at CS-GalN/GCE by square wave voltammetry (SWV). In addition, the peak currents increase linearly with the concentration of Tyr enantiomers in the concentration range 0.01-1.00 mM with detection limits of 0.65 μM and 0.86 μM for L-Tyr and D-Tyr (S/N = 3), respectively. CS-GalN/GCE also exhibited the ability to determine the percentage of D-Tyr in the racemic mixture. In addition, CS-GalN/GCE possessed remarkable sensitivity, great stability as well as fine reproducibility. It could be concluded that the chiral interface of CS-GalN/GCE can provide an ideal platform for electrochemical recognition and determination of Tyr enantiomers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

What are the interactions between sleep and appetite following early evening high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE)? What is the main finding and its importance? HIIE can be performed in the early evening without subsequent sleep disruptions and may favourably alter appetite-related hormone concentrations. Nonetheless, perceived appetite and  intake do not change with acute HIIE regardless of time of day.Despite exercise benefits for sleep and appetite, due to increased time restraints, many adults remain inactive. Methods to improve exercise compliance include preferential time-of-day or engaging in short-duration, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Hence, this study aimed to compare effects of HIIE time-of-day on sleep and appetite. Eleven inactive men undertook sleep monitoring to determine baseline (BASE) sleep stages and exclude sleep disorders. On separate days, participants completed 30 min HIIE (60 s work at 100%  , 240 s rest at 50%  ) in (1) the morning (MORN; 06.00-07.00 h), (2) the afternoon (AFT; 14.00-16.00 h) and (3) the early evening (EVEN: 19.00-20.00 h). Measures included appetite-related hormones (acylated ghrelin, leptin, peptide  ) and glucose pre-exercise, 30 min post-exercise and the next morning; overnight polysomnography (PSG; sleep stages); and actigraphy, self-reported sleep and food diaries for 48 h post-exercise. There were no between-trial differences for total sleep time (P = 0.46). Greater stage N3 sleep was recorded for MORN (23 ± 7%) compared to BASE (18 ± 7%; P = 0.02); however, no between-trial differences existed (P > 0.05). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was lower and non-REM sleep was higher for EVEN compared to BASE (P ≤ 0.05). At 30 min post-exercise, ghrelin was higher for AFT compared to MORN and EVEN (P = 0.01), while glucose was higher for MORN compared to AFT and EVEN (P ≤ 0.02). No between-trial differences were observed for perceived appetite (P ≥ 0.21) or  intake (P = 0.57). Early evening HIIE can be performed without subsequent sleep disruptions and reduces acylated ghrelin. However, perceived appetite and  intake appear to be unaffected by HIIE time of day.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the mechanisms of these IF benefits in humans require further investigation. This study sought to elucidate some of these mechanisms through secondary analyses of the Fasting and ExprEssion of Longevity Genes during fOOD abstinence (FEELGOOD) trial, in which apparently healthy participants were randomized in a Latin square design to a 24-h water-only fast and a 24-h ad libitum fed day. Two pathways were investigated, with trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) levels measured due to their association with elevated risk of CAD, along with conductance of a broad panel of metabolic analytes. Measurements were made at baseline, at the end of the fasting day, and at the end of the fed day. A fasting mean of 14.3 ng in TMAO was found versus the baseline mean of 27.1 ng with  = 0.019, although TMAO levels returned to baseline on refeeding. Further, acute alterations in levels of proline, , galactitol, and urea plasma levels were observed along with changes in 24 other metabolites during the fasting period. These acute changes reveal short-term mechanisms which, with consistent repeated episodes of IF, may lead to improved health and reduced risk of CAD and diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918104>Changes in hepatic metabolic profile during the evolution of STZ-induced diabetic rats via an H NMR-based metabonomic investigation.</a></h1><p> The present study aimed to explore the changes in the hepatic metabolic profile during the evolution of diabetes mellitus (DM) and verify the key metabolic pathways.  Liver samples were collected from diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and rats in the control group at 1, 5, and 9 weeks after STZ administration. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H NMR)-based metabolomics was used to examine the metabolic changes during the evolution of DM, and partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to identify the key metabolites.  We identified 40 metabolites in the H NMR spectra, and 11 metabolites were further selected by PLS-DA model. The levels of α-glucose and β-glucose, which are two -related metabolites, gradually increased over time in the DM rats, and were significantly greater than those of the control rats at the three-time points. The levels of choline, betaine, and methionine decreased in the DM livers, indicating that the protective function in response to liver injury may be undermined by hyperglycemia. The levels of the other amino acids (leucine, alanine, glycine, , and phenylalanine) were significantly less than those of the control group during DM development.  Our results suggested that the hepatic metabolic pathways of glucose, choline-betaine-methionine, and amino acids were disturbed during the evolution of diabetes, and that choline-betaine-methionine metabolism may play a key role.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115639>The Association of Aromatic Amino Acids with Incident Hip Fracture, aBMD, and Body Composition from the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h1><p>In 5187 persons from the Cardiovascular Health Study, there was no significant association of dietary intakes of aromatic amino acids (AAA) with areal BMD of the hip or body composition. However, those who had the lowest dietary intakes of AAA were at increased risk for incident hip fractures. Prior studies of the association of protein intake with osteoporosis are conflicting and have not directly examined the relationship of aromatic amino acids (AAA) with fractures, areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and body composition. We sought to determine the relationship of dietary intakes of AAA with osteoporosis parameters in elderly men and women. 5187 men and women aged ≥ 65 years from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) with dietary intakes of AAA (tryptophan, phenylalanine, ) estimated by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were included. We examined the relationship between a one-time estimate of daily dietary AAA intake with risk of incident hip fractures over a median of 13.2 years of fracture follow-up. A subset (n = 1336) who had dual  X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) performed were included in a cross-sectional analysis of the association of dietary AAA intake with aBMD of the total hip and measurements of body composition. In multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, medication use, and diet, higher dietary AAA intake was not significantly associated with incident hip fractures. All hazard ratios (HR) were less than one (tryptophan, HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.89; phenylalanine, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.55; , HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.32), but confidence intervals were wide and included no difference. However, in post hoc analyses, the lowest quartile of intake for each AAA was associated with an increased risk for hip fracture compared to higher quartiles (p ≤ 0.047 for all). Dietary AAA intakes were not significantly associated with total hip aBMD or any measurements of body composition. Overall, there was no significant association of dietary AAA intake with hip fractures, aBMD of the hip, or body composition. However, there may be a subset of elderly individuals with low dietary intakes of AAA who are at increased for hip fractures.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937130>H NMR-based metabolomic study of metabolic profiling for pollinosis.</a></h1><p>Allergic rhinitis is the main symptom of pollinosis, relieved by non-specific treatment universally. This study aimed to find the changes of serum metabolites between the seizure and remission periods of pollinosis and provide assistance in the diagnosis and/or therapy.Metabonomics based on H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to study the 37 serum samples of pollinosis patients.We believed that the decreased levels of isoleutine, leutine, valine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, allo-threonine, alanine, methionine, glutamine, lysine, glycine, , histidine, phenylalanine, lactate, acetate, O-acetylcholine, creatine and creatinine and the increased level of -acetylglutamine at the seizure stage were statistically significant.Pollinosis could change the metabolic profiles of , amino acid and lipid in patients, which might be the diagnosis and/or prognosis markers for hay fever patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696244>Orientation of Biotin-Binding Sites in Streptavidin Adsorbed onto the Surface of Polythiophene Films.</a></h1><p>The orientation of biotin-binding sites of streptavidin adsorbed to thin films of three polythiophenes (PTs), namely, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RP3HT), regiorandom poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT), and poly(3,3‴-didodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT12), has been investigated. Polymer films were examined prior to and after protein adsorption with atomic force microscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) applied to ToF-SIMS data revealed subtle changes in surface chemistry of polymer films and orientation of adsorbed streptavidin. PCA resolved the surface alignment of alkyl side chains and differentiated the ToF-SIMS data for PQT12, RP3HT, and P3BT, verifying an amorphous morphology for P3BT and a semicrystalline one for PQT12 and RP3HT. After the characterization of the polymeric films, streptavidin adsorption from solutions with different protein concentrations (up to 300 μg/mL) has been conducted. The PCA results distinguished between amino acids characteristic for external regions of streptavidin molecules adsorbed to different PTs suggest that streptavidin adsorbed to PQT12 exposes molecular regions rich in tryptophan and , which are components of the biotin-binding sites. The latter results were confirmed using biotin-labeled horse radish peroxidase to estimate the exposed binding sites of streptavidin adsorbed onto the different PT films. The analysis of streptavidin structure suggests that interaction between polythiophene film and dipole moment of streptavidin subunit is responsible for orientation of biotin-binding sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832316>Characterization of Yak Common Biofluids Metabolome by Means of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic profiles of yak () serum, feces, and urine by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR), to serve as a reference guide for the healthy yak milieu. A total of 108 metabolites, giving information about diet, protein digestion, and  generation or gut-microbial co-metabolism, were assigned across the three biological matrices. A core metabolome of 15 metabolites was ubiquitous across all biofluids. Lactate, acetate, and creatinine could be regarded as the most abundant metabolites in the metabolome of serum, feces, and urine, respectively. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the molecules identified could be able to give thorough information about four main metabolic pathways, namely valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis; glutamine and glutamate metabolism; and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298176>Biological underpinnings from psychosocial stress towards appetite and obesity during youth: research implications towards metagenomics, epigenomics and metabolomics.</a></h1><p>Psychosocial stress, uncontrolled eating and obesity are three interrelated epidemiological phenomena already present during youth. This broad narrative conceptual review summarises main biological underpinnings of the stress-diet-obesity pathway and how new techniques can further knowledge. Cortisol seems the main biological factor from stress towards central adiposity; and diet, physical activity and sleep are the main behavioural pathways. Within stress-diet, the concepts of comfort food and emotional eating are highlighted, as cortisol affects reward pathways and appetite brain centres with a role for insulin, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), endocannabinoids, orexin and gastrointestinal hormones. More recently researched biological underpinnings are microbiota, epigenetic modifications and metabolites. First, the gut microbiota reaches the stress-regulating and appetite-regulating brain centres via the gut-brain axis. Second, epigenetic analyses are recommended as diet, obesity, stress and gut microbiota can change gene expression which then affects appetite,  homeostasis and stress reactivity. Finally, metabolomics would be a good technique to disentangle stress-diet-obesity interactions as multiple biological pathways are involved. Saliva might be an ideal biological matrix as it allows metagenomic (oral microbiota), epigenomic and metabolomic analyses. In conclusion, stress and diet/obesity research should be combined in interdisciplinary collaborations with implementation of several -omics analyses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826349>Indication of quantum mechanical electron transport in human substantia nigra tissue from conductive atomic force microscopy analysis.</a></h1><p>Neuromelanin and ferritin in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra have a distribution and density that is similar to disordered arrays of quantum dots in photovoltaic devices, which have been experimentally shown to conduct electric  using quantum mechanical electron transport mechanisms.

Each amino acid has an amino group, a carboxylic acid, and a unique carbon structure. Human utilize 21 different amino acids; most of these can be synthesized endogenously, but 9 are "essential" in that they must be ingested in the diet. In addition to their role as building blocks of protein, amino acids are key  source (ketogenic, glucogenic or both), are building blocks of Kreb's (aka TCA) cycle intermediates and other metabolites, and recycled as needed. A metabolic defect in the metabolism of  (homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency) historically defined Archibald Garrod as key architect in linking biochemistry, genetics and medicine and creation of the term 'Inborn Error of Metabolism' (IEM). The key concept of a single gene defect leading to a single enzyme dysfunction, leading to "intoxication" with a precursor in the metabolic pathway was vital to linking genetics and metabolic disorders and developing screening and treatment approaches as described in other chapters in this issue. Amino acid disorders also led to the evolution of the field of metabolic nutrition and offending amino acid restricted formula and foods. This review will discuss the more common disorders caused by inborn errors in amino acid metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536605>Structural characterization of EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation using molecular dynamics simulation.</a></h1><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a  kinase receptor important in diverse biological processes including cell proliferation and survival. Upregulation of EGFR activity due to over-expression or mutation is widely implicated in cancer. Activating somatic mutations of the EGFR kinase are postulated to affect the conformation and/or stability of the protein, shifting the EGFR inactive-active state equilibrium towards the activated state. Here, we examined a common EGFR deletion mutation, Δ746ELREA750, which is frequently observed in non-small cell lung cancer patients. By using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigated the structural effects of the mutation that lead to the experimentally reported increases in kinase activity. Simulations of the active form wild-type and ΔELREA EGFRs revealed the deletion stabilizes the αC helix of the kinase domain, which is located adjacent to the deletion site, by rigidifying the flexible β3-αC loop that accommodates the ELREA sequence. Consequently, the αC helix is stabilized in the "αC-in" active conformation that would prolong the time of the activated state. Moreover, in the mutant kinase, a salt bridge between E762 and K745, which is key for EGFR activity, was also stabilized during the simulation. Additionally, the interaction between EGFR and ATP was favored by ΔELREA EGFR over wild-type EGFR, as reflected by the number of hydrogen bonds formed and the free  of binding. Simulation of inactive EGFR suggested the deletion would promote a shift from the inactive conformation towards active EGFR, which is supported by the inward movement of the αC helix. The MDS results also align with the effects of  kinase inhibitors on ΔELREA and wild-type EGFR lung cancer cell lines, where more pronounced inhibition was observed against ΔELREA than for wild-type EGFR by inhibitors recognizing the active kinase conformation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548435>Visible light accelerates the ultraviolet A-induced degradation of eumelanin and pheomelanin.</a></h1><p>Exposure to excess ultraviolet (UV) A radiation induces the degradation/modification of both eumelanin and pheomelanin that may be deleterious to pigmented tissues. Although the spectral distribution of solar  comprises nearly half of visible light (VL), few studies have been conducted to examine the role of VL in the photodegradation of both types of melanin, either VL alone or in combination with UVA. In this study, we examined the effects of physiological doses of VL (150 to 300 J cm ) alone or in combination with a physiological dose of UVA (20 J cm ) in normal human epidermal melanocytes. The degradation/modification of melanin structures was evaluated by our chemical degradation-high performance liquid chromatography methods. The results show that VL accelerates UVA-induced changes in the structural features of both eumelanin and pheomelanin, although VL or UVA alone induced only minor changes in melanin structure. The differential spectral method provides support for the additive effects of VL.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One possible way of overcoming drug resistance is combination therapy. Epigenetic modifier is one of the candidate drug group. A recent evidence suggests that cell metabolism is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic abnormalities lead to changes in metabolism and may contribute to drug resistance and progression of RCC. Consequently, we investigated whether trichostatin A (TSA), a potent histone-deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, alters sunitinib-induced cytotoxicity and metabolism in RCC cells at epigenetic regulatory concentrations. Combined metabolome and transcriptome analysis suggested that TSA impacts on  productive metabolic pathways, such as those involving TCA cycle and nucleotide metabolism especially for increase of hyperphosphorylated form. Combination of sunitinib and TSA increased cell death with PARP cleavage, an early marker of mitochondrial apoptosis, whereas receptor  kinase signaling, which is the target of sunitinib, was not altered by TSA. Finally, the established sunitinib resistant-RCC cell (786-O Res) was also exposed to sunitinib and TSA combination, resulting in significant growth inhibition. In summary, it was suggested that TSA reduces sunitinib resistance by triggering intracellular metabolome shifts regarding  metabolism, that is the first recognized mechanism as an HDAC inhibitor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Male and female C57BL/6J weanlings were used, initially 19 days of age, and malnutrition was produced using a nitrogen-deficient diet. In preliminary work ten daily subcutaneous 1.0 µg doses of murine Flt3L, comparable to a protocol effective in humans, expanded the splenic conventional dendritic cell compartment (CD11cF4/80) of healthy weanlings without affecting the numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, or recoverable mononuclear cells. Two subsequent experiments showed that, despite advancing malnutrition, exogenous Flt3L was able both to exert its classic influence on splenic conventional dendritic cell numbers and to invigorate the attenuated primary splenic cell-mediated inflammatory response to sheep erythrocytes. A final experiment showed that the cytokine intervention did not affect dendritic cell maturity according to several phenotypic indices. The findings provide new support for the proposition that dendritic cell numbers are the first limiting factor in the weak cell-mediated immune competence of acute pre-pubescent malnutrition. More substantially, intervention with Flt3L sustained an inflammatory systemic immune character despite progressive weanling malnutrition and weight loss. This outcome provides new support of fundamental character for the Tolerance Model which posits that the cell-mediated inflammatory incompetence of acute pre-pubescent protein and  deficits is a regulated adaptive attempt, the antithesis of the classic paradigm of unregulated immunological attrition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, acceleration of peroxynitrite formation and elevation of the nitrated protein pool within pathogen structures were observed mainly during the  MP 946-potato interaction.

However, the mechanism of the therapeutic process is still not fully understood. Metabolomic technique can be used to explore the mechanisms underlying the treatment of TBI with XFZYD. The purpose of this work was to investigate the metabolic characteristics of blood samples from rats with and without XFZYD treatment and the dynamic changes in metabolite profiles on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 after injury (within the severe phase of TBI) based on untargeted UPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS analysis. Pattern recognition, clustering analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were used to analyse the metabolomic data of three groups (a sham-operated group, a TBI model, and an XFZYD-treated TBI model). The results showed that XFZYD reversed the abnormalities in the levels of small-molecule metabolites (such as L-acetylcarnitine, L-tryptophan, indoleacrylic acid, γ-aminobutyric acid, hypotaurine, LysoPC(18:1)(11Z), creatine, L-phenylalanine and L-leucine) in TBI rats through six metabolic pathways (including phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism) involved in the therapy process. XFZYD regulated the metabolic disorders of endogenous markers by the possible mechanisms of neuroprotection,  metabolism, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. This study revealed the holistic and dynamic metabolic changes caused by XFZYD in rats with TBI and provided important research methods and approaches for exploring the multiple metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in the therapeutic effect of XFZYD on TBI.Copyright © 2019.

Alternatively, organic thin layers have also been successfully depth profiled with a low- cesium ion beam (Cs), to exploit the high chemical reactivity of cesium atoms, acting as free-radical scavengers. Despite of this, little is known about the depth resolution associated with low- Cs sputtering on organic multilayers. In this work, amino acids multilayers, consisting of phenylalanine delta layers alternated with  spacers, were used as model systems to assess the depth resolution associated with 500 eV Cs depth profiles. High yields were obtained for quasi-molecular ions from both amino acids, and no significant chemical alteration was noticed under the monoatomic bombardment. A depth resolution as low as 4 nm is demonstrated without sensible degradation on a rather long profile depth (300 nm). Limited depth resolution (> 10 nm) along with high molecular degradation was previously reported on similar systems by combining low- Cs with Ga analysis beam. The use of the Bi analysis beam results in a dramatic improvement of both the characteristic molecular signal intensities and the depth resolution. Even though the analysis beam fluence is very low compared to the sputtering beam fluence, data suggest that further reducing the analysis Bi fluence could improve the depth resolution by ~ 1 nm.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644969>Comparative non-targeted metabolomic analysis reveals insights into the mechanism of rice yellowing.</a></h1><p>Yellowing of rice during storage is a highly concerned issue for managing rice quality whereas the yellowing mechanism is not clearly elucidated so far. Thus, the comparative untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed in this study. The results revealed that glycolysis pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were significantly enhanced in yellowed rice, indicating the activated  metabolism was trigged during the yellowing process. In addition, the increased aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic acid and benzoic acid) and their precursors (phenylalanine, ) suggested the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in yellowed rice, which is an antioxidant defense related pathway. In particular, the pathways involved in the metabolism of glutamate and arginine also significantly altered in yellowed rice. Therefore, the enriched pathways of increased amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the TCA cycle during yellowing process are proposed to be associated with the response of heat and dry induced by the yellowing process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study primarily aims to define the metabolomic signature of PBC after comparison with healthy controls (HC). Second, it aims to evaluate the possible metabolic association between PBC and celiac disease (CD), an immune-mediated disorder frequently associated with PBC. Serum and urine samples from 20 PBC, 21 CD, and 19 sex-matched HC subjects were collected. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for all samples were acquired, and multivariate statistics were used to evaluate the differences among the three groups and to provide information about the involved metabolites. The classification accuracies to discriminate PBC and HC groups were 78.9-84.6% for serum and 76.9% for urine. In comparison to HC, PBC patient sera were characterized by altered levels ( p value <0.05) of pyruvate, citrate, glutamate, glutamine, serine, , phenylalanine, and lactate. PBC patient urine showed lower levels ( p value <0.05) of trigonelline and hippurate with respect to HC. Furthermore, the NMR metabolomic fingerprint was able to cluster PBC with respect to CD patients, and the classification accuracies in the discriminations between these groups were 81.9-91.7% for serum and 77.7% for urine. Our results show that PBC displays a unique metabolomic fingerprint, which led to speculation about an impaired  metabolism, probably associated with an altered gut microbiota. PBC and CD showed two distinct metabolic fingerprints. These data could provide clues for the comprehension of the PBC pathogenetic mechanisms and the detection of novel therapeutic targets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31087984>[Assessing Performance of Pollutant Removal from Municipal Wastewater by Physical and Chemical Methods Based on Membranes].</a></h1><p>The removal characteristics of various pollution factors in municipal wastewater by membrane-based physical and chemical treatment, especially the enrichment characteristics of dissolved organic matter, were investigated by high performance liquid chromatography and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that the municipal wastewater had a low COD/TN ratio after the treatment. The micro-flocculation filtration mainly enriched the non-dissolvable organic matter in the raw water and aromatic protein substances with relative molecular mass greater than 30 000. The enrichment degree was up to 60.93%, especially for -like and tryptophan-like substances. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) with a molecular weight greater than 30 000 was enriched fully by 0.45 μm and 0.22 μm acetate membranes, but the microfiltration membrane was not selective for the enrichment of organic matter. Thus, NF mainly enriched the fulvic acid and humic acid in urban sewage. The enrichment degree was 52.01% and 53.57%, respectively, and the total enrichment degree of dissolved organic matter was about 42%.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914305>Mechanisms underpinning AMP-activated protein kinase-related effects on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of depression.</a></h1><p>Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for whole-body  metabolism regulation. Recent studies have suggested that physical exercise ameliorates depressive-like behaviors via AMPK activation; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of AMPK activation on depressive-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice. We treated OBX mice with the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleotide (AICAR) on the 7th or 14th day after bilateral bulbectomy and evaluated depressive-like behavior using the tail-suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) on the 21st day. The expression of phosphorylated AMPK, protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis and localization of AMPK and phosphorylated NF-κB were examined by immunohistochemistry. Chronic AICAR treatment suppressed the prolonged immobility of OBX mice in the TST and FST, and increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK, PKCζ, NF-κB, CREB, and BDNF. Hippocampal neurogenesis in OBX mice was promoted by chronic AICAR treatment. Co-administration of AICAR with the PKCζ inhibitor or the neurotrophic  kinase receptor type 2 (TrkB) antagonist, ANA-12, inhibited these effects. Phosphorylated AMPK was detected in mature and immature hippocampal neurons and microglia, while phosphorylated NF-κB was detected only in neurons in AICAR-treated OBX mice. These data indicate that AMPK activation produces anti-depressant effects, which are mediated by elevated hippocampal neurogenesis potentially via PKCζ/NF-κB/BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling in neurons.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lid 1 region was stabilized by 17 hydrogen bond linkages and displayed lower mean hydrophobicity (0.596) compared to MIS38 lipase. Mutating lid 1 residues, Thr-52 and Gly-55 to aromatic hydrophobic-polar  would churned more side-chain interactions between lid 1 and water or toluene. This study revealed that T52Y leads G55Y and its recombinant towards achieving higher solvent-accessible surface area and longer half-life at 25 to 37 °C in 0.5% (v/v) toluene. T52Y also exhibited better substrate affinity with long-chain carbon substrate in aqueous media. The affinity for pNP palmitate, laurate and caprylate increased in 0.5% (v/v) toluene in recombinant AMS8, but the affinity in similar substrates was substantially declined in lid 1 mutated lipases. Regarding enzyme efficiency, the recombinant AMS8 lipase displayed highest value of k/K in 0.5% (v/v) toluene, mainly with NPC. In both hydrolysis reactions with 0% and 0.5% (v/v) toluene, the enzyme efficiency of G55Y was found higher than T52Y for NPL and NPP. At 0.5% (v/v) toluene, both mutants showed reductions in activation  and enthalpy values as temperature increased from 25 to 35 °C, displaying better catalytic functions. Only T52Y exhibited increase in entropy values at 0.5% (v/v) toluene indicating structure stability. As a conclusion, Thr-52 and Gly-55 are important residues for lid 1 stability as their existence helps to retain the geometrical structure of alpha-helix and connecting hinge.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128178>Insight into ponatinib resistance mechanisms in rhabdomyosarcoma caused by the mutations in FGFR4  kinase using molecular modeling strategies.</a></h1><p>Novel efficacious treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with less toxicity has yet to emerge. Genomic analysis of RMS has reported that the receptor  kinase FGFR4 is highly expressed and frequently mutated in the tumor tissue. The V550E/L and N535D/K mutations of FGFR4 in RMS can lead to strong drug resistance to almost all of the type-I inhibitors. Previous report has demonstrated the type-II inhibitor ponatinib is the most potentially effective agent for RMS but still hard to starboard the V550E/L mutants. In this case, an ensemble of molecular modeling strategies was employed to theoretically uncover the resistance mechanisms. The binding free  calculation results predicted by various strategies show that the V550E/L rather than N535D/K mutations indeed weaken the binding affinity of ponatinib, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations. Subsequently, the  decomposition analysis mapped a knock-on effect on the diverse  components of some key residues. Moreover, it is of great importance to report that there is an effective channel for type-II inhibitors sliding along the A-loop to prevent FGFR4 from phosphorylation and activation. Our results provide new insight into drug binding process and guide the development of effective inhibitors to surmount drug resistance in RMS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we describe our approach for estimating the thermodynamic profile of the binding sites identified by MixMD. First, we establish a framework for calculating free energies from MixMD simulations, and we compare our approach to alternative methods. Second, we present a means to obtain a relative ranking of the binding sites by their configurational entropy. The theoretical maximum and minimum free  and entropy values achievable under such a framework along with the limitations of the techniques are discussed. Using this approach, the free  and relative entropy ranking of the top-four MixMD binding sites were computed and analyzed across our allosteric protein targets: Abl Kinase, Androgen Receptor, Pdk1 Kinase, Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase, Chk1 Kinase, Glucokinase, and Protein  Phosphatase 1B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30895179>Angiogenic Endothelial Cell Signaling in Cardiac Hypertrophy and Heart Failure.</a></h1><p>Endothelial cells are, by number, one of the most abundant cell types in the heart and active players in cardiac physiology and pathology. Coronary angiogenesis plays a vital role in maintaining cardiac vascularization and perfusion during physiological and pathological hypertrophy. On the other hand, a reduction in cardiac capillary density with subsequent tissue hypoxia, cell death and interstitial fibrosis contributes to the development of contractile dysfunction and heart failure, as suggested by clinical as well as experimental evidence. Although the molecular causes underlying the inadequate (with respect to the increased oxygen and  demands of the hypertrophied cardiomyocyte) cardiac vascularization developing during pathological hypertrophy are incompletely understood. Research efforts over the past years have discovered interesting mediators and potential candidates involved in this process. In this review article, we will focus on the vascular changes occurring during cardiac hypertrophy and the transition toward heart failure both in human disease and preclinical models. We will summarize recent findings in transgenic mice and experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy on factors expressed and released from cardiomyocytes, pericytes and inflammatory cells involved in the paracrine (dys)regulation of cardiac angiogenesis. Moreover, we will discuss major signaling events of critical angiogenic ligands in endothelial cells and their possible disturbance by hypoxia or oxidative stress. In this regard, we will particularly highlight findings on negative regulators of angiogenesis, including protein  phosphatase-1B and tumor suppressor p53, and how they link signaling involved in cell growth and metabolic control to cardiac angiogenesis. Besides endothelial cell death, phenotypic conversion and acquisition of myofibroblast-like characteristics may also contribute to the development of cardiac fibrosis, the structural correlate of cardiac dysfunction. Factors secreted by (dysfunctional) endothelial cells and their effects on cardiomyocytes including hypertrophy, contractility and fibrosis, close the vicious circle of reciprocal cell-cell interactions within the heart during pathological hypertrophy remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30608127>Genetically Encoded FRET Biosensor for Visualizing EphA4 Activity in Different Compartments of the Plasma Membrane.</a></h1><p>The EphA4 receptor  kinase is well-known for its pivotal role in development, cancer progression, and neurological disorders. However, how EphA4 kinase activity is regulated in time and space still remains unclear. To visualize EphA4 activity in different membrane microdomains, we developed a sensitive EphA4 biosensor based on Förster resonance  transfer (FRET), and targeted it in or outside raft-like microdomains in the plasma membrane. We showed that our biosensor can produce a robust and specific FRET response upon EphA4 activation, both in vitro and in live cells. Interestingly, we observed stronger FRET responses for the non-raft targeting biosensor than for the raft targeting biosensor, suggesting that stronger EphA4 activation may occur in non-raft regions. Further investigations revealed the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in suppressing EphA4 activity in raft-like microdomains. Therefore, our FRET-based EphA4 biosensor could serve as a powerful tool to visualize and investigate EphA4 activation and signaling in specific subcellular compartments of single live cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563058>Structure-Based Drug Design Studies Toward the Discovery of Novel Chalcone Derivatives as Potential Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-1 (EGFR), a transmembrane  kinase receptor (RTK), has been associated with several types of cancer, including breast, lung, ovarian, and anal cancers. Thus, the receptor was targeted by a variety of therapeutic approaches for cancer treatments. A series of chalcone derivatives are among the most highly potent and selective inhibitors of EGFR described to date. A series of chalcone derivatives were proposed in this study to investigate the intermolecular interactions in the active site utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. After a careful analysis of docking results, compounds  and  were chosen for molecular dynamics simulation study. Extensive hydrogen bond analysis throughout 7 ns molecular dynamics simulation revealed the ability of compounds  and  to retain the essential interactions needed for the inhibition, especially MET 93.

Compound  showed to have a close binding  with TAK-285 (-66.17 kcal/mol), which indicates a high chance for compound  to exhibit inhibitory activity, thus recommending to synthesis it to test its biological activity.

The main purpose of this study was to assess the role of  nitration of mitochondrial proteins in postischemic contractile dysfunction known as myocardial stunning. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were subjected to 20-min global ischemia followed by 30-min reperfusion. The reperfused hearts showed marked decline in left ventricular developed pressure, maximal rate of contraction (+dP/dt), and maximal rate of relaxation (-dP/dt). Immunofluorescence and ELISA assays demonstrated enhanced protein  nitration in reperfused hearts. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, eight mitochondrial proteins were identified to be nitrated after ischemia reperfusion. These proteins are crucial in mitochondrial electron transport, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP synthesis, and control of high- phosphates. The proteome data also indicated reduced abundance in several of nitrated proteins. The results suggest that these changes may contribute to inhibition of aconitase activity but are unlikely to affect electron transport chain activity. Whether  nitration of mitochondrial proteins can be considered the contributing factor of postischemic contractile dysfunction remains to be explored.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535578>Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels.</a></h1><p>Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, , and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with  metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and  metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146528>Geometric and Electronic Structure Contributions to O-O Cleavage and the Resultant Intermediate Generated in Heme-Copper Oxidases.</a></h1><p>This study investigates the mechanism of O-O bond cleavage in heme-copper oxidase (HCO) enzymes, combining experimental and computational insights from enzyme intermediates and synthetic models. It is determined that HCOs undergo a proton-initiated O-O cleavage mechanism where a single water molecule in the active site enables proton transfer (PT) from the cross-linked  to a peroxo ligand bridging the heme Fe and Cu, and multiple H-bonding interactions lower the  p K. Due to sterics within the active site, the proton must either transfer initially to the O(Fe) (a high- intermediate), or from another residue over a ∼10 Å distance to reach the O(Cu) atom directly. While the distance between the H donor (Tyr) and acceptor (O(Cu)) results in a barrier to PT, this separation is critical for the low barrier to O-O cleavage as it enhances backbonding from Fe into the O σ* orbital. Thus, PT from Tyr precedes O-O elongation and is rate-limiting, consistent with available kinetic data. The electron transfers from tyrosinate after the barrier via a superexchange pathway provided by the cross-link, generating intermediate P. P is evaluated using available experimental data. The geometric structure contains an Fe═O that is H-bonded to the Cu-OH. The electronic structure is a singlet, where the Fe and Cu are antiferromagnetically coupled through the H-bond between the oxo(Fe) and hydroxo(Cu) ligands, while the Cu and Tyr are ferromagnetically coupled due their delocalization into orthogonal magnetic orbitals on the cross-linked His residue. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of efficient O reduction in HCOs, and the nature of the P intermediate that couples this reaction to proton pumping.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30963942>Conformational insights into the inhibitory mechanism of phyto-compounds against Src kinase family members implicated in psoriasis.</a></h1><p>Psoriasis is a chronic immune mediated disorder of the skin. There is growing evidence that the Src family  kinases (SFK) are highly upregulated in psoriasis. The SFK are the key components of the signaling pathways triggering cell growth and differentiation in addition to the immune cascades. In the current work, the interactions between SFK and selective phyto-compounds were studied using molecular docking approach. Based on the results of docking and binding  calculations quercetin was identified as potential lead compound. To get a deeper insight into the binding of quercetin with the SFK, a combined molecular dynamics and binding free  calculations were performed. The binding of quercetin disrupted the intra-molecular contacts making the SFK compact except Src kinase. The MM/PBSA free  decomposition analysis highlighted the significance of hydrophobic and polar residues which are involved in the binding of quercetin. An experimental validation was carried out against the activated forms of Fyn, Lyn and Src kinases, the top three proteins which showed high preference for quercetin. The flow cytometry analysis showed that the expression levels of Fyn, Lyn and Src kinases were dramatically increased in HaCaT cells. However, the treatment of quercetin at the concentration of 51.65 µM for 24 h markedly decreased their expression in HaCaT cells. Besides, similar results were also observed when the HaCaT cells were treated with the kinase inhibitor Ponitinib (1.43 µM) for 24 h. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

These natural products may be dimerized during their biosynthesis, which proceeds through atom- and -sufficient methods involving dimeric enzymes, to provide complex structures from simple compounds. Coumarin-derived dimers features the C-C or C-O-C biaryl, terpene sidechain linkages or by cyclobutane ring and acts as inhibitors of α-glucosidase, and cytochrome p450 while some show anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities, while chalcone-derived dimers have the 1,3-dihydroxy phenyl (resorcinol) substitution on the periphery of cyclobutane or cyclohexane ring and inhibit topoisomerase, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and cathepsins and others possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-plasmodial activities. Resveratrol-derived dimers have the resorcinol structure and are formed by oxidative coupling showing antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-HIV, anti-tyrosinase, and cytotoxic activity. Bioavailability evidence of closely related structural monomers could be applicable to their dimeric forms. Application of bioisosteric principles to such dimeric compounds is also discussed. Overall, these dimeric natural products can provide potent templates for the natural product-based drug discovery against several diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The classification of warm- and cold-stimulating TCM is defined mainly based on the effects of herbs in regulating body temperature; however, the underlying mechanism of such distinction has not been fully identified.Here, four commonly used spleen-meridian herbs, Ginseng Radix and Astragali Radix as typical warm-stimulating herbs, and Nelumbinis Semen and Coicis Semen as typical cold-stimulating herbs, were selected to test their effects in regulating body temperature, as well as its triggered thermo-regulatory factors and  related metabolites, in yeast-induced fever rats.The intake of Astragali Radix increased body temperature in yeast-induced fever rats; while Coicis Semen showed cooling effects in such rats. In parallel, the levels of cAMP, PGE and thermo-related metabolites, including choline, creatine, alanine, lactate and leucine, in the blood of yeast-induced rats were increased significantly by the intake of Astragali Radix. Oppositely, the cold-stimulating herbs, Nelumbinis Semen and Coicis Semen, showed cooling effects by increasing certain metabolites, e.g. histidine, , lipid, myo-inositol, as well as AVP level.Here, we compared different effects of warm and cooling spleen-meridian herbs in the regulation of body temperature. By providing an intuitive comparison of thermo-regulatory factors and related metabolites after intake of selected herbs, the mechanism behind the warm and cooling effects of specific herbs were revealed.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Analysis of changes in cancer metabolism in response to the inhibitors creates an opportunity for better understanding of the interplay between cell signaling and metabolism and, from the translational perspective, potential early evaluation of response to the inhibitors as well as treatment optimization. We performed genomic, metabolomic, and fluxomic analyses to evaluate the mechanism of action of the Bruton's  kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib (IBR) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the data generated by these diverse technologies revealed that IBR profoundly affected key metabolic pathways in IBR-sensitive cells including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis while having much less effects on IBR-poorly responsive cells. Changes in H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable lactate and alanine concentrations emerged as promising biomarkers of response and resistance to IBR as demonstrated from experiments on various MCL cell lines. The metabolic network analysis on the C MRS and C LC/MS experimental data provided quantitative estimates of various intracellular fluxes and  contributions. Glutaminolysis contributed over 50% of mitochondrial ATP production. Administration of the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 induced growth suppression of the IBR-poorly responsive cells. IMPLICATIONS: Our study demonstrates application of the advanced metabolomic/fluxomic techniques for comprehensive, precise, and prompt evaluations of the effects of kinase inhibition in MCL cells and has strong translational implications by potentially permitting early evaluation of cancer patient response versus resistance to kinase inhibitors and on design of novel therapies for overcoming the resistance.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117606>Perturbation of Short Hydrogen Bonds in Photoactive Yellow Protein via Noncanonical Amino Acid Incorporation.</a></h1><p>Photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is a small photoreceptor protein that has two unusually short hydrogen bonds between the deprotonated p-coumaric acid chromophore and two amino acids, a  and a glutamic acid. This has led to considerable debate as to whether the glutamic acid-chromophore hydrogen bond is a low barrier hydrogen bond, with conflicting results in the literature. We have modified the p K of the  by amber suppression and of the chromophore by chemical substitution. X-ray crystal structures of these modified proteins are nearly identical to the wild-type protein, so the heavy atom distance between proton donor and acceptor is maintained, even though these modifications change the relative proton affinity between donor and acceptor. Despite a considerable change in relative proton affinity, the NMR chemical shifts of the hydrogen-bonded protons are only moderately affected. QM/MM calculations were used to explore the protons' potential  surface and connect the calculated proton position with empirically measured proton chemical shifts. The results are inconsistent with a low barrier hydrogen bond but in all cases are consistent with a localized proton, suggesting an ionic hydrogen bond rather than a low barrier hydrogen bond.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816517>Neuroprotection of hydroxysafflor yellow A in experimental cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via metabolic inhibition of phenylalanine and mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h1><p>Stroke is the second most frequent cause of mortality, resulting in a huge societal burden worldwide. Timely reperfusion is the most effective therapy; however, it is difficult to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In traditional Chinese medicine, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has been widely used for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease and as a protective therapy against I/R injury. Evidence has demonstrated that HSYA could reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species and suppress cellular apoptosis; however, whether HSYA alters the metabolic profile as its underlying mechanism for neuroprotection remains unknown. In the present study, using a metabolomic screening, phenylalanine was identified to significantly increase in an experimental model of mouse cerebral I/R injury. Notably, western blotting and qPCR analysis were conducted to test the expression level of apoptosis‑associated factors, and HSYA was identified to be able to protect neuronal cells by reducing phenylalanine level associated with I/R injury. Additionally, these findings were confirmed in primary mouse neurons and PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) stress. Of note, HSYA was observed to regulate the mRNA expression of key metabolic enzymes, phenylalanine hydroxylase,  aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which are responsible for phenylalanine metabolism. Furthermore, by performing mitochondrial labeling and JC‑1 fluorescence assay, HSYA was identified to promote mitochondrial function and biogenesis suppressed by OGD/R. The findings of the present study demonstrated that I/R injury could increase the levels of phenylalanine, and HSYA may inhibit phenylalanine synthesis to enhance mitochondrial function and biogenesis for neuroprotection. The present study proposed a novel metabolite biomarker for cerebral I/R injury and the evaluated the efficacy of HSYA as a potential therapeutic treatment I/R injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522674>Comparison of the Size and Properties of the Cytochrome c/Cardiolipin Nanospheres in a Sediment and Non-polar Medium.</a></h1><p>Apoptosis, as the major type of programmed cell death, plays an important role in the organism renewal and removal of defective and transformed cells, including cancer cells. One of the earliest apoptotic events is lipid peroxidation in the inner mitochondrial membrane catalyzed by a complex of cytochrome c (CytC) with the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). It was shown that mixing CytC and CL solutions results in the formation of CytC/CL complexes (Cyt-CL nanospheres) with a diameter of 11-12 nm composed of the molten globule protein molecule and a CL monolayer. Using the methods of dynamic light scattering for the Cyt-CL chloroform solution and small-angle X-ray scattering for the Cyt-CL sediment, it was found that in both cases, Cyt-CL formed nanospheres with a diameter of 8 and 11 nm, which corresponded to the earlier determined lipid/protein ratios of 13-14 and 35-50, respectively. These results showed that the Cyt-CL nanospheres can form not only during crystallization but also in a hydrophobic medium. CytC in the complex exists as a molten globule, as evidenced by the emergence of tryptophan and  fluorescence (absent in the native protein) due to the Förster resonance transfer of the electron excitation  onto the heme. At the same time, the coordinate bond between the heme iron and the sulfur atom of methionine 80 in Cyt-CL is disrupted (the absorption band at ~700 nm disappears). Similar disruption of the iron-sulfur bond in Cyt-CL was observed in 50% methanol. These changes were reversible, which corroborates the conclusion on the CytC transition to the molten globule conformation in methanol-containing solutions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949952>Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can prevent changes in mitochondrial  metabolism and oxidative stress caused by chronic administration of  in the brain of rats.</a></h1><p>Deficiency of hepatic enzyme  aminotransferase characterizes the innate error of autosomal recessive disease Tyrosinemia Type II.

Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of the treatment with n-3 PUFA in the alterations caused by chronic administration of  on important parameters of energetic metabolism and oxidative stress in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex of developing rats. Chronic administration of  causes a decrease in the citrate synthase (CS) activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activities, and an increase in the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in the hippocampus. Moreover, in the striatum,  administration caused a decrease in the activities of CS, SDH, creatine kinase, and complexes I, II-III and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We also observed that the high levels of  are related to oxidative stress in the brain. Notably, supplementation of n-3 PUFA prevented the majority of the modifications caused by the chronic administration of  in the cerebral enzyme activities, as well as ameliorated the oxidative stress in the brain regions of rats. These results indicate a possible neuroprotective and antioxidant role for n-3 PUFA and may represent a new therapeutic approach and potential adjuvant therapy to Tyrosinemia Type II individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616873>Emerging Structure-Function Paradigm of Endocrine FGFs in Metabolic Diseases.</a></h1><p>Endocrine fibroblast growth factors (eFGFs) control pathways that are crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis of lipids, glucose, , bile acids, and minerals. Unlike the heparin-binding paracrine FGFs, eFGFs require a unique Klotho family protein to form a productive triad complex, but the structural and mechanistical details of this complex have remained obscure since the beginning of the eFGF field. However, recent breakthroughs in resolving the 3D structures of eFGF signaling complexes have now unveiled the atomic details of multivalent interactions among eFGF, FGFR, and Klotho. We provide here a timely review on the architecture and the structure-function relationships of these complexes, and highlight how the structural knowledge opens a new door to structure-based drug design against a repertoire of eFGF-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A high adsorption in the membrane, with a marked enantioselectivity to l-Tyr, was found. Computational calculations carried out by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) showed a difference in the affinity of the enantiomers and two regions of adsorption in the polymer matrix. The interactions of the enantiomers with the polymer matrix were studied by using FTIR, DRx, DSC and TG measurements. These results indicate that adsorption of Tyr reduces the crystallinity of the membrane and generates a rearrangement of the chains, decreasing the intercatenary spacing. Also, it was observed that the hydrated polymorph to anhydrous polymorph ratio has changed during adsorption, that is, water bound to chitosan is also modified. The  balance of the system hydrogen bonding, desolvation and the conformational changes resulted in a spontaneous and endothermic process.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These properties are mirrored in intrachain site-to-site distances and diffusion coefficients of mutual site-to-site motion. Both distance distribution and diffusion determine the extent of Förster resonance  transfer (FRET) between two sites labeled with a FRET donor and acceptor. The relatively large Förster radii of traditional FRET methods (₀ > 20 Å) lead to a fairly low contribution of diffusion. We introduced short-distance FRET (sdFRET) where Dbo, an asparagine residue conjugated to 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, acts as acceptor paired with donors, such as naphtylalanine (NAla), tryptophan, 5-l-fluorotryptophan, or . The Förster radii are always close to 10 Å, which makes sdFRET highly sensitive to diffusional motion. We recently found indications that the FRET enhancement caused by diffusion depends symmetrically on the product of the radiative fluorescence lifetime of the donor and the diffusion coefficient. In this study, we varied this product by two orders of magnitude, using both donors of different lifetime, NAla and FTrp, as well as a varying viscogen concentration, to corroborate this statement. We demonstrate the consequences of this relationship in evaluating the impact of viscogenic coadditives on peptide dimensions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106906>The effect of dietary high  density and carbohydrate  ratio on digestive enzymes activity, nutrient digestibility, amino acid utilization and intestinal morphology of weaned piglets.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effect of high or low digestible  ratio of carbohydrate in a high or normal dietary  density on performance, amino acid utilization and intestinal functions of weaned piglets. A total of 32 healthy weaners (9.60 ± 0.13 kg) were allocated to two dietary  densities (3,400 and 3,800 kcal/kg) and two digestible  ratio of carbohydrate to fat (9:1 and 3:1) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. There were eight piglets per treatment. The feed intake of piglets was significantly increased by dietary high carbohydrate ratio (9:1) (p < 0.01); however, this did not result in improved body weight gain (p > 0.05). The piglets fed high carbohydrate  ratio had a reduced villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio in the duodenum (p < 0.05), and dietary high  density further decreased the VH/CD ratio in the ileum (p < 0.01). In the duodenum, the lymphocyte count was increased by dietary high  density (p < 0.05), while dietary  density and carbohydrate  ratio interacted to increase lymphocyte count in the ileum (p < 0.05). The serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were not significantly affected (p > 0.05), but dietary  density interacted with dietary  ratio to increase high-density lipoprotein concentration (p < 0.05) in piglets fed reduced carbohydrate  ratio. Dietary high  density reduced  digestibility (p < 0.05), whereas high carbohydrate  ratio increased crude protein digestibility in the piglets (p < 0.05). The intestinal sucrase, lactase activities and serum concentrations of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, alanine, glycine,  and citrulline were higher in the piglets fed dietary increased carbohydrate  ratio. Oxidative stress markers and volatile fatty acids concentrations were altered by the dietary treatments. It was concluded that dietary high  density could be detrimental to piglets intestinal functions and that increased carbohydrate  ratio could affect amino acid utilization and body weight gain in weaner pigs.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263101>An ErbB2/c-Src axis links bioenergetics with PRC2 translation to drive epigenetic reprogramming and mammary tumorigenesis.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of histone modifications promotes carcinogenesis by altering transcription. Breast cancers frequently overexpress the histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2). However, the role of EZH2 in this setting is unclear due to the context-dependent functions of PRC2 and the heterogeneity of breast cancer. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying PRC2 overexpression in cancer are obscure. Here, using multiple models of breast cancer driven by the oncogene ErbB2, we show that the  kinase c-Src links  sufficiency with PRC2 overexpression via control of mRNA translation. By stimulating mitochondrial ATP production, c-Src suppresses  stress, permitting sustained activation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which increases the translation of mRNAs encoding the PRC2 subunits Ezh2 and Suz12. We show that Ezh2 overexpression and activity are pivotal in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumourigenesis. These results reveal the hitherto unknown c-Src/mTORC1/PRC2 axis, which is essential for ErbB2-driven carcinogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31459367>Probing the Nature of Noncovalent Interactions in Dimers of Linear -Based Dipeptides.</a></h1><p>-based dipeptides self-assemble to form higher order structures. To gain insights into the nature of intermolecular interactions contributing to the early stages of the self-assembly of aromatic dipeptides, we study the dimers of linear dityrosine (YY) and tryptophan- (WY) using quantum-chemical methods with dispersion corrections and universal solvation model based on density in combination with  decomposition and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses. We find that hydrogen bonding is a dominant stabilizing force. The lowest  structure for the linear YY dimer is characterized by O···H(O). In contrast, the lowest  dimer of linear WY is stabilized by O···H(N) and π···π. The solvent plays a critical role as it can change the strength and nature of interactions. The lowest  for linear WY dimer in acetone is stabilized by O···H(O), π···H(C), and π···H(N). The Δ of dimerization and stabilization energies of solvated dipeptides reveal that the dipeptide systems are more stable in the solvent phase than in gas phase. NBO confirms increased magnitudes for donor-acceptor interaction for the solvated dipeptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771008>Simultaneous voltammetric sensing of levodopa, piroxicam, ofloxacin and methocarbamol using a carbon paste electrode modified with graphite oxide and β-cyclodextrin.</a></h1><p>A carbon paste electrode (CPE) was modified with graphite oxide (GrO) and β-cyclodextrin (CD) to obtain a sensor for simultaneous voltammetric determination of levodopa (LD), piroxicam (PRX), ofloxacin (OFX) and methocarbamol (MCB). The morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of the functionalized GrO were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the sensor is capable of detecting LD, PRX, OFX and MCB by square wave voltammetry (SWV) at working potentials of +0.40, +0.60, +1.03 and + 1.27 V (versus Ag/AgCl), respectively. Response is linear from 1.0 to 20 μM for LD, from 1.0 to 15 μM for PRX, from 1.0 to 20 μM for OFX, and from 1.0 to 50 μM for MCB. The respective limits of detection are 65, 105, 89 and 400 nM.

A growing arsenal of therapeutic agents is being designed to suppress the transfer of mitochondria from stromal to malignant cells, to interfere with mitochondrial biogenesis, to directly inhibit respiratory chain complexes, or to disrupt mitochondrial function in other ways. For the experimental treatment of cancers, OXPHOS inhibitors can be advantageously combined with  kinase inhibitors, as well as with other strategies to inhibit glycolysis, thereby causing a lethal  crisis. Unfortunately, most of the preclinical data arguing in favor of OXPHOS inhibition have been obtained in xenograft models, in which human cancer cells are implanted in immunodeficient mice. Future studies on OXPHOS inhibitors should elaborate optimal treatment schedules and combination regimens that stimulate-or at least are compatible with-anticancer immune responses for long-term tumor control.© 2019 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918129>Hydrogen exchange reveals Hsp104 architecture, structural dynamics, and energetics in physiological solution.</a></h1><p>Hsp104 is a large AAA+ molecular machine that can rescue proteins trapped in amorphous aggregates and stable amyloids by drawing substrate protein into its central pore. Recent cryo-EM studies image Hsp104 at high resolution. We used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry analysis (HX MS) to resolve and characterize all of the functionally active and inactive elements of Hsp104, many not accessible to cryo-EM. At a global level, HX MS confirms the one noncanonical interprotomer interface in the Hsp104 hexamer as a marker for the spiraled conformation revealed by cryo-EM and measures its fast conformational cycling under ATP hydrolysis. Other findings enable reinterpretation of the apparent variability of the regulatory middle domain. With respect to detailed mechanism, HX MS determines the response of each Hsp104 structural element to the different bound adenosine nucleotides (ADP, ATP, AMPPNP, and ATPγS). They are distinguished most sensitively by the two Walker A nucleotide-binding segments. Binding of the ATP analog, ATPγS, tightly restructures the Walker A segments and drives the global open-to-closed/extended transition. The global transition carries part of the ATP/ATPγS-binding  to the somewhat distant central pore. The pore constricts and the  and other pore-related loops become more tightly structured, which seems to reflect the -requiring directional pull that translocates the substrate protein. ATP hydrolysis to ADP allows Hsp104 to relax back to its lowest  open state ready to restart the cycle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30843677>Expression profile of Galp, alarin and their receptors in rat adrenal gland.</a></h1><p>Galanin-like peptide (Galp) and alarin (Ala) are 2 new members of the galanin peptide family. Galanin (Gal), the "parental" peptide of the entire family, is known to regulate numerous physiological processes, including  and osmotic homeostasis, reproduction, food intake, and secretion of adrenocortical hormones. Galp and Ala are known to regulate food intake. In the rat, Galp mRNA has been found in the brain, exclusively in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and median eminence, which are involved in the regulation of  homeostasis. Alarin-like immunoreactivity is present in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the ARC of rats and mice.The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of Ala, Galp and their receptors in the organs of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of the rat.The expression of the examined genes was measured in different models of adrenal growth of the rat in vivo (postnatal ontogenesis, compensatory adrenal growth, adrenocortical regeneration, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration). The expression was evaluated using the Affymetrix® microarray system or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).The expression of Ala gene was observed in each organ of the HPA axis (the hypothalamus, hypophysis and adrenal gland). The elevated level of expression of this gene was observed in the pituitary of 2-day rats, while very low levels of Ala mRNA were observed in the adrenals. Galp mRNA expression was observed only in the hypothalamus and the hypophysis during postnatal ontogenesis. The expression of Gal receptors was demonstrated in the hypothalamus, the hypophysis and the adrenal gland. In different compartments of the adrenal glands of adult, intact male and female rats, the expression of Ala, Galp and galanin receptor 1 (Galr1) genes was negligible, but the expression of galanin receptor 2 (Galr2), galanin receptor 3 (Galr3) and neurotrophic receptor  kinase 2 (Ntrk2) genes was noticeable.The examined genes showed different expression levels within the studied HPA axis; some of them were neither expressed in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, nor in the adrenal gland.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521785>Skin metabolome reveals immune responses in yellow drum Nibea albiflora to Cryptocaryon irritans infection.</a></h1><p>The yellow drum Nibea albiflora is less susceptible to Cryptocaryon irritans infection than is the case with other marine fishes such as Larimichthys crocea, Lateolabrax japonicus, and Pagrus major. To investigate further their resistance mechanism, we infected the N. albiflora with the C. irritans at a median lethal concentration of 2050 theronts/g fish. The skins of the infected and the uninfected fishes were sampled at 24 h and 72 h followed by an extensive analysis of metabolism. The study results revealed that there were 2694 potential metabolites. At 24 h post-infection, 12 metabolites were up-regulated and 17 were down-regulated whereas at 72 h post-infection, 22 metabolites were up-regulated and 26 were down-regulated. Pathway enrichment analysis shows that the differential enriched pathways were higher at 24 h with 22 categories and 58 subcategories (49 up, 9 down) than at 72 h whereby the differential enriched pathways were 6 categories and 8 subcategories (4 up, 4 down). In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) plot shows that at 24 h the metabolites composition of infected group were separately clustered to uninfected group while at 72 h the metabolites composition in infected group were much closer to uninfected group. This indicated that C. irritans caused strong metabolic stress on the N. albiflora at 24 h and restoration of the dysregulated metabolic state took place at 72 h of infection. Also, at 72 h post infection a total of 17 compounds were identified as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, out of 2694 primary metabolites detected, 23 metabolites could be clearly identified and semi quantified with a known identification number and assigned into 66 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Most of the enriched KEGG pathways were mainly from metabolic pathway classes, including the metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, purine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis. Others were glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Moreover, out of the identified metabolites, only 6 metabolites were statistically differentially expressed, namely, L -glutamate (up-regulated) at 24 h was important for  and precursor for other glutathiones and instruments of preventing oxidative injury; 15-hydroxy- eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), (S)-(-)-2-Hydroxyisocaproic acid, and adenine (up-regulated) at 72 h were important for anti-inflammatory and immune responses during infection; others were delta-valerolactam and betaine which were down-regulated compared to uninfected group at 72 h, might be related to immure responses including stimulation of immune system such as production of antibodies. Our results therefore further advance our understanding on the immunological regulation of N. albiflora during immune response against infections as they indicated a strong relationship between skin metabolome and C. irritans infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the oral toxicity of isopsoralen in Wistar rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0, 3.5, 7.0, and 14 mg/kg. Additionally, the plasma metabolomics of isopsoralen in male and female rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0 and 14 mg/kg were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many abnormalities were observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats, including suppression of body weight gain, and changes in serum biochemical parameters and visceral coefficients. Histopathological changes in liver, pancreatic, and reproductive system tissues were also observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats. The metabolomic analyses showed alterations in many metabolites (19 in female rats; 28 in male rats) after isopsoralen administration. The significant changes in these metabolites revealed metabolomic alterations in the isopsoralen-treated rats, especially in amino acid metabolism regardless of sex, including phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Furthermore, fatty acid metabolism comprised the main affected pathways in female rats, while lipid metabolism and  metabolism were the main affected pathways in male rats.Copyright © 2019.

This study compared the satiating effect of two protein diets on resistance-trained individuals during short-term  deficit. Following ethical approval, 16 participants (age: 28 ± 2 years; height: 1.72 ± 0.03 m; body-mass: 88.83 ± 5.54 kg; body-fat: 21.85 ± 1.82%) were randomly assigned to 7-days moderate (PRO: 1.8 g·kg·d) or high protein (PRO: 2.9 g·kg·d) matched calorie-deficit diets in a cross-over design. Daily satiety responses were recorded throughout interventions. Pre-post diet, plasma ghrelin and peptide   (PYY), and satiety ratings were assessed in response to a protein-rich meal. Only perceived satisfaction was significantly greater following PRO (67.29 ± 4.28 v 58.96 ± 4.51 mm,  = 0.04). Perceived cravings increased following PRO only (46.25 ± 4.96 to 57.60 ± 4.41 mm,  = 0.01). Absolute ghrelin concentration significantly reduced post-meal following PRO (972.8 ± 130.4 to 613.6 ± 114.3 pg·mL;  = 0.003), remaining lower than PRO at 2 h (-0.40 ± 0.06 v -0.26 ± 0.06 pg·mL normalized relative change;  = 0.015). Absolute PYY concentration increased to a similar extent post-meal (PRO: 84.9 ± 8.9 to 147.1 ± 11.9 pg·mL, PRO: 100.6 ± 9.5 to 143.3 ± 12.0 pg·mL;  < 0.001), but expressed as relative change difference was significantly greater for PRO at 2 h (+0.39 ± 0.20 pg·mL v -0.28 ± 0.12 pg·mL;  = 0.001). Perceived hunger, fullness and satisfaction post-meal were comparable between diets ( > 0.05). However, desire to eat remained significantly blunted for PRO ( = 0.048). PRO does not confer additional satiating benefits in resistance-trained individuals during short-term  deficit. Ghrelin and PYY responses to a test-meal support the contention that satiety was maintained following PRO, although athletes experiencing negative symptoms (i.e., cravings) may benefit from protein-rich meals as opposed to over-consumption of protein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262008>One Step Preparation of Peptide-Coated Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Size.</a></h1><p>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) made from self-assembling peptides have been used in many research fields and attracted a great deal of attention due to their high stability, biocompatibility and functionality.

The antiangiogenic factor, sFlt-1 (soluble FMS-like  kinase-1) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. sFlt-1 is secreted into the maternal circulation where it antagonizes VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and ultimately disrupts vascular homeostasis. However, the upstream mechanisms regulating release of sFlt-1 are poorly characterized. We investigated the roles of key prosurvival pathways, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling, and the mitochondria, in regulating sFlt-1 production. We initially found that the mRNA and protein of EGFR and downstream adaptor molecules were significantly increased in preeclamptic placental tissue relative to normotensive controls. Inhibiting the EGFR signaling cascade using siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) or small molecule inhibitors significantly reduced sFlt-1 release from primary cytotrophoblast (placental cells). Additionally, inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain or activating downstream -sensing molecules (AMPK [AMP-activated kinase], SIRT1 [sirtuin 1 ], and PGC1α [PPAR-γ co-activator 1]) also significantly reduced sFlt-1 secretion from cytotrophoblast cells, without affecting EGFR signaling. In vivo, treating pregnant mice with gefitinib (an EGFR inhibitor) or resveratrol (perturbs mitochondrial function) significantly reduced circulating murine sFlt-1 compared with vehicle control. Furthermore, treating primary cytotrophoblasts with therapeutics which have been previously found to reduce sFlt-1 secretion, either reduced EGFR signaling (esomeprazole and statins) or perturbed mitochondrial function (esomeprazole, resveratrol, and metformin). Additionally, targeting both pathways simultaneously produced additive reductions in sFlt-1 secretion. Thus, we have identified 2 key survival pathways that seem to be overactive in preeclampsia and involved in the regulation of placental sFlt-1 secretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772375>Extracellular glucose-dependent IPSC enhancement by leptin in fast-spiking to pyramidal neuron connections via JAK2-PI3K pathway in the rat insular cortex.</a></h1><p>Leptin is produced in the adipocytes and plays a pivotal role in regulation of  balance by controlling appetite and metabolism. Leptin receptors are widely distributed in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and neocortex. The insular cortex (IC) processes gustatory and visceral information, which functionally correlate to feeding behavior. However, it is still an open issue whether and how leptin modulates IC neural activities. Our paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using IC slice preparations demonstrated that unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) but not uEPSCs were potentiated by leptin in the connections between pyramidal (PNs) and fast-spiking neurons (FSNs). The leptin-induced increase in uIPSC amplitude was accompanied by a decrease in paired-pulse ratio. Under application of inhibitors of JAK2-PI3K but not MAPK pathway, leptin did not change uIPSC amplitude. Variance-mean analysis revealed that leptin increased the release probability but not the quantal size and the number of release site. These electrophysiological findings suggest that the leptin-induced uIPSC increase is mediated by activation of JAK2-PI3K pathway in presynaptic FSNs. An in vivo optical imaging revealed that leptin application decreased excitatory propagation in IC induced by electrical stimulation of IC. These leptin-induced effects were not observed under the low  states: low glucose concentration (2.5 mM) in vitro and one-day-fasting condition in vivo. However, leptin enhanced uIPSCs under application of low glucose with an AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that leptin suppresses IC excitation by facilitating GABA release in FSN→PN connections, which may not occur under a hunger state.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

O-GlcNAc is a product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, a side pathway of glucose metabolism. It is essential for cell survival and proper gene regulation, mirroring the metabolic status of a cell. STAT3 and STAT5 proteins are essential transcription factors that can act in a mutational context-dependent manner as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. They regulate gene expression for vital processes such as cell differentiation, survival, or growth, and are also critically involved in metabolic control. The role of STAT3/5 proteins in metabolic processes is partly independent of their transcriptional regulatory role, but is still poorly understood. Interestingly, STAT3 and STAT5 are modified by O-GlcNAc in response to the metabolic status of the cell. Here, we discuss and summarize evidence of O-GlcNAcylation-regulating STAT function, focusing in particular on hyperactive STAT5A transplant studies in the hematopoietic system. We emphasize that a single O-GlcNAc modification is essential to promote development of neoplastic cell growth through enhancing STAT5A  phosphorylation. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation of STAT5A on threonine 92 lowers  phosphorylation of oncogenic STAT5A and ablates malignant transformation. We conclude on strategies for new therapeutic options to block O-GlcNAcylation in combination with  kinase inhibitors to target neoplastic cancer cell growth and survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566145>Recent advances in bioinspired proton-coupled electron transfer.</a></h1><p>Mechanistic investigations of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) are increasingly important, especially in the context of small molecule activation and solar  conversion.

Evidence indicates that high amounts of dityrosine exist in oxidized milk powders and some milk related foodstuffs, further reducing the nutritional value of oxidized proteins. Therefore, we hypothesize that some receptors related to special diseases would be targets for dityrosine. However, the mechanisms of the interaction of dityrosine with probable targets are still unknown. In the present work, an inverse virtual screening approach was performed to screen possible novel targets for dityrosine. Molecular docking studies were performed on a panel of targets extracted from the potential drug target database (PDTD) to optimize and validate the screening results. Firstly, two different conformations cis- and trans- were found for dityrosine during minimization. Moreover, Tubulin (αT) (-11.0 kcal/mol) was identified as a target for cis-dityrosine (CDT), targets including αT (-11.2 kcal/mol) and thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 (-10.7 kcal/mol) presented high binding affinities for trans-dityrosine (TDT). Furthermore, in order to provide binding complexes with higher precision, the three docked systems were further refined by performing thermo dynamic simulations. A series of techniques for searching for the most stable binding pose and the calculation of binding free  are elaborately provided in this work. The major interactions between these targets and dityrosine were hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding. The application of inverse virtual screening method may facilitate the prediction of unknown targets for known ligands, and direct future experimental assays.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498992> and Enzyme Activity Landscapes of Yeast Chorismate Mutase at Cellular Concentrations of Allosteric Effectors.</a></h1><p>In solution, proteins fluctuate among many conformational substates, with their relative free energies determining substate populations and  barriers determining conformational exchange kinetics. It has been suggested that members of the conformational ensemble may be responsible for different protein functions, although it is generally difficult to test such a proposal in most systems. A model protein for deciphering individual substate contributions is the homodimeric  chorismate mutase (ScCM) enzyme, which is negatively and positively regulated by  and tryptophan, respectively. Previous X-ray crystallography structures revealed two equivalent allosteric binding pockets that can be occupied by either tryptophan or . We proposed that under cellular conditions there are six potential states of ScCM: no allosteric effector bound, a single  bound, a single tryptophan bound, two tyrosines bound, two tryptophans bound, and a mixed bound state in which  and tryptophan occupy different allosteric sites. We used isothermal titration calorimetry and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm the existence of all six states and construct the complete six-state equilibrium binding profile. We were also able to assign enzyme activities to each state, which allowed us to derive the enzyme activity landscape across the range of cellular concentrations of  and tryptophan. Surprisingly, the mixed bound state had the highest enzyme activity, which suggested that the shikimate pathway is shunted toward  production under most conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312984>Theoretical study on the mechanism of N- and α-carbon oxidation of lapatinib catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.</a></h1><p>Lapatinib, an orally active dual  kinase inhibitor, is efficacious in combination therapy with capecitabine for advanced metastatic breast cancer. Despite its importance, it has been associated with hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. The mechanisms of hepatotoxicity at the chemical and cellular levels may link to drug metabolism. In this study, the N- and α-carbon oxidation processes of lapatinib catalyzed by CYP3A4 were explored by density functional theory method. The calculation results show that oxidation of C is the primary metabolic process and carboxylic acid is the main metabolic product. Both hydroxylation of C and subsequent formation of primary amines are feasible. However, it is not easy for the primary amines to form active metabolites nitroso, which indicates that there are other paths for the production of nitroso. Carboxylic acid is not the main metabolite of N oxidation because of higher hydrolysis  barrier of intermediate nitrone. It is worthy to study subsequent N-hydroxylation and its downstream reaction, which may be the main pathway for the formation of nitroso. These results lay the foundation for drug design and optimization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244095>Activation and Inactivation of the FLT3 Kinase: Pathway Intermediates and the Free  of Transition.</a></h1><p>The aberrant expression of kinases is often associated with pathologies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Like other types of enzymes, kinases can adopt active and inactive states, where a shift toward more stable active state often leads to disease. Dozens of kinase inhibitors are, therefore, used as drugs. Most of these bind to either the inactive or active state. In this work, we study the transitions between these two states in FLT3, an important drug target in leukemias. Kinases are composed of two lobes (N- and C-terminal lobes) with the catalytic site in-between. Through projection of the largest motions obtained through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that each of the end-states (active or inactive) already possess the ability for transition as the two lobes rotate which initiates the transition. A targeted simulation approach known as essential dynamics sampling (EDS) was used to speed up the transition between the two protein states. Coupling the EDS to implicit-solvent MD was performed to estimate the free  barriers of the transitions. The activation energies were found in good agreement with previous estimates obtained for other kinases. Finally, we identified FLT3 intermediates that assumed configurations that resemble that of the c-Src nonreceptor  kinase. The intermediates show better binding to the drug ponatinib than c-Src and the inactive state of FLT3. This suggests that targeting intermediate states can be used to explain the drug-binding patterns of kinases and for rational drug design.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214677>Expanding the range of binding energies and oxidizability of biologically relevant S-aromatic interactions: imidazolium and phenolate binding to sulfoxide and sulfone.</a></h1><p>Oxidation and protonation/deprotonation strongly impact intermolecular noncovalent interactions. For example, S-aromatic interactions are stabilized up to three-fold in the gas phase on oxidation of the sulfur ligand or protonation/deprotonation of the aromatic. To probe if such stabilizing effects are additive and to model interactions of oxidized methionine (MetOn) with protonated histidine and deprotonated  residues in proteins, we examined Me2SOn (n = 1, 2) binding to imidazolium, phenolate and their 4-methylated forms. Ab initio MP2(full)/6-311++G(d,p) gas-phase calculations reveal that the Me2SOn-imidazolium complexes adopt edge-on geometry with σ-type (N/C-HarO) H-bonding and interaction energies of -17.2 to -31.1 kcal mol-1. The less stable (-13.8 to -21.0 kcal mol-1) Me2SOn-phenolates possess en-face geometry stabilized by π-type (C-Hπar) H-bonding. Comparing these energies with those reported for the Me2S-neutral aromatics affirms the additive effects of ligand protonation/deprotonation and oxidation on gas-phase stability. However, this is not the case in water although the aqueous complexes retain their preferred gas-phase σ- and π-type H-bonded structures. Binding free energies (kcal mol-1) calculated from molecular dynamics simulations in bulk water (preceded by CHARMM36 force field calibration where necessary) reveal that Me2SO-imidazolium (-4.4) is more stable than Me2SO-phenolate (-2.4) but Me2SO2-imidazolium (-0.6) is less stable than Me2SO2-phenolate (-3.8). Vertical ionization potentials (IPV) calculated for the gas-phase complexes indicate that the Me2SOn-phenolates, but not the Me2SOn-imidazoles, are oxidizable under biological conditions. Charge transfer from the phenolate increases its IPV by ∼20%, decreasing its susceptibility to oxidation. Overall, this work provides fundamental data to predict the behaviour of protein-based MetOn-aromatic-ion interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227054>Radionuclide Therapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.</a></h1><p>The current mainstay of treatment in metastatic prostate cancer is based on hormonal manipulations. Standard androgen deprivation therapy and novel androgen axis drugs are commonly well tolerable and can stabilize metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancers for years. However, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is still challenging to treat. Except taxanes, prostate cancer presents intrinsic resistance against conventional chemotherapies. The typically elderly patient population excludes more aggressive treatment regimens. First clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy or -kinase-inhibitors against prostate cancer failed. In contrast, prostate cancer can be radiosensitive and external beam radiotherapy is effective in localized prostate cancer, thus providing a good rationale for the use of systemic radiopharmaceuticals in the metastatic setting. Beta-particle emitting "bone-seekers" have a long history and are effective as analgesics but do not improve survival because they are limited by red-marrow dose. Alpha emitting Radium can be used in a dose that prolongs survival but is restricted to bone-confined patients. Currently radiolabeled high-affinity ligands to the prostate-specific membrane antigen are in clinical evaluation. While radioimmunotherapy approaches were limited by the long circulation time and slow tumor-accumulation of antibodies, low molecular weight PSMA-specific ligands offer an approx. ten-fold improved tumor to red-marrow ratio in comparison to the unspecific bone-seekers. Early clinical studies demonstrate that regarding surrogate markers, such as >50% PSA reduction (60%) and radiologic response (80%), PSMA-therapy exceeds the antitumor activity of all approved or other recently tested compounds; for example, PSA-response was only observed in approx. a total of 10% of patients treated with ipilimumab, sunitinib, cabozantinib, or xofigo, respectively and in approx. 30, 40, 50% of patients treated with abiraterone, cabazitaxel, or enzalutamide. Also progression free and overall survivals of these single-arm studies appear promising when compared to historical controls. Consecutively, the first PSMA-RLT recently advanced into phase-3 (Lu-PSMA-617; VISION-trial). Future developments aim to avoid off-target radiation by ligand-optimization and to outperform the antitumor activity of beta-emitter PSMA-RLT by labeling with highly focused, high  transferring alpha-nuclides; however the latter potentially also increasing the risk of side-effects and additional early phase studies are needed to improve treatment protocols. Academically clinical research is developing prognostic tools to improve treatment benefit by selecting the most appropriate patients in advance.Copyright © 2019.

Coupling spectroscopy with mass spectrometry allows for the development of new methods to enhance biomolecular structure determination. Herein, we demonstrate two new  acceptors that can be utilized for action-excitation  transfer experiments. In the first system, C-S bonds in methionine act as  acceptors from native chromophores, including , tryptophan, and phenylalanine. Comparison among chromophores reveals that  transfers  most efficiently at 266 nm, but phenylalanine and tryptophan also transfer  with comparable efficiencies. Overall, the C-S bond dissociation yields following  transfer are low for methionine, which led to an investigation of selenomethionine, a common analog that is found in many naturally occurring proteins. Sulfur and selenium are chemically similar, but C-Se bonds are weaker than C-S bonds and have lower lying σ* anti-bonding orbitals. Excitation of peptides containing  and tryptophan results in efficient  transfer to selenomethionine and abundant C-Se bond dissociation. A series of helical peptides were examined where the positions of the donor or acceptor were systematically scanned to explore the influence of distance and helix orientation on  transfer. The distance was found to be the primary factor affecting  transfer efficiency, suggesting that selenomethionine may be a useful acceptor for probing protein structure in the gas phase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718434>Magnesium-sensitive upstream ORF controls PRL phosphatase expression to mediate  metabolism.</a></h1><p>Phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3, also known as PTP4A1, PTP4A2, and PTP4A3) control magnesium homeostasis through an association with the CNNM magnesium transport regulators. Although high PRL levels have been linked to cancer progression, regulation of their expression is poorly understood. Here we show that modulating intracellular magnesium levels correlates with a rapid change of PRL expression by a mechanism involving its 5'UTR mRNA region. Mutations or CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of the conserved upstream ORF present in the mRNA leader derepress PRL protein synthesis and attenuate the translational response to magnesium levels. Mechanistically, magnesium depletion reduces intracellular ATP but up-regulates PRL protein expression via activation of the AMPK/mTORC2 pathway, which controls cellular  status. Hence, altered PRL-2 expression leads to metabolic reprogramming of the cells. These findings uncover a magnesium-sensitive mechanism controlling PRL expression, which plays a role in cellular bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941004> as a Mechanistic-Based Biomarker for Brain Glycogen Decrease and Supercompensation With Endurance Exercise in Rats: A Metabolomics Study of Plasma.</a></h1><p>Brain glycogen, localized in astrocytes, produces lactate as an  source and/or a signal factor to serve neuronal functions involved in memory formation and exercise endurance. In rodents, 4 weeks of chronic moderate exercise-enhancing endurance and cognition increases brain glycogen in the hippocampus and cortex, which is an adaption of brain metabolism achieved through exercise. Although this brain adaptation is likely induced due to the accumulation of acute endurance exercise-induced brain glycogen supercompensation, its molecular mechanisms and biomarkers are unidentified. Since noradrenaline synthesized from blood-borne  activates not only glycogenolysis but also glycogenesis in astrocytes, we hypothesized that blood  is a mechanistic-based biomarker of acute exercise-induced brain glycogen supercompensation. To test this hypothesis, we used a rat model of endurance exercise, a microwave irradiation for accurate detection of glycogen in the brain (the cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus), and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to observe the comprehensive metabolic profile of the blood. Endurance exercise induced fatigue factors such as a decrease in blood glucose, an increase in blood lactate, and the depletion of muscle glycogen, but those parameters recovered to basal levels within 6 h after exercise. Brain glycogen decreased during endurance exercise and showed supercompensation within 6 h after exercise. Metabolomics detected 186 metabolites in the plasma, and 110 metabolites changed significantly during and following exhaustive exercise. Brain glycogen levels correlated negatively with plasma glycogenic amino acids (serine, proline, threonine, glutamate, methionine, , and tryptophan) ( < -0.9). This is the first study to produce a broad picture of plasma metabolite changes due to endurance exercise-induced brain glycogen supercompensation. Our findings suggest that plasma glycogenic amino acids are sensitive indicators of brain glycogen levels in endurance exercise. In particular, plasma  as a precursor of brain noradrenaline might be a valuable mechanistic-based biomarker to predict brain glycogen dynamics in endurance exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572179>Effects of Tianshu Capsule on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats as Revealed by H-NMR-Based Metabolic Profiling.</a></h1><p>Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases, resulting in serious complications such as cardiovascular damage and chronic kidney disease. Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to glycolysis, and perturb the levels of a series of amino acids (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and pathways. Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism and  metabolism disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2,  hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to metabolic biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997443>The Bone Phenotype and Pain Response to Pamidronate in  Kinase Inhibitor-Treated Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.</a></h1><p> kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been linked to bone pain and linear growth attenuation in children with TKI-treated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We describe the skeletal phenotype in an 11-year-old boy with chronic bone pain due to TKI-treated CML, including his response to intravenous (IV) pamidronate. This boy was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML at 4 years of age. He was treated with imatinib for 3 years, followed by dasatinib for 4 years. At age 11 years, he was seen in a bone health clinic with a 4-year history of leg pains that necessitated regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and downward crossing of height percentiles (from the 25th to fifth). The bone volume/tissue volume Z-score was +1.6 for a trans-iliac bone biopsy specimen, with an increase in trabecular number (Z-score, +3.1). Bone formation and resorption parameters on trabecular surfaces were within normal limits. Tibia volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and bone geometry were normal by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, areal BMD Z-scores were average or above average at multiple skeletal sites by dual- x-ray absorptiometry, and tibia length Z-score was reduced (-2.3). Growth- and bone-related biochemical studies were unremarkable except a low serum alkaline phosphatase level. His bone pain resolved completely after 9 months of low-dose IV pamidronate. An increase in trans-iliac trabecular number and shortened tibia were the main skeletal features in this patient. Short-term IV pamidronate was effective for mitigating bone pain, allowing this boy to continue receiving dasatinib without the need for chronic NSAID therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011359>Investigation of Efficacy Enhancing and Toxicity Reducing Mechanism of Combination of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and Paeoniae Radix Alba in Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Rats by Metabolomics.</a></h1><p>Combination of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (FZ) and Paeoniae Radix Alba (BS) shows a significant effect in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy enhancing and toxicity reducing mechanism of combination of them in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats by metabolomics. Rats were randomly divided into seven groups, including A (healthy control), B (model control), C1 (therapy group), C2 (efficacy enhancing group), D1 (toxicity group), and D2 (toxicity reducing group), and dexamethasone group was used as positive control. The plasma biochemical indexes showed that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could significantly inhibit the concentrations of IL-1, TNF- and IFN- in AIA rats, and combination with total glucosides of peony could further reduce the concentration of IL-1. Then, UPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap MS with untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify the possible metabolites and pathways. Through multivariate data analysis of therapeutic dose groups (A vs. B vs. C1 vs. C2) and multivariate data analysis of toxic dose groups (A vs. B vs. D1 vs. D2), 10 and 7 biomarkers were identified based on biomarker analysis, respectively. After inducing AIA model, the plasma contents of spermidine, vanillylmandelic acid, catechol, and linoleate were increased significantly, and the contents of citric acid, , L-phenylalanine, leucine, L-tryptophan, and uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) were decreased significantly. High dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could increase the plasma contents of L-lysine, L-arginine, and deoxycholic acid, while the plasma contents of UMP, carnitine, N-formylanthranilic acid, and adenosine were decreased significantly. The pathway analysis indicated that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could regulate  and amino acid metabolic disorders in AIA rats. However, toxic dose could cause bile acid, fat, amino acid, and  metabolic disorders. And combination with total glucosides of peony could enhance the therapeutic effects and attenuate the toxicity induced by lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165976>Alterations of Gut Microbiota After Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch in Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) represents the most effective surgical procedure for the treatment of severe obesity and associated type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut microbiota, and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet. Body weight and  intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible  intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced weight gain (P < 0.0001) and body fat mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose metabolism, and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal microbiota, as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal microbiota resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut microbiota might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583478>Cyclodextrins in Parkinson's Disease.</a></h1><p> Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder characterized by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that has been object of study by the scientific community through the last decades. However, nowadays there is still no treatment to cure it, although there are drugs available, with limited efficacy, to relieve the symptoms or replenish the cells with dopamine to supply the lack of dopaminergic neurons. This work was structured in two parts. In the first one, binary aqueous solutions of L-dopa and cyclodextrins were studied. In the second part, ternary aqueous solutions of L-dopa were studied with each of the selected cyclodextrins. In all cases, thermodynamic properties (density, partial molar volume and thermodynamic transfer functions for temperatures between 294.15 ± 0.01 K and 312.15 ± 0.01 K) and transport properties (mutual diffusion coefficients, viscosity, transfer viscosity at 298.15 ± 0.01 K and 310.15 ± 0.01 K) were studied. Using theoretical models to adjust the experimental data obtained for the diffusion coefficients and for the apparent molar volumes, in the ternary aqueous solutions, it was possible to estimate the values to the L-dopa-cyclodextrin association constant. For the aqueous ternary solutes, the partial molar volume of transfer of levodopa in the presence of the cyclodextrins, the partial molar expansibility at infinite dilution and from this, the Hepler constant, were determined. Also, the values of Gibbs free  (Δ⁰), enthalpy (Δ⁰) and entropy (Δ⁰) were determined. From the obtained information, it was possible to characterize the molecular interactions, as well as to identify some structural characteristics of the controlled drug delivery systems under study and to estimate the influence of the cyclodextrin substituent groups, and, also, the temperature effect in the interaction levodopa-cyclodextrin. It is our intent to attain information about the mechanism of possible new systems for controlled drug delivery systems, throughout an alternative perspective, which could allow to increase its effectiveness in the Parkinson's treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284513>Phenformin as an Anticancer Agent: Challenges and Prospects.</a></h1><p>Currently, there is increasing evidence linking diabetes mellitus (especially type 2 diabetes mellitus) with carcinogenesis through various biological processes, such as fat-induced chronic inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and angiogenesis. Chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of cancer, but in most cases, patients develop resistance. Phenformin, an oral biguanide drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, was removed from the market due to a high risk of fatal lactic acidosis. However, it has been shown that phenformin is, with other biguanides, an authentic tumor disruptor, not only by the production of hypoglycemia due to caloric restriction through AMP-activated protein kinase with  detection (AMPK) but also as a blocker of the mTOR regulatory complex. Moreover, the addition of phenformin eliminates resistance to antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKI), which prevent the uncontrolled metabolism of glucose in tumor cells. In this review, we evidence the great potential of phenformin as an anticancer agent. We thoroughly review its mechanism of action and clinical trial assays, specially focusing on current challenges and future perspectives of this promising drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519754>Theoretical study of the mechanism of the manganese catalase KatB.</a></h1><p>The mechanism of the HO disproportionation catalyzed by the manganese catalase (MnCat) KatB was studied using the hybrid density functional theory B3LYP and the quantum chemical cluster approach. Compared to the previous mechanistic study at the molecular level for the Thermus thermophilus MnCat (TTC), more modern methodology was used and larger models of increasing sizes were employed with the help of the high-resolution X-ray structure. In the reaction pathway suggested for KatB using the Large chemical model, the O-O homolysis of the first substrate HO occurs through a μ-η:η coordination mode and requires a barrier of 10.9 kcal/mol. In the intermediate state of the bond cleavage, two hydroxides form as terminal ligands of the dimanganese cluster at the Mn(III,III) oxidation state. One of the two Mn(III)-OH moieties and a second-sphere  stabilize the second substrate HO in the second-sphere of the active site via hydrogen bonding interactions. The HO, unbound to the metals, is first oxidized into HO· through a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step with a barrier of 9.5 kcal/mol. After the system switches to the triplet surface, the uncoordinated HO· replaces the product water terminally bound to the Mn(II) and is then oxidized into O spontaneously. Transition states with structural similarities to those obtained for TTC, where μ-η-OH/O groups play important roles, were found to be higher in .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618863>Plasma Free Amino Acid Responses to Whey Protein and Their Relationships with Gastric Emptying, Blood Glucose- and Appetite-Regulatory Hormones and  Intake in Lean Healthy Men.</a></h1><p>This study determined the effects of increasing loads of whey protein on plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations, and their relationships with gastric emptying, blood glucose- and appetite-regulatory hormones, blood glucose and  intake. Eighteen healthy lean men participated in a double-blinded study, in which they consumed, on 3 separate occasions, in randomised order, 450-mL drinks containing either 30 g (L) or 70 g (H) of pure whey protein isolate, or control with 0 g of protein (C). Gastric emptying, serum concentrations of AAs, ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), insulin, glucagon and blood glucose were measured before and after the drinks over 180 min. Then  intake was quantified. All AAs were increased, and 7/20 AAs were increased more by H than L. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) for CCK, GLP-1, insulin and glucagon were correlated positively with iAUCs of 19/20 AAs ( < 0.05). The strongest correlations were with the branched-chain AAs as well as lysine, , methionine, tryptophan, and aspartic acid (all R > 0.52,  < 0.05). Blood glucose did not correlate with any AA (all  > 0.05). Ghrelin and  intake correlated inversely, but only weakly, with 15/20 AAs (all R < 0.34,  < 0.05). There is a strong relationship between gluco-regulatory hormones with a number of (predominantly essential) AAs. However, the factors mediating the effects of protein on blood glucose and  intake are likely to be multifactorial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029629>Bacterial melanin production by heterologous expression of 4‑hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</a></h1><p>Pyomelanin is a reddish-brown pigment produced by bacteria of different genera and plays a variety of physiological roles. Proposals have been regarding the use of pyomelanin in various environmental, industrial and, more recently, cosmetic applications. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the enzyme 4‑hydroxyphenylpiruvate dioxygenase (Hpd) converts 4-hydroxyphenylpiruvate into homogentisic acid, which represents the key intermediate for melanin biosynthesis. This work aimed to obtain Escherichia coli cells overexpressing hpd gene from the PAO1 strain to produce large amounts of pyomelanin for biotechnological purposes. The recombinant dioxygenase expression gave E. coli JM109 the ability to produce pyomelanin. A series of biotransformations led us to choose the best experimental conditions for pyomelanin production. Cells were grown at the mid-exponential phase in a mineral medium with added glucose 10 mM as carbon and  sources and casamino acid 0.2% w/v as an amino acid source. The administration of  1 mM after 30 min of exposure to arabinose 1% w/v made it possible to purify 213 mg/L of pyomelanin after 6 days of biotransformation.

The aim of this study was to provide information on these components in order to guide future nutritional recommendations.A prospective, observational study in adults who start treatment with TKIs, in whom NS was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and dietary intake (24-hour dietary recall). The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to assess quality of life. Nonparametric tests were used in statistical analysis, and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank curves.Of the overall sample, 21.7% had moderate malnutrition according to PG-SGA, and 74.2% moderate weight loss at 6 months, but no patient had BMI<18.5kg/m. Patients with moderate malnutrition had lower survival at four years of diagnosis (log-rank=0.015).  intake was lower than recommended by the ESPEN 2017 congress, and no patient covered the protein requirements (1.5g protein/kg weight) during follow-up. A worse score on the global health scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was related to worse NS.Treatment with TKIs does not appear to have a significant impact on NS and quality of life after 6 months of follow-up. Malnutrition should be prevented through individualized nutritional advice because it is related to shorter survival.Copyright © 2019 SEEN y SED. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Doxorubicin and varlitinib, an anthracycline and a  kinase inhibitor respectively, were conjugated with gold nanoparticles. The systems were characterized, after synthesis, regarding their size, stability and morphology. An efficient conjugation of doxorubicin and varlitinib with PEGAuNPs was revealed. The cytotoxicity effect induced by the combination of the nanoconjugates was investigated in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Doxorubicin and varlitinib conjugated with PEGAuNPs revealed a combined effect to decrease the cell survival of the cancer line S2-013s, while reducing the drugs' toxicity for the healthy pancreatic cells hTERT-HPNE. This study highlights the promising potential of PEGAuNPs for targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs into human cells, enhancing the antitumor growth-inhibition effect on cancer cells, and decreasing the toxicity against normal cells. In cancer therapy, the present approach based on PEGAuNP functionalization can be further explored to increase drug targeting efficiency and to reduce side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968134>Alternative oxidase is an important player in the regulation of nitric oxide levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in plants.</a></h1><p>Plant mitochondria possess two different pathways for electron transport from ubiquinol: the cytochrome pathway and the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway. The AOX pathway plays an important role in stress tolerance and is induced by various metabolites and signals. Previously, several lines of evidence indicated that the AOX pathway prevents overproduction of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species. More recent evidence suggests that AOX also plays a role in regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and signalling. The AOX pathway is induced under low phosphate, hypoxia, pathogen infections, and elicitor treatments. The induction of AOX under aerobic conditions in response to various stresses can reduce electron transfer through complexes III and IV and thus prevents the leakage of electrons to nitrite and the subsequent accumulation of NO. Excess NO under various stresses can inhibit complex IV; thus, the AOX pathway minimizes nitrite-dependent NO synthesis that would arise from enhanced electron leakage in the cytochrome pathway. By preventing NO generation, AOX can reduce peroxynitrite formation and  nitration. In contrast to its function under normoxia, AOX has a specific role under hypoxia, where AOX can facilitate nitrite-dependent NO production. This reaction drives the phytoglobin-NO cycle to increase  efficiency under hypoxia.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Experimental Biology.

However, the metabolic vulnerabilities for most human cancers remain unclear. Establishing the link between metabolic signatures and the oncogenic alterations of receptor  kinases (RTK), the most well-defined cancer genotypes, may precisely direct metabolic intervention to a broad patient population. By integrating metabolomics and transcriptomics, we herein show that oncogenic RTK activation causes distinct metabolic preference. Specifically, EGFR activation branches glycolysis to the serine synthesis for nucleotide biosynthesis and redox homeostasis, whereas FGFR activation recycles lactate to fuel oxidative phosphorylation for  generation. Genetic alterations of EGFR and FGFR stratify the responsive tumors to pharmacological inhibitors that target serine synthesis and lactate fluxes, respectively. Together, this study provides the molecular link between cancer genotypes and metabolic dependency, providing basis for patient stratification in metabolism-targeted therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451955>In silico investigations on the binding efficacy and allosteric mechanism of six different natural product compounds towards PTP1B inhibition through docking and molecular dynamics simulations.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major negative regulator of both the insulin and leptin receptor phosphorylation which impacts insulin sensitivity and hence is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Identification of PTP1B active site inhibitors has proven to be difficult with none of them clearing the phase II clinical trials. Since the conventional methods of targeting the active site of PTP1B have failed to bring out effective PTP1B inhibitors as potential drugs, recent studies are focussing on identification of potential allosteric inhibitors of PTP1B with better specificity and activity. A complete understanding of the molecular features dynamically involved for allosteric site inhibition is still uncertain, and hence, this study is aimed at evaluating the allosteric effectiveness of six natural compounds isolated from medicinal plants which showed in vitro antidiabetic activity along with PTP1B inhibition. The allosteric binding and inhibition of these compounds are studied using computational methods such as molecular docking, homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations for a timescale of 100 ns. The molecular dynamics simulations of native PTP1B, along with the modelled allosteric α-7 helix, for a timescale of 100 ns, revealed the spontaneous transition of the native PTP1B from open WPD loop (active) to closed WPD loop (inactive) conformations during the simulations. Similar dynamics was observed in the presence of the active site substrate pTyr (phosphotyrosine), whereas this transition was inhibited in the presence of the compounds at the allosteric site. Results of molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis reveal that the hindrance to WPD loop was mediated through structural interactions between the allosteric α-helical triad with Loop11 and WPD loop. The MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics - Poisson Boltzmann with Surface Area solvation) binding  results along with H-bonding analysis show the possible allosteric inhibition of Aloe emodin glycoside (AEG), 3β-taraxerol (3BT), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and cichoric acid (CHA) to be higher in comparison with (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol (SGS) and methyl lignocerate (MLG). The interaction analysis was further validated by scoring the allosteric complexes before and after MD simulations using Glide. These findings on spontaneous PTP1B fluctuations and the allosteric interactions provide a better insight into the role of PTP1B fluctuations in impacting the binding  of allosteric inhibitors towards optimal drug designing for PTP1B.

Patients with the L858R mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to the first generation  kinase inhibitors (TKIs); however, after one year of treatment, they may become resistant. The T790M mutation is the most probable cause for drug resistance. Third generation drugs, including Osimertinib (AZD9291), are more effective against T790M and other sensitive mutations. Osimertinib is effective against the L844V mutation, has conditional effectiveness for the L718Q mutation, and is ineffective for the Cys797Ser (C797S) mutation. Cells that have both the T790M and C797 mutations are more resistant to third generation drugs. Although research has shown that Osimertinib is an effective treatment for EGFR L844V cells, this has not been shown for cells that have the C797S mutation. This molecular mechanism has not been well-studied.In the present study, we used the GROMACS software for molecular dynamics simulation to identify interactions between Osimertinib and the kinase part of EGFR in L844V and C797S mutants.We evaluated native EGFR protein and the L844V and C797S mutations' docking and binding , kI, intermolecular, internal, and torsional  parameters. Osimertinib was effective for the EGFR L844V mutation, but not for EGFR C797S. All simulations were validated by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and radius of gyration (ROG).According to our computational simulation, the results supported the experimental models and, therefore, could confirm and predict the molecular mechanism of drug efficacy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611846>Shared Autonomic Pathways Connect Bone Marrow and Peripheral Adipose Tissues Across the Central Neuraxis.</a></h1><p>Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is increased in both obesity and anorexia. This is unique relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which is generally more attuned to metabolic demand. It suggests that there may be regulatory pathways that are common to both BMAT and WAT and also those that are specific to BMAT alone. The central nervous system (CNS) is a key mediator of adipose tissue function through sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that central autonomic pathways may be involved in BMAT regulation. To test this, we first quantified the innervation of BMAT by  hydroxylase (TH) positive nerves within the metaphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of B6 and C3H mice. We found that many of the TH+ axons were concentrated around central blood vessels in the bone marrow. However, there were also areas of free nerve endings which terminated in regions of BMAT adipocytes. Overall, the proportion of nerve-associated BMAT adipocytes increased from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia (from ~3-5 to ~14-24%), regardless of mouse strain. To identify the central pathways involved in BMAT innervation and compare to peripheral WAT, we then performed retrograde viral tract tracing with an attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) to infect efferent nerves from the tibial metaphysis (inclusive of BMAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) of C3H mice. PRV positive neurons were identified consistently from both injection sites in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord, reticular formation, rostroventral medulla, solitary tract, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, and hypothalamus. We also observed dual-PRV infected neurons within the majority of these regions. Similar tracings were observed in pons, midbrain, and hypothalamic regions from B6 femur and tibia, demonstrating that these results persist across mouse strains and between skeletal sites. Altogether, this is the first quantitative report of BMAT autonomic innervation and reveals common central neuroanatomic pathways, including putative "command" neurons, involved in coordinating multiple aspects of sympathetic output and facilitation of parallel processing between bone marrow/BMAT and peripheral adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Wee, Lorenz, Bekirov, Jacquin and Scheller.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408968>Association between Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 and Aggressiveness in Thyroid Cancer.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays important roles in regulating glucose, lipid, and  metabolism; however, its effects in tumors remain poorly understood. To understand the role of FGF21 in regulating tumor aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, serum levels of FGF21 were measured in healthy subjects and patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and expression levels of FGF21, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and β-klotho (KLB) were investigated in human thyroid tissues. The cell viability, migrating cells, and invading cells were measured in PTC cells after treatment with recombinant FGF21. Higher serum levels of FGF21 were found in patients with thyroid cancer than in control participants, and were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose levels, triglyceride levels, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, and recurrence. Serum FGF21 levels were positively correlated with the BMI in patients with PTC, and significantly associated with recurrence. Recombinant FGF21 led to tumor aggressiveness via activation of the FGFR signaling axis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling in PTC cells, and AZD4547, an FGFR  kinase inhibitor, attenuated the effects of FGF21. Hence, FGF21 may be a new biomarker for predicting tumor progression, and targeting FGFR may be a novel therapy for the treatment of obese patients with PTC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171721>Peroxynitrite supports a metabolic reprogramming in merlin-deficient Schwann cells and promotes cell survival.</a></h1><p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The  gene encodes the tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that peroxynitrite-mediated  nitration down-regulates mitochondrial metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous  nitration, indicating production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of  metabolism characterized by a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential, mediated by the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of  metabolism in tumor cells. Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role.© 2019 Pestoni et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with  metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634150>Beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of a mouse model of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are closely associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is thought to play multiple roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular  metabolism. We recently reported that altering PGC-1α gene expression modulates mitochondrial functions in N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP) treated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, possibly via the regulation of Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the potential beneficial effects of PGC-1α in the substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated C57BL mice.The overexpression or knockdown of the PGC-1α gene in the mouse model of dopaminergic neurotoxicity was performed using a stereotactic injection of lentivirus in MPTP-treated male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to one of 6 groups (n=24 per group): normal saline (NS) intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) (con); MPTP i.p. (M); solvent of the lentivirus striatal injection (lentivirus control) + MPTP i.p. (LVcon+M); lentivirus striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LV+M); LV-PGC-1α striatum injection + MPTP i.p. (LVPGC+M); and LV-PGC-1α-siRNA striatal injection + MPTP i.p. (LVsiRNA+M). Intraperitoneal injections of MPTP/NS were conducted two weeks after lentivirus injection.We found significant improvement in motor behavior and increases in  hydroxylase expression in the substantia nigra (SN) in the brains of mice in the LVPGC+M group. The opposite tendency was observed in those in the LVsiRNA+M group. The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the SN region was also consistent with the changes in PGC-1α expression. Electron microscopy showed an increasing trend in the mitochondrial density in the LVPGC+M group and a decreasing trend in the M and LVsiRNA+M groups compared to that in the controls.Our results indicated that PGC-1α rescues the effects of MPTP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in C57BL mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682691>Can photolysis of the CoC bond in coenzyme B-dependent enzymes be used to mimic the native reaction?</a></h1><p>Coenzyme B (Adenosylcobalamin = AdoCbl)-dependent enzymes catalyze complex molecular transformations where cleavage of the CoC bond initiates the catalytic cycle. Alternatively, the CoC bond can be cleaved with light. In both cases, rupture of the CoC bond results in the formation of Co(II)/Ado radical pair (RP). Within the field of B chemistry, there has been a suspicion that photolytic cleavage can be used as a probe or a direct comparison of the native reaction. Herein, we seek to resolve what the connection between light induced RP formation and the native catalytic cycle is. We used a combined QM/MM approach to construct PESs for AdoCbl-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) as a function of axial bonds to describe the reaction mechanism. We have found that there is no direct comparison that can be made between photolysis and enzymatic cleavage as the mechanism associated with these involves different electronic states. With that being said, we have explored an alternate hypothesis for the connection which involves the one-electron reduced form of the AdoCbl cofactor. This hypothesis is in line with the concept based on proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which involves the formation of AdoCbl cofactor- diradical complex. The topology of the PES for the one-electron reduced (D) cofactor is very similar to the PES associated with photo-induced cleavage (S). Both surfaces contain two  minima that are, similarly, the result of two distinct electronic states. Thus, it appears that the reaction mechanism associated with the D surface and the S surface are very similar, providing a plausible connection between photolysis and native catalysis.Copyright © 2018.

Current therapeutic approaches, either pancreatic lipase inhibitors or appetite suppressors, are generally of limited effectiveness. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige cells dissipate fatty acids as heat to maintain body temperature, termed non-shivering thermogenesis; the activity and mass of BAT and beige cells are negatively correlated with overweight and obesity. The existence of BAT and beige cells in human adults provides an effective weight reduction therapy, a process likely to be amenable to pharmacological intervention. Herein, we combed through the physiology of thermogenesis and the role of BAT and beige cells in combating with obesity. We summarized the thermogenic regulators identified in the past decades, targeting G protein-coupled receptors, transient receptor potential channels, nuclear receptors and miscellaneous pathways. Advances in clinical trials were also presented. The main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge from the biological importance of thermogenesis in  homeostasis to the representative thermogenic regulators for treating obesity.

However, even though the clinically relevant F691L gatekeeper mutation conferred resistance to current FLT3 drug quizartinib, PLX3397 remained unaffected. In this study, the protein-ligand interactions between FLT3 kinase domain (wild-type or F691L) and quizartinib or PLX3397 were compared  an integrated computational approach. The classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with dynamic cross-correlation (DCC) analysis, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and free  calculations indicated that the resistant mutation may induce the conformational change of αC-helix and A-loop of the FLT3 protein. The major variations were controlled by the electrostatic interaction and SASA, which were allosterically regulated by residues Glu-661 and Asp-829. When FLT3-F691L was bound to quizartinib, a large conformational change was observed  combination of accelerated MD simulations (aMDs), principal component analysis (PCA), and free  landscape (FEL) calculations. The umbrella sampling (US) simulations were applied to investigate the dissociation processes of the quizartinib or PLX3397 from FLT3-WT and FLT3-F691L. The calculated results suggested that PLX3397 had similar dissociation processes from both FLT3-WT and FLT3-F691L, but quizartinib dissociated more easily from FLT3-F691L than from FLT3-WT. Thus, reduced residence time was responsible for the FLT3-F691L resistance to inhibitors. These findings indicated that both the conformational changes of αC-helix and A-loop and the drug residence time should be considered in the design of drugs so that rational decisions can be made to overcome resistance to FLT3-F691L.Copyright © 2019 Sun, Xia, Zhao, Zheng, Zhang and Ying.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612141>Administration of  KBL375 Causes Taxonomic and Functional Changes in Gut Microbiota Leading to Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota play an important role in immune responses and  metabolism.

Green tea is richer in antioxidants compared to other forms of tea. Tea is composed of polyphenols, caffeine, minerals, and trace amounts of vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrates. The composition of the tea varies depending on the fermentation process employed to produce it. The phytochemicals present in green tea are known to stimulate the central nervous system and maintain overall health in humans. Skin aging is a complex process mediated by intrinsic factors such as senescence, along with extrinsic damage induced by external factors such as chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-A process known as photoaging-Which can lead to erythema, edema, sunburn, hyperplasia, premature aging, and the development of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. UV can cause skin damage either directly, through absorption of  by biomolecules, or indirectly, by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Green tea phytochemicals are a potent source of exogenous antioxidant candidates that could nullify excess endogenous ROS and RNS inside the body, and thereby diminish the impact of photoaging. Several in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that green tea supplementation increases the collagen and elastin fiber content, and suppresses collagen degrading enzyme MMP-3 production in the skin, conferring an anti-wrinkle effect. The precise mechanism behind the anti-photoaging effect of green tea has not been explored yet. Studies using the worm model have suggested that green tea mediated lifespan extension depends on the DAF-16 pathway. Apart from this, green tea has been reported to have stress resistance and neuroprotective properties. Its ROS scavenging activity makes it a potent stress mediator, as it can also regulate the stress induced by metal ions. It is known that tea polyphenols can induce the expression of different antioxidant enzymes and hinder the DNA oxidative damage. Growing evidence suggests that green tea can also be used as a potential agent to mediate neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. EGCG, an abundant catechin in tea, was found to suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ as it activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), along with inhibiting c-Abl/FE65-the cytoplasmic nonreceptor  kinase which is involved in the development of the nervous system and in nuclear translocation. Additionally, green tea polyphenols induce autophagy, thereby revitalizing the overall health of the organism consuming it. Green tea was able to activate autophagy in HL-60 xenographs by increasing the activity of PI3 kinase and BECLIN-1.

Ph + ALL is caused by the fusion of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and the Ableson (ABL) genes, named the BCR-ABL fused gene that codes for an autonomously active  kinase.  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are among the first-line therapeutic agents for the treatment of Ph + ALL. Drug resistance are the major obstacle, limiting their clinical utility. The latest third-generation TKIs, ponatinib, can tackle most abnormal BCR-ABL kinases, including the T315I mutant that is resistant to first- and second-generations TKIs such as imatinib. However, drug resistance still emerges with the novel T315L mutation and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we explored into the detailed interactions between ponatinib and BCR-ABL in the wild-type (WT), T315I, and T315L systems. The simulations revealed the significant conformational changes of ponatinib in its binding site due to the T315L mutation and the underlying structural mechanisms. Binding free  analysis unveiled that the affinity of ponatinib to BCR-ABL decreased upon T315L mutation, which resulted in its unfavorable binding and drug resistance. Key residues responsible for the unfavored unbinding were also identified. This study elucidates the detailed mechanisms for the resistance of ponatinib in Ph + ALL triggered by the T315L mutation and will provide insights for future drug development and optimization.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508966>A Novel Conjugate of Bis[((4-bromophenyl)amino)quinazoline], a EGFR-TK Ligand, with a Fluorescent Ru(II)-Bipyridine Complex Exhibits Specific Subcellular Localization in Mitochondria.</a></h1><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target in anticancer research, whose aberrant function in malignancies has been linked to severe irregularities in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. EGFR mutant variants, either transmembrane or translocated to the mitochondria and/or the nucleus, often exhibit resistance to EGFR inhibitors. The ability to noninvasively image and quantify EGFR provides novel approaches in the detection, monitoring, and treatment of EGFR-related malignancies. The current study aimed to deliver a new theranostic agent that combines fluorescence imaging properties with EGFR inhibition. This was achieved via conjugation of an in-house-developed ((4-bromophenyl)amino)quinazoline inhibitor of mutant EGFR-TK, selected from a focused aminoquinazoline library, with a [Ru(bipyridine)] fluorophore. A triethyleneglycol-derived diamino linker featuring (+)-ionizable sites was employed to link the two functional moieties, affording two unprecedented Ru conjugates with 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometry of aminoquinazoline to the Ru complex (mono-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate and bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, respectively). The bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate, which retains an essential inhibitory activity, was found by fluorescence imaging to be effectively uptaken by Uppsala 87 malignant glioma (grade IV malignant glioma) cells. The fluorescence imaging study and a time-resolved fluorescence resonance  transfer study indicated a specific subcellular distribution of the conjugate that coincides with that of a mitochondria-targeted dye, suggesting mitochondrial localization of the conjugate and potential association with mitochondria-translocated forms of EGFR. Mitochondrial localization was further documented by the specific concentration of the bis-quinazoline-Ru-conjugate in a mitochondrial isolation assay.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918972>Cell cycle control by the target of rapamycin signalling pathway in plants.</a></h1><p>Cells need to ensure a sufficient nutrient and  supply before committing to proliferate. In response to positive mitogenic signals, such as light, sugar availability, and hormones, the target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway promotes cell growth that connects to the entry and passage through the cell division cycle via multiple signalling mechanisms. Here, we summarize current understanding of cell cycle regulation by the RBR-E2F regulatory hub and the DREAM-like complexes, and highlight possible functional relationships between these regulators and TOR signalling. A genetic screen recently uncovered a downstream signalling component to TOR that regulates cell proliferation, YAK1, a member of the dual specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family. YAK1 activates the plant-specific SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and therefore could be important to regulate both the CDKA-RBR-E2F pathway to control the G1/S transition and the mitotic CDKB1;1 to control the G2/M transition. TOR, as a master regulator of both protein synthesis-driven cell growth and cell proliferation is also central for cell size homeostasis. We conclude the review by briefly highlighting the potential applications of combining TOR and cell cycle knowledge in the context of ensuring future food security.© The Author(s) 2019.

For every death by suicide there are as many as 25 suicide attempts, which can result in serious injury even when not fatal. Despite this large impact on morbidity and mortality, the genetic influences on suicide attempt are poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of severity of suicide attempts to investigate genetic influences. A discovery GWAS was performed in Yale-Penn sample cohorts of European Americans (EAs, n = 2,439) and African Americans (AAs, n = 3,881). We found one genome-wide significant (GWS) signal in EAs near the gene LDHB (rs1677091, p = 1.07 × 10) and three GWS associations in AAs: ARNTL2 on chromosome 12 (rs683813, p = 2.07 × 10), FAH on chromosome 15 (rs72740082, p = 2.36 × 10), and on chromosome 18 (rs11876255, p = 4.61 × 10) in the Yale-Penn discovery sample. We conducted a limited replication analysis in the completely independent Army-STARRS cohorts. rs1677091 replicated in Latinos (LAT, p = 6.52 × 10). A variant in LD with FAH rs72740082 (rs72740088; r = 0.68) was replicated in AAs (STARRS AA p = 5.23 × 10; AA meta, 1.51 × 10). When combined for a trans-population meta-analysis, the final sample size included n = 20,153 individuals. Finally, we found significant genetic overlap with major depressive disorder (MDD) using polygenic risk scores from a large GWAS (r = 0.007, p = 6.42 × 10). To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS of suicide attempt severity. We identified GWS associations near genes involved in anaerobic  production (LDHB), circadian clock regulation (ARNTL2), and catabolism of  (FAH). These findings provide evidence of genetic risk factors for suicide attempt severity, providing new information regarding the molecular mechanisms involved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30863278>Metabolite Profiles of the Cerebrospinal Fluid in Neurosyphilis Patients Determined by Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis.</a></h1><p>The mechanism underlying the stealth property of neurosyphilis is still unclear. Global metabolomics analysis can provide substantial information on  metabolism, physiology and possible diagnostic biomarkers and intervention strategies for pathogens. To gain better understanding of the metabolic mechanism of neurosyphilis, we conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 18 neurosyphilis patients and an identical number of syphilis/non-neurosyphilis patients and syphilis-free patients using the Agilent, 1290 Infinity LC system. The raw data were normalized and subjected to subsequent statistical analysis by MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Metabolites with a variable importance in projection (VIP) greater than one were validated by Student's -test. A total of 1,808 molecular features were extracted from each sample using XCMS software, and the peak intensity of each feature was obtained. Partial-least squares discrimination analysis provided satisfactory separation by comparing neurosyphilis, syphilis/non-neurosyphilis and syphilis-free patients. A similar trend was obtained in the hierarchical clustering analysis. Furthermore, several metabolites were identified as significantly different by Student's -test, including L-gulono-gamma-lactone, D-mannose, N-acetyl-, hypoxanthine, and -methyl-5'-thioadenosine. Notably, 87.369-fold and 7.492-fold changes of N-acetyl- were observed in neurosyphilis patients compared with syphilis/non-neurosyphilis patients and syphilis-free patients. These differential metabolites are involved in overlapping pathways, including fructose and mannose metabolism, lysosomes, ABC transporters, and galactose metabolism. Several significantly expressed metabolites were identified in CSF from neurosyphilis patients, including L-gulono-gamma-lactone, D-mannose, N-acetyl-, and hypoxanthine. These differential metabolites could potentially improve neurosyphilis diagnostics in the future. The role of these differential metabolites in the development of neurosyphilis deserves further exploration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513003>In-silico design, ADMET screening, MM-GBSA binding free  of some novel isoxazole substituted 9-anilinoacridines as HER2 inhibitors targeting breast cancer.</a></h1><p>Human epidermal development factor receptor-2 (HER2) is the dominent  kinase receptor, being enhanced in 20% of instances of breast cancer.

Environmental metabolomics methods that combine quantitative measurements of metabolite levels and multivariate statistical analysis are powerful tools for ascertaining biological impacts and identifying potential biomarkers of exposure. We propose the use of the saltwater aquatic crustacean, Artemia franciscana, as a model organism for environmental metabolomics in saltwater ecosystems. Artemia are a good choice for ecotoxicity assays and metabolomics analysis because they have a short life cycle, their hemolymph is rich in metabolites and they tolerate a wide salinity range. In this work we explore the potential of Artemia franciscana for environmental metabolomics through exposure to the broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate. The LC for a 48 h exposure of Roundup was determined to be 237 ± 23 ppm glyphosate in the Roundup formulation. Artemia cysts were hatched and exposed to sub-lethal glyphosate concentrations of 1.00, 10.0, 50.0, or 100 ppm glyphosate in Roundup. We profiled 48 h old Artemia extracts using H NMR and GC-MS. Dose-dependent metabolic perturbation was evident for several metabolites using univariate and multivariate analyses. Metabolites significantly affected by Roundup exposure included aspartate, formate, betaine, glucose, , phenylalanine, gadusol, and isopropylamine. Biochemical pathway analysis with the KEGG database suggests impairment of carbohydrate and  metabolism, folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, Artemia molting and development, and microbial metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the TOR signaling pathway in plants. We used Arabidopsis lines affected in the lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (LST8-1) gene, a core element of the TOR complex, to search for suppressor mutations. Two suppressor lines with improved growth were isolated that carried mutations in the Yet Another Kinase 1 (AtYAK1) gene encoding a member of the dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) family. Atyak1 mutations partly rescued the developmental defects of lst8-1-1 mutants and conferred resistance to the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Moreover, atyak1 mutations suppressed the transcriptomic and metabolic perturbations as well as the abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitivity of the lst8-1-1 mutants. AtYAK1 interacted with the regulatory-associated protein of TOR (RAPTOR), a component of the TOR complex, and was phosphorylated by TOR. Thus, our findings reveal that AtYAK1 is a TOR effector that probably needs to be switched off to activate plant growth.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently, inspired by the intrinsic emission of nonaromatic amino acids and poly(amino acids) in concentrated solutions and solids, we revisited protein light emission using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model. BSA is virtually nonemissive in dilute solutions (≤0.1 mg mL ), but highly luminescent upon concentration or aggregation, showing unique concentration-enhanced emission and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Notably, apart from well-documented UV luminescence, bright blue emission is clearly observed. Furthermore, persistent room-temperature phosphorescence (p-RTP) is achieved even in the amorphous solids under ambient conditions. This visible emission can be rationalized by the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism. These findings not only provide an in-depth understanding of the emissive properties of proteins, but also hold strong implications for further elucidating the basis of tissue autofluorescence.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To better understand the roles of TATs and how Tyr is metabolized , here we characterized single and double loss-of-function mutants of  (At5g53970) and  (At5g36160) in the model plant  As reported previously,  mutants exhibited elevated and decreased levels of Tyr and tocopherols, respectively. The  mutation alone had no impact on Tyr and tocopherol levels, but a  double mutant had increased Tyr accumulation and decreased tocopherol levels under high-light stress compared with the  mutant. Relative to WT and the  mutant, the  mutant displayed increased vulnerability to continuous dark treatment, associated with an early drop in respiratory activity and sucrose depletion. During isotope-labeled Tyr feeding in the dark, we observed that the  mutant exhibits much slower C incorporation into tocopherols, fumarate, and other tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates than WT and the  mutant. These results indicate that TAT1 and TAT2 function together in tocopherol biosynthesis, with TAT2 having a lesser role, and that TAT1 plays the major role in Tyr degradation  Our study also highlights the importance of Tyr degradation under carbon starvation conditions during dark-induced senescence in plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094198>Nitration of  Channels Photoenergy through a Conical Intersection in Water.</a></h1><p>Nitration of  occurs under oxidative stress in vivo. The product, 3-nitrotyrosine (3NY), has a dramatically decreased quantum yield and can be used as a molecular ruler. In this study, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum calculations were implemented to elucidate the photoinduced relaxation processes of anionic 3NY in water. Upon 400 nm excitation into an excited electronic state with notable charge-transfer (CT) character, a barrierless nitro-twisting motion rapidly (<100 fs) guides the chromophore into an adjacent twisted intramolecular CT state, therein reaching a sloped S/S conical intersection on the ∼100 fs time scale. Once in the hot ground state, excess  is further released through vibrational cooling with biexponential time constants of ∼140 and 680 fs in water. Nitro back-twisting occurs on longer time scales (∼1.1 and 9 ps in water), returning the system to original ground state. Systematic evaluations of excited-state potential energies of anionic 3NY were performed by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations, showing that intersystem crossing (ISC) from the first singlet state (S) to the first or second triplet state (T or T) is unlikely. Inclusion of an explicit water molecule in calculations leads to improved mapping of the excited-state  ordering of the second singlet state (S) and T, further diminishing ISC probability from S and favoring an ultrafast internal conversion to S. These results provide deep insights into the highly efficient nonradiative decay of anionic 3NY in aqueous solution, with nitro-site-specific information that can help infer the characterization and potential optogenetic control of 3NY in protein environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235103>Are dietary amino acids prospectively predicts changes in serum lipid profile?</a></h1><p>Besides of dietary fat and carbohydrate, amino acids(AAs), as constituent components of dietary protein have been related with serum lipid levels. This study aims to examine the association between dietary AAs and prospective changes in serum lipid profile in adults.Analyses were conducted on 3881 participants aged, 18-75 years of Tehran lipid and Glucose study, at baseline (2008-2011) and were followed for 3 years (2011-2014) to ascertain serum lipid profile changes. Dietary intakes of AAs were collected at baseline using food frequency questionnaire. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, smoking and daily intakes of , total fat, and fiber were used.The median(IQR) changes in triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 6.0(-19.0, -35.5), 9.0(7.0, -24.0), 1.0(-3.0, -6.0), and 5.2(-8.0, -18.6) mg/dl, respectively. Higher intakes of isoleucine, lysine, , alanine, threonine, methionine, valine, histidine, aspartic acid, and branched chain, alkaline, and alcoholic AAs were positively associated with TGs-changes in the final adjusted model, whereas tryptophan, glutamic acid, and acidic AAs were negatively related to TG-changes. Alanine and tryptophan were associated with higher and lower LDL-C-changes, respectively. Lysine, alanine, methionine, aspartic acid, and alkaline AAs showed positive association with changes in TC, whereas tryptophan and glutamic acid had a negative association with TC-changes.Our findings showed that some dietary amino acids have the potential to increase or decrease serum lipid profile.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

As a product of water chlorination and a metabolite of certain industrial chemicals, DCA is ubiquitous in our biosphere at low μg/kg body weight daily exposure levels without obvious adverse effects in humans. As an investigational drug for numerous congenital and acquired diseases, DCA is administered orally or parenterally, usually at doses of 10-50mg/kg per day. As a therapeutic, its principal mechanism of action is to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). In turn, PDK inhibits the key mitochondrial  homeostat, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), by reversible phosphorylation. By blocking PDK, DCA activates PDC and, consequently, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. A reversible sensory/motor peripheral neuropathy is the clinically limiting adverse effect of chronic DCA exposure and experimental data implicate the Schwann cell as a toxicological target. It has been postulated that stimulation of PDC and respiratory chain activity by DCA in normally glycolytic Schwann cells causes uncompensated oxidative stress from increased reactive oxygen species production. Additionally, the metabolism of DCA interferes with the catabolism of the amino acids phenylalanine and  and with heme synthesis, resulting in accumulation of reactive molecules capable of forming adducts with DNA and proteins and also resulting in oxidative stress. Preliminary evidence in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy suggest that DCA-induced neurotoxicity may be mitigated by naturally occurring antioxidants and by a specific class of muscarinic receptor antagonists. These findings generate a number of testable hypotheses regarding the etiology and treatment of DCA peripheral neuropathy.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we used hybrid structural methods to decipher Siw14 molecular architecture. We found the protein exists in solution as an elongated monomer that is ∼140 Å in length, containing an acidic N-terminal domain and a basic C-terminal dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) domain, structurally similar to the glycogen phosphatase laforin. The two domains are connected by a protease susceptible linker and do not interact in vitro. The crystal structure of Siw14-DSP reveals a highly basic phosphate-binding loop and an ∼10 Å deep substrate-binding crevice that evolved to dephosphorylate pyro-phosphate moieties. A pseudoatomic model of the full-length phosphatase generated from solution, crystallographic, biochemical, and modeling data sheds light on the interesting zwitterionic nature of Siw14, which we hypothesized may play a role in discriminating negatively charged inositol phosphates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616835>Molecular Mechanisms of Macular Degeneration Associated with the Complement Factor H Y402H Mutation.</a></h1><p>A single nucleotide polymorphism,  at position 402 to histidine (Y402H), within the gene encoding complement factor H (FH) predisposes individuals to acquiring age-related macular degeneration (AMD) after aging. This polymorphism occurs in short consensus repeat (SCR) 7 of FH and results in decreased binding affinity of SCR6-8 for heparin. As FH is responsible for regulating the complement system, decreased affinity for heparin results in decreased regulation on surfaces of self. To understand the involvement of the Y402H polymorphism in AMD, we leverage methods from bioinformatics and computational biophysics to quantify structural and dynamical differences between SCR7 isoforms that contribute to decreased pattern recognition in SCR7. Our data from molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations suggest a revised mechanism for decreased heparin binding. In this model, transient contacts not observed in structures for SCR7 are predicted to occur in molecular dynamics simulations between coevolved residues Y402 and I412, stabilizing SCR7 in a conformation that promotes association with heparin. H402 in the risk isoform is less likely to form a contact with I412 and samples a larger conformational space than Y402. We observe  minima for sidechains of Y402 and R404 from SCR7 that are predicted to associate with heparin at a rate constant faster than  minima for sidechains of H402 and R404 from SCR7. As both carbohydrate density and degree of sulfation decrease with age in Bruch's membrane of the macula, the decreased heparin recognition of SCR7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.Copyright © 2018 Biophysical Society.

However, ATP-competitive Src inhibitors have not reached the clinic yet and alternative approaches are in high demand. The UNC119A/B proteins bind the myristoylated N terminus of Src and thereby mediate -driven spatial cycles that maintain Src enrichment at the plasma membrane, which is critical for Src signaling activity. We describe the discovery of a potent and specific inhibitor of the UNC119-Src interaction with unprecedented chemotype. The inhibitor binds to UNC119 in cells, and induces redistribution of Src to endomembranes and reduction of activating Src autophosphorylation on Y419. UNC119 inhibition in Src-dependent colorectal cancer cells results in the specific reduction of cell growth and clonogenic potential. Our results demonstrate that small-molecule interference with the dynamics of the Src spatial cycle may provide an opportunity to impair oncogenic Src signaling.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Paradoxically, radiation is also a risk factor for GBM development, raising the possibility that radiotherapy of brain tumors could promote tumor recurrence or trigger secondary gliomas. In this study, we determined whether tumor suppressor losses commonly displayed by patients with GBM confer susceptibility to radiation-induced glioma.

Mice with loss of one allele each of  and  did not develop spontaneous gliomas, but were highly susceptible to radiation-induced gliomagenesis. Tumor development frequency after exposure to high-LET particle radiation was significantly higher compared with X-rays, in accordance with the irreparability of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by high-LET radiation.

Mutations in the  or the TrkB-encoding  gene have been found to cause severe obesity in humans and mice. However, it remains unknown which brain neurons express TrkB to control body weight. Here, we report that TrkB-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) regulate food intake. We found that the DMH contains both glutamatergic and GABAergic TrkB-expressing neurons, some of which also express the leptin receptor (LepR). As revealed by Fos immunohistochemistry, a significant number of TrkB-expressing DMH (DMH) neurons were activated upon either overnight fasting or after refeeding. Chemogenetic activation of DMH neurons strongly suppressed feeding in the dark cycle when mice are physiologically hungry, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of DMH neurons greatly promoted feeding in the light cycle when mice are physiologically satiated, without affecting feeding in the dark cycle. Neuronal tracing revealed that DMH neurons do not innervate neurons expressing agouti-related protein in the arcuate nucleus, indicating that DMH neurons are distinct from previously identified LepR-expressing GABAergic DMH neurons that suppress feeding. Furthermore, selective  deletion in the DMH of adult mice led to hyperphagia, reduced  expenditure, and obesity. Thus, our data show that DMH neurons are a population of neurons that are necessary and sufficient to suppress appetite and maintain physiological satiation. Pharmacological activation of these neurons could be a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900086>Silver cluster-amino acid interactions: a quantum-chemical study.</a></h1><p>Binding of silver ion (Ag) and two atomic neutral silver cluster (Ag) with a set of amino acids has been studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio MP2 method.

Herein, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach was applied to evaluate the important driving factors of the human insulin encapsulation into the chitosan and cholesterol-modified chitosan polymers. The MD results revealed that the native conformation of insulin was stabilized by the chitosan polymers. In the present study, the effect of cholesterol moieties of modified chitosan was also examined and the results indicated that the cholesterol components would decrease the tendency of chitosan polymers to human insulin. Further analyses showed that the intermolecular interactions between the , phenylalanine, and acidic residues are important in the formation of the insulin-polymer complexes.

Subsequent studies found that the (P)RR is widely distributed in organs throughout the body, including the kidneys, heart, brain, eyes, placenta and the immune system, and has multifaceted functions in vivo. The (P)RR has roles in various physiological processes, such as the cell cycle, autophagy, acid-base balance,  metabolism, embryonic development, T cell homeostasis, water balance, blood pressure regulation, cardiac remodelling and maintenance of podocyte structure. These roles of the (P)RR are mediated by its effects on important biological systems and pathways including the tissue RAS, vacuolar H-ATPase, Wnt, partitioning defective homologue (Par) and  phosphorylation. In addition, the (P)RR has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as fibrosis, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, diabetic microangiopathy, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity. Current evidence suggests that the (P)RR has key roles in the normal development and maintenance of vital organs and that dysfunction of the (P)RR is associated with diseases that are characterized by a disruption of the homeostasis of physiological functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558029>Ultrahighly Efficient and Stable Fluorescent Gold Nanoclusters Coated with Screened Peptides of Unique Sequences for Effective Protein and Serum Discrimination.</a></h1><p>Gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) coated with various peptides have been widely used as fluorescent probes, and nowadays the most commonly used are cysteine (C) and  (Y) based ones. Herein, we report the preparation and clinical application of highly efficient and stable fluorescent Au NCs protected by screened peptides with a specific amino acid sequence Cys-Met-Met-Met-Met-Met (CMMMMM). Compared with traditional C, Y based peptide (CYYYYY) protected Au NCs, the fluorescence intensity of the CMMMMM-Au NCs increased by 230%, and the photobleaching resistance or stability of the CMMMMM-Au NCs increased by about 300% (after continuous ultraviolet irradiation for 60 min, the fluorescence of the CMMMMM-Au NCs remained more than 90% of their initial intensity, while the CYYYYY-Au NCs remained less than 30%). Assaying arrays based on CMMMMM protected Au NCs with different positive or negative charges as sensing receptors were developed through regulating different pH values, and multivariate analysis on the patterns obtained by these arrays allowed effective identification of not only ten proteins separately but also complex protein mixtures with subtly diverse compositions. The docking simulation and isothermal titration confirmed that target proteins interacted with CMMMMM-Au NCs mainly through electrostatic interactions and partly hydrophobic interactions, which affected the binding  and fluorescence lifetime of CMMMMM-Au NCs, resulting in the unique fingerprint-like recognition patterns. Furthermore, serums from breast cancer, severe osteoarthritis, and rectal cancer patients can be effectively identified with healthy people using this CMMMMM-Au NCs based sensor array.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531707>Co-ingestion of whey protein hydrolysate with milk minerals rich in calcium potently stimulates glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion: an RCT in healthy adults.</a></h1><p>To examine whether calcium type and co-ingestion with protein alter gut hormone availability.Healthy adults aged 26 ± 7 years (mean ± SD) completed three randomized, double-blind, crossover studies. In all studies, arterialized blood was sampled postprandially over 120 min to determine GLP-1, GIP and PYY responses, alongside appetite ratings,  expenditure and blood pressure. In study 1 (n = 20), three treatments matched for total calcium content (1058 mg) were compared: calcium citrate (CALCITR); milk minerals rich in calcium (MILK MINERALS); and milk minerals rich in calcium plus co-ingestion of 50 g whey protein hydrolysate (MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN). In study 2 (n = 6), 50 g whey protein hydrolysate (PROTEIN) was compared to MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN. In study 3 (n = 6), MILK MINERALS was compared to the vehicle of ingestion (water plus sucralose; CONTROL).MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN increased GLP-1 incremental area under the curve (iAUC) by ~ ninefold (43.7 ± 11.1 pmol L 120 min; p < 0.001) versus both CALCITR and MILK MINERALS, with no difference detected between CALCITR (6.6 ± 3.7 pmol L 120 min) and MILK MINERALS (5.3 ± 3.5 pmol L 120 min; p > 0.999). MILK MINERALS + PROTEIN produced a GLP-1 iAUC ~ 25% greater than PROTEIN (p = 0.024; mean difference: 9.1 ± 6.9 pmol L 120 min), whereas the difference between MILK MINERALS versus CONTROL was small and non-significant (p = 0.098; mean difference: 4.2 ± 5.1 pmol L 120 min).When ingested alone, milk minerals rich in calcium do not increase GLP-1 secretion compared to calcium citrate.

The development of small molecule multikinase inhibitors through hybridization strategy can provide highly potent and selective anticancer agents. A library of N-alkyl-2-[(4-oxo-3-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)thio]acetamide derivatives 5-18 was designed and synthesized. The synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and showed IC in the range of 0.34-149.10 µM. The inhibition percentage of VEGFR-2 was measured for all the compounds and found to be in the range of 90.09-20.44%. The promising compounds 8, 12, 13, 16 and 17 were selected to measure their possible multikinase inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 and EGFR. IC of the promising compounds were in the range of 247-793 nM for VEGFR-2 in reference to sunitinib (IC 320 nM), and 369-725 nM for EGFR in reference to erlotinib (IC 568 nM). Compounds 12 and 13 showed the most potent activity towards VEGFR-2 & EGFR, respectively. Measuring the cytotoxicity of 12 and 13 against MCF-10 normal breast cell line indicates their relative safety to normal breast cells (IC 37 & 97 µM, respectively). As radiotherapy is considered the primary treatment for some types of solid tumors, the radiosensitizing ability of 12 and 13 was measured by subjecting the MDA-MB-231 cells to a single dose of 8 Gy of gamma radiation. IC of 12 and 13 decreased from 1.91 & 0.51 µM to 0.79 & 0.43 µM, respectively.

These various cancer-related kinases form intricate interdependent signaling networks. Evaluation of the effect of various kinase inhibitors on these networks is critical to understand kinase inhibitor efficacy in cancer therapy. The dynamic activation of some kinases can be monitored by fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) biosensors with high temporal resolution. Here, we established a FRET biosensor-based high throughput imaging approach to determine ERK and AKT activity in two triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines HCC1806 and Hs578T. FRET functionality was systematically evaluated using EGF stimulation and different MEK and AKT inhibitors, respectively. Next, we assessed the effect of a kinase inhibitor library containing >350 different kinase inhibitors (KIs) on ERK and AKT kinase activity using a FRET high-throughput screening setting. Suppression of FRET-ERK activity was generally positively correlated with the proliferation phenotype against inhibitors targeting MAPK signaling in both cell lines containing FRET-ERK reporter. AKT inhibitor (AKTi) resistant HCC1806 showed decreased proliferation associated with downregulated dynamics of FRET-ERK when treated with KIs targeting protein receptor  kinase (RTK). Yet, MEK inhibitor (MEKi) resistant Hs578T showed positively correlated FRET-AKT and proliferative responses against different PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Altogether, our data demonstrate the feasibility to integrate high throughput imaging-based screening of intracellular kinase activity using FRET-based biosensors in assessing kinase specificity and possible signaling crosstalk in direct relation to therapeutic outcome.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Although functional genomics has accelerated therapeutic target discovery in cancer, its use in primary immune cells is limited because vector delivery is inefficient and can perturb cell states. Here we describe CHIME: CHimeric IMmune Editing, a CRISPR-Cas9 bone marrow delivery system to rapidly evaluate gene function in innate and adaptive immune cells in vivo without ex vivo manipulation of these mature lineages. This approach enables efficient deletion of genes of interest in major immune lineages without altering their development or function. We use this approach to perform an in vivo pooled genetic screen and identify Ptpn2 as a negative regulator of CD8 T cell-mediated responses to LCMV Clone 13 viral infection.

Some of these mutations are known to decrease FAH catalytic activity, but the mechanisms of FAH mutation-induced pathogenicity remain poorly understood. Here, using diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy, cryo-EM, and CD analyses, along with site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the putative role of thermodynamic and kinetic stability in WT FAH and a representative set of 19 missense mutations identified in individuals with HT1. We found that at physiological temperatures and concentrations, WT FAH is in equilibrium between a catalytically active dimer and a monomeric species, with the latter being inactive and prone to oligomerization and aggregation. We also found that the majority of the deleterious mutations reduce the kinetic stability of the enzyme and always accelerate the FAH aggregation pathway. Depending mainly on the position of the amino acid in the structure, pathogenic mutations either reduced the dimer population or decreased the  barrier that separates the monomer from the aggregate. The mechanistic insights reported here pave the way for the development of pharmacological chaperones that target FAH to tackle the severe disease HT1.© 2019 Macias et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892888>Active Site Midpoint Potentials in Different Cytochrome c Oxidase Families: A Computational Comparison.</a></h1><p>Cytochrome c oxidase (C cO) is the terminal enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain, reducing molecular oxygen to water. The binuclear active site in C cO comprises a high-spin heme associated with a Cu complex and a redox active . The electron transport in the respiratory chain is driven by increasing midpoint potentials of the involved cofactors, resulting in a release of free , which is stored by coupling the electron transfer to proton translocation across a membrane, building up an electrochemical gradient. In this context, the midpoint potentials of the active site cofactors in the C cOs are of special interest, since they determine the driving forces for the individual oxygen reduction steps and thereby affect the efficiency of the proton pumping. It has been difficult to obtain useful information on some of these midpoint potentials from experiments. However, since each of the reduction steps in the catalytic cycle of oxygen reduction to water corresponds to the formation of an O-H bond, they can be calculated with a reasonably high accuracy using quantum chemical methods. From the calculated O-H bond strengths, the proton-coupled midpoint potentials of the active site cofactors can be estimated. Using models representing the different families of C cO's (A, B, and C), the calculations give midpoint potentials that should be relevant during catalytic turnover. The calculations also suggest possible explanations for why some experimentally measured potentials deviate significantly from the calculated ones, i.e., for Cu in all oxidase families, and for heme b in the C family.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30685094>Discovery of a potent  kinase AXL inhibitor bearing the 3-((2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-7-yl)amino)pyrazine core.</a></h1><p>Starting from the recently launched FLT3/AXL multi-targeted inhibitor Gilteritinib (5), we conducted a side-chain ring closure medicinal chemistry approach leading to the identification of compound 15c as a highly potent AXL inhibitor in the biochemical and cellular anti-proliferative assays, with IC values of 1.2 and 0.3 nM, respectively.

We show that female mice genetically lacking protein  phosphatase (PTP) receptor type α (PTPRA) exhibit reduced weight and adiposity and increased  expenditure, and are more resistant to diet-induced obesity than matched wild-type control mice. These mice also exhibit reduced levels of circulating leptin and are leptin hypersensitive, suggesting that PTPRA inhibits leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. Male and female PTPRA-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet were leaner and displayed increased metabolic rates and lower circulating leptin levels, indicating that the effects of loss of PTPRA persist in the obese state. Molecularly, PTPRA down-regulates leptin receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor-associated kinase JAK2, with which the phosphatase associates constitutively. In contrast to the closely related  phosphatase ε, leptin induces only weak phosphorylation of PTPRA at its C-terminal regulatory site Y789, and this does not affect the activity of PTPRA toward JAK2. PTPRA is therefore an inhibitor of hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo and may prevent premature activation of leptin signaling, as well as return signaling to baseline after exposure to leptin.-Cohen-Sharir, Y., Kuperman, Y., Apelblat, D., den Hertog, J., Spiegel, I., Knobler, H., Elson, A.

We previously reported that use of an FRET-based drug sensitivity test at diagnosis efficiently predicts the response to treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Here, we conducted a phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment and identify useful biomarkers, including results of the FRET-based drug sensitivity test, for predicting treatment response. Data from 42 patients were used in the analysis. Major molecular response (MMR), MR4, and MR4.5 rates at 12 months were 64.3, 42.9, and 28.6%, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events occurred in 11 patients (26.2%). The dose intensity of nilotinib (> 76.44%) and halving time (HT, < 13.312 days) were identified as significant factors for MMR at 12 months. However, when we focused on patients whose dose intensity of nilotinib was > 76.44%, the FRET-based drug sensitivity test became a predictive factor of MR4 achievement at 12 months.

Arctic fjords are preferred systems to study these changes as they respond quickly to variations in ocean, land and atmosphere conditions. In this study, we investigated for the first time the seasonal variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties and its origin in an Arctic fjord, which allows for an assessment of the future potential effects of climate change in this environment. We conducted an integrated analysis of the concentrations, optical properties (absorption and fluorescence), and molecular size distributions of DOM in two seasons (October 2017 and April 2018) and in eight to ten stations in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) along with the related environmental parameters such as chlorophyll-a, inorganic nutrients, particulate organic carbon (POC), temperature, and salinity. Our results showed that, in both seasons, the DOM in the fjord was predominately of autochthonous origin with a seasonally variable terrestrial input. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were consistently higher in October than in April at each station. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a marked seasonal variability depending on the DOM fluorophore types and size fractions. In October, humic-like and tryptophan-like substances were dominant whereas in April, -like compounds represented, on average, 58% of the DOM fluorescence.

This efficacy decreases due to drug resistance conferred by a second mutation, T790M, which subsequently produces a double mutant, L858R/T790M. Although this resistance was initially attributed to steric blocking by the T790M mutation, experimental studies have demonstrated that differences in the binding affinities of TKIs to T790M and L858R/T790M mutants are more a result of the increased sensitivity of these mutants to ATP than to a decrease in the affinity to TKIs. Regrettably, detailed information at the atomic level on the origins of the increased binding affinity of mutants for ATP is lacking. In this study, we have combined structural data and molecular dynamics simulations with the MMGBSA approach to determine how the L858R, T790M and L858R/T790 mutations impact the binding mechanism of ATP with respect to wild-type EGFR. Structural and energetic analyses provided novel information that helps to explain the increased affinity of ATP to T790M and L858R/T790 mutants with respect to L858R and wild-type systems. In addition, it was observed that dimerization of the wild-type and mutant systems exerts dissimilar effects on the ATP binding affinity characteristic of negative cooperativity.

Fluorescence, NMR, and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) techniques have been used to study the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the loop motions. In this study, a computational approach based on the pathway refinement methods nudged elastic band (NEB) and harmonic Fourier beads (HFB) has been developed to provide structural interpretations for the experimentally observed kinetic processes. In this approach, the minimum potential  pathways for the loop open/closure conformational changes were determined by NEB using a one-dimensional global coordinate. Two dimensional data analyses of the NEB results were performed as an efficient method to qualitatively evaluate the energetics of transitions along several specific physical coordinates. The free  barriers for these transitions were then determined more precisely using the HFB method. Kinetic parameters were estimated from the  barriers using transition state theory and compared against experimentally determined kinetic parameters. When the calculated  barriers are calibrated by a simple "scaling factor", as have been done in our previous vibrational frequency calculations to explain the ligand frequency shift upon its binding to protein, it is possible to make structural interpretations of several observed enzyme dynamic rates. For example, the nanosecond kinetics observed by fluorescence anisotropy may be assigned to the translational motion of the catalytic loop and microsecond kinetics observed in fluorescence T-jump can be assigned to the loop backbone dihedral angle flipping. Furthermore, we can predict that a Trp354 conformational conversion associated with the loop movements would occur on the tens of nanoseconds time scale, to be verified by future UVRR T-jump studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934865>Structural and Computational Characterization of Disease-Related Mutations Involved in Protein-Protein Interfaces.</a></h1><p>One of the known potential effects of disease-causing amino acid substitutions in proteins is to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To interpret such variants at the molecular level and to obtain useful information for prediction purposes, it is important to determine whether they are located at protein-protein interfaces, which are composed of two main regions, core and rim, with different evolutionary conservation and physicochemical properties. Here we have performed a structural, energetics and computational analysis of interactions between proteins hosting mutations related to diseases detected in newborn screening. Interface residues were classified as core or rim, showing that the core residues contribute the most to the binding free  of the PPI. Disease-causing variants are more likely to occur at the interface core region rather than at the interface rim ( < 0.0001). In contrast, neutral variants are more often found at the interface rim or at the non-interacting surface rather than at the interface core region. We also found that arginine, tryptophan, and  are over-represented among mutated residues leading to disease.

None of the existing models can capture all aspects of AN but they are able to mirror the core features of the disorder e.g., elective starvation, emaciation and premature death. The anorectic  mouse is of particular value for the understanding of the abnormal response to negative  balance seen in AN. These mice appear normal at birth but gradually develops starvation and emaciation despite full access to food, and die prematurely around three weeks of age. Several changes in hypothalamic neuropeptidergic and -transmitter systems involved in regulating food intake and metabolism have been documented in the  mouse. These changes are accompanied by signs of inflammation and degeneration in the same hypothalamic regions; including activation of microglia cells and expression of major histocompatibility complex I by microglia and selective neuronal populations. These aberrances are likely related to the dysfunction of complex I (CI) in the oxidative phosphorylation system of the mitochondria, and subsequent increased oxidative stress, which also has been revealed in the hypothalamus of these mice. Interestingly, a similar CI dysfunction has been shown in leukocytes from patients with AN. In addition, a higher expression of the  gene has been shown in the  hypothalamus. This agrees with AN being associated with specific variants of the genes for brain derived neurotrophic factor and Neurotrophic Receptor  Kinase 2. The  mouse is also glucose intolerant and display pancreatic dysfunction related to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and pancreatic inflammation. An increased incidence of eating disorders has been reported for young diabetic women, and as well has increased levels of circulating FFAs in AN. Also similar to individuals with AN, the  mouse has reduced leptin and increased cholesterol levels in serum. Thus, the  mouse shares several characteristics with patients with AN, including emaciation, starvation, premature death, diabetic features, increased FFA and low leptin, and is therefore a unique resource in research on the (neuro)biology of AN.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453187>Effect of fermentation using  and  on nutritional quality, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of used rice as a poultry feed ingredient.</a></h1><p>This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of fermentation using  and  on nutritional qualities, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of the used rice as a poultry feed ingredient.The used rice was soaked, steamed, and spread on a tray to cool.

On the other hand, drug-induced kidney proximal tubular injury, electrolytes disturbances, and renal failure is a clinical complication associated with imatinib therapy. There is no precise cellular mechanism(s) for imatinib-induced renal injury. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of imatinib nephrotoxicity. Rats received imatinib (50 and 100 mg/kg, oral, 14 consecutive days). Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury and markers of oxidative stress in the kidney tissue were assessed. Moreover, kidney mitochondria were isolated, and mitochondrial indices, including mitochondrial depolarization, dehydrogenases activity, mitochondrial permeabilization, lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial glutathione levels, and ATP content were determined. A significant increase in serum (Creatinine; Cr and blood urea nitrogen; BUN) and urine (Glucose, protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase; γ-GT, and alkaline phosphatase; ALP) biomarkers of renal injury, as well as serum electrolytes disturbances (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia), were evident in imatinib-treated animals. On the other hand, imatinib (100 mg/kg) caused an increase in kidney ROS and LPO. Renal tubular interstitial nephritis, tissue necrosis, and atrophy were evident as tissue histopathological changes in imatinib-treated rats. Mitochondrial parameters were also adversely affected by imatinib administration. These data represent mitochondrial impairment, renal tissue  crisis, and oxidative stress as possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of imatinib-induced renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183838>Integration of High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry with Cryogenic Ion Vibrational Spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>We describe an instrumental configuration for the structural characterization of fragment ions generated by collisional dissociation of peptide ions in the typical MS scheme widely used for peptide sequencing. Structures are determined by comparing the vibrational band patterns displayed by cryogenically cooled ions with calculated spectra for candidate structural isomers. These spectra were obtained in a linear action mode by photodissociation of weakly bound D molecules. This is accomplished by interfacing a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Velos Pro to a cryogenic, triple focusing time-of-flight photofragmentation mass spectrometer (the Yale TOF spectrometer). The interface involves replacement of the Orbitrap's higher- collisional dissociation cell with a voltage-gated aperture that maintains the commercial instrument's standard capabilities while enabling bidirectional transfer of ions between the high-resolution FT analyzer and external ion sources. The performance of this hybrid instrument is demonstrated by its application to the a, y and z fragment ions generated by CID of a prototypical dipeptide precursor, protonated L-phenylalanyl- (H-Phe-Tyr-OH or FY-H). The structure of the unusual z ion, nominally formed after NH is ejected from the protonated  (y) product, is identified as the cyclopropane-based product is tentatively identified as a cyclopropane-based product.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949723>Metabolomic signature of type 1 diabetes-induced sensory loss and nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic-induced peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a highly complex and frequent diabetic late complication, which is manifested by prolonged hyperglycemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of nerve damage and sensory loss remain largely unclear. Recently, alteration in metabolic flux has gained attention as a basis for organ damage in diabetes; however, peripheral sensory neurons have not been adequately analyzed with respect to metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, we attempted to delineate the sequence of event occurring in alteration of metabolic pathways in relation to nerve damage and sensory loss. C57Bl6/j wild-type mice were analyzed longitudinally up to 22 weeks in the streptozotocin (STZ) model of type 1 diabetes. The progression of DPN was investigated by behavioral measurements of sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli and quantitative morphological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density. We employed a mass spectrometry-based screen to address alterations in levels of metabolites in peripheral sciatic nerve and amino acids in serum over several months post-STZ administration to elucidate metabolic dysfunction longitudinally in relation to sensory dysfunction. Although hyperglycemia and body weight changes occurred early, sensory loss and reduced intraepithelial branching of nociceptive nerves were only evident at 22 weeks post-STZ. The longitudinal metabolites screen in peripheral nerves demonstrated that compared with buffer-injected age-matched control mice, mice at 12 and 22 weeks post-STZ showed an early impairment the tricaoboxylic acid (TCA cycle), which is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism leading to  generation. We found that levels of citric acid, ketoglutaric acid (2 KG), succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were observed to be significantly reduced in sciatic nerve at 22 weeks post-STZ. In addition, we also found the increase in levels of sorbitol and L-lactate in peripheral nerve from 12 weeks post-STZ injection. Amino acid screen in serum showed that the amino acids valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), and leucine (Leu), grouped together as BCAA, increased more than twofold from 12 weeks post-STZ. Similarly, the levels of  (Tyr), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), histidine (His), alanine (Ala), and proline (Pro) showed progressive increase with progression of diabetes. Our results indicate that the impaired TCA cycle metabolites in peripheral nerve are the primary cause of shunting metabolic substrate to compensatory pathways, which leads to sensory nerve fiber loss in skin and contribute to onset and progression of peripheral neuropathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707914>Local and systemic metabolic alterations in brain, plasma, and liver of rats in response to aging and ischemic stroke, as detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.</a></h1><p>Metabolic dysfunction impacts stroke incidence and outcome. However, the intricate association between altered metabolic program due to aging, and focal ischemia in brain, circulation, and peripheral organs is not completely elucidated. Here we identified locally and systemically altered metabolites in brain, liver, and plasma as a result of normal aging, ischemic-stroke, and extended time of reperfusion injury. Comprehensive quantitative metabolic profiling was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Aging, but healthy rats showed significant metabolic alterations in the brain, but only a few metabolic changes in the liver and plasma as compared to younger rats. But, ischemic stroke altered metabolites significantly in liver and plasma of older rats during early acute phase. Major metabolic changes were also seen in the brains of younger rats following ischemic stroke during early acute phase of injury. We further report that metabolic changes occur sequentially in a tissue specific manner during extended reperfusion time of late repair phase. First metabolic alterations occurred in brain due to local injury. Next, changes in circulating metabolites in plasma occurred during acute-repair phase transition time. Lastly, the delayed systemic effect was seen in the peripheral organ, liver that exhibited significant and persistent changes in selected metabolites during later reperfusion time. The metabolic pathways involved in /glucose, and amino acid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress were mainly altered as a result of aging and ischemia/reperfusion. Biomarker analysis revealed citrate, lysine, and  as potential age-independent blood metabolic biomarkers of ischemia/reperfusion. Overall, our study elucidates the complex network of metabolic events as a function of normal aging and acute stroke. We further provide evidence for a clear transition from local to systemic metabolic dysfunction due to ischemic injury in a time dependent manner, which may altogether greatly impact the post-stroke outcome.Copyright © 2019.

After the exposure, H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics was used to measure earthworm sub-lethal responses by analyzing the changes in the polar metabolite profile. Maltose, glucose, malate, lactate/threonine, myo-inositol, glutamate, arginine, lysine, , leucine, and phenylalanine relative concentrations were altered with imidacloprid exposure in soil. In addition to these metabolites (excluding leucine and phenylalanine), fumarate, ATP, inosine, betaine, scyllo-inositol, glutamine, valine, tryptophan, alanine, , and isoleucine relative concentrations shifted with imidacloprid exposure during contact tests. Metabolite changes in E. fetida earthworms exposed to imidacloprid showed a non-linear concentration response and an upregulation in gluconeogenesis. Overall, imidacloprid exposure in soil induces a less pronounced response in metabolites glucose, maltose, fumarate, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), inosine, scyllo-inositol, lactate/threonine, and  in comparison to the response observed via contact tests. Thus, our study highlights that tests in soil can result in a different metabolic response in E. fetida and demonstrates the importance of different modes of exposure and the extent of metabolic perturbation in earthworms. Our study also emphasizes the underlying metabolic disruption of earthworms after acute sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid.

In this study, we have performed similarity/substructure-based search of eMolecule database to find out promising benzothiazole derivatives as EGFR  kinase inhibitors. Several screening criteria that included molecular docking, pharmacokinetics and synthetic accessibility were used on initially derived about 7000 molecules consisting of benzothiazole as major component. Finally, four molecules were found to be promising EGFR  kinase inhibitors. The best docked pose of each molecule was considered for binding interactions followed by molecular dynamics (MD) and binding  calculation. Molecular docking clearly showed the final proposed derivatives potential to form a number of binding interactions. MD simulation trajectories undoubtedly indicated that the EGFR protein becomes stable when proposed derivatives bind to the receptor cavity. Strong binding affinity was found for all molecules toward the EGFR which was substantiated by the binding  calculation using the MM-PBSA approach. Therefore, proposed benzothiazole derivatives may be promising EGFR  kinase inhibitors for potential application as cancer therapy. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A single change in protein can trigger serious genetic disorders like Tyrosinemia type III and Hawkinsinuria. This study aims to identify the functional missense SNPs of the HPPD gene by using multiple computational tools. All deleterious missense SNPs retrieved from Ensembl and OMIM database were evaluated through six different software. Ultimately, out of 148 missense SNPs, only 27 were confirmed as diseasecausing SNPs by developing a consensus approach. These damaging SNPs were further examined to evaluate their impact on protein stability and  including their evolutionary conservation. Native and mutated proteins structures were also designed and superimposed by I-TASSER and PyMol respectively. This work results in narrowing down missense SNPs which are still not confirmed experimentally and demands the confirmation by GWAS data. Thus, these missense SNPs could directly or indirectly destabilize the amino acid interactions causing functional deviations of protein.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purine biosynthetic pathway was recently identified as an important source of metabolic intermediates for these processes. However, very little was known about the regulatory mechanisms of purine metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored the role of dual-specificity  (Y) phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (Dyrk3) in HCC metabolism. Dyrk3 was significantly down-regulated in HCC compared with normal controls. Its introduction in HCC cells markedly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft tumor models. Mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites suggests that the effect of Dyrk3 on HCC occurred at least partially through down-regulating purine metabolism, as evidenced by the fact that inhibiting purine synthesis reverted the HCC progression mediated by the loss of Dyrk3. We further provide evidence that this action of Dyrk3 knockdown requires nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3), which has been shown to be a coactivator of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) to target purine pathway genes for transcriptional activation. Mechanistically, Dyrk3 directly phosphorylated NCOA3 at Ser-1330, disrupting its binding to ATF4 and thereby causing the inhibition of ATF4 transcriptional activity. However, the phosphorylation-resistant NCOA3-S1330A mutant has the opposite effect. Interestingly, the promoter activity of Dyrk3 was negatively regulated by ATF4, indicating a double-negative feedback loop. Importantly, levels of Dyrk3 and phospho-NCOA3-S1330 inversely correlate with the expression of ATF4 in human HCC specimens. Conclusion: Our findings not only illustrate a function of Dyrk3 in reprograming HCC metabolism by negatively regulating NCOA3/ATF4 transcription factor complex but also identify NCOA3 as a phosphorylation substrate of Dyrk3, suggesting the Dyrk3/NCOA3/ATF4 axis as a potential candidate for HCC therapy.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921660>Synthesis of (E)-Ethyl-4-(2-(furan-2-ylmethylene)hydrazinyl)benzoate, crystal structure, and studies of its interactions with human serum albumin by spectroscopic fluorescence and molecular docking methods.</a></h1><p>A novel hydrazone, (E)-Ethyl-4-(2-(furan-2-ylmethylene)hydrazinyl)benzoate (EFHB), has been synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, NMR and Mass spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction; compound crystallized as translucent light yellow thin plates. EFHB was studied for their binding to human serum albumin (HSA) using the fluorescence quench titration method. Molecular docking was also performed to get a more detailed insight into their interaction with HSA at the binding site. Addition of this hydrazone to HSA produced significant fluorescence quenching and splitting of emission spectra of HSA through static quenching mechanism with binding constants of about 10 M at 292.15, 298.15, 304.15 and 310.15 K. According to the synchronous fluorescence, tryptophan and  residues of the protein are most perturbed by the binding process. Thermodynamic parameters ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS were got and the main sort of acting force between EFHB and HSA was studied. Results of molecular docking have shown that EFHB binds to subdomain IIA of HSA mainly by hydrophobic interaction,  binding are in good agreement with those obtained by fluorescence study (ΔG = -7.32 ± 0.09 kcal mol and ΔG = -6.76 ± 0.03 kcal mol).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A simple permutation of the amino acids creates a broad palette of proteins and these have been successfully engineered into useful biofunctional agents. For example, the intrinsic ultraviolet fluorescence of phenylalanine and tryptophan has been engineered to emit in the visible spectrum, which has broad applications for imaging/sensing probes, photothermal therapy agents, optogenetic switches, etc. Nature produces more colorful coats/furs, feathers/hairs, and eyes through various biochemical modifications of -based pigmentation. However, it is challenging to modulate the fluorescence wavelength from the UV to the visible region through oligopeptides. Herein, we report an innovative approach to obtain cyan fluorescence by using de novo tripeptides containing glycine, , and lysine, which form robust dimer structures under moderate oxidizing conditions. Through an in vitro mutation approach, we deduce that both the amino acids and their sequence play significant roles in modulating the fluorescence.

The effect of dietary lipid-induced AproA-IV on BAT thermogenesis and  expenditure remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that ApoA-IV knockout (ApoA-IV-KO) mice exhibited decreased BAT thermogenesis to affect  homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, BAT thermogenesis in wildtype (WT) and ApoA-IV-KO mice fed either a standard low-fat chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated. When fed a chow diet,  expenditure and food intake were comparable between WT and ApoA-IV-KO mice. After 1 week of HFD consumption, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable  intake but produced lower  expenditure relative to their WT controls in the dark phase. After an acute feeding of dietary lipids or 1-week HFD feeding, ApoA-IV-KO mice produced lower levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and exhibited reduced expression of thermogenic genes in the BAT compared with WT controls. In response to cold exposure, however, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable  expenditure and BAT temperature relative to WT mice.

Bacterial topoisomerase I is an ATP-independent type 1A topoisomerase that uses the inherent torsional strain within hyper-negatively supercoiled DNA as an  source for its critical function of DNA relaxation. Interest in the enzyme has gained momentum as it has proven to be essential in various bacterial organisms. In order to aid in further biochemical characterization, the apo 65-kDa amino-terminal fragment of DNA topoisomerase I from the gram-positive model organism Streptococcus mutans was crystalized and a three-dimensional structure was determined to 2.06 Å resolution via x-ray crystallography. The overall structure illustrates the four classic major domains that create the traditional topoisomerase I "lock" formation comprised of a sizable toroidal aperture atop what is considered to be a highly dynamic body. A catalytic  residue resides at the interface between two domains and is known to form a 5' phosphotyrosine DNA-enzyme intermediate during transient single-stranded cleavage required for enzymatic relaxation of hyper negative DNA supercoils. Surrounding the catalytic  residue is the remainder of the highly conserved active site. Within 5 Å from the catalytic center, only one dissimilar residue is observed between topoisomerase I from S. mutans and the gram-negative model organism E. coli. Immediately adjacent to the conserved active site, however, S. mutans topoisomerase I displays a somewhat unique nine residue loop extension not present in any bacterial topoisomerase I structures previously determined other than that of an extremophile.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abnormal  substrate metabolism may contribute to aggravation of malnutrition. Late evening snack (LESs) supplementation has been recommended as an intervention to reduce starvation time and improve nutritional status. Published studies have analyzed the effect of LESs on the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)/ ratio (BTR) and oxidation rate of fat and carbohydrate in patients with liver cirrhosis.  We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase for relevant research from January 2000 to October 2018. The primary outcome for this analysis was changes in BTR and fat and carbohydrate oxidation in patients with liver cirrhosis.  A total of 9 articles, containing 211 patients, were included in this analysis. The results supported that supplementation with BCAA-enriched LESs improved BTR, and long-term supplementation with BCAAs (>1 month) may be more beneficial than short-term supplementation (<1 month) in patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, supplementation with BCAAs may increase the oxidation rate of carbohydrates and decrease the oxidation rate of fat. Furthermore, compared with liquid-enriched LESs, BCAA was a better choice for increasing the oxidation of carbohydrates and decreasing the rate of fat oxidation.  BCAA-enriched LES supplementation is an appropriate nutritional intervention to improve abnormal  substrate metabolism, which may improve malnutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis. Further research is needed on the long-term benefit and improved survival in patients with liver cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851218>Automated FRET quantification shows distinct subcellular ERK activation kinetics in response to graded EGFR signaling in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>Threshold responses to an activity gradient allow a single signaling pathway to yield multiple outcomes. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is one such signal, which couples receptor  kinase signaling with multiple cellular responses in various developmental processes. Recent advances in the development of fluorescent biosensors for live imaging have enabled the signaling activities accompanying embryonic development to be monitored in real time. Here, we used an automated computational program to quantify the signals of a fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) reporter for activated ERK, and we used this system to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of ERK during neuroectoderm patterning in Drosophila embryos. We found that the cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK activity gradients show distinct kinetics in response to epidermal growth factor receptor activation. The ERK activation patterns implied that the cytoplasmic ERK activity is modulated into a threshold response in the nucleus.© 2019 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079216>Novel stable analogues of the neurotensin C-terminal hexapeptide containing unnatural amino acids.</a></h1><p>Neurotensin (NT) (pGlu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu) exerts a dual function as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central nervous system and as a hormone/cellular mediator in periphery. This dual function of NT establishes a connection between brain and peripheral tissues that renders this peptide a central player in  homeostasis. Many biological actions of NT are mediated through its interaction with three types of NT receptors (NTS receptors). Despite its role in  homeostasis, NT has a short half-life that hampers further determination of the biological actions of this peptide and its receptors in brain and periphery. The short half-life of NT is due to the proteolytic degradation of its C-terminal side by several endopeptidases. Therefore, it is important to synthesize NT analogues with resistant bonds against metabolic deactivation. Based on these findings, we herein report the synthesis of ten linear, two cyclic and two dimeric analogues of NT with modifications in its structure that improve their metabolic stability, while retaining the ability to bind to NTS receptors. Modifications at position 11 (introduction of D- (OEthyl) [D-Tyr(Et)] or D-1-naphtylalanine [D-1-Nal] were combined with introduction of a L-Lysine or a D-Arginine at positions 8 or 9, and 1-[2-(aminophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (AOPC) at positions 7 or 8, resulting in compounds NT4-NT21. AOPC is an unnatural amino acid with promise in applications as a building block for the synthesis of peptidomimetic compounds. To biologically evaluate these analogues, we determined their plasma stability and their binding affinities to type 1 NT receptor (NTS1), endogenously expressed in HT-29 cells, Among the fourteen NT analogues, compounds, NT5, NT6, and NT8, which have D-Tyr(Et) at position 11, bound to NTS1 in a dose-response manner and with relatively high affinity but still lower than that of the natural peptide. Despite their lower binding affinities compared to NT, the NT5, NT6, and NT8 exhibited a remarkably higher stability, as a result of their chemistry, which provides protection from enzymatic activity. These results will set the basis for the rational design of novel NT molecules with improved pharmacological properties and enhanced enzymatic stability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31318686>Cysteine, glutathione and a new genetic code: biochemical adaptations of the primordial cells that spread into open water and survived biospheric oxygenation.</a></h1><p>Life most likely developed under hyperthermic and anaerobic conditions in close vicinity to a stable geochemical source of . Epitomizing this conception, the first cells may have arisen in submarine hydrothermal vents in the middle of a gradient established by the hot and alkaline hydrothermal fluid and the cooler and more acidic water of the ocean. To enable their escape from this -providing gradient layer, the early cells must have overcome a whole series of obstacles. Beyond the loss of their  source, the early cells had to adapt to a loss of external iron-sulfur catalysis as well as to a formidable temperature drop. The developed solutions to these two problems seem to have followed the principle of maximum parsimony: Cysteine was introduced into the genetic code to anchor iron-sulfur clusters, and fatty acid unsaturation was installed to maintain lipid bilayer viscosity. Unfortunately, both solutions turned out to be detrimental when the biosphere became more oxidizing after the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. To render cysteine thiol groups and fatty acid unsaturation compatible with life under oxygen, numerous counter-adaptations were required including the advent of glutathione and the addition of the four latest amino acids (methionine, , tryptophan, selenocysteine) to the genetic code. In view of the continued diversification of derived antioxidant mechanisms, it appears that modern life still struggles with the initially developed strategies to escape from its hydrothermal birthplace. Only archaea may have found a more durable solution by entirely exchanging their lipid bilayer components and rigorously restricting cysteine usage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972371>Peroxynitrite-Mediated Dimerization of 3-Nitrotyrosine: Unique Chemistry along the Spectrum of Peroxynitrite-Mediated Nitration of .</a></h1><p>Peroxynitrite (ONOO, PN) has long been considered a potent nitrating agent implicated in numerous inflammation-mediated diseases. The current work highlights an unexplored oxidation chemistry initiated under conditions of sustained PN exposure. Impetus for this investigation developed from mass spectral results that suggested dimerization of a model peptide with a single  residue that was first nitrated following extended exposure to PN generated . In attempts to substantiate this dimerization event and divulge the possible mode of linkage between the  derivatives of the peptide monomers, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) was exposed to sustained fluxes of PN in a two-component PN-generating platform developed in this laboratory. Such exposure afforded products with tandem mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy profiles indicative of C-O coupling between 3-NT moieties. Synthesis and comparative analysis of the C-C coupled 3-NT isomer corroborated these findings. Most notably, the mass spectral data of the C-C coupled 3-NT dimer displayed a 226.80  peak following exposure to high collision , corresponding to symmetric cleavage of the parent dimer peak ( = 453) along with a fragmentation product at  = 180.04 (-NO species). This fragmentation profile was distinct from the C-O coupled 3-NT dimer that exhibited a predominant 209.14  peak with a small secondary 226.15  peak indicative of asymmetric cleavage of the parent dimer.

However, the intermediate metabolites involved in this change remain largely unknown.We conducted targeted metabolomics profiling to identify moieties associated with adult obesity.In this case-control study of Iranian adults, 200 obese patients were compared with 100 controls based on 104 metabolites profiled by a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis comprised acylcarnitines, diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCaa), acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCae), sphingomyelins (SM), lyso-phospholipids (LPC) and amino acids. We performed multivariable linear regression to identify metabolites associated with obesity, adjusting for age, sex, total  intake, total physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.A pattern of 19 metabolites was significantly associated with obesity. Branched chain amino acids, alanine, glutamic acid, proline,  LPCa C16:1, PCaa C32:1, PCaa C32:2 and PCaa C38:3 were positively, while serine, asparagine, LPCa C18:1, LPCa C18:2, LPCe C18:0, PCae C34:3, PCae C38:4 and PCae C40:6 were negatively associated with obesity (all p < 0.00048).A metabolomic profile containing 9 amino acids and 10 polar lipids may serve as a potential biomarker of adult obesity.

Although the intestinal L-cell hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide - (PYY) have attracted the most attention, direct tests in humans and rodents with pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of either the GLP1-receptor (GLP1R) or the Y2-receptor (Y2R) were unable to confirm their critical roles in the beneficial effects gastric bypass surgery on body weight and glucose homeostasis. However, new awareness of the power of combinatorial therapies in the treatment of metabolic disease would suggest that combined blockade of more than one signaling pathway may be necessary to reverse the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery.The metabolic effects of high-fat diet and the ability of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to lower food intake and body weight, as well as improve glucose handling, was tested in GLP1R and Y2R-double knockout (GLP1RKO/Y2RKO) and C57BL6J wildtype (WT) mice.GLP1RKO/Y2RKO and WT mice responded similarly for up to 20 weeks on high-fat diet and 16 weeks after RYGB. There were no significant differences in loss of body and liver weight, fat mass, reduced food intake, relative increase in  expenditure, improved fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, and insulin tolerance between WT and GLP1RKO/Y2RKO mice after RYGB.Combined loss of GLP1R and Y2R-signaling was not able to negate or attenuate the beneficial effects of RYGB on body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice, suggesting that a larger number of signaling pathways is involved or that the critical pathway has not yet been identified.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We attempted to develop high-performance CPP immunoassays using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies prepared via cytokine-assisted immunization.  We used fetal liver  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), CC subtype chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to assist traditional subcutaneous immunization of preparing high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, and further to develop high-performance immunoassay methods for CPP.  This novel immune strategy significantly enhanced immune response against CPP. Six anti-CPP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity were successfully screened and selected for application in a fully automated magnetic chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). This robust and rapid assay can efficiently detect CPP in the range of 1.2-1250 pmol L with a detection limit of 6.25 pmol L. Significantly, the whole incubation process can be completed in 30 min as compared to about 4.5 hr for the control ELISA kit. Furthermore, this assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity, low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs < 15%). The developed assay was applied in the detection of CPP in 115 random serum samples and results showed a high correlation with data obtained using a commercially available ELISA kit (correlation coefficient, 0.9737).  Our assay could be applied in the point-of-care testing of CPP in the serum samples, and also the method developed in this study could be adopted to explore the detection and diagnosis of other biomarkers for various diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319312>Metabolomics and phenotype assessment reveal cellular toxicity of triclosan in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>Triclosan (TCS) is an antibiotic that is added to household and personal care products. Recently, it has become more popular, turning into one of the major contaminants of the environment. This raises a dawning awareness regarding health and environmental issues. In this study, the toxicity of TCS to Caenorhabditis elegans was evaluated using a metabolomics approach. Additionally, the lifespan, locomotion, and reproduction of C. elegans were monitored for a better interpretation of toxic effects. In C. elegans exposed to TCS at the concentration of 1 mg/L, the average lifespan decreased in approximately 3 days. Reproduction and locomotion were also decreased with TCS exposure. The number of progenies, head thrashes, and body bends decreased to 45.15 ± 11.63, 39.60 ± 5.90, and 9.20 ± 1.56 with the exposure to TCS, respectively. Oxidative stress was induced by TCS exposure, which was confirmed by using DAF-16:GFP strain and HDCF-DA-based ROS assay. Metabolomics analysis revealed that carbohydrates and amino acids related to  production were considerably affected by TCS exposure. Additionally, levels of , serine, and polyamines, responsible for neurotransmitter and stress response, were significantly altered. Collectively, our findings suggest that TCS induces toxic effects by various mechanisms and exerts a strong influence in various phenotypes of the tested model.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of , plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose metabolism plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and  was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to fat metabolism, transamination,  metabolism, and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that helps plants survive drought by mediating guard cell closure. Since the identification of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, the mechanism underlying ABA signaling has been intensely investigated. However, dynamic and energetic aspects of ABA-mediated activation of receptors and their downregulation by post-translational modifications remain elusive. Using molecular simulations, we establish complete ABA recognition pathways by two subtype receptors (PYL5 and PYL10) and a modified PYL5 receptor through  nitration. Energetic landscapes reveal that ABA binding is necessary but insufficient for full receptor activation, and ABA must surmount a large  barrier to bind the receptors. The major barrier appears to be associated with substantial dewetting of both ABA and receptor during ABA binding. Finally, our results suggest that  nitration of ABA receptors alters the binding pocket, thereby preventing ABA perception and receptor activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the absorption of light  by the human scalp and skull may limit the utility of transcranial PBM in clinical contexts. We have previously shown that targeting light at peripheral tissues (i.e. "remote PBM") also provides protection of the brain in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, suggesting remote PBM might be a viable alternative strategy for overcoming penetration issues associated with transcranial PBM. This present study aimed to determine an effective pre-conditioning regimen of remote PBM for inducing neuroprotection and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which remote PBM enhances the resilience of brain tissue. Balb/c mice were irradiated with 670-nm light (4 J/cm per day) targeting dorsum and hindlimbs for 2, 5 or 10 days, followed by injection of the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP (50 mg/kg) over two consecutive days. Despite no direct irradiation of the head, 10 days of pre-conditioning with remote PBM significantly attenuated MPTP-induced loss of midbrain  hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cells and mitigated the increase in FOS-positive neurons in the caudate-putamen complex. Interrogation of the midbrain transcriptome by RNA microarray and pathway enrichment analysis suggested upregulation of cell signaling and migration (including CXCR4 stem cell and adipocytokine signaling), oxidative stress response pathways and modulation of the blood-brain barrier following remote PBM. These findings establish remote PBM preconditioning as a viable neuroprotective intervention and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

In this study, the introduction of radical-forming aromatic amino acids by chemical modification of the protein surface was performed, and the catalytic implications of these additional surface active-sites on the oxidation of 2,6-dimethylphenol, Mn and Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) were determined. These three different substrates are oxidized in different active-sites of enzyme molecule, of which the high redox RBBR the only one that is transformed by an external radical formed on the protein surface. Both catalytic constants k and K were significantly affected by the chemical modifications. Tryptophan- and -modified VP showed higher catalytic transformation than the unmodified enzyme for RBBR, while the Mn oxidation was significantly reduced by all chemical modifications. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance studies demonstrated the formation of additional protein-based radicals after the chemical modification with radical-forming amino acids. In addition, the catalytic rate of the LRET-mediated transformation showed a good correlation with the ionization  of the additional amino acid on the protein surface.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For environmental and economic reasons, biological synthesis of these plant-derived metabolites has garnered interest. In this study, we exploited HDT1, a BAHD acyltransferase recently isolated from red clover, for the production of clovamide and derivatives in S. cerevisiae and L. lactis. HDT1 catalyses the transfer of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) onto aromatic amino acids. Therefore, by heterologously co-expressing HDT1 with 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), we succeeded in the biological production of clovamide and more than 20 other HAA, including halogenated ones, upon feeding the engineered micro-organisms with various combinations of cinnamates and amino acids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the biological synthesis of HAA and, more generally, on the synthesis of plant-derived antioxidant phenolic compounds in L. lactis. The production of these health beneficial metabolites in Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) micro-organisms such as S. cerevisiae and L. lactis provides new options for their delivery as therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: N-hydroxycinnamoyl-L-amino acids such as clovamide are bioactive plant-derived phenolic compounds with health beneficial effects. Relying on chemical synthesis or direct extraction from plant sources for the supply of these valuable molecules poses challenges to environmental sustainability. As an alternative route, this work demonstrates the potential for biological synthesis of N-hydroxycinnamoyl-L-amino acids using engineered microbial hosts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactococcus lactis. Besides being more eco-friendly, this approach should also provide more structurally diverse compounds and offer new methods for their delivery to the human body.Published 2019.

Here, we used the JM-b/CYT-1 isoform to investigate the roles of serine/threonine phosphorylation in MEK-ERK-dependent feedback inhibition. TPA as an activator of the ERK pathway markedly induced ErbB4 phosphorylation at Thr-674, the conserved common feedback site in the intracellular JM domain, which resulted in the downregulation of  autophosphorylation. We also identified Ser-1026 as an ErbB4-specific ERK target site in the CYT-1 region. Moreover, double mutations (Thr-674/Ser-1026 to Ala) significantly upregulated ErbB4 activation, indicating that Thr-674 and Ser-1026 are cooperatively involved in negative feedback regulation. Given the fact that ErbB4 mutation is one of the most common genetic alterations in melanoma cells, we demonstrated that a typical oncogenic ErbB4 mutant was resistant to the negative feedback regulation to maintain a highly active status of  kinase activity. Together, these findings indicate that feedback mechanisms are key switches determining oncogenic potentials of ErbB receptor kinases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamics of two dominant microbial pools (amino acids; AA and exopolymeric substances; EPS) in soils exposed to drying and C and N amendment to mimic both low and high nutrient soil habitats were examined. It was hypothesized that dynamics of EPS and AA (osmolytes) would be greater when soil drying was preceded by a pulse of bioavailable C and N. Drying reduced AA content, even as overall soil MBC increased (~35%). The increase in absolute amounts and mol% of certain AA (eg: Taurine, glutamine, , phenylalanine) in the driest treatment (-10 MPa) were similar in both soils regardless of amendment suggesting a common mechanism underlying the  intensive acclimation across soils. MBC and EPS, both increased ~1.5X and ~3X due to drying and especially drying associated with amendment. Overall major pools of C and N based microbial metabolites are dynamic to drying (drought), and thus have implications for earth's biogeochemical fluxes of C and N, perhaps costing 4-7% of forest fixed photosynthetic C input during a single drying (drought) period.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655560>Thermopriming reprograms metabolic homeostasis to confer heat tolerance.</a></h1><p>Heat stress threatens agriculture worldwide. Plants acquire heat stress tolerance through priming, which establishes stress memory during mild or severe transient heat stress. Such induced thermotolerance restructures metabolic networks and helps maintain metabolic homeostasis under heat stress. Here, we used an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based platform to explore the composition and dynamics of the metabolome of Arabidopsis thaliana under heat stress and identify metabolites involved in thermopriming. Primed plants performed better than non-primed plants under severe heat stress due to altered  pathways and increased production of branched-chain amino acids, raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), lipolysis products, and tocopherols. These metabolites serve as osmolytes, antioxidants and growth precursors to help plants recover from heat stress, while lipid metabolites help protect membranes against heat stress. The carbohydrate (e.g., sucrose and RFOs) and lipid superpathway metabolites showed the most significant increases. Under heat stress, there appears to be crosstalk between carbohydrate metabolism (i.e., the thermomemory metabolites stachyose, galactinol, and raffinose) and  metabolism towards the production of the thermomemory metabolite salidroside, a phenylethanoid glycoside. Crosstalk occurs between two glycerophospholipid pathways (the biosynthetic pathways of the thermomemory metabolite S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and the terpenoid backbone) and the δ-tocopherol (chloroplast lipid) pathway, which favors the production of glycine betaine and other essential tocopherols, respectively, compounds which are essential for abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Therefore, metabolomic analysis can provide comprehensive insights into the metabolites involved in stress responses, which could facilitate plant breeding to maximize crop yields under adverse conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664965>Novel BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (ACP-196) tightly binds to site I of the human serum albumin as observed by spectroscopic and computational studies.</a></h1><p>Spectrofluorometric, UV-vis spectroscopic and theoretical tools were recruited to comprehend the interaction of acalabrutinib (ACP-196; ACLB) with human serum albumin (HSA). Fluorescence intensity determinations revealed that ACLB statically quenched the HSA-native fluorescence. Analysis of the observed fluorescence data resulting from the ACLB-HSA interaction presented binding constants in the range of 6.65-7.54 × 10 M with the studied temperatures. Those constants showed steady decline with the rising temperatures that further signifies static interaction of the HSA and ACLB. Binding energetics were also interpreted using the fluorescence-recorded results that exhibited a spontaneous exothermic binding reaction with a negative change in Gibbs free  as well as negative enthalpy and positive entropy changes. Those results suggested the involvement of electrostatic forces as discovered by further computational investigation. Those docking results verified that ACLB binds to domain IIA (site I) of the HSA as demonstrated experimentally by site markers displacement binding studies. Circular dichroism studies along with the synchronous and 3D fluorescence observations showed that ACL binding does not alter the HSA conformation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Global Metabolomics Screen Reveals Brown Adipose Tissue Changes in Amino Acids, Catecholamines, and Antioxidants After Short-Term Restriction in C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h1><p>Animals undergoing calorie restriction (CR) often lower their body temperature to conserve . Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is stimulated through norepinephrine when rapid heat production is needed, as it is highly metabolically active due to the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from ATP synthesis. To better understand how BAT metabolism changes with CR, we used metabolomics to identify 883 metabolites that were significantly differentially expressed in the BAT of C57BL/6 mice, fed graded CR (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% CR relative to their individual baseline intake), compared with mice fed ad libitum (AL) for 12 hours a day. Pathway analysis revealed that graded CR had an impact on the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation. In addition, an increase in nucleic acids and catecholamine pathways was seen with graded CR in the BAT metabolome. We saw increases in antioxidants with CR, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. Importantly, the instigator of BAT activation, norepinephrine, was increased with CR, whereas its precursors  and dopamine were decreased, indicating a shift of metabolites through the activation pathway. Several of these key changes were correlated with food anticipatory activity and body temperature, indicating BAT activation may be driven by responses to hunger.© The Author(s) 2019.

Intranasally administered insulin has already shown promise as a memory-enhancing therapy in patients with Alzheimer's and animal models of the disease. Intranasal drug delivery allows for direct targeting of insulin to the brain, bypassing the blood brain barrier and minimizing systemic adverse effects. In this study, we sought to expand upon previous results that show intranasal insulin may also have promise as a Parkinson's therapy. We treated 6-OHDA parkinsonian rats with a low dose (3 IU/day) of insulin and assessed apomorphine induced rotational turns, motor deficits via a horizontal ladder test, and dopaminergic cell survival via stereological counting. We found that insulin therapy substantially reduced motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death induced by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA. These results confirm insulin's efficacy within this model, and do so over a longer period after model induction which more closely resembles Parkinson's disease. This study also employed a lower dose than previous studies and utilizes a delivery device, which could lead to an easier transition into human clinical trials as a therapeutic for Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent reports show that MBD3 recognizes both methylated CG (mCG)- and hydroxymethylated CG (hmCG)-containing DNA, with a preference for hmCG. However, whether the MBD3-MBD indeed has methyl-CG-binding ability is controversial. In this study, we provided the structural basis to support the ability of MBD3-MBD to bind mCG-containing DNA. We found that the MBD3-MBD bound to mCG-containing DNA through two conserved arginine fingers, and preferentially bound to mCG over hmCG, similar to other methyl-CpG-binding MBD proteins. Compared to its closest homolog MBD2, the -to-phenylalanine substitution at Phe34 of MBD3 is responsible for a weaker mCG DNA binding ability. Based on the complex structure of MBD3-MBD with a nonpalindromic AmCGC DNA, we suggest that all the mCG-binding MBD domains can recognize mCG-containing DNA without orientation selectivity, consistent with our observations that the sequences outside the mCG dinucleotide do not affect mCG DNA binding significantly. DNA cytosine methylation is evolutionarily conserved in most metazoans, and most invertebrates have only one MBD gene, MBD2/3. We also looked into the mCG DNA binding ability of some invertebrates MBD2/3 and found that the conserved arginine fingers and a conserved structural fold are required for methylated DNA binding by MBD2/3-MBDs in invertebrates. Hence, our results demonstrate that mCG-binding arginine fingers embedded into a conserved structural fold are essential structural features for MBD2/3s binding to methylated DNA among metazoans.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512989>Small GTPases of the Ras superfamily and glycogen phosphorylase regulation in T cells.</a></h1><p>Small GTPases, together with their regulatory and effector molecules, are key intermediaries in the complex signalling pathways that control almost all cellular processes, working as molecular switches to transduce extracellular cues into cellular responses that drive vital functions, such as intracellular transport, biomolecule synthesis, gene activation and cell survival.

However, improving the selectivity of PTP1B inhibitors over the most closely related T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) remains a major challenge for inhibitor development. Lys120 at the active site and Ser27 at the second pTyr binding site are distinct in PTP1B and TCPTP, which may bring differences in binding affinity. To explore the determinant of selective binding of inhibitor, molecular dynamics simulations with binding free  calculations were performed on K120A and A27S mutated PTP1B, and the internal changes induced by mutations were investigated. Results reveal that the presence of Lys120 induces a conformational change in the WPD-loop and YRD-motif and has a certain effect on the selective binding at the active site. Ser27 weakens the stability of the inhibitor at the second pTyr binding site by altering the orientation of the Arg24 and Arg254 side chains via hydrogen bonds. Further comparison of alanine scanning demonstrates that the reduction in the  contribution of Arg254 caused by A27S mutation leads to a different inhibitory activity. These observations provide novel insights into the selective binding mechanism of PTP1B inhibitors to TCPTP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945368>Free  calculations elucidate substrate binding, gating mechanism, and tolerance-promoting mutations in herbicide target 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.</a></h1><p>4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) catalyzes the second reaction in the  catabolism and is linked to the production of cofactors plastoquinone and tocopherol in plants. This important biological role has put HPPD in the focus of current herbicide design efforts including the development of herbicide-tolerant mutants. However, the molecular mechanisms of substrate binding and herbicide tolerance have yet to be elucidated. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and free  calculations to characterize active site gating by the C-terminal helix H11 in HPPD. We compared gating equilibria in Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Zea mays (Zm) wild-type proteins retrieving the experimentally observed preferred orientations from the simulations. We investigated the influence of substrate and product binding on the open-closed transition and discovered a ligand-mediated conformational switch in H11 that mediates rapid substrate access followed by active site closing and efficient product release through H11 opening. We further studied H11 gating in At mutant HPPD, and found large differences with correlation to experimentally measured herbicide tolerance. The computational findings were then used to design a new At mutant HPPD protein that showed increased tolerance to six commercially available HPPD inhibitors in biochemical in vitro experiments. Our results underline the importance of protein flexibility and conformational transitions in substrate recognition and enzyme inhibition by herbicides.© 2019 The Protein Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759416>Combined microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to characterize a fossilized feather with minimal damage to the specimen.</a></h1><p>The study of fossil feathers has been revitalized in the last few decades and has contributed significantly to paleontological studies of dinosaurs and birds. Specific morphological and physicochemical characteristics of the microscale structures of feathers and the protein keratin are key targets when preserved during the fossilization process. Keratin is a fibrous protein that composes some hard tissues such as hair, nails and feathers. It is part of the so called intermediate filaments inside keratinocyte cells and is rich in sulfur containing amino acid cysteine. To date, different microscopy and analytical methods have been used for the analysis and detailed characterization and classification of feathers. However, in this work we showed that analytical optical and electron microscopies can be quick and precise methods with minimal effects on the sample during analysis. This association of different approaches on the same sample results in correlative data albeit in different length scales. Intracellular bodies called melanosomes originally present in melanocyte cells were identified with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and had well-defined orientation and a mean aspect ratio comparable to melanosomes extant in dark feathers. The detection of sulphur in melanosomes via  Dispersive Spectroscopy both in SEM and TEM shows that, along the fossilization process, sulphur from the degraded keratin matrix could have been trapped inside the melanosomes. Chemical groups that make up keratin and melanin in the fossil sample were detected via FT-IR Spectroscopy and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). The use of combined analytical microscopy techniques can contribute significantly to the study of fossils generating precise results with minimum damage to the original sample.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we describe an in-depth ADP-ribosylome using our Af1521-based proteomics methodology for comprehensive profiling of ADP-ribosylation sites, by systematically assessing complementary proteolytic digestions and precursor fragmentation through application of electron-transfer higher- collisional dissociation (EThcD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), respectively. Although ETD spectra yielded higher identification scores, EThcD generally proved superior to ETD in identification and localization of ADP-ribosylation sites regardless of protease employed. Notwithstanding, the propensities of complementary proteases and fragmentation methods expanded the detectable repertoire of ADP-ribosylation to an unprecedented depth. This system-wide profiling of the ADP-ribosylome in HeLa cells subjected to DNA damage uncovered >11,000 unique ADP-ribosylated peptides mapping to >7,000 ADP-ribosylation sites, in total modifying over one-third of the human nuclear proteome and highlighting the vast scope of this PTM. High-resolution MS/MS spectra enabled identification of dozens of proteins concomitantly modified by ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation, revealing a considerable degree of crosstalk on histones. ADP-ribosylation was confidently localized to various amino acid residue types, including less abundantly modified residues, with hundreds of ADP-ribosylation sites pinpointed on histidine, arginine, and  residues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested modification of these specific residue types is directed in a spatial manner, with  ADP-ribosylation linked to the ribosome, arginine ADP-ribosylation linked to the endoplasmic reticulum, and histidine ADP-ribosylation linked to the mitochondrion.© 2019 Hendriks et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800581>An oncoinformatics study to predict the inhibitory potential of recent FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs against human Polo-like kinase 1 enzyme: a step towards dual-target cancer medication.</a></h1><p>Cancer prevalence has increased at an alarming rate worldwide.

The Δ and   values for BI-2536 and rigosertib interaction with the kinase domain of PLK1 were '- 6.8 kcal/mol and 10.38 µM' and '- 6.6 kcal/mol and 14.51 µM', respectively. Brigatinib, niraparib and ribociclib have been approved by FDA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian/fallopian tube cancer and breast cancer, respectively. PLK1 is regarded as a potential cancer target, and it is specifically over-expressed in different types of cancer cells, including aforementioned cancers. Actually, the target enzymes for anti-cancer action of brigatinib, niraparib and ribociclib are  kinase, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, respectively. However, based on our outcomes, we could safely state that PLK1 might plausibly emerge as an add-on target for each of these three anti-cancer drugs. We strongly believe that this study would assist in the development of better dual-targeting cancer therapeutic agent in the near future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845793>Protein  Phosphatase, Receptor Type B (PTPRB) Inhibits Brown Adipocyte Differentiation through Regulation of VEGFR2 Phosphorylation.</a></h1><p>Brown adipocytes have an important role in the regulation of  balance through uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)-mediated nonshivering thermogenesis. Although brown adipocytes have been highlighted as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type II diabetes in adult humans, the molecular mechanism underlying brown adipogenesis is not fully understood. We recently found that protein  phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) expression dramatically decreased during brown adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of PTPRB and its regulatory mechanism during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of PTPRB led to a reduced brown adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the  phosphorylation of VEGFR2, whereas a catalytic inactive PTPRB mutant showed no effects on differentiation and phosphorylation. Consistently, the expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as UCP-1, PGC-1α, PRDM16, PPAR-γ, and CIDEA, were significantly inhibited by PTPRB overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that PTPRB functions as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation through its phosphatase activity-dependent mechanism and may be used as a target protein for the regulation of obesity and type II diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30691681>Regulation of cancer stem cell properties by SIX1, a member of the PAX-SIX-EYA-DACH network.</a></h1><p>The PAX-SIX-EYA-DACH network (PSEDN) is a central developmental transcriptional regulatory network from Drosophila to humans. The PSEDN is comprised of four conserved protein families; including paired box (PAX), sine oculis (SIX), eyes absent (EYA), and dachshund (DACH). Aberrant expression of PSEDN members, particularly SIX1, has been observed in multiple human cancers, where SIX1 expression correlates with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In conjunction with its transcriptional activator EYA, the SIX1 transcription factor increases cancer stem cell (CSC) numbers and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). SIX1 promotes multiple hallmarks and enabling characteristics of cancer via regulation of cell proliferation, senescence, apoptosis, genome stability, and  metabolism. SIX1 also influences the tumor microenvironment, enhancing recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and stimulating angiogenesis, to promote tumor development and progression. EYA proteins are multifunctional, possessing a transcriptional activation domain and  phosphatase activity, that each contributes to cancer stem cell properties. DACH proteins function as tumor suppressors in solid cancers, opposing the actions of SIX-EYA and reducing CSC prevalence. Multiple mechanisms can lead to increased SIX1 expression, including loss of SIX1-targeting tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRs), whose expression correlates inversely with SIX1 expression in cancer patient samples. In this review, we discuss the major mechanisms by which SIX1 confers CSC and EMT features and other important cancer cell characteristics. The roles of EYA and DACH in CSCs and cancer progression are briefly highlighted. Finally, we summarize the clinical significance of SIX1 in cancer to emphasize the potential therapeutic benefits of effective strategies to disrupt PSEDN protein interactions and functions.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The accurate measurement of the concentration of AMH is relevant for the success of assisted reproductive therapies and diagnosis of clinical cases. In this study, we show that cytokines such as fetal liver  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), CC subtype chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and β-microglobulin (βM) significantly enhance the immune response against AMH. Two anti-AMH monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity were selected by biolayer interferometry (BLI) technology for application in a fully automated magnetic chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). This robust and rapid assay can efficiently detect AMH in the range of 0.125~20 ng mL with a detection limit of 0.099 ng mL. This immunoassay showed high specificity with no cross-reaction with structurally related proteins and some of the other members of the TGF-β super family, such as inhibin A, activin A, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. The average recovery rates of three different batches were 100.19%, 102.72%, and 103.59%, respectively, with coefficients of variation of less than 12%. The developed assay was applied in the detection of AMH in 69 serum samples from randomly selected patients. Our data showed a high correlation with those obtained using commercially available ELISA kits (correlation coefficient, 0.9831). Hence, we suggest that this immunoassay could find application in the development of POCT for the diagnosis of AMH in clinical samples.

The theoretical model used was a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) in order to describe the coherent transport in molecular devices. First, we studied the physisorption of each amino acid on a graphene sheet and we reported the adsorption , the adsorption distances, the equilibrium configuration and the charge transfer of ten amino acids that can be considered as representative of all of the amino acids: histidine (His), alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp),  (Tyr), arginine (Arg), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro) and lysine (Lys). As a result, significant differences were found in the density of states (DOS) after adsorption and there was a change in the semi-metallic character of the graphene due to the lysine and arginine interactions. Furthermore, we noticed changes in the electrical characteristics of the devices, as the amino acids adsorbed onto the surface of the graphene. The curves of current vs. bias voltage (I-Vb) display a distinct response for each amino acid, i.e. the I-Vb curves produce a characteristic footprint for each amino acid. We identified a possible rectification mechanism related to the voltage profile asymmetry, where the amino acids can control the transport characteristics in the device, i.e. Lys and Phe amino acids physisorbed on graphene act as a molecular diode, where electrons can easily flow in one direction and decrease in the other. This may be promising for the prospect of biosensors: graphene could be used as an amino acid detector.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718305>Substrate-assisted mechanism of catalytic hydrolysis of misaminoacylated tRNA required for protein synthesis fidelity.</a></h1><p>d-aminoacyl-tRNA-deacylase (DTD) prevents the incorporation of d-amino acids into proteins during translation by hydrolyzing the ester bond between mistakenly attached amino acids and tRNAs. Despite extensive study of this proofreading enzyme, the precise catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, a combination of biochemical and computational investigations has enabled the discovery of a new substrate-assisted mechanism of d-Tyr-tRNA hydrolysis by  DTD. Several functional elements of the substrate, misacylated tRNA, participate in the catalysis. During the hydrolytic reaction, the 2'-OH group of the А76 residue of d-Tyr-tRNA forms a hydrogen bond with a carbonyl group of the  residue, stabilizing the transition-state intermediate. Two water molecules participate in this reaction, attacking and assisting ones, resulting in a significant decrease in the activation  of the rate-limiting step. The amino group of the d-Tyr aminoacyl moiety is unprotonated and serves as a general base, abstracting the proton from the assisting water molecule and forming a more nucleophilic ester-attacking species. Quantum chemical methodology was used to investigate the mechanism of hydrolysis. The DFT-calculated deacylation reaction is in full agreement with the experimental data. The Gibbs activation energies for the first and second steps were 10.52 and 1.05 kcal/mol, respectively, highlighting that the first step of the hydrolysis process is the rate-limiting step. Several amino acid residues of the enzyme participate in the coordination of the substrate and water molecules. Thus, the present work provides new insights into the proofreading details of misacylated tRNAs and can be extended to other systems important for translation fidelity.© 2019 The Author(s).

Although wild-type mice rarely emit, those with mutations that influence the tectorial membrane (TM) show an incidence of SOAEs similar to that in humans. In this report, we characterized mice with a missense mutation in  a gene required for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix within the core of the TM. Mice heterozygous for the Y1870C mutation ( ) are prolific emitters, despite a moderate hearing loss. Additionally, Kimura's membrane, into which the OHC stereocilia insert, separates from the main body of the TM, except at apical cochlear locations. Multimodal SOAEs are also observed in  mice where  is present at frequencies that are integer multiples of a lower-frequency SOAE (the primary). Second-harmonic SOAEs, at twice the frequency of a lower-frequency primary, are the most frequently observed. These secondary SOAEs are found in spatial regions where stimulus-evoked OAEs are small or in the noise floor. Introduction of high-level suppressors just above the primary SOAE frequency reduce or eliminate both primary and second-harmonic SOAEs. In contrast, second-harmonic SOAEs are not affected by suppressors, either above or below the second-harmonic SOAE frequency, even when they are much larger in amplitude. Hence, second-harmonic SOAEs do not appear to be spatially separated from their primaries, a finding that has implications for cochlear mechanics and the consequences of changes to TM structure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415771>Urinary metabolic disturbance in the olfactory bulbectomized rats and the modulatory effects of fluoxetine.</a></h1><p>The present study aims to investigate the impacts of olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) on urinary metabolic profile and tryptophan metabolites in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats, and to explore the regulation effects of fluoxetine.OBX model was developed by aspiration of olfactory bulbs. After fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg) for 14 days, urine samples were collected and behavior tests were applied. Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites and neurotransmitters in PFC were determined by prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography-QTRAP-mass spectrometry, and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) were evaluated by western blot. Urinary metabolites were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabonomics strategy.OBX rats showed hyperlocomotion in open field, hyperactivity in open arm and despair status, and fluoxetine reserved these behavioral abnormalities. The levels of TRP, 5-HIAA, 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio and DA increased, while kynurenine and 5-HT decreased in PFC of OBX rats. The activities of TPH2 and IDO1were inhibited after OBX. Twenty-six altered metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers in OBX rats involved in tryptophan metabolism, gut microbiota metabolism,  metabolism, purine metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, and  metabolism. Among them, 15 abnormal metabolites were corrected by fluoxetine to some extent.Our results revealed that urinary metabolic profile changed greatly in OBX rats, and identified biomarkers might be helpful for the diagnosis of agitated depression. The regulation effects of fluoxetine on urinary metabolic profile and tryptophan metabolites in PFC might contribute to its antidepressant action in OBX rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To reduce racial disparities in health, a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty is needed. Metabolomics may further our understanding by characterizing differences in the body during a vigorous versus frail state. We sought to identify metabolites and biological pathways associated with vigor to frailty among 287 black men ages 70-81 from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 350 metabolites were measured in overnight-fasting plasma. The Scale of Aging Vigor in Epidemiology (SAVE) measured vigor to frailty based on weight change, strength, , gait speed, and physical activity. Thirty-seven metabolites correlated with SAVE scores ( < 0.05), while adjusting for age and site. Fourteen metabolites remained significant after multiple comparisons adjustment (false discovery rate < 0.30). Lower values of tryptophan, methionine, , asparagine, C14:0 sphingomyelin, and 1-methylnicotinamide, and higher values of glucoronate, N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine, isocitrate, creatinine, C4-OH carnitine, cystathionine, hydroxyphenylacetate, and putrescine were associated with frailer SAVE scores. Pathway analyses identified nitrogen metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and the citric acid cycle.

The time scale of this process ranges from tens of femtoseconds to a few nanoseconds. Femtosecond transient absorption allows for exploration of such photo-induced carrier dynamics to observe the de-excitation pathways of the biological complex. Here, we report on the ultrafast relaxation of suspensions of Sepia melanin in DMSO at room temperature using a femtosecond broadband pump and probe technique by photoexciting in the UV and probing in the entire visible range. In particular, we focus on the possible role that different heat treatments, performed in the temperature range 30-80 °C  might have on the relaxation of charge carriers photogenerated by UV radiation in such suspensions. Experimental data indicate that in all the investigated suspensions, photoexcited carriers always follow a tri-exponential route to relaxation. Moreover, we find that the relaxation time constants are essentially the same in all cases, within the experimental error. We take this as evidence that all the investigated suspensions essentially exhibit the same relaxation dynamics, regardless of the temperature at which the heat treatment has been performed and of the heat-induced denaturation of the proteinaceous compounds bound to the photoactive pigment. Our experiments represent a significant step towards the understanding of the stability of melanin with respect to temperature changes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884121>Age-associated cholesterol reduction triggers brain insulin resistance by facilitating ligand-independent receptor activation and pathway desensitization.</a></h1><p>In the brain, insulin plays an important role in cognitive processes. During aging, these faculties decline, as does insulin signaling. The mechanism behind this last phenomenon is unclear. In recent studies, we reported that the mild and gradual loss of cholesterol in the synaptic fraction of hippocampal neurons during aging leads to a decrease in synaptic plasticity evoked by glutamate receptor activation and also by receptor  kinase (RTK) signaling. As insulin and insulin growth factor activity are dependent on  kinase receptors, we investigated whether the constitutive loss of brain cholesterol is also involved in the decay of insulin function with age. Using long-term depression (LTD) induced by application of insulin to hippocampal slices as a read-out, we found that the decline in insulin function during aging could be monitored as a progressive impairment of insulin-LTD. The application of a cholesterol inclusion complex, which donates cholesterol to the membrane and increases membrane cholesterol levels, rescued the insulin signaling deficit and insulin-LTD. In contrast, extraction of cholesterol from hippocampal neurons of adult mice produced the opposite effect. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of Cyp46A1, an enzyme involved in brain cholesterol loss with age, improved insulin signaling. Fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) experiments pointed to a change in receptor conformation by reduced membrane cholesterol, favoring ligand-independent autophosphorylation. Together, these results indicate that changes in membrane fluidity of brain cells during aging play a key role in the decay of synaptic plasticity and cognition that occurs at this late stage of life.© 2019 The Authors.

Signal transduction in insect cell is also associated with PTPs and PTKs. The grasshopper (Oedaleus asiaticus) 'Bey-Bienko' were treated with dsRNA of protein  non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) and protein  kinase 5 (PTK5) along with control (water). Applying dsPTK5 treatments in 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus, significant reduction was recorded in body dry mass, growth rate and overall performance except survival rate. Whereas with PTPN4, no such significant impact on all of these growth parameters was recorded. Expression of genes in ILP 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus by the application of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 revealed that PTK, INSR (insulin receptor), IRS (insulin receptor substrate), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), PDK (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B) and FOXO (forkhead transcription factor) significantly expressed with downregulation except PTPN4, which remained non-significant. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of ILP four proteins in O. asiaticus with the treatment of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 significantly affected P-IRS and P-FOXO, while P-INSR and P-AKT remained stable at the probability level of 5%. This indicated that the stress response in the O. asiaticus insulin-like signalling pathway (ILP) reduced. Regarding association of protective enzymatic activities, ROS (relative oxygen species), CAT (catalase) and PO (phenol oxidase) increased significantly with exposure to dsPTK5 as compared to dsPTPN4 and control, while exposure of 5th instar of O. asiaticus to dsPTPN4 treatment slightly raised CAT and PO activities with but significant contribution. No such significant effect on MFO and POD was seen using dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5. This showed that in the ILP of O. asiaticus, PTK5 was detrimental to growth, body mass and overall performance, which ultimately benefited insect detoxification with high- cost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062694>Pulmonary artery denervation using catheter-based ultrasonic .</a></h1><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating disease characterised by pulmonary vascular remodelling and right heart failure. Radio-frequency pulmonary artery denervation (PDN) has improved pulmonary haemodynamics in preclinical and early clinical studies; however, denervation depth is limited. High-frequency non-focused ultrasound can deliver  to the vessel adventitia, sparing the intima and media. We therefore aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound PDN.Histological examination demonstrated that innervation of human pulmonary arteries is predominantly sympathetic (71%), with >40% of nerves at a depth of >4 mm. Finite element analysis of ultrasound  distribution and ex vivo studies demonstrated generation of temperatures >47ºC to a depth of 10 mm. In domestic swine, PDN reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure induced by thromboxane A2 in comparison to sham. No adverse events were observed up to 95 days. Histological examination identified structural and immunohistological changes of nerves in PDN-treated animals, with sparing of the intima and media and reduced  hydroxylase staining 95 days post procedure, indicating persistent alteration of the structure of sympathetic nerves.Ultrasound PDN is safe and effective in the preclinical setting, with  delivery to a depth that would permit targeting sympathetic nerves in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572001>The role of TCPTP on leptin effects on astrocyte morphology.</a></h1><p>Leptin and LPS has been implicated in the development of hypothalamic astrogliosis in rodents. Astrocytes, which are interconnected by gap junction proteins, have emerged as important players in the control of  homeostasis exerted by the hypothalamus. To investigate the hypothesis of action of T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) on the astrocyte morphology, astrocytes from the hypothalamus of one-day-old rats were stimulated with leptin and LPS (used as a positive control). Leptin and LPS induced a marked increase in astrocyte size, an increase in Ptpn2 (TCPTP gene) and gap junction alpha-1 protein, - Gja1 (connexin 43 - CX43 gene) mRNA expression and a decrease in gap junction protein, alpha 6 - Gja6 (CX30 gene) mRNA expression. Remarkably, these effects on astrocytes morphology and connexins were prevented by Ptpn2 siRNA. Astrocytes are known to produce cytokines; here we show that TCPTP acts as an important regulator of the cytokines and it possesses a reciprocal interplay with protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Our findings demonstrate that leptin and LPS alter astrocyte morphology by increasing TCPTP, which in turn modulates connexin 30 (CX30) and connexin 43 (CX43) expression. TCPTP and PTP1B seem to act in the regulation of cytokine production in astrocytes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Pink1 mutations are the second most common cause of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to characteristic motor impairments, PD patients also commonly exhibit cognitive impairments. As the hippocampus plays a prominent role in cognition, we tested if loss of Pink1 in mice influences learning and memory. While wild-type mice were able to perform a contextual discrimination task, age-matched Pink1 knockout (Pink1) mice showed an impaired ability to differentiate between two similar contexts. Similarly, Pink1 mice performed poorly in a delayed alternation task as compared to age-matched controls. Poor performance in these cognitive tasks was not the result of overt hippocampal pathology. However, a significant reduction in hippocampal  hydroxylase (TH) protein levels was detected in the Pink1 mice. This decrease in hippocampal TH levels was also associated with reduced DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine D2 receptor levels, but not post-synaptic dopamine D1 receptor levels. These presynaptic changes appeared to be selective for dopaminergic fibers as hippocampal dopamine beta hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tryptophan hydroxylase levels were unchanged in Pink1 mice. Administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 to Pink1 mice was found to improve performance in the context discrimination task. Taken together, our results show that Pink1 loss may alter dopamine signaling in the hippocampus, which could be a contributing mechanism for the observed learning and memory impairments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Most patients involve mutation in SHP2 encoded by -protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene. Studies have shown that NSML-associated Y279C mutation exhibited the reduced phosphatase activity, leading to loss-of-function (LOF) of SHP2. However, the effect of the Y279C mutation on the SHP2 at the molecular level is unclear. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations of SHP2 wild-type (SHP2) and Y279C mutant (SHP2) were performed to investigate the structural differences in proteins after Y279C mutation and to find out the reason for loss-of-function of SHP2. Through a series of post-dynamic analyses, it was found that the protein occupied a smaller phase space after Y279C mutation, showing reduced flexibility. Specifically, due to the mutation of Y279C, the secondary structures of these two regions (residues Lys70-Ala72 and Gly462-Arg465) were significantly transformed from Turn to α-helix and β-strand. Furthermore, by calculating the residue interaction network, hydrogen bond occupancy and binding free , it was further revealed that the conformational differences between SHP2 and SHP2 systems were mainly caused by the differences in the interaction between Arg465-Phe469, Ile463-Gly467, Cys279-Lys70, Cys459-Ala72, Gly464-Phe71, Phe71-Ile463, Ile463-Ala505 and Arg465-Glu361. Consequently, this finding is expected to provide a new insight into the reason for loss-of-function of SHP2 caused by Y279C mutation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Germline inactivating Gα mutations lead to obesity in humans and mice. Mice with brain-specific Gα deficiency also develop obesity with reduced  expenditure and locomotor activity, and impaired adaptive thermogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.We created mice (DMHGsKO) with Gα deficiency limited to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and examined the effects on  balance and thermogenesis.DMHGsKO mice developed severe, early-onset obesity associated with hyperphagia and reduced  expenditure and locomotor activity, along with impaired brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Studies in mice with loss of MC4R in the DMH suggest that defective DMH MC4R/Gα signaling contributes to abnormal  balance but not to abnormal locomotor activity or cold-induced thermogenesis. Instead, DMHGsKO mice had impaired leptin signaling along with increased expression of the leptin signaling inhibitor protein  phosphatase 1B in the DMH, which likely contributes to the observed hyperphagia and reductions in  expenditure, locomotor activity, and cold-induced thermogenesis.DMH Gα signaling is critical for  balance, thermogenesis, and leptin signaling.

Particularly, drug withdrawal, usually starting within hours of the last dose, is considered as a critical step in the transition to addiction and a treatment clue. The aim of this study was to uncover metabolic effects associated with methamphetamine (MA) short-term abstinence using both non-targeted and targeted metabolomics. Metabolic alterations were investigated in rat plasma collected immediately after 16 days of MA self-administration and after 12 and 24 h of abstinence. Principal component analysis revealed that the highest level of separation occurred between the 24 h and saline (control) groups based on the significantly changed ion features, 257/320/333 and 331/409/388, in the SA/12 h/24 h groups in positive and negative modes of UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS, respectively. Targeted metabolomics revealed dynamic changes in the biosynthesis/metabolism of amino acids, including the phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. Integrating non-targeted and targeted metabolomics data uncovered rapid and distinct changes in the metabolic pathways involved in  metabolism, the nervous system, and membrane lipid metabolism. These findings provide essential knowledge of the dynamic metabolic effects associated with short-term MA abstinence and may help identify early warning signs of MA dependence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596287>Planarity and out-of-plane vibrational modes of tryptophan and  in biomolecular modeling.</a></h1><p>Tryptophan and  are amino acids that play significant roles in the folding processes of proteins at water-membrane interfaces because of their amphipathic heteroaromatic rings. Employing appropriate heteroaromatic molecular structures is essential for obtaining accurate dynamics and predictive capabilities in molecular simulations of these amino acids. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations that applied the most recent version of the CHARMM36 force field were conducted on aqueous solutions of tryptophan and of . Geometric analysis and dynamics quantified how aromatic rings deviated from planar structures and exhibited out-of-plane fluctuations. Radial distribution functions showed possible biological significance because the extent of ring planarity slightly affected local water concentrations near aromatic rings. Instantaneous all-atom normal mode analysis (NMA) and Fourier transformation of time autocorrelation functions of out-of-plane displacements were applied to study out-of-plane vibrations of atoms in these rings. The NMA started with minimum  configurations and then averaged over fluctuations in aqueous solution. The frequencies and frequency patterns that were obtained for tryptophan and  with CHARMM36 differed from literature reports of Raman spectra, infrared spectra, and frequencies calculated using quantum mechanics, with some out-of-plane modes found at higher frequencies. Effects of imposing improper torsion potentials and changing torsion angle force constants were investigated for all atoms in the rings of tryptophan and . Results show that these coarse force field variations only affect planarity and out-of-plane vibrations of atoms within the rings, and not other vibrations. Although increasing improper torsion force constants reduced deviations from aromatic ring planarity significantly, it increased out-of-plane mode frequencies. Reducing torsion angle force constants (with and without improper torsions) shifted modes to lower frequencies. A combination of decreasing most torsion angle force constants for ring atoms in both amino acids and including improper torsion forces attained frequencies and frequency patterns for out-of-plane normal modes that were more similar to the literature spectra. These force field variations decreased the extents of out-of-plane vibrations within the heteroaromatic rings of tryptophan, especially around the nitrogen atom in the ring, but not within the heteroaromatic ring of . Conclusions were unaffected by the peptide endgroup, water, or simulation ensemble.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875680>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy improves liver and hypothalamic functions in obese mice.</a></h1><p>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is an effective surgery to treat obesity and diabetes. However, the direct effect of VSG on metabolic functions is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if alterations in hypothalamic neurons were linked with perturbations in liver metabolism after VSG in an  intake-controlled obese mouse model. C57BL/6 and hrNPY-GFP reporter mice received HFD for 12 weeks and were then divided into three groups: Sham (ad lib), sham (pair-fed) with VSG, and VSG. Food intake was measured daily, and blood glucose levels were measured before and after the study.  expenditure and body composition were determined. Serum parameters, liver lipid and glycogen contents were measured, and gene/protein expression were analyzed. Hypothalamic POMC, AgRP/NPY, and  hydroxylase expressing neurons were counted. As results, we found that VSG reduced body weight gain and adiposity induced by HFD, increased  expenditure independent of  intake. Fed and fasted blood glucose levels were reduced in the VSG group. While serum active GLP-1 level was increased, the active ghrelin and triglycerides levels were decreased along with improved insulin resistance in VSG group. Liver lipid accumulation, glycogen content, and gluconeogenic gene expression were reduced in the VSG group. In the hypothalamus, TH expressing neuron population was decreased, and the POMC-expressing neuron population was increased in the VSG group. Our data suggests that VSG improves metabolic symptoms by increasing  expenditure and lowering lipid and glycogen contents in the liver. These physiological alterations are possibly related to changes in hypothalamic neuron populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31085346>Silencing AXL by covalent siRNA-gelatin-antibody nanoconjugate inactivates mTOR/EMT pathway and stimulates p53 for TKI sensitization in NSCLC.</a></h1><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality with the 5-year survival rate at a dismal 16% for the past 40 years. Drug resistance is a major obstacle to achieving long-term patient survival. Identifying and validating molecular biomarkers responsible for resistance and thereby adopting multi-directional therapy is necessary to improve the survival rate. Previous studies indicated ~20% of  kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistant NSCLC patients overexpress AXL with increase in EMT and decrease in p53 expression. To overcome the resistance, we designed gelatin nanoparticles covalently conjugated with EGFR targeting antibody and siRNA (GAbsiAXL). GAbsiAXL efficiently silences AXL, decreases mTOR and EMT signaling with concomitant increase in p53 expression. Because of the molecular changes, the AXL silencing sensitizes the cells to TKI. Our results show AXL overexpression has an important role in driving TKI resistance through close association with -dependent mitochondrial pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate bioengineered OMVs for contrast enhancement in optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging. We produce OMVs encapsulating biopolymer-melanin (OMV) using a bacterial strain expressing a tyrosinase transgene. Our results show that upon near-infrared light irradiation, OMV generates strong optoacoustic signals appropriate for imaging applications. In addition, we show that OMV builds up intense heat from the absorbed laser  and mediates photothermal effects both in vitro and in vivo. Using multispectral optoacoustic tomography, we noninvasively monitor the spatio-temporal, tumour-associated OMV distribution in vivo. This work points to the use of bioengineered vesicles as potent alternatives to synthetic particles more commonly employed for optoacoustic imaging, with the potential to enable both image enhancement and photothermal applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374893>Milk and Dairy Products and Their Nutritional Contribution to the Average Polish Diet.</a></h1><p>The main aim of this study was to identify the dairy sources of  and 44 nutrients in the average Polish diet. Our research included: carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), cholesterol, 18 amino acids, 9 minerals, and 10 vitamins. The analysis was conducted based on the data from the 2016 Household Budget Survey, a representative sample of the Polish population (i.e., 36,886 households). The category of milk and dairy products was divided into three main groups (i.e., milk, cheeses, and yoghurts, milk drinks and other dairy products) and seven sub-groups (i.e., whole milk, reduced fat milk, condensed and powdered milk, ripened and melted cheese, cottage cheese, yoghurts, milk drinks and other dairy products). Milk and dairy products provided 9.1% of the total  supply. A high share (above 20%) in the supply of nutrients was noted in the case of calcium (54.7%), riboflavin (28.1%), vitamin B12 (26.1%), and phosphorus (24.6%). Supply at the level of 10-20% was observed for protein, SFA, zinc, total fat, cholesterol, potassium, magnesium, and vitamin A. Of the amino acids, the share above 20% from dairy category was recorded in the case of 6 amino acids (proline, , serine, lysine, valine, and leucine) and at the level of 10-20% for 10 amino acids (isoleucine, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and arginine).</p></html>
