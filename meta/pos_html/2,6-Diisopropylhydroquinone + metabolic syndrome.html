Even though over the past few decades the global scientific community has made tremendous efforts to understand this entity, many questions remain to be raised on this issue and even more to be answered. Epidemiological findings have unveiled numerous environmental and genetic risk factors, each one contributing to a certain degree to the final account of new CRC cases. Moreover, different trends have been revealed regarding the age of onset of CRC between the two sexes. That, in addition to newly introduced therapeutic approaches for various diseases based on androgens, anti‑androgens and anabolic hormones has raised some concerns regarding their possible carcinogenic effects or their synergistic potential with other substances/risk factors, predisposing the individual to CRC. Notably, despite the intense research on experimental settings and population studies, the conclusions regarding the majority of anabolic substances are ambiguous. Some of these indicate the carcinogenic properties of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), growth hormone and insulin‑like growth factor (IGF) and others, demonstrating their neutral nature or even their protective one, as in the case of vitamin D. Thus, the synergistic nature of anabolic substances with other CRC risk factors (such as type  diabetes mellitus,  and smoking) has emerged, suggesting a more holistic approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641634>Prevalence of Diagnostic Methods and Treatment Modalities in Vipoma Patients: A Rare Cause of Hormone-Mediated Diarrhea.</a></h2><p>VIPoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that secrets vasoactive intestinal peptide and produces a well-defined clinical  characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypochlorhydria and  acidosis. The aim of this study to investigate clinical studies about diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of vipoma patients. In this retrospective study, all patients of vipoma were investigated. Clinical features, laboratory data at initial presentation, management and outcomes were collected.The paper has written based on searching PubMed and Google Scholar to identify potentially relevant articles or abstracts. Categorical variables as percentage and continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).All the patients presented with watery diarrhea (30/30, 100%) and dehydration was reported in 33.3% of them. Prevalence of laboratory findings in these patients were assessed for hypokalaemia (25/30, 83.3%),  acidosis (9/30, 33.6%), hypochloremia and achlorhydria (/30, 6.6%). Elevated VIP levels have been seen in 73.3% patients with mean values of 882.85 ± 1134.87 pg/ml. Prevalence of diagnostic methods included CT scan in 19 patients (19/30, 63.3%), ultrasonography (15/50, 50%), and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (8/30, 26.6%). Medical treatments included somatostatin and analogues in 18 patients (18/30, 60%). Surgery included less percentage of treatment in these patients.CT scan can be used as a reliable modality for diagnosis of vipoma and somatostatin analogues can be used as the most effective treatment in vipoma patients. Surveillance of these patients needs to close monitoring of patients via history, physical examination, laboratory and imaging.Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662402>Metabolically healthy obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.</a></h2><p>Metabolically healthy obese phenotype (MHO) refers to obese individuals with an adequate  profile and absence of . Many prospective studies have reported the benign condition relating the MHO phenotype and its potential role in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, inconsistent results were found and the question remains controversial. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations these associations from relevant prospective studies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 statement was used to prepare this protocol. MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE and Cochrane Database will be used for literature search from their inception up to December 2019 with restriction of published studies in English. Published prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between MHO phenotype and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause or cause-specific mortality will be included. The process of study screening, selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, and the risk of bias for the studies included will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs or RRs for disease events and mortality with 95% CIs will be considered as primary outcomes, and summary HRs/RRs will be pooled using random-effects models. The Cochrane's Q and the I statistics will be used to assess and quantify heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out according to study characteristics to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.As this meta-analysis is performed based on the published studies, no ethical approval and patient safety considerations are required. The findings of the study will be reported and submitted to a peer-reviewed journals for publication.CRD42019121766.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

To date, the clinical impact of elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels in MetS is still under discussion. The aim of this cross sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and the potential role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications of MetS.We recruited 300 outpatients with MetS. All patients underwent a medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling and carotid ultrasound echo-color Doppler. According to Hcy levels, MetS patients were divided into two groups: "normal" (< 10.7 μmol/l; n = 140, group 1) and "high" Hcy (≥ 10.7 μmol/l; n = 160, group ). Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t-test or Chi-square test. The effects of potential covariates on group differences were evaluated by general linear models. The relationships between continuous variables were assessed by simple or multiple correlation and by linear regression. Multiple regression models were built to evaluate the effects of Hcy, together with other potential risk factors, on carotid atherosclerosis.Patients with high Hcy were predominantly male and slightly older than group 1 patients. Smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar Hcy levels, nor was a statistical relationship between pack-years and Hcy observed. Group  showed lower levels of folic acid, vitamin D, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) than group 1, but higher levels of C-peptide, uric acid and triglycerides. In all patients, Hcy was positively correlated with C-peptide and uric acid and negatively with folic acid and e-GFR. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid stenosis degree were significantly higher in patients with high Hcy and a positive relationship between Hcy and both IMT and carotid stenosis was detected in all patients. Finally, Hcy atherogenic effects were independent of other well-known atherosclerosis risk factors.Our results highlight a link between MetS and hyperhomocysteinemia and a direct effect of Hcy on atherogenic process during MetS. Early correction of folic acid levels may contribute to prevent cardiovascular complications in MetS patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641635>Comparison of the Different PCOS Phenotypes Based on Clinical , and Hormonal Profile, and their Response to Clomiphene.</a></h2><p>To compare the different polycystic ovarian  (PCOS) phenotypes based on their clinical, , hormonal profile, and their differential response to clomiphene.Prospective observational study.Infertility clinic, a government hospital.164 women with PCOS-related infertility.Sample population was divided into four phenotypes based on the NIH (National Institute of Health) consensus panel criteria. The incremental dose of clomiphene from 50 to 150 mg/day over three cycles was given.Clinical history, , hormonal profile, and ultrasound features of each phenotype. Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, B, C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene resistance was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, -hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse  and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype. Thus, the phenotypic division of patients with PCOS-related infertility can help in prognosticating the patients about the severity of the disease and the fertility outcome.Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580748>Sepiolite Clay Attenuates the Development of Hypercholesterolemia and Obesity in Mice Fed a High-Fat High-Cholesterol Diet.</a></h2><p>Obesity reduces the quality of life and life expectancy, whereas nonoperative interventions have shown poor results so far. Statins effectively combat hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing  the capacity of sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and () assessing  the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.% cholesterol) supplemented with 5% (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed  that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12.5 weeks resulted in lower total blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Further exploration of the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of sepiolite as a food supplement for combating the  is needed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579662>Clinical spectrum of  infection, from benign to severe malaria: A tertiary care prospective study in adults from Delhi, India.</a></h2><p> infection has been recognized to be a cause of severe malaria in recent time. We report findings from a prospective observational study aimed at analyzing the clinical spectrum, complications, and outcome of patients infected with  malaria.The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Delhi over a period of  years. All adults hospitalized with  malaria, confirmed on peripheral smear and/or rapid diagnostic test, were included in the study. The cases were categorized into uncomplicated and severe malaria groups according to WHO criteria. The clinical and biochemical profile of cases in each group were compared for determining the predictors of severe malaria.One hundred and fifty consecutive cases of  monoinfection were included in the study. All patients had fever, and 63 (42%) developed severe malaria, while 87 (58%) were uncomplicated. Vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, altered consciousness, cough with breathlessness, icterus, and hepatosplenomegaly were more frequent in severe malaria. Severe malaria was associated with severe thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, raised serum bilirubin, elevated serum creatinine, and prolonged prothrombin time. Jaundice (54 patients) was the most common complication, followed by acute respiratory distress , spontaneous bleeding,  acidosis, shock, renal failure, and cerebral malaria. Multiple complications were observed in 17 (26.9%) cases of severe malaria. Overall mortality of 1.33% was recorded. However, case fatality of 40% was observed in cases with evidence of multiorgan dysfunction. malaria has a varying clinical profile, from a relatively benign uncomplicated form to severe, even fatal disease.

We embarked on studies to determine how fructose affects differential  dysfunctions across genetically dissimilar mice, namely, C57BL/6 J (B6), DBA/ J (DBA) and FVB/NJ (FVB), by integrating physiological and gene regulatory mechanisms. We report that fructose has strain-specific effects, involving tissue-specific gene regulatory cascades in hypothalamus, liver, and white adipose tissues. DBA mice showed the largest numbers of genes associated with adiposity, congruent with their highest susceptibility to adiposity gain and glucose intolerance across the three tissues. In contrast, B6 and FVB mainly exhibited cholesterol phenotypes, accompanying the largest number of adipose genes correlating with total cholesterol in B6, and liver genes correlating with LDL in FVB mice. Tissue-specific network modeling predicted strain-and tissue-specific regulators such as Fgf21 (DBA) and Lss (B6), which were subsequently validated in primary hepatocytes. Strain-specific fructose-responsive genes revealed susceptibility for human diseases such that genes in liver and adipose tissue in DBA showed strong enrichment for human type  diabetes and obesity traits. Liver and adipose tissues genes in FVB were mostly related to lipid traits, and liver and adipose genes in B6 showed relevance to most cardiometabolic traits tested. Our results show that fructose induces gene regulatory pathways that are tissue specific and dependent on the genetic make-up, which may underlie interindividual variability in cardiometabolic responses to high fructose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

Targeting modifiable risk factors such as dietary habits is therefore of great importance. Many of today's health challenges with overweight and obesity may have behavioral roots, and traditional methods such as regulations and campaigns are often insufficient to improve dietary choices. Nudging or choice architecture might be a viable tool to influence people's everyday choices and behaviors to better outcomes. This paper reviews the current state of the rapidly expanding number of experimental field studies that investigate the effects/associations of nudging on healthy food choices. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, where 142 citations were identified. Based on selection criteria, six randomized controlled trials and 15 non-randomized controlled trials were ultimately included. The results of this systematic review show that many of the studies included traffic-light labeling, which may be a promising strategy. The reviewed findings, however, also highlight the challenges that confront experimental studies examining the impact of nudging on diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592400>Drug development research for novel adiponectin receptor-targeted antidiabetic drugs contributing to healthy longevity.</a></h2><p>It is well recognized that the decrease of adiponectin associated with high-fat diet and lack of exercise accounts for the onset of insulin resistance, type  diabetes, the , and cardiovascular disease. Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty acid oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high-fat diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647291>Associations between homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and routinely examined parameters in individuals with .</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether routine clinical parameters, including visceral adiposity index (VAI) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), could become widely applicable predictors of insulin resistance (IR), evaluated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta), with regard to presence of  (MS). The study comprised 188 individuals identified to meet the MS criteria during regular health examinations and an equal number of age, sex-matched controls without MS. The strongest correlations were noted between HOMA-IR and waist circumference (WC) in the MS group (r=0.57) as well as between HOMA-IR and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, r=0.57) or aspartate aminotransferase (r=0.56) in the controls, with a statistical significance of p<0.001. In a multivariate linear regression model, the predictors of HOMA-IR were WC (linear coefficient beta=0.1, p<0.001), ALT (beta=.28, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (beta=0.04, p<0.001). HOMA-beta was determined by WC (beta=1.97, p=0.032) and ALT (beta=99.49, p=0.004) and inversely associated with age (beta=-1.31, p=0.004). Neither VAI nor AIP were significant predictors. The presence of MS was significantly associated with both HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta. These results indicate that WC and ALT appear to be reliable predictors of IR.

The study population consisted of all consecutive births delivered at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Hospitalier Sud Reunion's maternity (ap. 4,300 birth per year, only level 3 maternity in the south of Reunion Island, sole allowed to follow and deliver all preeclampsia cases of the area). History of pregnancies, deliveries and neonatal outcomes have been collected in standardized fashion into an epidemiological perinatal data base.Chronic hypertension and, history of preeclampsia in multigravidas, were the strongest risk factors for EOP. Primiparity, age over 35 years and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² were rather associated with LOP. In a multivariate analysis with EOP or LOP as outcome variables compared with controls (normotensive), maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI were independent risk factors for both EOP and LOP (p < 0.001). However, analyzing by increment of 5 (years of age, kg/m² for BMI) rising maternal ages and incidence of preeclampsia were strictly parallel for EOP and LOP, while increment of BMI was only associated with LOP. Controlling for maternal ages and booking/pre-pregnancy BMI, diabetes was not an independent risk factor neither for EOP or LOP. factors, other than diabetes, associated with pre-pregnancy maternal corpulence are specifically associated with LOP. This may be a direction for future researches on the maternal preeclamptic .

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41. years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.%-38.1%) to 47.% (95% CI 40.3%-54.%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type  DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI .13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05).

The prevalence of MetS was high (44.9%), and higher among women (46.1%) than men (44.%) (p<0.001). The prevalence increased significantly with increasing age and body mass index (BMI) in both genders (p<0.001). However, metabolically obese but normal weight individuals (MONW) (8.4%) were also identified, with a slight increase among women (9.4%) compared with men (7.5%) (p=0.56). MetS was more likely to be prevalent among participants with increased fasting blood sugar (5.8 times), increased triglyceride (7.4 times), increased blood pressure (4.5 times) and BMI ≥25 (19.9 times) (p<0.001). The prevalence of MetS was higher among rural (50.3%) vs urban (39.3%) residents and refugees (33.8%).With increasing age and obesity, clustering of MetS components increased remarkably in both genders. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for MetS and its risk factors should be developed targeting different ages and genders.© The Author(s) 2019.

The goals of treatment in hypertension are to optimally control high blood pressure and to reduce associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality using the most suitable therapy available. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and chlorthalidone (CTLD) are with proven hypertensive effects. The topic of our meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of HCTZ and CTLD therapy in patient with hypertension. A search of electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, PsyInfo, eLIBRARY.ru was performed. We chose the random-effects method for the analysis and depicted the results as forest plots. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to evaluate the degree of significance of each study. Of the 1289 identified sources, only nine trials directly compared HCTZ and CTLD and were included in the meta-analysis. Changes in SBP lead to WMD (95% CI) equal to -3.26 mmHg showing a slight but statistically significant prevalence of CTLD. Results from analyzed studies referring to DBP lead to WMD (95% CI) equal to -.41 mmHg, which is also statistically significant. During our analysis, we found that there were not enough studies presenting enough data on the effect of CTLD and HCTZ on levels of serum potassium and serum sodium. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated a slight superiority for CTLD regarding blood pressure control. At the same time, the two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637401>Frailty and the  - Results of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II).</a></h2><p>Frailty and the  (MetS) are frequently found in old subjects and have been associated with increased risk of functional decline and dependency. Moreover, central characteristics of the MetS like inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with the frailty . However, the relationship between MetS and frailty has not yet been studied in detail. Aim of the current analysis within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) was to explore associations between MetS and frailty taking important co-variables such as nutrition (total energy intake, dietary vitamin D intake), physical activity and vitamin D-status into account.Complete cross-sectional data of 1,486 old participants (50.% women, 68.7 (65.8-71.3) years) of BASE-II were analyzed. MetS was defined following the joint interim statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity in 2009. Frailty was defined according to the Fried criteria. Limitations in physical performance were assessed via questionnaire, muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and grip strength using a Smedley dynamometer. Adjusted regression models were calculated to assess the association between MetS and Frailty.MetS was prevalent in 37.6% of the study population and 31.9% were frail or prefrail according to the here calculated frailty index. In adjusted models the odds of being frail/prefrail were increased about 50% with presence of the MetS (OR1.5; 95% CI 1.,1.9; p= 0.002). Moreover the odds of being prefrail/frail were significantly increased with low HDL-C (OR: 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-.3); p = 0.037); and elevated waist circumference (OR: 1.65 (95%CI: 1.1-.3); p = 0.008).The current analysis supports an association between MetS and frailty. There are various , immune and endocrine alterations in MetS that also play a role in mechanisms underlying the frailty . To what extent cytokine alterations, inflammatory processes, vitamin D supply and hormonal changes in age and in special  states as MetS influence the development of frailty should be subject of further research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641636>Nonfunctioning and Subclinical Cortisol Secreting Adrenal Incidentalomas and their Association with : A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that nonfunctioning and subclinical cortisol secreting adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are associated with several components of  resulting in increased cardiometabolic risk.

To identify common variants in SNAP25 associated with schizophrenia and evaluate their effects on AIWG and antipsychotic responses in Han Chinese individuals with schizophrenia, we conducted a two-stage case-control study of 3,243 patients and 6,154 healthy controls. 2128 inpatients in the replication stage have received conventional treatment with an antipsychotic monotherapy (Haloperidol, Olanzapine or Risperidone) for 10 weeks at least. Weight change, antipsychotic responses and  indices change were assessed during treatments. Three SNPs were significantly associated with schizophrenia in samples (rs6039769, P = 6.64 × 10; rs3787283, P = 0.004283; rs3746544, P = .51 × 10). Of these, rs6039769 is a novel schizophrenia-associated SNP and is uncorrelated with the other two variants, which have previously been associated with schizophrenia in European-ancestry samples. Rs6039769 was significantly associated with AIWG (P < 0.001), but not with antipsychotic responses or  indices. Another two SNPs were not associated with AIWG or antipsychotic responses or  indices. Overall, there were significant differences in antipsychotic responses and  indices among the three treatment groups. Our findings suggest that SNAP25 gene may contribute to the susceptibility of AIWG and even  disturbances. A prior identification of high-risk of patients with rs6039769 would contribute to a better precision of the pharmacological treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to determine the extent to which self-reported sleep disturbances,  (MetS) factors, cellular inflammation, depressive symptomatology, and diminished physical mobility were associated with cognitive impairment and poorer cognitive performance.This is a cross-sectional study.Participants with elevated, well-controlled blood pressure were recruited from the local community for a Tai Chi and healthy-aging intervention study.One hundred forty-five older adults (72.7 ± 7.9 years old; 66% female), 54 (37%) with evidence of cognitive impairment (CI) based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≤24, underwent medical, psychological, and mood assessments.CI and cognitive domain performance were assessed using the MoCA. Univariate correlations were computed to determine relationships between risk factors and cognitive outcomes. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of CI risk and linear regression to explore cognitive domains affected by risk factors.The CI group were slower on the mobility task, satisfied more MetS criteria, and reported poorer sleep than normocognitive individuals (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleep disturbances, but no other risk factors, predicted increased risk of evidence of CI (OR = .00, 95% CI: 1.26-4.87, 99% CI: 1.08-7.48). Further examination of MoCA cognitive subdomains revealed that sleep disturbances predicted poorer executive function (β = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.06, 99% CI: -0.61 to -0.02), with lesser effects on visuospatial performance (β = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.02, 99% CI: -0.39 to 0.03), and memory (β = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.01, 99% CI: -0.76 to 0.08).Our results indicate that the deleterious impact of self-reported sleep disturbances on cognitive performance was prominent over other risk factors and illustrate the importance of clinician evaluation of sleep in patients with or at risk of diminished cognitive performance. Future, longitudinal studies implementing a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and objective sleep measurement are warranted to further explore these associations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617855>The interplay between muscle mass decline, obesity, and type  diabetes.</a></h2><p>The world's population is progressively becoming older, and age-related conditions are a major public health concern. A worrying phenomenon worldwide is increasing obesity among ageing societies, which is occurring in parallel with a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in older populations. As a result of the combination of these two states, new medical conditions, such as sarcopenic obesity, have recently become a public health concern. Data from the literature indicate a higher risk of , type  diabetes (T2DM), and atherosclerosis among patients with sarcopenic obesity than the risks associated with simple obesity or sarcopenia alone. The mechanisms underlying sarcopenic obesity are multifactorial. There is interplay between low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, a sedentary lifestyle, eating habits, and ageing. The aim of this review is to summarize the available data regarding the definition, epidemiology, and pathways that lead to sarcopenic obesity, as well as treatment strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620021>Multiple Hits in Acute Pancreatitis: Components of  Synergize Each Other's Deteriorating Effects.</a></h2><p>The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the prevalence of  (MetS) are growing worldwide. Several studies have confirmed that obesity (OB), hyperlipidemia (HL), or diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase severity, mortality, and complications in AP. However, there is no comprehensive information on the independent or joint effect of MetS components on the outcome of AP. Our aims were (1) to understand whether the components of MetS have an independent effect on the outcome of AP and () to examine the joint effect of their combinations.From 2012 to 2017, 1435 AP cases from 28 centers were included in the prospective AP Registry. Patient groups were formed retrospectively based on the presence of OB, HL, DM, and hypertension (HT). The primary endpoints were mortality, severity, complications of AP, and length of hospital stay. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.1257 patients (55.7 ± 17.0 years) were included in the analysis. The presence of OB was an independent predictive factor for renal failure [OR: .98 (CI: 1.33-6.66)] and obese patients spent a longer time in hospital compared to non-obese patients (12.1 vs. 10.4 days,  = 0.008). HT increased the risk of severe AP [OR: 3.41 (CI: 1.39-8.37)], renal failure [OR: 7.46 (CI: 1.61-34.49)], and the length of hospitalization (11.8 vs. 10.5 days,  = 0.020). HL increased the risk of local complications [OR: 1.51 (CI: 1.10-.07)], renal failure [OR: 6.4 (CI: 1.93-21.17)], and the incidence of newly diagnosed DM [OR: .55 (CI: 1.26-5.19)]. No relation was found between the presence of DM and the outcome of AP. 906 cases (mean age ± : 56.9 ± 16.7 years) had data on all four components of MetS available. The presence of two, three, or four MetS factors increased the incidence of an unfavorable outcome compared to patients with no MetS factors.OB, HT, and HL are independent risk factors for a number of complications. HT is an independent risk factor for severity as well. Components of MetS strongly synergize each other's detrimental effect. It is important to search for and follow up on the components of MetS in AP.Copyright © 2019 Szentesi, Párniczky, Vincze, Bajor, Gódi, Sarlós, Gede, Izbéki, Halász, Márta, Dobszai, Török, Farkas, Papp, Varga, Hamvas, Novák, Mickevicius, Maldonado, Sallinen, Illés, Kui, Erőss, Czakó, Takács and Hegyi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599742>The Impact of Obesity and Type  Diabetes on Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The growing global epidemic of obesity and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led to the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Changes in lifestyle during and after remission of breast cancer tend to increase abdominal visceral fat, leading to increased risks of  and chronic diseases.This cross-sectional study examined the differences in  risk factors and health-related behaviors between abdominally obese and nonabdominally obese groups of Korean patients with breast cancer.The participants were assigned to nonabdominal obesity (waist circumference < 85 cm, n = 77) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥ 85 cm, n = 59) groups, and a questionnaire was used to assess the prevalence of risk factors of  and health-related behaviors in each. The chi-square test and t test were used to analyze the data.The average age was 54. years in the abdominal obesity group and 51.3 years in the nonabdominal obesity group. The average blood pressure and fasting blood glucose levels were higher in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group (117.3/76.3 vs. 108.9/70.4 mmHg, respectively [p = .001]; 96.9 and 90.1 mg/dl, respectively [p = .007]). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group (55.4 and 62.5 mg/dl, respectively [p = .005]), whereas triglycerides were higher in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group (151.6 and 111.3 mg/dl, respectively [p = .006]). The prevalence of  in the abdominal obesity and nonabdominal obesity groups were 42.4% and 9.1%, respectively (p = .001). Moreover, eating habits differed between the two groups, with the frequency of vegetable consumption lower in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group (p = .040) and the frequencies of salty and sweet food consumption and of overeating higher in the abdominal obesity than the nonabdominal obesity group. The percentage of participants who exercised for 30 minutes three times per week was 52.5% in the abdominal obesity group and 71.4% in the nonabdominal obesity group (p = .024).This observational study found more  risk factors in the abdominal obesity group than the nonabdominal obesity group. Consumption of sweet foods and overeating were higher and the frequencies of vegetable intake and exercise were lower in the abdominal obesity group. These findings suggest that female abdominally obese patients with breast cancer exhibit health-related behaviors that require improvement and better management.

Overall, the systematic reviews were of low quality, while meta-analyses were of moderate- to high-quality. No association of increased egg intake and risks of heart disease or stroke in the general population were found in the meta-analyses. Increased risk of heart failure was noted in two meta-analyses that analysed the same three cohort studies. Five recent meta-analyses reported no increased risk of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the general population, although increased risk in US-based populations only has been reported. Older (<2013) meta-analyses reported increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or heart disease in T2DM populations, and no recent evidence-based reviews were identified. Finally, only one meta-analysis reported intervention studies specifically on eggs and biomarkers (i.e. lipids), and the results contradicted those from observation studies.Recent evidence-based reviews conclude that increased egg consumption is not associated with CVD risk in the general population.

This study assessed whether the prevalence and control of diabetes differed based on the use of removable dental prostheses through an analysis of nationally representative data.Overall, 8,155 individuals (3,525 men and 4,630 women) aged ≥ 50 years were included in this study and were classified into the following 3 groups: group 1, did not use any removable dental prostheses (NF); group , used removable partial dentures (RPD); and group 3, used removable complete dentures on at least 1 jaw (CD). The characterization of diabetic patients and glycemic control were analyzed and compared among groups. To determine the relationship between diabetes and the use of dental prostheses, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed ( < 0.05).The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diabetes in men participants in groups NF, RPD, and CD were 1 (reference), 1.165 (0.878-1.544), and 1.491 (1.034-.151), respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors. Diabetes and glycemic control were significantly associated with the use of removable dental prostheses among men.The use of removable dental prostheses is a potential risk indicator for uncontrolled diabetes in Korean men adults, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach to minimize the complications of diabetes mellitus.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575467>Evaluation of thrombocytopenia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease without cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disorder in western countries. It is often related to , presenting an increased risk of advanced liver disease and cardiovascular-related death. In some etiologies of chronic liver disease, thrombocytopenia has been associated not only with advanced stages of fibrosis but also with autoimmune disease. In NAFLD, however, its prevalence and related factors are still unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of thrombocytopenia in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and to investigate its related risk factors.This was a retrospective study carried out in two tertiary hospitals in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD by liver biopsy were included. Those with other causes of liver disease and/or cirrhosis were excluded. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups, with and without thrombocytopenia. Data was analyzed using a significance level of 5%.441 non-cirrhotic patients with NAFLD (evaluated by liver biopsy) were included in the study. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia was 3.% (14/441 patients). In the comparative analysis between groups, thrombocytopenia was associated with male sex (p=0.007) and level of hemoglobin (p=0.023).Thrombocytopenia is an infrequent event in NAFLD patients without cirrhosis and is related with male sex and higher hemoglobin levels.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

CRP has been found to be elevated in patients with mood disorders (especially unipolar disorders (UD) and in schizophrenia (SZ)) but also to be lowered by antidepressants.The objectives were (i) to determine the prevalence of major depression, antidepressant prescription and remission under antidepressant in a stabilized population of SZ and UD patients consulting in a daily hospital, and (ii) to determine if CRP was a marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in these SZ and UD populations.Abnormal CRP was defined by a CRP blood level ≥ 3 mg/L. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Calgary Depression Rating Scale score. The clinicians were blinded of the CRP status of the patient.411 patients were included (272 SZ and 139 UD). 171 (41.6%) were diagnosed with current major depression (74 (27.%) for SZ and 97 (69.8%) for UD). 86 SZ (31.6%) and 119 UD (85.6%) were treated by antidepressant. Only 28/74 (37.8%) of the SZ subjects with major depression were administered antidepressants vs. 87/97 (89.7%) for UD. The non-remission rate under antidepressant was 28/86(32.6%) for SZ and 87/119 (73.1%) for UD. Overall, 105 (40.1%) of SZ and 39 (28.1%) of UD patients were found to have abnormal CRP blood levels. Abnormal CRP levels were significantly associated with increased MDD and more strongly with increased rates of non-remission under antidepressants in SZ patients, independently of age, gender, psychotic symptomatology, functioning, tobacco smoking and . This result was not replicated in UD patients, which suggests that CRP may be a specific marker of major depression and remission under antidepressant in SZ patients.The development of biomarkers in psychiatry may orientate specific etiologic therapies in patients with mental disorders. The present findings suggest that major depression is frequent in SZ patients and that increased CRP levels are associated with non-remission under antidepressants in this population. Anti-inflammatory strategies may be particularly useful in this specific population.Copyright © 2018.

DNA, extracted from dried blood cards was collected as part of the regular NBS program. As cystinosis has a prevalence of only 1:100,000-1:200,000, a molecular genetic assay for detection of the SMN1 gene mutation with a higher prevalence was also included in the screening process, a genetic defect that leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). First tier multiplex PCR was employed for both diseases. The cystinosis screening employed assays for the three most common  mutations covering 75% of German patients; in case of heterozygosity for one of these mutations, samples were screened by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the CTNS exons for 101  mutations. A detection rate of 98.5% is predicted using this approach.Between January 15, 2018 and May 31, 2019, 257,734 newborns were screened in Germany for cystinosis. One neonate was diagnosed with cystinosis, consistent with the known incidence of the disease. No false positive or false negatives were detected so far. Screening, communication of findings to parents, and confirmation of diagnosis were accomplished in a multi-disciplinary setting.

Genetic ablation of CD40L reduced adipose tissue inflammation, while absence of CD40 resulted in aggravated  dysfunction in mice. During obesity, CD40 expressing CD11c dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages accumulate in adipose tissue and liver. We investigated the role of CD40CD11c cells in the  and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). DC-CD40-ko mice (CD40CD11c) mice were subjected to obesity or NASH. Obesity and insulin resistance were induced by feeding mice a 54% high fat diet (HFD). NASH was induced by feeding mice a diet containing 40% fat, 20% fructose and % cholesterol. CD40CD11c mice fed a HFD displayed increased weight gain, increased adipocyte size, and worsened insulin resistance. Moreover, CD40CD11c mice had higher plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels and developed profound liver steatosis. Overall, regulatory T cell numbers were decreased in these mice. In NASH, absence of CD40 on CD11c cells slightly decreased liver inflammation but did not affect liver lipid accumulation.

At least 3 months after surgery, serum leptin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride levels and the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) (night and morning) significantly decreased. According to the classical definition of surgical success, 40 subjects had successful surgery and were categorized as surgical responders, and the other 40 patients who failed surgery were categorized as surgical nonresponders. Significant reductions in serum leptin, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels and improvement of mean SBP (morning) occurred in surgical responders but not in nonresponders.Effective OSA surgery improves serum leptin, lipid profiles, and SBP. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of serial measurements of these biomarkers in monitoring surgical outcome of OSA treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615302>Type  diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk; what the pharmacotherapy can change through the epigenetics.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are part of the  and share similar risk factors, including obesity, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Atherosclerosis and insulin resistance contribute to the development of the diseases, and subclinical inflammation is observed in both conditions. There are many proofs about the connection between epigenetic factors and different diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, recent studies show that at least some anti-diabetic drugs, as well as blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), exert epigenetic effects aside from their hypoglycemic and antihypertensive functions, respectively. More studies are needed to discover other positive effects of the medications established through epigenetic mechanisms and to find out more about the epigenetic role in the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641800>The use of microindentation for the study of bone properties in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of fracture. In this study, we analysed the bone quality of premenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus by microindentation. No differences in bone quality were identified between patients and healthy controls, suggesting that intensive insulin therapy can preserve bone health.To compare the bone quality of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and healthy controls, and to determine the relationship with bone mineral density (BMD).This was a cross-sectional study of 45 premenopausal women with T1DM and 21 healthy controls, matched according to age and BMI. Clinical parameters, BMD and bone tissue mechanical properties (assessed using the bone material strength index [BMSi]) were evaluated in each group using microindentation. In T1DM patients, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA), the number of hypoglycaemic events and the status of chronic complications were also analysed.No differences in BMSi or BMD between T1DM patients and healthy controls were identified. In the T1DM patients, the mean HbA was 7.52% ± 1.00% and the mean time elapsed since diagnosis was 22.6 ± 12. years. Eight patients (17.7%) met the criteria for  (MetS), and microvascular complications were present in 12 patients (26.7%). Neither the number of features of MetS present nor the presence of microangiopathy was found to be associated with BMSi.T1DM premenopausal patients showed bone tissue properties comparable to those shown by controls. Further larger-scale studies should be conducted to confirm these results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662001>The association between preeclampsia and the risk of  after delivery: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p> We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiologic evidence of the association between preeclampsia and increased risk of  after delivery.

We aimed to investigate the association between DII and CVD events among a representative population sample in northeastern Iran. This prospective cohort study was a subsample of 4,672 adults aged 35-65 years, and recruited as part of Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder cohort study population. The DII was computed at baseline according to a 65-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox regression was used to determine the association of DII with incident CVD. One hundred twenty-four participants developed CVD (including 24 cases of myocardial infarction [MI], 34 cases of stable angina [SA], and 66 cases of unstable angina [UA]). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, a hazard ratios of 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-1.60), 1.36 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-3.52), 1.33 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-.94), and 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-1.53) were found for total CVD, MI, SA, and UA events, respectively, among the participants with proinflammatory diet (DII ≥ 0) versus those with anti-inflammatory diet (DII < 0).

Given the limited published literature on DAL, the aim of this study was to examine the association between DAL and risk factors for CVD and prevalence of MetS in young women.This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 371 women (20-50 y of age). Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. DAL was evaluated through potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP). The associations between DAL (both PRAL and NEAP) with categories of biochemical factors (fasting blood sugar, triacylglycerol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol), anthropometric parameters (body mass index and waist circumference) and the prevalence of MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III) were assessed using binary logistic regression in crude and adjusted models.The median values of PRAL and NEAP were 8.93 and 46.77 mEq/d, respectively. After adjustment for several covariates, a significant positive association was observed between PRAL and serum triglyceride levels (odds ratio [OR], 4.28; 95% CI, 1.67-10.99; P = 0.002). Moreover, there were positive associations between NEAP with overweight and obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m; OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.92-4.93; P = 0.0001), waist circumference (OR, .27; 95% CI, 1.37-3.75; P 0.001), and serum triglyceride levels (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 1.87-12.92; P 0.001).Compared with women with a low DAL score, women with a higher DAL score had higher weight, waist circumference, and triglyceride concentrations.Copyright © 2019.

However, the data are unclear regarding the effects on Sertoli cell (SC) function.To study SC function by assessing Inhibin B (IB) and Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels at baseline and after 3 month of CC treatment.This is an ancillary study of a cross-over, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed to evaluate androgen response to CC treatment in dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels treated with metformin. We evaluated SC function by assessing IB and AMH levels at baseline and after three months of each treatment in ten dysmetabolic obese subjects with low T levels. In all subjects,the influence of the clinical characteristics,  and hormonal baseline parameters on SC and Leydig (LC) function, evaluated respectively with AMH, IB, FSH and T levels, were tested.No significant changes were observed for IB and AMH concentrations after each treatment period. Whereas T and estradiol (E2) levels were shown to be significantly higher in the CC plus metformin phase (CC/Met) only. No clinical,  or hormonal parameters showed significant effects on serum AMH at baseline or after treatments. However, baseline T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) andE2 positively affected IB levels during CC/Met therapy (P=0.003, P=0.038 and P=0.049 respectively). Baseline leptin, and FSH had a negative (P=0,031) and positive (P=0.048) respectively role on T levels during CC/Met, as they were statistically significant compared to the placebo period (Plac/Met).Unlike the LC activity, CC was unable to influence SC function, as shown by the lack of IB and AMH serum modifications, thus suggesting an intrinsic non-reversible defect of SC cells in patients with dysmetabolic conditions.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577716>Gitelman  combined with growth hormone deficiency: Three cases report.</a></h2><p>Gitelman  (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary salt-losing tubulopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SLC12A3 gene. It is usually characterized by hypokalemia,  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. There are only a few reports on GS combined with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).Three patients presented with weakness, spasm, and growth retardation, respectively.GS was diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and genetic analysis. GH stimulation tests were performed when the magnesium level returned to normal under magnesium oxide (MgO) therapy.Initially, all patients received oral replacement of MgO and potassium chloride, and  of them received simultaneous spironolactone therapy. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy was initiated after they were diagnosed with GHD.All 3 patients exhibited satisfactory growth velocity and normal serum magnesium level, although the potassium level was still slightly lower than normal.We suggest that all GS patients should undergo genetic evaluation, especially regarding SLC12A3 gene mutation.

There are inconsistence findings about the relationship between food insecurity and MetS. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the association between food insecurity and MetS in North West of Iran.  The anthropometric measurements, food insecurity, dietary intake, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBS), serum triglyceride and HDL levels of 151 subjects who had participated in Azar cohort study were evaluated. Food security was assessed by Household Food Security Scale (HFIAS) (six-item short questionnaire) and dietary intake (using 24- hour recall questionnaire) of participants. MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATPIII ) criteria.  On the basis of HFIAS and energy, 7.3% and 11.9% of participants were food insecure and hunger, respectively. We observed no significant differences in mean body weight, BMI, waist circumference and FBS between food insecure and secure groups. Moreover, obesity (41.7% vs 30.%) and MetS (45.5% vs 30%) were more prevalent in the food insecure group but the differences were not significant.  The most percent of participants in food insecure were obese and had MetS. However, we could not find significant differences between food insecure and food secure groups. Therefore, for achieving more clear results, further studies with large sample size are needed.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671730>Antihypertensive and Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme (ACE)-Inhibitory Peptides from Fish as Potential Cardioprotective Compounds.</a></h2><p>The term /cardiometabolic/insulin resistance  could generally be defined as the co-occurrence of several risk factors inclusive of systemic arterial hypertension. Not only that organizations, such as the world health organization (WHO) have identified high blood pressure as one of the main risk factors of the cardiometabolic , but there is also a link between the occurrence of insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension that would consequently lead to type- diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is medicated by various classes of synthetic drugs; however, severe or mild adverse effects have been repeatedly reported. To avoid and reduce these adverse effects, natural alternatives, such as bioactive peptides derived from different sources have drawn the attention of researchers. Among all types of biologically active peptides inclusive of marine-derived ones, this paper's focus would solely be on fish and fishery by-processes' extracted peptides and products. Isolation and fractionation processes of these products alongside their structural, compositional and digestion stability characteristics have likewise been briefly discussed to better address the structure-activity relationship, expanding the reader's knowledge on research and discovery trend of fish antihypertensive biopeptides.

We aimed to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) in the overall safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AF, with emphasis on the use of cryoballoon ablation and novel oral anticoagulants. Methods and Results There were 2497 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF in 7 European high volume centers were stratified according to BMI (normal weight <25 kg/m, pre-obese 25-30 kg/m, obesity 30-35 kg/m, and morbid obesity ≥35 kg/m) and comparisons of procedural outcomes evaluated. Pre-obese and obese patients presented more comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea), and had higher rates of non-paroxysmal AF ablation procedures. The rate of atrial 12-month arrhythmia relapse increased alongside with BMI (35.%, 35.7%, 43.6%, and 48.0% <0.001). During a median follow-up of 18.8 months (interquartile range 11-28), after adjusting for all baseline differences, BMI was an independent predictor of relapse (hazard ratio=1.01 per kg/m; 95% CI 1.01-1.02; =0.002), adding incremental predictive value to obstructive sleep apnea. BMI was not a predictor for any of the reported complications. Using novel oral anticoagulants and cryoballoon ablation was safe and efficacy was comparable with vitamin-K antagonists and radiofrequency ablation. Conclusions Obese patients present with a more adverse comorbidity profile, more advanced forms of AF, and have lower chances of being free from AF relapse after ablation. Use of novel oral anticoagulants and cryoballoon ablation may be an option in this patient group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632345>Prevalence of  and Its Determinants in Newly-Diagnosed Adult-Onset Diabetes in China: A Multi-Center, Cross-Sectional Survey.</a></h2><p> The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of  (MetS) and its determinants in newly-diagnosed adult-onset diabetes in China.  From April 2015 to October 2017, 15,492 consecutive patients with diabetes diagnosed within 1 year and aged ≥30 years were recruited from 46 tertiary care hospitals in 24 cities across China. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody was assayed centrally and clinical data were collected locally. Classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were defined using the criteria of American Diabetes Association, Immunology of Diabetes Society and World Health Organization. MetS was defined using Chinese Diabetes Society's criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) of determinants of MetS.  The overall prevalence of MetS was 66.5%, with the highest prevalence in T2DM (68.1%), followed by those in LADA (44.3%) and T1DM (34.%) ( < 0.05 for all comparisons). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, T2DM had a .8-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): .36-3.37] MetS risk compared with LADA, whereas T1DM had significantly lower OR than LADA (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92). After further adjustment for insulin resistance, the OR of T2DM vs. LADA was slightly reduced but the OR of T1DM vs. LADA was greatly attenuated to non-significance (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.33). In addition to types of diabetes, age, gender, geographical residence, education attainment, alcohol consumption and HOMA2-IR were independent determinants of MetS.  MetS was highly prevalent, not only in T2DM but also in T1DM and LADA in Chinese newly diagnosed patients; higher risk of MetS in LADA than in T1DM was partially attributable to higher insulin resistance in LADA.Copyright © 2019 Li, Cao, Tang, Yan, Zhou, Liu, Ji, Yang and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664103>Association of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone and Thyroid Hormones with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Euthyroid Children and Adolescents Aged 10-18 Years: A Population-Based Study.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence indicates that low-normal thyroid function test results within the reference ranges may be related to increased cardiometabolic risk factors.

It most commonly occurs after parotidectomy, but other causes may include submandibular gland surgery, mandibular condylar fracture, obstetric (forceps) trauma, sympathectomy and  disease. Although the pathophysiology of Frey's  remains controversial, the generally accepted hypothesis is that it occurs as the result of injury to the auriculotemporal nerve.There is currently no clear evidence to establish the efficacy and safety of the different methods used for the treatment of Frey's , therefore the prevention of this symptom during surgery is important. The main method used for prevention is the interposition of a graft between the skin flap and the parotid bed during surgery. Biomaterials, allograft or autograft can be used for this purpose.To evaluate the effects and safety of biomaterial, allograft or autograft interposition for the prevention of Frey's  in patients undergoing parotidectomy, and to identify its effect on prevention and delayed occurrence.The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue ); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 5 February 2019.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with parotid disease (including tumours, inflammation, trauma etc.) undergoing parotidectomy with a minimal follow-up period of six months. We planned to include trials with interventions including biomaterial, allograft or autograft interposition alone or in combination with other surgical techniques. We included trials that compared any graft interposition and no graft interposition, or different graft interpositions.We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's  assessed clinically (Minor's starch-iodine test) and other complications (postoperative infection, subjective painful or restricted cervical movement, scar spread, rejection of the graft, complications related to the donor site such as accessory nerve injury and haematoma). Our secondary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's  assessed by participants (by questionnaire) and sweating area assessed by Minor's starch-iodine test. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.We included three RCTs (124 participants), two of which we assessed as at high risk of bias and one at unclear risk of bias. All studies were hospital-based and recruited participants undergoing superficial parotidectomy. Most participants were diagnosed with benign lesions of the parotid gland. Participants were followed up for more than six months. The studies evaluated the two comparisons shown below:Sternocleidomastoid muscle flap versus no flapTwo studies assessed this comparison. Both assessed the effects of the sternocleidomastoid muscle flap procedure on the incidence rate of Frey's  assessed clinically but neither showed a significant difference between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 1.23; 24 participants and RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.73; 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not pool the data due to the high heterogeneity (I² = 87%).One study found that the sternocleidomastoid muscle flap may result in little or no difference in other complications including haematoma (RR .18, 95% CI 0.09 to 50.16; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence), subjective painful or restricted cervical movement (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.14 to .05; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence) and scar spread in the cervical region (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.54; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence). Both studies reported the incidence rate of Frey's  assessed by participants, with one reporting no events in either group and the other finding no evidence of a difference (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.26; 36 participants; low-certainty evidence).Acellular dermal matrix versus no graftOnly one study assessed this comparison. Use of an acellular dermal matrix graft may result in little or no difference to the incidence rate of Frey's  (assessed clinically) in comparison with the no graft group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.25; 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence).Acellular dermal matrix may slightly increase the wound infection rate compared with control (RR 17.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 282.67; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acellular dermal matrix may result in little or no difference to the incidence of seromas or sialoceles (RR .33, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.23; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acellular dermal matrix may result in little or no difference to the incidence rate of Frey's  (assessed by participants) in comparison with the no graft group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.04; 64 participants; low-certainty evidence).The evidence for the effectiveness of graft interposition in preventing Frey's  is of low or very low certainty. The use of acellular dermal matrix may be associated with an increase in the wound infection rate, and little or no difference in the incidence of seromas or sialoceles.

Therefore, we aimed to conduct the first dose-response meta-analysis to investigate this effect.A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to June 01, 2019, together with relevant literature scrutiny, was performed to identify related studies for inclusion into the meta-analysis. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. Furthermore, subgroup, sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses were performed. This meta-analysis included 14 cross-sectional and four cohort studies, totaling 284,638 participants and 69,554 MetS cases. The highest versus the lowest carbohydrate intake values were associated with an increased risk of MetS (OR: 1.253, 95% CI: 1.147-1.368), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 54.5%). Using dose-response analysis, we found a linear association between carbohydrate consumption and MetS risk with a corresponding OR of 1.026 (95% CI, 1.004-1.048) and with significant heterogeneity (I = 82.0%) at 5% energy intake from carbohydrates. We have found similar results using subgroup analyses for major study characteristics and adjustment for confounders. Sensitivity analysis further enhanced the robustness of the results, and no publication bias was detected.Carbohydrate intake is associated with an increased risk of developing MetS. Therefore, additional large prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Individuals were classified as inactive, lower or upper insufficiently active, active, and high active. Metabolically unhealthy was defined as having 1 or more of the  criteria, excluding the abdominal obesity criterion.The percentages of metabolically healthy normal-weight (MHNW), metabolically healthy overweight (MHOW), MHO, and MUO in our cohort were 30.8% (63,408 of 205,745), 5.8% (12,002 of 205,745), 4.1% (8329 of 205,745), and 20.7% (42,564 of 205,745), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 6 (range, 0.5-19) years, among 63,408 MHNW participants, 1890 (3.0%) and 1174 (1.9%) developed MUO and MHO, respectively. Among 12,002 MHOW participants, 3404 (28.4%) developed MUO and 2734 (22.8%) developed MHO. A total of 5506 of 8329 (66.1%) participants moved from MHO to MUO, and 5675 of 42,564 (13.3%) moved from MUO to MHO. Compared with being inactive, MHNW individuals who were active or high active showed lower risk for MUO. Among those with MHOW, being high active was associated with reduced risk for MUO and MHO. Although among MHO participants, PA was not associated with incident MUO, being active or high active was linked to a greater likelihood of moving from MUO to MHO.PA may prevent the development of both MHO and MUO. PA also helps increase the transition from MUO to MHO, which may contribute to reduce the subsequent development of type  diabetes mellitus and major cardiovascular disease complications.Copyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The  can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone acetate (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and  parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and  mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated.  parameters such as serum insulin, glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, , and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term  outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617968>Prevalence of  and Associated Factors in a Cohort of Individuals With Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results From the FACE-DR Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of  (MetS) and its components in a cohort of French patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to determine correlations with sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors.From 2012 to 2018, 205 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode with moderate-to-severe symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 20), and at least Stage II resistance according to Thase and Rush criteria were enrolled in the FondaMental Advanced Centers of Expertise in Resistant Depression (FACE-DR) cohort. Data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, lifestyle information, and treatment and comorbidities were collected, and a blood sample was drawn. MetS was defined according to the criteria of the International Diabetes Federation.Overall, 38% of individuals with TRD met criteria for MetS. The frequency of MetS was significantly higher in men than in women only for patients aged 40 years or older (46.3% vs 35.%, P = .0427). Moreover, whereas the management for diabetes was good, less than one-third of the patients with high blood pressure or dyslipidemia were treated for these conditions. Multivariate analysis showed that individuals with abnormal plasma c-reactive protein levels had a 3-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.5-5.) of having MetS, independent of other potential confounders.The prevalence of MetS is higher in patients with TRD than in those with other psychiatric disorders and characterized by a considerable undertreatment of some components of MetS in this population. Diagnosis and treatment of the components of MetS should be systematically performed to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases in patients with TRD. These findings highlight the need for integrated care, with more interaction and coordination between psychiatrists and primary care providers.© Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636781>Ezetimibe Monotherapy Reduces Serum Levels of Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase in Patients With Dyslipidemia.</a></h2><p>The combination of ezetimibe with statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events compared to statin monotherapy in IMPROVEIT study, and ezetimibe monotherapy attenuated atherosclerosis in basic study. We previously showed ezetimibe monotherapy was especially effective for  (MetS) patients. We investigated the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) function and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity.Forty-two patients who initially received ezetimibe (10 mg/day) without statin treatment for 16 weeks from January 2009 to August 2011 were enrolled. Patients were divided into MetS and non-MetS groups, and serum levels of lipids, PAF-AH, and HDL-chol efflux capacity (HDL-CEC) at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment were investigated. Serum PAF-AH, HDL-associated PAF-AH (HDL-PAF-AH), and LDL-associated PAF-AH (LDL-PAF-AH) were measured.In all patients, age, the percentages of males, and body mass index were 61.0 ± 8.8 years, 59.5% and 26.3 ± 3.4 kg/m, respectively. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy. Serum PAF-AH and LDL-PAF-AH were significantly decreased by ezetimibe monotherapy, whereas HDL-PAF-AH and HDL-CEC were not. There was no difference in the results of PAF-AH and HDL-CEC between MetS and non-MetS groups.Ezetimibe monotherapy might prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) regardless of the presence of MetS, because PAF-AH was independent risk factor for CHD.Copyright 2019, Tano et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642000> is a predictor of decreased renal function among community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.</a></h2><p> (MetS) is increasing worldwide with the continuous increase in obesity prevalence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a major public health problem, but there is controversy over whether baseline MetS is a predictor of decreased renal function among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese.We conducted a prospective cohort study designed as part of the Nomura study. We recruited a random sample of 410 men aged 68 ± 8 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 50-95) years and 549 women aged 69 ± 7 (50-84) years during their annual health examination in a single community. We examined the relationship between baseline MetS and renal dysfunction after a 3-year evaluation based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI equations modified by the Japan coefficient. CKD was defined as dipstick-positive proteinuria (> or = 1 +) or a low eGFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m).Of the 959 participants, 413 (43.1%) had MetS at baseline. Annual eGFR decline rate was significantly greater in those with MetS than in those without MetS, and the annual eGFR decline rate of < - 1. mL/min/1.73 m/year increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, the incidence rate of CKD after 3 years was 13.5% and increased significantly in relation to presence of baseline MetS, especially its components such as elevated HbA1c. The multivariate-adjusted odd ratio (OR) for CKD in participants with MetS versus those without MetS was 1.55 (0.99-.43). The multivariate-adjusted ORs for rapid annual eGFR decline rate were significantly high in patients aged ≥ 65 years and presence of medication, regardless of gender and eGFR value.Low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c levels correlated significantly with eGFR decline in a short period of 3 years. MetS also showed a significant association with eGFR decline. This study suggests the importance of low HDL-C and elevated HbA1c in the effect of MetS on eGFR decline rather than obesity among Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese without CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611471>Visceral adiposity index and longitudinal risk of incident : Korean genome and epidemiology study (KoGES).</a></h2><p>Available data is insufficient to identify the influence of visceral adiposity assessed by visceral adiposity index (VAI) on incident MetS. This study was to evaluate the association of VAI with incident MetS. In a cohort of Korean genome epidemiology study, 5,807 free of MetS were followed-up for 10 years. They were subdivided into 3 tertile groups according to VAI score. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidential interval (CI) [adjusted HRs (95% CI)] for MetS according to VAI tertiles. Subgroup analyses were conducted for VAI and waist circumference (WC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) analyses were conducted to compare the discriminative ability for Mets among indices. The risk for MetS increased proportionally to VAI tertiles in all participants, which was similarly observed in both men and women. Subgroup analysis indicated that group with high VAI and low WC had the increased risk for MetS (all participants: .76 [.48-3.07], men: .77 [.40-3.19] and women: .55 [.16-3.00]), compared with groups with low VAI and low WC. Group with low VAI and high WC generally had the higher adjusted HRs for MetS than group with the high VAI and low WC. In AUC analyses, WC had the highest discriminative ability for Mets. In conclusion, elevated VAI was significantly associated with the increased long-term risk of MetS. VAI is a useful supplementary to classic anthropometric indices in screening high risk group of MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655555>Liddle  due to a novel mutation in the γ subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in family from Russia: a case report.</a></h2><p>Liddle  is a monogenic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Basic characteristics of this disease are hypertension, reduced concentration of aldosterone and renin activity, as well as increased excretion of potassium leading to low level of potassium in serum and  alkalosis. The cause of Liddle  is missense or frameshift mutations in SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G genes that encode epithelial sodium channel subunits.We describe a family with Liddle  from Russia. 15-year-old proband has arterial hypertension, hypokalemia, hyporeninemia,  alkalosis, but aldosterone level is within the normal range. At 12 years of age, arterial hypertension was noticed for the first time. We identified novel frameshift mutation c.1769delG (p.Gly590Alafs) in SCNN1G, which encodes the γ subunit of ENaC in vertebrates. The father and younger sister also harbor this heterozygous deletion. Treatment with amiloride of proband and his sister did not normalize the blood pressure, but normalized level of plasma renin activity.Our results expand the mutational spectrum of Liddle  and provide further proof that the conserved PY motif is crucial to control of ENaC activity. Genetic analysis has implications for the management of hypertension, specific treatment with amiloride and counselling in families with Liddle .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611883>Antioxidant Defense, Redox Homeostasis, and Oxidative Damage in Children With Ataxia Telangiectasia and Nijmegen Breakage .</a></h2><p>Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen breakage  (NBS) belong to a group of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PI) characterized by premature aging, cerebral degeneration, immunoglobulin deficiency and higher cancer susceptibility. Despite the fact that oxidative stress has been demonstrated  and in animal models of AT and NBS, the involvement of redox homeostasis disorders is still unclear in the  phenotype of AT and NBS patients. Our study is the first to compare both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants as well as oxidative damage between AT and NBS subjects. Twenty two Caucasian children with AT and twelve patients with NBS were studied. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants - glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD) and uric acid (UA); redox status-total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP); and oxidative damage products-8-hydroxy-'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), advanced glycation end products (AGE), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adducts, and 8-isoprostanes (8-isop) were evaluated in serum or plasma samples. We showed that CAT, SOD and UA were significantly increased, while TAC and FRAP levels were statistically lower in the plasma of AT patients compared to controls. In NBS patients, only CAT activity was significantly elevated, while TAC was significantly decreased as compared to healthy children. We also showed higher oxidative damage to DNA (↑8-OHdG), proteins (↑AGE, ↑AOPP), and lipids (↑4-HNE, ↑8-isop) in both AT and NBS patients. Interestingly, we did not demonstrate any significant differences in the antioxidant defense and oxidative damage between AT and NBS patients. However, in AT children, we showed a positive correlation between 8-OHdG and the α-fetoprotein level as well as a negative correlation between 8-OHdG and IgA. In NBS, AGE was positively correlated with IgM and negatively with the IgG level. Summarizing, we demonstrated an imbalance in cellular redox homeostasis and higher oxidative damage in AT and NBS patients. Despite an increase in the activity/concentration of some antioxidants, the total antioxidant capacity is overwhelmed in children with AT and NBS and predisposes them to more considerable oxidative damage. Oxidative stress may play a major role in AT and NBS phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Maciejczyk, Heropolitanska-Pliszka, Pietrucha, Sawicka-Powierza, Bernatowska, Wolska-Kusnierz, Pac, Car, Zalewska and Mikoluc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637139>ncRNA2MetS: a manually curated database for non-coding RNAs associated with .</a></h2><p> is a cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors (diabetes and raised fasting plasma glucose, abdominal obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure), and has become a major global threat to human health.

To better investigate RTT disease progression/pathogenesis animal models of Mecp2 deficiency have been developed. Here, Mecp2 mouse models are employed to investigate the role of protein patterns in RTT. A proteome analysis was carried out in brain tissue from i) Mecp2 deficient mice at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages and, ii) mice in which the disease phenotype was reversed by Mecp2 reactivation. Several proteins were shown to be differentially expressed in the pre-symptomatic (n = 18) and symptomatic (n = 20) mice. Mecp2 brain reactivated mice showed wild-type comparable levels of expression for twelve proteins, mainly related to proteostasis (n = 4) and energy  pathways (n = 4). The remaining ones were found to be involved in redox homeostasis (n = ), nitric oxide regulation (n = 1), neurodevelopment (n = 1). Ten out of twelve proteins were newly linked to Mecp2 deficiency. Our study sheds light on the relevance of the protein-regulation of main physiological process in the complex mechanisms leading from Mecp2 mutation to the RTT clinical phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: We performed a proteomic study of a Mecp2 mouse model for Rett  (RTT) at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic Mecp2 deficient mice stage and for the brain specific reactivated Mecp2 model. Our results reveal major protein expression changes pointing out to defects in proteostasis or energy  pathways other than, to a lesser extent, in redox homeostasis, nitric oxide regulation or neurodevelopment. The Mecp2 mouse rescued model provides the possibility to select target proteins more susceptible to the Mecp2 gene mutation, potential and promising therapeutical targets.Copyright © 2019.

Extended Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was performed and showed severe IR. She was then started on metformin 850 mg twice a day, and had repeated OGTT. This showed dramatic worsening of glucose tolerance (e.g. glucose 96 mg/dl versus 187 mg/dl and 68 mg/dl versus 204 mg/dl at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively). This was accompanied by a massive increase of already high insulin concentrations (e.g. from 488.6 to > 1000 µIU/ml, and from 246.8 to > 1000 µIU/ml at 120 and 150 min of OGTT, respectively). Insulin concentrations remained above upper assay detection limit also at 180 min of OGTT on metformin treatment (> 1000 µIU/ml versus 100.6 µIU/ml without metformin).Metformin treatment may paradoxically lead to deterioration of insulin resistance and to development of glucose intolerance in SHORT . Hence, metformin treatment might be potentially harmful in these patients. Though, the precise cause of such profound and paradoxical worsening of glucose tolerance post metformin remains unknown, SHORT  might prove to be an interesting model to study the mechanism(s) of metformin action.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654729>Cluster patterns of behavioural risk factors among children: Longitudinal associations with adult cardio- risk factors.</a></h2><p>Much of what is known about childhood clusters of cardiovascular disease behavioural risk factors (RFs) comes from cross-sectional studies, providing little insight into the long-term health impacts of different behavioural cluster profiles. This study aimed to establish the longitudinal relationship between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Data were from an Australian prospective cohort study of 1265 participants measured in 1985 (ages 9-15 yrs), and in 2004-06 (ages 26-36 yrs). At baseline, children self-reported smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity (PA), dietary behaviour and psychological well-being. At follow-up, participants completed questionnaires and attended study clinics where the following component indicators of the  (MetS) score were measured: waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids. TwoStep cluster analyses were carried out to identify clusters in childhood. Linear regression was used to examine the longitudinal associations between cluster patterns of childhood behavioural RFs and adult cardio- RFs. Four childhood cluster patterns of behavioural RFs labelled 'most healthy', 'high PA', 'most unhealthy', and 'breakfast skippers' were identified. The unhealthier childhood clusters predicted a significantly higher adult MetS score ('most unhealthy': β = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.01, 0.19) and adult waist circumference ('most unhealthy': β = .29, 95%CI = 0.90, 6.67; 'breakfast skippers': β = .15, 95%CI = 0.30, 4.00). These associations were independent of adult behavioural RFs and socio-economic position. These findings emphasise the impact of multiple childhood behavioural RFs on important adult health outcomes and may be useful for the development of early intervention strategies, where identification of children at higher risk of poorer adult cardio- health is vital.Copyright © 2018.

Evidence has shown that physical activity can positively impact age-related health conditions, yet exercise trials in older adults with mental disorders are rare. Our study was a tailored and targeted pilot exercise intervention for older veterans with PTSD.Fifty-four older veterans with PTSD (mean age = 67.4 years, 90.7% male, 85.% non-white) were randomized to supervised exercise (n=38) or wait-list usual care (WL; n=18) for 12 weeks. Physical activity (MET-min/wk) and aerobic endurance (assessed with the 6-minute walk test), were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were physical performance (strength, mobility, balance), cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., waist circumference), and health-related quality of life.At 12 weeks, a large effect of the intervention on physical activity levels (Cohen's d=1.37) was observed compared to WL. Aerobic endurance improved by 69 meters in the exercise group compared to 10 meters in WL, reflecting a moderate between-group effect (Cohen's d=.50). Between-group differences on 12-week changes in physical performance, cardiometabolic risk factors, and health-related quality of life ranged from small to large effects (Cohen's d=.28-1.48), favoring the exercise arm.Participation in supervised exercise improved aerobic endurance, physical performance, and health-related clinical factors in older veterans with PTSD; a medically complex population with multiple morbidity.

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

This prospective study with three predetermined timepoints and a standardized treatment protocol investigates changes in sleep parameters during the first .5 years of acromegaly treatment.Before initiation of acromegaly treatment (medical pretreatment followed by surgery), polysomnography (PSG) was performed in twenty-seven consecutive patients with treatment-naive acromegaly. PSG was repeated after 1 year (N=24) and .5 years (N=23), and anthropometric and biochemical parameters were obtained.At baseline, 74.1% of the patients was diagnosed with OSAS. The Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI; P 0.001), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI; P 0.001), lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2; P 0.007) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; P<0.001) improved significantly during treatment, with the greatest improvement in the first year. After .5 years of treatment, all patients had controlled acromegaly. Of the 16 patients with repeated PSGs and OSAS at baseline, 11 (68.8%) were cured of OSAS. Changes in RDI, ODI, LSaO2, and ESS correlated with IGF-1 levels.OSAS has a high prevalence in active acromegaly. There is a substantial decrease in prevalence and severity of OSAS following acromegaly treatment with the largest improvement during the first year. Most surgically and biochemically controlled patients recovered from OSAS. Therefore, a PSG is advised after diagnosis of acromegaly. When OSAS is present, it should be treated and PSGs should be repeated during acromegaly treatment.© Endocrine Society 2019. All rights reserved.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage . The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic acid, cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different -inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and . Various types of diet can lead to type  diabetes. The gut microbiota in type  diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease.

Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

These increases may be a result of the concurrent increases of obesity and aging. T2DM is associated with cognitive impairments and  factors, which increase the cellular vulnerability to develop an increased risk of age-related LOAD. This review addresses possible mechanisms due to obesity, aging, multiple intersections between T2DM and LOAD and mechanisms for the continuum of progression. Multiple ultrastructural images in female diabetic  models are utilized to demonstrate marked cellular remodeling changes of mural and glia cells and provide for the discussion of functional changes in T2DM. Throughout this review multiple endeavors to demonstrate how T2DM increases the vulnerability of the brain's neurovascular unit (NVU), neuroglia and neurons are presented.

Plasma levels of Ad are reduced in obesity, which contributes to type  diabetes. Therefore, agents that activate the Ad signaling pathway could ameliorate  diseases such as type  diabetes. Here, we report the identification of a high-affinitive agonist antibody against Ad receptors. The antibody was selected by using phage display of human combinatorial antibody libraries. The selected antibody induced phosphorylation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and stimulated glucose uptake and fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) in myotubes. In addition, the antibody significantly lowered blood glucose levels during a glucose challenge in normal mice as well as basal blood glucose levels in a type  diabetic mouse model. Taken together, these results suggest that the agonist antibody could be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of  such as type  diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that MetS confers an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients.We performed a retrospective review of trauma patients from 2014 through 2018, excluding patients <16 years of age, ISS <16, and with incomplete height and/or weight documentation. MetS was defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and a BMI ≥30 kg/m. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), complications, discharge location, and mortality.There were 4,491 patients meeting criteria of which 100 (.%) had MetS. Patients with MetS were older (64.0 vs 38.6 years, p<.0001) but similar in ISS (22 vs 22, p=.70). Hospital LOS was significantly longer with MetS (16.5 vs 11 days, p <.0001) as was ICU LOS (9 vs 5 days, p=.0002). MetS correlated with higher rates of AKI (19% vs 3.6%,p<.0001), ARDS (11.0% vs 4.6%, p=.01), cardiac arrest (10.0% vs 4.0%, p=.01), MI (.0% vs 0.3%, p=.05), severe sepsis (8.0% vs 3.3%, p=.03), unplanned intubation (11.0% vs 5.0%, p=.02), unplanned ICU admission (13.0% vs 6.1%, p=.02), and non-home discharge (51.0% vs 30.%, p=.0007). After controlling for age, GCS, ISS, gender, and mechanism, MetS remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR .5, 95% CI 1.33-4.7, p=.004).MetS occurs infrequently in our severely injured trauma population but is strongly associated with increasing LOS as well as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, and renal complications.

Consecutive gout patients were recruited between August 2017 and December 2018. Demographic information, clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected. BC was assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis including body fat percentage (BF%), trunk and limb BF%, appendicular skeletal muscle index. Overfat was defined by BF% ≥25% for male and ≥35% for female. The association between BC and serum uric acid (sUA) was evaluated by multiple linear regression.  A total of 362 gout patients were recruited with median age 38 (30, 52) years, 96.1% (348/362) were male. Mean sUA was (551±133) μmol/L. The mean BF% was (25.8±6.4)% with 53.6%(194/362) patients overfat. Male gout patients with overfat showed more affected joints [4(, 6) vs. (, 5)], higher sUA [(576±126)μmol/L vs. (523±134) μmol/L], higher prevalence of dyslipidemia [70.1%(131/187) vs. 54.0%(87/161)],  [60.8%(118/187) vs. 28.0%(47/161)], fatty liver [58.%(113/187) vs. 35.1%(59/161)] and hypertension [44.4%(83/187) vs. 25.5%(41/161)] than male patients with normal fat (all <0.05). Their BF%, trunk BF% and limb BF% were positively correlated with the numbers of affected joints, sUA, , fatty liver, and hypertension, respectively (=0.154-0.435, all <0.05). Multivariable linear regression suggested that BF% (=4.29, =0.020) and trunk BF% (=9.11, =0.007), but not limb BF%, were positively correlated with sUA.  Overfat is very common in gout patients.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for . Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance.

Several mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for associating FLD with CVD through several mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipotoxicity and microbiota dysbiosis which may also be influenced by other factors such as genetic and epigenetic variations. Despite of all this evidence, the exact mechanisms of how FLD can causally contribute to CVD are not fully elucidated and much remains unknown. Moreover, the current literature supports the increasing evidence associating FLD with several cardiovascular (CV) adverse events including coronary artery disease, increased subclinical atherosclerosis risk, structural alterations mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, increased epicardial fat thickness, valvular calcifications including aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification and functional cardiac modifications mainly diastolic dysfunction in addition to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias and conduction defects including atrioventricular blocks and bundle branch blocks. Patients with FLD should be evaluated and managed accordingly in order to prevent further complications. Possible management methods include non-pharmacological strategies including life style modifications, pharmacological therapies as well as surgical management. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FLD with an increased CV risk, in addition to associated CV adverse events and current management modalities.Copyright © 2019 Ismaiel and Dumitraşcu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573841>Amelioration of  by metformin associates with reduced indices of low-grade inflammation independently of the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Metformin beneficially impacts several aspects of  including dysglycemia, obesity and liver dysfunction, thus making it a widely used front line treatment for early-stage type  diabetes, which is associated with these disorders. Several mechanisms of action for metformin have been proposed, including that it acts as anti-inflammatory agent, possibly as a result of its impact on intestinal microbiota. In accord with this possibility, we observed herein that, in mice with diet-induced , metformin is impacting the gut microbiota by preventing its encroachment upon the host, a feature of  in mice and humans. However, the ability of metformin to beneficially impact  in mice was not impacted by ablation of gut microbiota achieved by use of antibiotics or germfree mice. Rather, while microbiota ablation itself suppressed diet-induced dysglycemia, other features of  including obesity, hepatic steatosis, and low-grade inflammation were similarly suppressed by metformin in the presence or absence of gut microbiota.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely , type  diabetes mellitus, obesity, atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. In summary, in this paper we consider the non-genomic vascular mode of action of androgen in physiological conditions and the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the role of dietary berries (taken as fresh, frozen, or other processed forms) on insulin resistance and biomarkers of T2D in human feeding studies. Reported feeding trials involve different berries taken in different forms, and consequently differences in nutritional or polyphenol composition must be considered in their interpretation. Commonly consumed berries, especially cranberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, ameliorate postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in overweight or obese adults with insulin resistance, and in adults with the  (MetS). In non-acute long-term studies, these berries either alone, or in combination with other functional foods or dietary interventions, can improve glycemic and lipid profiles, blood pressure and surrogate markers of atherosclerosis. Studies specifically in people with T2D are few, and more knowledge is needed. Nevertheless, existing evidence, although sparse, suggests that berries have an emerging role in dietary strategies for the prevention of diabetes and its complications in adults. Despite the beneficial effects of berries on diabetes prevention and management, they must be consumed as part of a healthy and balanced diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611265>All about skin manifestations of insulin resistance and type  diabetes: acanthosis nigricans and acrochordons.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646301>Relative fat mass is a better predictor of dyslipidemia and  than body mass index.</a></h2><p>Relative fat mass (RFM) had been recently developed.

A total of 8,464 subjects aged 10-20 years were classified into 4 groups according to sex- and age-specific TMI: (i) underweight, (ii) normal weight, (iii) overweight, and (iv) obese. The range of the 50th percentiles of TMI was from 13.24 kg/m at 10 years to 12.94 kg/m at 20 years among males and from 12.19 kg/m to 12.84 kg/m among females. In the analysis of covariance, obesity groups according to sex- and age-specific TMI were positively correlated with waist circumference (WC) standard deviation score; systolic blood pressure (BP); diastolic BP; and levels of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but for both sexes, the obesity groups were negatively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In the multiple logistic regression, subjects in the overweight group had higher odds ratios (ORs) for elevated WC (29.18), elevated BP (1.33), elevated TGs (.55), reduced HDL-C (.31), and MetS (8.93) than those with normal weight. Participants in the obesity group had increased ORs for elevated WC (154.67), elevated BP (.22), elevated glucose (3.54), elevated TGs (4.12), reduced HDL-C (3.69), and MetS (25.57) compared to participants with normal weight after adjustment for confounders.

Their crucial biological roles dictate the significance of PPAR-targeting synthetic ligands in medical research and drug discovery. Clinical implications of PPAR agonists span across a wide range of health conditions, including  diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and malignancies. In this review we aim to consolidate existing clinical evidence of PPAR modulators, highlighting their clinical prospects and challenges. Findings from clinical trials revealed that different agonists of the same PPAR subtype could present different safety profiles and clinical outcomes in a disease-dependent manner. Pemafibrate, due to its high selectivity, is likely to replace other PPARα agonists for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone showed tremendous promises in many non- disorders like chronic kidney disease, depression, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The clinical niche of PPARβ/δ agonists is less well-explored. Interestingly, dual- or pan-PPAR agonists, namely chiglitazar, saroglitazar, elafibranor, and lanifibranor, are gaining momentum with their optimistic outcomes in many diseases including type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and primary biliary cholangitis. Notably, the preclinical and clinical development for PPAR antagonists remains unacceptably deficient. We anticipate the future design of better PPAR modulators with minimal off-target effects, high selectivity, superior bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. This will open new possibilities for PPAR ligands in medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646115>Metabolically healthy versus unhealthy obesity and risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h2><p>Obesity presents one of the biggest issues of modern-day life for a wide variety of medical specialties, starting with the cardiologist and ending with the diabetologist or the bariatric surgeon.

We have developed an Indian variant of the Palaeolithic vegan diet, which excludes all animal-based foods. The Palaeolithic diet typically has low carbohydrate and lean protein of 30-35% daily caloric intake in addition to a fibre diet from non-cereal, plant-based sources, up to 45-100 g daily. In different observational studies, beneficial effects on , blood pressure, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk factors have been documented with the Palaeolithic diet. Short-term randomised controlled trials have documented weight loss, and improved glycaemia and adipo-cytokine profiles. Few concerns of micronutrient deficiency (e.g. calcium) have been raised.Initial data are encouraging with regard to the use of the Palaeolithic diet in managing diabesity.

Estimates are that almost 50 to 60% of adults will develop at least one of these harmless growths in their lifetime, with the probability of their occurrence increasing after the fourth decade of life. However, at the very outset, it should be noted that acrochordons occur more commonly in individuals suffering from obesity, diabetes,  (MeTS), and in people with a family history of skin tags. Skin tags affect men and women equally. Acrochordons may appear as early as the teenage years but are most common in the latter part of life. However, many studies have reported that the incidence of skin tags in children and adolescents is increasing. The latter seems to be in concert with the global rise in the incidence of childhood and teenage obesity. Skin tags, on the other hand, are rare after the seventh decade of life. These lesions tend to grow in areas where there are skin folds, such as the axilla, neck, eyelids, and groin. The lesions are skin-colored, brown, and even red ovoid growths that are often pedunculated and attached to a fleshy stalk. Skin tags are small, between 1 and 5 mm, but rarely can grow to be 1 to  centimeters in size. Acrochordons are not painful or tender but can be troublesome all the same. People frequently complain of skin tags getting caught on clothing or jewelry like necklaces. Sometimes the constant friction between the garments and the skin tag may result in bleeding or itching. Certain genetic disorders may have a predisposition to skin tags. In patients with the Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD)  and tuberous sclerosis.[1][] in addition to other cutaneous and systemic features, acrochordons may be seen in large numbers, often forming a 'necklace' like configuration around the neck- referred to as the 'molluscum pendulum necklace sign.'Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646289>Serum leptin in male hypothyroid prediabetic patients: Association with cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>Hyperliptenemia is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD).

Few studies have addressed the role of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and its effect on CHD risk factors.The aim of this study was to detect serum levels of leptin in hypothyroid prediabetic patients and their relationship with risk factors for CHD.The study included three groups; group A included 120 hypothyroid male patients with normal glucose tolerance, group B included 120 hypothyroid male patients with prediabetes, and group C included 120 healthy individuals matched for age and sex as a control group. All groups were subjected to assessment of history, clinical examination, and laboratory investigations including fasting and  h postprandial blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), free T3, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and fasting serum leptin.Serum leptin was significantly higher in groups A and B compared with group C (=0.0001), whereas there was no significant difference in serum leptin between groups A and B. In comparison with group A, the patients in group B had significantly higher serum TC (=0.02), LDL (=0.04), and lower serum HDL (=0.02).

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of six anthropometric indices to identify MetS in the Polish population. The highest odds ratios for the occurrence of MetS, according to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), were noted for the following indices: waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, OR = 24.87) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE, OR = 17.47) in men and WHtR (OR = 25.61) and body roundness index (BRI, OR = 16.44) in women. The highest odds ratios for the modified definition of MetS (without waist circumference) were found for the following indices: WHtR (OR = 7.32), BRI (OR = 6.57), and CUN-BAE (OR = 6.12) in women and CUN-BAE (OR = 5.83), WHtR (OR = 5.70), and body mass index (BMI, OR = 5.65) in men ( < 0.001 for all). According to the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses conducted for the identification of MetS, defined in accordance with IDF, the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) in men were observed for WHtR and CUN-BAE indices, whereas in women, they were observed for WHtR and BRI. In the analysis carried out for the identification of MetS (according to modified definition, without waist circumference), the AUCs were larger for WHtR and BRI in women, while in men, they were larger for CUN-BAE, BMI, and WHtR. BMI was also characterized by a relatively strong discriminatory power in identifying individuals with MetS. An optimal cut-off point for MetS, in accordance with the conventional definition, for both sexes was the value of BMI = 27. kg/m. The weakest predictor of the  was the ABSI (a body shape index) indicator. The most useful anthropometric indicator for the identification of MetS, both in men and in women in the Polish population, was WHtR.

PROK2 is also expressed in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) as an essential factor for neuro-and morphogenesis. Since the MOB was shown to be strongly involved in eating behavior, we hypothesized that PROK2 could be a new target in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, through its effects in the MOB. We also asked whether PROK2 could be associated with the pathophysiology of obesity, the  (MetS), and type  diabetes (T2D) in humans.We assessed in wild type mice whether the expression of Prok2 in the MOB is dependent on the nutritional status. We measured the effect of human recombinant PROK2 (rPROK2) acute injection in the MOB on food intake and olfactory behavior. Then, using a lentivirus expressing Prok2-shRNA, we studied the effects of Prok2 underexpression in the MOB on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism.  parameters and meal pattern were determined using calorimetric cages. In vivo -deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed in mice after intraperitoneally insulin injection. Plasmatic PROK2 dosages and genetic associations studies were carried out respectively on 148 and more than 4000 participants from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiologic Study on the Insulin Resistance ) cohort.Our findings showed that fasting in mice reduced Prok2 expression in the MOB. Acute injection of rPROK2 in the MOB significantly decreased food intake whereas Prok2-shRNA injection resulted in a higher dietary consumption characterized by increased feeding frequency and decreased meal size. Additionally, Prok2 underexpression in the MOB induced insulin resistance compared to scrambled shRNA-injected mice. In the human D.E.S.I.R. cohort, we found a significantly lower mean concentration of plasma PROK2 in people with T2D than in those with normoglycemia. Interestingly, this decrease was no longer significant when adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) or calorie intake, suggesting that the association between plasma PROK2 and diabetes is mediated, at least partly, by BMI and feeding behavior in humans. Moreover, common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PROK2 gene were genotyped and associated with incident T2D or impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), MetS, and obesity.Our data highlight PROK2 as a new target in the MOB that links olfaction with eating behavior and energy homeostasis. In humans, plasma PROK2 is negatively correlated with T2D, BMI, and energy intake, and PROK2 genetic variants are associated with incident hyperglycemia (T2D/IFG), the MetS and obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for determining optimal cutoff for SPISE in MetS.SPISE was significantly lower in MetS patients (5.35 ± 1.35) than that for controls (7.45 ± ) with  < 0.05 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.79-.41). ROC curve showed area under the curve = 0.83 for SPISE ( < 0.05, CI: 0.79-0.86), showing SPISE to have good predictive ability to discriminate MetS cases from controls. The cutoff value of SPISE index for predicting insulin sensitivity in MetS was found out to be 5.82 with sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 80%, respectively. This cutoff is lower than the European population (6.61), indicating higher insulin resistance (IR) in the study population.SPISE could be a useful potential low-cost indicator with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting IR in MetS.Copyright: © 2019 Journal of Laboratory Physicians.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581549>Exogenous Ketones Lower Blood Glucose Level in Rested and Exercised Rodent Models.</a></h2><p>Diseases involving inflammation and oxidative stress can be exacerbated by high blood glucose levels. Due to tight  regulation, safely reducing blood glucose can prove difficult. The ketogenic diet (KD) reduces absolute glucose and insulin, while increasing fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and circulating levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone. Compliance to KD can be difficult, so alternative therapies that help reduce glucose levels are needed. Exogenous ketones provide an alternative method to elevate blood ketone levels without strict dietary requirements. In this study, we tested the changes in blood glucose and ketone (βHB) levels in response to acute, sub-chronic, and chronic administration of various ketogenic compounds in either a post-exercise or rested state. WAG/Rij (WR) rats, a rodent model of human absence epilepsy, GLUT1 deficiency  mice (GLUT1D), and wild type Sprague Dawley rats (SPD) were assessed. Non-pathological animals were also assessed across different age ranges. Experimental groups included KD, standard diet (SD) supplemented with water (Control, C) or with exogenous ketones: 1, 3-butanediol (BD), βHB mineral salt (KS), KS with medium chain triglyceride/MCT (KSMCT), BD acetoacetate diester (KE), KE with MCT (KEMCT), and KE with KS (KEKS). In rested WR rats, the KE, KS, KSMCT groups had lower blood glucose level after 1 h of treatment, and in KE and KSMCT groups after 24 h. After exercise, the KE, KSMCT, KEKS, and KEMCT groups had lowered glucose levels after 1 h, and in the KEKS and KEMCT groups after 7 days, compared to control. In GLUT1D mice without exercise, only KE resulted in significantly lower glucose levels at week  and week 6 during a 10 weeks long chronic feeding study. In 4-month and 1-year-old SPD rats in the post-exercise trials, blood glucose was significantly lower in KD and KE, and in KEMCT groups, respectively. After seven days, the KSMCT group had the most significantly reduced blood glucose levels, compared to control. These results indicate that exogenous ketones were efficacious in reducing blood glucose levels within and outside the context of exercise in various rodent models of different ages, with and without pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589129>Mechanism Underlying the Formation of a Cluster of .</a></h2><p>The concept of  (MetS) as a cluster of risk factors of type  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has undergone some evolutionary transformations over the past years. Integrating the autonomic dysfunction into the pathogenesis of MetS creates the possibility of including a range of nosologies affecting treatment and clinical manifestations of pathologies belonging to MetS into the MetS cluster The purpose of this work is to determine the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of associated pathological conditions in patients and MetS.A cross-sectional study was conducted. The sample consisted of 158 patients with . The patients underwent a physical examination, including BMI; a blood chemistry test with the determination of the hormonal status (insulin, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone); a 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure (BP); an assessment of heart rate variability; studies showing the presence of gastric reflux (рН-measurement) or its damaging impact (endoscopy); men were tested with the IPSS-QOL questionnaire and underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and ultrasound of the bladder.It is revealed that because of MetS, the occurrence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy reaches 37.5%. Some features of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with MetS are shown. Regurgitation prevails in the structure of complaints. In case of fibrogastroduodenoscopy, an endoscopy-negative form of the disease occurs in 38%. According to the data of daily pH-measurement, when DeMeester score is high, in the supine position, 25% of time accounts for alkaline reflux (рН > 7). It is found out that young men experience the enlargement of prostate volume and size; according to the IPSS questionnaire, the scores correspond to the initial manifestations of hyperplastic diseases of the prostate gland due to insulin resistance and normal level of androgens.The paper demonstrates that the autonomic dysfunction of nervous system (on a par with insulin resistance) is the main link in the development of MetS. This provides the basis for including the mentioned states - cardiac autonomic neuropathy, lower urinary tract symptoms and gastroesophageal reflux disease - into the MetS cluster.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655560>Disease burden and associated risk factors for  among adults in Ethiopia.</a></h2><p> (MetS) and Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are alarmingly increasing in low-income countries. Yet, very limited is known about the prevalence and risk factors associated with MetS in Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult outpatients (N = 325) at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study was conducted in accordance with STEPwise approach of the World Health Organization. MetS was defined using modified National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.The overall prevalence of MetS was 20.3%. Among the 325 participants, 76.9% had at least one MetS components. Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the most common MetS component at 48.6%, followed by elevated blood pressure at 36.3%, and elevated fasting glucose at 32.6%. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 4.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43-12.04), Amhara ethnicity (OR = .36; 95%CI = 1.14-4.88), overweight status (OR = .21; 95%CI = 1.03-4.71), higher income (OR = 3.31; 95%CI = 1.11-9.84) and higher education levels (OR = .19; 95%CI = 1.05-4.59) were risk factors for MetS.The disease burden of MetS among Ethiopians is high, and is associated with age, weight, income, education and ethnicity.

The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, the DIs received a tutorial on the use of human-centered approach in designing mobile health applications. In phase , the DIs were provided a case study for which they designed an app for patients to manage  using a human centered approach. The goal of phase  was to identify the features that were believed to be most important when designing this  app. An initial questionnaire was administered to the DIs to gather information on their socio-demographics, prior training in nutrition, smart phone usage, perceptions about food logs, and calorie intake calculations. Subsequent questionnaires gathered information from the DIs on their preferred diet app components, app features, rankings of the features, and mock representations of the diet app with the selected features.The DIs were enrolled in the supervised practice component of their training to be Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs). Fifty percent of them had previously worked in a nutrition-related field. One-third of them were currently using a nutrition app. The top five features of the proposed diet app which the DIs identified as very important included (I) personalization of the app based on user preferences (80%, n=8); (II) disease specific education tips (90%, n=9); (III) ability to track progress (80%; n=8); (IV) reminders (70%, n=7) and (V) reinforcement based on user feedback (50%, n=5). In translating the identified features into functional requirements, majority of the DIs felt that the five key features identified should incorporate the following components: (I) personalization of the app should comprise information on medical factors, personal information, personal preferences, and recording weights; (II) disease specific educational tips should comprise information on food selections, low sodium options, and recipes for diabetes; (III) tracking progress should comprise features for storing audio files, viewing previous logs and uploading photos into a library; (IV) reminders should comprise daily messages to the users from the app; and (V) reinforcement should comprise provisions to enter motivational messages.Our study lends support to the need for utilizing human-centered design (HCD) approaches in developing e-health dietary apps as well other non-diet related apps. App developers are encouraged to incorporate user characteristics, needs and preferences using a HCD framework that will allow for reproducibility, tailoring, user satisfaction, and effectiveness assessments.2019 mHealth.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be a phenotype of Mets in the liver. Although there have been some reports of the association between NAFLD and light alcohol consumption (LAC), the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC in the subjects with and without fatty liver is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of LAC on Mets-related diseases in individuals with and those without fatty liver. This study included 1,190 men who underwent regular health check-ups and consumed <20 g/day of alcohol. The subjects were divided into two groups, the non-fatty liver group and fatty liver group, and investigated the association between Mets-related diseases and LAC. Fatty liver was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound. The effect of LAC was different between the non-fatty liver and fatty liver groups. In the non-fatty liver group, the odds ratio (OR) for hypertension was 1.73 (1.04-.88; P=0.035). In the fatty liver group, the OR for each Mets-related diseases were as follows: Dyslipidemia, 0.64 (0.44-0.95, P=0.028); impaired glucose tolerance 0.57 (0.37-0.88; P=0.012); chronic kidney disease, 0.58 (0.36-0.94; P=0.029); and Mets by Japanese criteria, 0.63 (0.44-0.92; P=0.016). The influence of LAC on Mets-related diseases differs based on the presence of fatty liver.

The CHADS-VASc score does not account for the MetS components of prehypertension, prediabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Data are limited on the association of MetS with stroke in AF, independent of CHADS-VASc variables. Our aim was to identify MetS components associated with ischemic stroke in participants with AF in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities). Methods- We included 1172 participants with incident AF within 5 years of measurement of MetS components. MetS was defined by ATP criteria and International Diabetes Federation criteria. Incident ischemic stroke was physician adjudicated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of MetS components with stroke. Results- After a median follow-up of 14.8 years, there were 113 ischemic stroke cases. Of the individual MetS components, low HDL was borderline associated with increased stroke risk (hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 0.99-.21]) after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables while the remaining MetS variables were not associated with stroke risk. The presence of ≥3 components of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.91-.11]). The risk of stroke increased by 13% for each additional component of MetS; however, this association was borderline significant (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.99-1.28]). Conclusions- The presence of MetS was not significantly associated with ischemic stroke after adjustment for CHADS-VASc variables.

The principal risk factor for development of  is obesity, defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol--yl)-,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575959>Mitigation of radiation-induced gastro-intestinal injury by the polyphenolic acetate 7, 8-diacetoxy-4-methylthiocoumarin in mice.</a></h2><p>Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) constitutes a crucial clinical element of acute radiation  with life-threatening implications posing challenges in devising effective medical countermeasures. Herein, we report the potential of 7, 8-diacetoxy-4-methylthiocoumarin (DAMTC) to mitigate RIII following total-body irradiation (TBI) in C57BL/6 mice and underlying mechanisms. Administration of DAMTC 24 hours post TBI facilitated structural reconstitution and restoration of functional absorption linked to alleviation of radiation-induced apoptotic death of intestinal crypt progenitor/stem (ICPS) and villus stromal cells through induction of Bcl- family-mediated anti-apoptotic signalling. Reduction in TBI-induced DNA damage accumulation coupled with inhibition of cell cycle arrest through stimulation of anti-p53- and anti-p21-dependent synergistic signalling protected ICPS cells from radiation injury. Enhanced proliferation of crypt stem cells, induction of anti-oxidant defence, subjugation of TBI-induced lipid peroxidation and phenotypic polarization of intestinal macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 class underlie amelioration of RIII. Stimulation of multiple mitigative signalling processes by DAMTC appeared to be associated with enhanced protein acetylation, an important regulator of cellular responses to radiation damage. Our findings establish the mitigative potential of DAMTC against RIII by hyper-acetylation-mediated epigenetic regulation, which triggers axes of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways, enabling proliferation and maintenance of ICPS cells leading to epithelial regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632116> With Aortic Arterial Stiffness And First Hospitalization Or Mortality In Coronary Artery Disease Patients.</a></h2><p> (MetS) and aortic arterial stiffness (AS) are risk factors for future cardiovascular events. We evaluated their roles in first hospitalization or all-cause mortality prediction in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.From January to December 2012, 115 CAD patients were enrolled from a single center and followed up for 5.5 years. The composite endpoint included hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction, revascularization, or heart failure and all-cause mortality. Patients with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity > 10 m/s (measured using applanation tonometry) constituted the high AS group.During a median 54-month follow-up, there were 43 (37.4%) and 11 (9.6%) hospitalization and mortality events, respectively. Overall, 41 (35.7%) and 70 (60.9%) patients were diagnosed with AS and MetS, respectively. CAD patients with high AS had higher diabetes and MetS percentages, were older, and had higher waist circumference and systolic blood pressure (SBP) but lower glomerular filtration rate than those with low AS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed old age ( < 0.001), diabetes ( = 0.003), and high waist circumference ( = 0.044) and SBP ( = 0.007) as independent predictors of AS in CAD patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CAD patients with concurrent MetS and high AS had a higher risk for hospitalization (log rank test,  = 0.005) or developing all-cause mortality (log rank test,  = 0.002). Compared with CAD patients without MetS or AS, composite outcome development risk in those with both the conditions was 10.-fold higher ( < 0.001); this risk was 6.54-fold higher in those with AS alone ( = 0.007).In CAD patients, age, diabetes, and high waist circumference and SBP are the independent predictors of AS. Additionally, CAD patients with AS with and without MetS have a high first hospitalization or all-cause mortality development risk.© 2019 Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651274>A real-world evaluation of a tertiary care childhood obesity intervention to reduce  risk in a hard-to-reach urban population.</a></h2><p>Research on outcomes associated with lifestyle interventions serving pediatric populations in urban settings, where a majority have severe obesity, is scarce. This study assessed whether participation in a lifestyle intervention improved body mass index (BMI) percentile, BMI z-score, blood pressure, and lipid levels for children and adolescents.The Live Light Live Right program is a lifestyle intervention that uses medical assessment, nutritional education, access to physical fitness classes, and behavioral modification to improve health outcomes. Data was analyzed for 144 subjects aged -19 who participated for a minimum of 12 consecutive months between 2002 and 2016. McNemar tests were used to determine differences in the proportion of participants who moved from abnormal values at baseline to normal at follow-up for a given clinical measure. Paired sample t-tests assessed differences in blood pressure and lipid levels. Multiple linear regression assessed the change in blood pressure or lipid levels associated with improvement in BMI% and BMI z-score.The majority were female (62.5%), mean age was 9.6, and 71% were Black. At baseline, 70.1% had severe obesity, systolic hypertension was present in 44, and 13.9% had diastolic hypertension. One-third had abnormally low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at baseline, 35% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 47% had abnormal total cholesterol (TC). The average difference in percentage points of BMI% at follow-up compared was - 3.0 (95% CI: - 5.0, - 1.1; p < 0.003). The mean difference in BMI z-score units at follow-up was - 0.15 (95% CI: - 0., - 0.1; p < 0.0001).

Cystinosis is caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine carrier protein cystinosin. CTNS mutations result in either complete absence or reduced cystine transporting function of the protein. The diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis is generally based on measuring leukocyte cystine level, demonstration of corneal cystine crystals by the slit lamp examination and confirmed by genetic analysis of the CTNS gene.A boy born to consanguineous Caucasian parents had the characteristic clinical features of the infantile nephropathic cystinosis including renal Fanconi  (polydipsia/polyuria,  acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, cystine crystals in the cornea) and elevated WBC cystine levels. Initially we performed RFLP analysis of the common in the Northern European population 57-kb deletion of proband's DNA, then a direct Sanger sequencing which revealed no mutations in the coding part of the CTNS gene. To confirm the diagnosis we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA obtained from patient-derived fibroblasts in combination with cDNA sequencing. This revealed the skipping of exon 4 and exon 5 in the CTNS in our patient. Therefore, we detected a novel 9-kb homozygous deletion in the CTNS gene at genomic DNA level, spanning region from intron 3 to intron 5.

Both parents were found to be heterozygous carriers of the CTNS mutation.Analysis of CTNS gene transcript allowed to identify a large homozygous deletion in the patient with infantile nephropathic cystinosis.

Polygenic predisposition and complicated epigenetic regulations are the upstream factors to elicit its development. Mitochondrial dysfunction-provoked oxidative stress may also play a crucial role in it. Classical epigenetic regulations of gene expression may include DNA methylation/acetylation and histone modification. Recent investigations have revealed that intracellular and extracellular (exosomal) noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), are the key molecules for post-transcriptional regulation of messenger (m)RNA expression. Oxidative and nitrosative stresses originating from mitochondrial dysfunctions could become the pathological biosignatures for increased cell apoptosis/necrosis, nonhyperglycemic , multiple neoantigen formation, and immune dysregulation in patients with SLE. Recently, many authors noted that the cross-talk between oxidative stress and ncRNAs can trigger and perpetuate autoimmune reactions in patients with SLE. Intracellular interactions between miR and lncRNAs as well as extracellular exosomal ncRNA communication to and fro between remote cells/tissues via plasma or other body fluids also occur in the body. The urinary exosomal ncRNAs can now represent biosignatures for lupus nephritis. Herein, we'll briefly review and discuss the cross-talk between excessive oxidative/nitrosative stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues/cells and ncRNAs, as well as the prospect of antioxidant therapy in patients with SLE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675274>Relevant Features in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Determined Using Machine Learning for Feature Selection.</a></h2><p> We investigated the prevalence and the most relevant features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, (NAFLD) in which the inflammation of hepatocytes can lead to increased cardiovascular risk, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplant.  We analyzed data from 2239 hypertensive patients using descriptive statistics and supervised machine learning algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest classifier, to select the most relevant features of NASH.  The prevalence of NASH among our hypertensive patients was 11.3%. In univariate analyses, it was associated with , type  diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Ferritin and serum insulin were the most relevant features in the final model, with a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 79%, and area under the curve of 0.79.  Ferritin and insulin are significant predictors of NASH. Clinicians may use these to better assess cardiovascular risk and provide better management to hypertensive patients with NASH.

Intrauterine growth-restricted fetuses (intrauterine growth restriction [IUGR]) have a higher risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension in adulthood. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by hyperproliferation, invasive migration, and disordered angiogenesis, is a hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis. Growing evidence suggests that intergenerational transmission of disease, including , can be induced by IUGR. Epigenetic modification of the paternal germline is implicated in this transmission. However, it is unclear whether offspring of individuals born with IUGR are also at risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Using a model of maternal caloric restriction to induce IUGR, we found that first and second generations of IUGR exhibited elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, myocardial, and vascular remodeling after prolonged exposure to hypoxia. Primary pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (PVECs) from both first and second generations of IUGR exhibited greater proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Moreover, in  generations, PVECs-derived ET-1 (endothelin-1) was activated by IUGR and hypoxia, and its knockdown mitigated PVECs dysregulation. Most interestingly, within ET-1 first intron, reduced DNA methylation and enhanced tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 were observed in PVECs and sperm of first generation of IUGR, with DNA demethylation in PVECs of second generation of IUGR. These results suggest that IUGR permanently altered epigenetic signatures of ET-1 from the sperm and PVECs in the first generation, which was subsequently transferred to PVECs of offspring. This mechanism would yield  generations with endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension-like pathophysiological features in adulthood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617618>Immunoreactive insulin stability in horses at risk of insulin dysregulation.</a></h2><p>Diseases associated with insulin dysregulation (ID), such as equine  and pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction, are of interest to practitioners because of their association with laminitis. Accurate insulin concentration assessment is critical in diagnosing and managing these diseases.To determine the effect of time, temperature, and collection tube type on insulin concentrations in horses at risk of ID.Eight adult horses with body condition score >6/9.In this prospective study, subjects underwent an infeed oral glucose test  hours before blood collection. Blood samples were divided into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, heparinized, or serum tubes and stored at 4 or 20°C. Tubes were centrifuged and analyzed for insulin by a chemiluminescent assay over 8 days. Changes in insulin concentrations were compared with a linear mixed effects model.An overall effect of time, tube type and temperature was identified (P = .01, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). Serum and heparinized samples had similar concentrations for 3 days at 20°C and 8 days at 4°C; however, after 3 days at 20°C, heparinized samples had significantly higher insulin concentrations (P = .004, P = .03, and P = .03 on consecutive days). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid samples had significantly lower insulin concentrations regardless of time and temperature (P = .001 for all comparisons).These results suggest an ideal protocol to determine insulin concentrations involves using serum or heparinized samples with analysis occurring within 3 days at 20°C or 8 days at 4°C.© 2019 The Authors.

We assessed whether  (MetS) severity would remain linked to future CHD and diabetes even when assessed from non-fasting samples.Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were assessed at 4 visits and followed for 20-years of adjudicated CHD outcomes. We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year diabetes outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (≥8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51). MetS-Z at Visit-1 also remained linked to future diabetes when measured from non-fasting samples, with odds ratio for fasting MetS-Z 3.10 (CI .88, 3.35) and for non-fasting 1.92 (CI 1.05, 3.51).MetS-Z remained linked to future CHD and diabetes when assessed from non-fasting samples. A score such as this may allow for identification of at-risk individuals and serve as a motivation toward interventions to reduce risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

We formulated a subphenotyping schema and compared long-term mortality risk among the HF subphenotypes in the community-based Framingham Study.In hierarchical order, we grouped participants with new-onset HF (stratified by HF with reduced [HFrEF] vs. preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) according to the presence of: (1) coronary heart disease (CHD), ()  (MetS), (3) hypertension, and (4) 'other' causes. Age at HF onset was lowest in people with the MetS (mean 76 vs. 77 years for HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively) and highest in those with hypertension only (mean 82 and 85 years for HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). For HFrEF, 10-year cumulative mortality and hazards ratios [HR] were 87% for CHD (n = 219; referent group), 88% for MetS (n = 105; HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.73-1.23]), 82% for hypertension (n = 104; HR 0.71 [0.55-0.91]), and 78% for other (n = 37; HR 0.81 [0.55-1.19]).

However, few studies have examined the impact of MetS on the postoperative complications of colorectal cancer and the conclusions remain controversial. The present study aimed to investigate whether MetS, as defined based on visceral fat area (VFA) instead of BMI or waist circumference, would predict complications after surgery for rectal cancer.We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for rectal cancer at our department between January 2013 and August 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses evaluating the risk factors for postoperative complications were performed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the gender-specific cut-off values for VFA.A total of 381 patients were included in the study. The optimal cut-off values for VFA were 117.9 cm for men and 76.9 cm for women, and 153 patients were diagnosed as having MetS. The rate of postoperative complication was significantly higher in the MetS group than that in the non-MetS group (34.6% versus 15.8%, P < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MetS (OR 3.712, P < 0.001), NRS 2002 scores ≥ 3 (OR .563, P = 0.001), and tumor located at the lower 1/3 (OR 3.290, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for complications after surgery for rectal cancer., as defined based on parameters including visceral fat area, was an independent risk factor for complications after surgery for rectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640630>Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels in newborn screened infants with an inconclusive diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) not only identifies infants with a diagnosis of CF, but also those with an uncertain diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), i.e. CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-related  (CRMS) or CF screen positive inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID). These infants have an uncertain long-term outcome and it is currently unclear around time of diagnosis, which infants are at higher risk of later fulfilling a CF diagnosis. In this study, we hypothesised that immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, used in NBS as a marker of pancreatic disease and function, may reflect the degree of CFTR dysfunction in each individual and therefore would help to identify those with CRMS/CSPID who are later at risk for meeting the criteria of CF.In this longitudinal, prospective study, infants with CRMS/CFSPID and CF were recruited and followed in 9 CF clinics (Canada and Italy). We compared NBS IRT levels between CF and CRMS/CFSPID, and between children with CRMS/CFSPID→CF and CRMS/CFSPID→CRMS/CFSPID during the period of June 2007 to April 2016.Ninety eight CRMS/CFSPID and 120 CF subjects were enrolled. During the study period, 14 (14.3%) CRMS/CFSPID subjects fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CF (CRMS/CFSPID→CF), while the diagnosis remained uncertain (CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID) in 84 (85.7%) subjects. Significantly higher NBS IRT concentrations (ng/ml) were present in CF than CRMS/CFPSID (median (interquartile range): 143.8 (99.8-206.) vs. 75.0 (61.0-105.9); P < 0.0001). Infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF (n = 14) had significantly higher NBS IRT concentrations (ng/ml) than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID (n = 83) (median (interquartile range): 108.9 (72.3-126.8) vs. 73.7(60.0-96.0); P = 0.02).Amongst infants who tested positive on NBS for CF, there is a gradation of elevated NBS IRT concentrations. Infants with CF have higher NBS IRT levels than CRMS/CFPSID, and higher NBS IRT concentrations were present in infants with CRMS/CFSPID→CF than CRMS/CFSPID→ CRMS/CFSPID.

Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem  disorder who inherited two copies of chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKM) gene, and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) gene (both on chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in glycolysis and is linked to Tarui . The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM, revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1 while levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease, and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646122>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: implications for cardiovascular risk.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic in the USA affecting ∼30% of the population.

Oestrogen injections induced FLHS, but the incidence and severity of the condition was increased with a combination of E & LPS. Hepatic mRNA levels of the genes encoding key regulators of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were evaluated. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in hepatocytes of all treated groups (E, LPS and E & LPS hens) was elevated from 6 to 56 fold (< 0.01), when compared to baseline and control values, with the highest fold change at 3 h post-treatment. The mRNA levels for IL-1β were better expressed at 24 h post-treatments with E, LPS and E & LPS. The expression of IL-18 mRNA in the liver tissue was lower than IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in all treated birds. At 24 h post-treatments, total white blood cell (WBC) counts and fibrinogen levels were elevated (< 0.05) in E, LPS and E & LPS treated hens. Histologically, livers of hens from E and E & LPS treated groups revealed inflammatory alterations with areas showing mononuclear aggregations, vacuolar fatty degeneration of hepatocytes, and increased sinusoidal congestion and haemorrhages. It was concluded that liver lipid accumulation and injury were associated with incidences of local (hepatic) and systemic inflammation, which could have initiated liver blood vessel and capsule rupture and subsequently the onset of FLHS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607354>Exercise on bipolar disorder in humans.</a></h2><p>People with Bipolar disorder (BD) often have a sedentary lifestyle and low level of physical activity which in part contribute to the high co-occurrence of medical diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, etc. Exercise especially aerobic exercise may be beneficial not only to mental health but also physical health outcomes.

This may be due to the lack of a definitive animal model of disease, which limits our understanding of obesity-induced renal damage. We evaluated the changes in renal histology and lipid deposits induced by obesity in a model of insulin resistance: the Iberian swine fed with fat-enriched food.Twenty-eight female sows were randomized to standard (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD: 6.8% of saturated fat) for 100 days.

Renal histology and lipid deposits in renal tissue were analyzed.Animals on HFD developed obesity, hypertension, high levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance, and glomerular hyperfiltration. No animal developed overt diabetes.

Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type , and the . We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD. Genetic studies support that NAFLD may drive asCVD through mixed hyperlipidemia. Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction. Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and MetS in non-diabetic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) women.Cross-sectional analyses of the relationship between concentrations of 25(OH)D, MetS, and its components were made in 160 non-diabetic SLE women. MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were categorized into quartiles (<16.6, 16.6-21.1, 21.-26.3, ≥26.4 ng/mL).A total of 79 (49.3%) SLE women had MetS. Without adjusting for body mass index (BMI) or smoking, the odds of having MetS decreased according to increasing quartiles of 25(OH)D concentrations (P for trend = .03). The odds ratio (OR) of having MetS was 0.4 (95% confidence interval: 0.-0.9, P = .04) for the highest vs the lowest quartile of 25(OH)D concentrations when adjusted by age. The crude OR of having elevated hypertriglyceridemia decreased according to increasing quartiles of 25(OH)D concentrations (P for trend = .036). However, further adjustments for BMI and smoking removed the inverse association between 25(OH)D concentrations and MetS and its individual components.In non-diabetic SLE women with mild activity, 25(OH)D concentrations are not associated with MetS and its components.© 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581955>Impact of Ramadan Diurnal Intermittent Fasting on  Components in Healthy, Non-Athletic Muslim People Aged Over 15 Years: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Studies on the impact of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on  (MetS) components among healthy Muslims observing Ramadan month have yielded contradictory results. This comprehensive meta-analysis aimed to obtain a more stable estimate of the effect size of fasting during Ramadan on MetS components, examine variability among studies, assess the generalizability of reported results, and perform subgroup analyses for associated factors. We searched the CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, ProQuest Medical, PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published from 1950 to March, 2019. The MetS components analyzed were: waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma/serum glucose (FG), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

This study aimed to determine the effect of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG)-induced weight loss on Lp(a) levels in obese individuals.Patients submitted to VSG from January 2011 to July 2015 were included. Anthropometric and  parameters were recorded before and 12 months after surgery. Univariate analysis identified associations between Lp(a) and anthropometry and  parameters, and the logistic regression predictors of Lp(a) decrease after VSG.MetS was present in 47% of the 330 patients involved. Patients with MetS had higher body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride levels and were more insulin-resistant. No differences were found between groups respecting Lp(a) levels prior to surgery (15. mg/dL vs. 15.0 mg/dL, p = 0.795). After surgery, patients without MetS had a decrease in Lp(a) levels (14.7 mg/dL vs. 12.3 mg/dL, p = 0.006), while MetS patients showed no differences (13.9 mg/dL vs. 14.6 mg/dL, p = 0.302). The regression model evidenced that older age and Δ HDL-c were predictors of Lp(a) decrease, whereas the greater the number of MetS components and lower estimated BF% loss, the lesser odds of decreasing Lp(a) after surgery.Despite a global improvement of conventional CVD risk factors, only individuals without MetS showed a decrease of Lp(a) levels after VSG. Further studies should explore not only the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the absence of decrease of Lp(a) levels in MetS patients, but also its impact on the  beneficial changes usually observed after VSG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638560>Review of SRD5A3 Disease-Causing Sequence Variants and Ocular Findings in Steroid 5α-Reductase Type 3 Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, and a Detailed New Case.</a></h2><p>Steroid 5α-reductase type 3 congenital disorder of glycosylation (SRD5A3-CDG) is a severe  disease manifesting as muscle hypotonia, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxia and ocular symptoms; typically, nystagmus and optic disc pallor.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with  who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity have yet to deliver desired outcomes, thus introducing a pressing need for molecular- and cellular-based therapies. Excess energy from food is stored in the form of triglycerides in white adipose tissue, which expands during weight gain and can lead to insulin resistance and T2D. By contrast, brown adipose tissue (BAT) releases energy from  substrates in the form of heat and secretes factors that can reverse  disease by acting systemically. Therefore, the ability to increase BAT activity is a promising approach to improve energy balance and  homeostasis. Methods are now being developed to generate brown adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which would (1) provide an unlimited source of cellular material to study human brown adipogenesis, and () could be used to develop drug- and cell-based therapies for the treatment of  complications associated with obesity.

Obesity occurs when dietary energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and has arisen in many societies due to an increasingly "obesogenic" environment in which physical activity has declined and yet children continue to be exposed to unhealthy, energy-dense diets. Additional risks for the development of obesity also include psychological issues and genetic factors. Obesity has many adverse health consequences including development of insulin resistance, Type  diabetes, and the .

These factors encourage inaccurate diagnosis with both under and overdiagnosis. This unfavorable diagnostic experience exasperates affected women and limits timely opportunities for intervention to minimize associated comorbidities, especially during the transition from pediatric to adult care. Recognition of these issues in the care of adolescents and women with PCOS inspired the development of the International Evidence-Based PCOS Guidelines, which emphasize the prevention, screening, and treatment of PCOS across the reproductive lifespan. The Guidelines and accompanying meta-analyses focus on three major categories of associated comorbidities: (1) reproductive; () ; and (3) psychological. With the exception of infertility, this article considers common manifestations and comorbidities associated with PCOS throughout the lifecycle. Healthy lifestyle interventions with prevention of excess weight gain comprise the primary intervention for all comorbidities. Hence, early identification of girls "at risk" for PCOS and those with PCOS is a priority.

Gut microbiome diversity and its natural fermentation products are not only correlated with MS and CAD, but their correlations also appear to be stronger than the associations with traditional risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a new potential pathway for the natural fermentation product butyrate to improve MS and to examine whether it is associated with serum  profiles and gut flora composition.  C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with 400 mg/kg of sodium butyrate for 16 weeks. Blood and fecal samples were collected, and the metabolite concentrations and 16s rRNA were measured with liquid chromatography-MS and Illumina platform, respectively. The plasma differential metabolites and gut microbiome composition were analyzed with XCMS online and QIIME , respectively.  Gut microbiome-derived butyrate reduced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, resisting HFD-induced increase in the relative abundance of f_, f_, and f_. Meanwhile, sodium butyrate increased the levels of α-linolenate, all-trans-retinal, resolvin E1, and leukotriene in the plasma, and the differential pathways showed enrichment in mainly resolvin E biosynthesis, histidine degradation, lipoxin biosynthesis, and leukotriene biosynthesis. Moreover, sodium butyrate increased the levels of phosphorylated-adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and facilitated glucose transporter member 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue.  Butyrate can induce AMPK activation and GLUT4 expression in the adipose tissue, improving cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related  disorder, resisting HFD-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis, and promoting resolvin E1 and lipoxin biosynthesis. Oral supplement of the natural fermentation product butyrate can be a potential strategy for preventing CVD.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Lv, Long, Chen, He, Ruan and Zhu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658741>Sphingolipid Metabolism Perturbations in Rett .</a></h2><p>Rett  is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly females and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the  gene that encoded the methyl-CpG-binding protein .

This study was aimed at investigating predictors and correlates of MBPS in diabetes. In a cross-sectional study including 167 patients with diabetes (age 58.5 ± 11.1 years, duration 15.9 ± 12.1 years), clinical variables, diabetic and neuropathic complications, and MBPS (using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) were measured. The upper quartile of MBPS (>30.5 mmHg) was associated with higher values of waist circumference (P = 0.027), triglycerides (P = 0.021), and Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (P = 0.042), with lower HDL cholesterol (P = 0.030), and with the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) (P = 0.016) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (P < 0.0001). In a logistic regression analysis, PVD (odds ratio: 10., P = 0.001), CAN (odds ratio: 6.09, P = 0.016), and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (odds ratio: 1.06, P = 0.022) predicted MBPS upper quartile (r = 0.20, P = 0.0005). In a multiple regression analysis, PVD (P = 0.002) and diastolic BP (P = 0.003) were the only determinants of MBPS (r = 0.20).

The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of using glutamate level to identify individuals with abdominal obesity and a high cardiometabolic risk.The study sample included 99 men and 99 women. Fasting serum glutamate was measured using the Biocrates p180 kit. Anthropometric and  variables were used to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (WC ≥ 95 cm in both sexes), the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype and the  (MetS). Mean (±SD) age was 34.1 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI was 29.0 ± 6. kg/m and mean WC was 92.7 ± 16.5 cm. Glutamate was strongly correlated with WC (r = 0.66 for men; r = 0.76 for women, both p < 0.0001) and multiple markers of  dysfunction, particularly fasting triglyceride level (r = 0.59 for men; r = 0.57 for women, both p < 0.0001), HDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.45, p < 0.0001 in both sexes) and the HOMA-IR index (r = 0.65 for men; r = 0.60 for women, both p < 0.0001). Logistic regressions showed that glutamate had an excellent accuracy to identify individuals with abdominal obesity (ROC_AUC: 0.90 for both sexes), a good accuracy to identify those with the HTW phenotype (ROC_AUC: 0.82 for men; 0.85 for women) and fair-to-good accuracy for the MetS (ROC_AUC: 0.78 for men; 0.89 for women).Glutamate level may represent an interesting potential biomarker of abdominal obesity and  risk.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Unregulated levels of IGFs/IGFBPs have been associated with the development of glucose intolerance and  X (MSx). We hypothesized that change of IGFs/IGFBPs levels could increase the risk of MSx; thus, this study aimed to evaluate the serostatus of IGFs/IGFBPs in individuals with MSx.After adjustment for  parameters, MSx patients had a lower level of IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP- compared with subjects in the control group. Further analysis revealed a positive correlation between serum levels of IGF-1 and IGF- (p < 0.05), as well as serum IGFBP-3 and IGF- (p < 0.05). Also, the statistical analysis showed a negative association of serum IGF-1 with plasma glucose and total cholesterol levels (p < 0.05). Besides, a negative relationship was found between serum concentrations of IGF-1/IGF- and the risk of developing MSx. These data indicated that some components of IGFs/IGFBPs are linked with the pathogenesis of MSx. In conclusion, these inverse associations showed a possible linkage between the IGF/IGFBP signaling pathway and the development of MSx. It seems the decreased concentrations of IGFs edmay be regarded as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis or even prognosis of MSx but need more systematic studies to confirmed it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662026>Adapting a Prediction Rule for  Risk Assessment Suitable for Developing Countries.</a></h2><p>  (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic disturbances that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type  diabetes mellitus (DM). The early identification of high-risk individuals is the key for halting these conditions. The world is facing a growing epidemic MetS although the magnitude in Egypt is unknown.  To describe MetS and its determinants among apparently healthy individuals residing in urban and rural communities in Egypt and to establish a model for MetS prediction.  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 270 adults from rural and urban districts in Alexandria, Egypt. Participants were clinically evaluated and interviewed for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary habits. MetS was defined according to the harmonized criteria set by the AHA/NHLBI. The risk of ischemic heart diseases (IHDs), DM and fatty liver were assessed using validated risk prediction charts. A multiple risk model for predicting MetS was developed, and its performance was compared.  In total, 57.8% of the study population met the criteria for MetS and were at high risk for developing IHD, DM, and fatty liver. Silent CVD risk factors were identified in 20.4% of the participants. In our proposed multivariate logistic regression model, the predictors of MetS were obesity [OR (95% CI) = 16.3 (6.03-44.0)], morbid obesity [OR (95% CI) = 21.7 (5.3-88.0)], not working [OR (95% CI) = .05 (1.1-3.8)], and having a family history of chronic diseases [OR (95% CI) = 4.38 (.23-8.61)]. Consumption of caffeine once per week protected against MetS by 27.8-fold. The derived prediction rule was accurate in predicting MetS, fatty liver, high risk of DM, and, to a lesser extent, a 10-year lifetime risk of IHD.  Central obesity and sedentary lifestyles are accountable for the rising rates of MetS in our society. Interventions are needed to minimize the potential predisposition of the Egyptian population to cardiometabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667162>Use of Homeostatic Model Assessment Indexes for the Identification of  and Insulin Resistance among Cuban-Americans: A Cross Sectional Study.</a></h2><p>to determine cut off points for The Homeostatic Model Assessment Index 1 and  (HOMA-1 and HOMA-) for identifying insulin resistance and  among a Cuban-American population.Cross sectional.Florida International University, Robert Stempel School of Public Health and Social Work, Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, Miami, FL from July 2010 to December 2011.Subjects without diabetes residing in South Florida were enrolled (N=146, aged 37 to 83 years).

The independent impact of HPD on recurrence patterns has not been well defined.The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) was used to quantify HPD including steatosis and fibrosis for all patients with completely resected CRLM between April 2003 and March 2007. Clinicopathologic factors, perioperative history, and outcomes were compared with the NAS. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the association between severe HPD (NAS ≥ 3) with clinical and perioperative characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS). The cumulative incidences of recurrence [any intrahepatic recurrence (IHR), extrahepatic recurrence only (EHR), and death without recurrence (DWR)] were estimated using competing risks methods.Among the 357 patients included in this study, microsteatosis was noted in 124 (35%) patients, severe HPD in 31 (9%), steatohepatitis in 14 (4%), and sinusoidal injury in 36 (10%). After median follow-up of 127 months (range 4-175 months), 10-year RFS was 22% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17-27%]. Ten-year cumulative incidence for IHR, EHR, and DWR was 37%, 30%, and 12%, respectively. After controlling for confounders, NAS ≥ 3 was independently associated with higher risk of IHR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-.90, p = 0.027] and lower risk of EHR (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.75, p = 0.019) on multivariable analysis.Severe HPD was associated with increased IHR risk and decreased EHR risk.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of ED and evaluate the associated risk factors in a cohort of 254 young (18-49 years) nondiabetic obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg m) men from primary care. Erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-5] questionnaire), quality of life (Aging Males' Symptoms [AMS scale]), and body composition analysis (Tanita MC-180MA) were determined. Total testosterone was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the factors associated with ED. ED prevalence was 42.1%. Subjects with ED presented higher BMI, waist circumference, number of components of the , AMS score, insulin resistance, and a more unfavorable body composition than those without ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a pathological AMS score (odds ratio [OR]: 4.238, P < 0.001), degree of obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg m, OR: .602, P = 0.005, compared with BMI 30-34.9 kg m), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (OR: 0.956, P = 0.004), and age (OR: 1.047, P = 0.016) were factors independently associated with ED. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, in a primary care-based cohort of nondiabetic young obese men, ED affected >40% of subjects. A pathological AMS score, the degree of obesity, and age were positively associated with ED, while elevated HDL-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of presenting ED.

Their anthropometric measurements and fasting blood samples were collected for evaluation of MetS. The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed with a Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) , scored using dietary data collected from a food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, education, smoking, physical activity and energy intake, was used to establish the association between DII and MetS.MetS prevalence was 25% and was significantly associated with a pro-inflammatory diet [mean (SD) 3.28 (1.45); P < 0.01]. The pro-inflammatory diet was statistically associated with women, university degree, moderate physical activity, snacking between meals, central obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, MetS prevalence and lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet.

Lipidomic data were then analyzed using various statistical and bioinformatics tools, which detected numerous lipid species altered by the treatments, and consistently demonstrated interactions between the gut microbiota and the HNaLK diet in altering circulating lipids, mainly triglycerides (TGs). We identified two distinct TG groups, differentially regulated by antibiotic treatment. One group (cluster 1), representing the majority of TG species detected, was downregulated, whereas the other group (cluster ) was upregulated by antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, cluster  TGs were also regulated by the diet. Cluster  TGs exhibited greater carbon-chain length and double-bond content and included TGs composed of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, previously associated with reduced diabetes risk.The HNaLK diet interacts with gut bacteria to alter plasma lipid profiles, which may be related to its health effects.

Over the last 15 years, data have begun to emerge from human and more frequently, mouse studies, that support the idea that parasitic worm infection can protect against this condition. We have therefore investigated the potential of two synthetic small molecule analogues (SMAs) of the anti-inflammatory Acanthocheilonema viteae product ES-62, to protect against  dysfunction in a C57BL/6 J mouse model of high calorie-induced obesity. We found weekly subcutaneous administration of the SMAs in combination (1 μg of each), starting one week before continuous exposure to high calorie diet (HCD), decreased fasting glucose levels and reversed the impaired glucose clearance observed in male mice, when measured at approximately 7 and 13 weeks after exposure to HCD. Fasting glucose levels were also improved in male mice fed a HCD for some 38 weeks when given SMA-treatment 13 weeks after the start of HCD, indicating an SMA-therapeutic potential. For the most part, protective effects were not observed in female mice. SMA treatment also conferred protection against each of reduced ileum villus length and liver fibrosis, but more prominently in female mice. Previous studies in mice indicate that protection against  dysfunction is usually associated with polarisation of the immune system towards a type-/anti-inflammatory direction but our attempts to correlate improved  parameters with such changes were unsuccessful. Further analysis will therefore be required to define mechanism of action. Nevertheless, overall our data clearly show the potential of the drug-like SMAs as a preventative or treatment for  dysregulation associated with obesity.Copyright © 2019.

Our highly personalised and measurement-based care model includes three core concepts: ▶ A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework that includes: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviour; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶ Clinical stage. ▶ Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on proposed pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). The model explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within this highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care as well as utilisation of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality, mental health care for young people. CHAPTER 1: MULTIDIMENSIONAL OUTCOMES IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CARE: WHAT MATTERS AND WHY?: Mood and psychotic syndromes present one of the most serious public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. Factors including prevalence, age of onset, and chronicity contribute to substantial burden and secondary risks such as alcohol or other substance misuse. Mood and psychotic syndromes most often emerge during adolescence and young adulthood, a period characterised by major physical and social change; thus, effects can have long term consequences. We propose five key domains which make up a multidimensional outcomes framework that aims to address the specific needs of young people presenting to health services with emerging mental illness. These include social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Impairment and concurrent morbidity are well established in young people by the time they present for mental health care. Despite this, services and health professionals tend to focus on only one aspect of the presentation - illness type, stage and trajectory - and are often at odds with the preferences of young people and their families. There is a need to address the disconnect between mental health, physical health and social services and interventions, to ensure that youth mental health care focuses on the outcomes that matter to young people. CHAPTER : COMBINING CLINICAL STAGE AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS TO UNDERSTAND ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EMERGING MOOD AND PSYCHOTIC SYNDROMES: Traditional diagnostic classification systems for mental disorders map poorly onto the early stages of illness experienced by young people, and purport categorical distinctions that are not readily supported by research into genetic, environmental and neurobiological risk factors. Consequently, a key clinical challenge in youth mental health is to develop and test new classification systems that align with current evidence on comorbid presentations, are consistent with current understanding of underlying neurobiology, and provide utility for predicting outcomes and guiding decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care. This chapter outlines a transdiagnostic framework for classifying common adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, combining two independent but complementary dimensions: clinical staging, and three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical staging reflects the progression of mental disorders and is in line with the concept used in general medicine, where more advanced stages are associated with a poorer prognosis and a need for more intensive interventions with a higher risk-to-benefit ratio. The three proposed pathophysiological mechanisms are neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hyperarousal and circadian dysfunction, which, over time, have illness trajectories (or pathways) to psychosis, anxious depression and bipolar spectrum disorders, respectively. The transdiagnostic framework has been evaluated in young people presenting to youth mental health clinics of the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, alongside a range of clinical and objective measures. Our research to date provides support for this framework, and we are now exploring its application to the development of more personalised models of care. CHAPTER 3: A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: GUIDING HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES: There is an urgent need for improved care for young people with mental health problems, in particular those with subthreshold mental disorders that are not sufficiently severe to meet traditional diagnostic criteria. New comprehensive assessment frameworks are needed to capture the biopsychosocial profile of a young person to drive highly personalised and measurement-based mental health care. We present a range of multidimensional measures involving five key domains: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness type, stage and trajectory. Objective measures include: neuropsychological function; sleep-wake behaviours and circadian rhythms;  and immune markers; and brain structure and function. The recommended multidimensional measures facilitate the development of a comprehensive clinical picture. The objective measures help to further develop informative and novel insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and illness trajectories to guide personalised care plans. A panel of specific multidimensional and objective measures are recommended as standard clinical practice, while others are recommended secondarily to provide deeper insights with the aim of revealing alternative clinical paths for targeted interventions and treatments matched to the clinical stage and proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of the young person. CHAPTER 4: PERSONALISING CARE OPTIONS IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT, CLINICAL STAGE, PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, AND INDIVIDUAL ILLNESS TRAJECTORIES TO GUIDE TREATMENT SELECTION: New models of mental health care for young people require that interventions be matched to illness type, clinical stage, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and individual illness trajectories. Narrow -focused classifications often direct clinical attention away from other key factors such as functional impairment, self-harm and suicidality, alcohol or other substance misuse, and poor physical health. By contrast, we outline a treatment selection guide for early intervention for adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes (ie, active treatments and indicated and more specific secondary prevention strategies). This guide is based on experiences with the Brain and Mind Centre's highly personalised and measurement-based care model to manage youth mental health. The model incorporates three complementary core concepts: ▶A multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework including: social and occupational function; self-harm, suicidal thoughts and behaviours; alcohol or other substance misuse; physical health; and illness trajectory. ▶Clinical stage. ▶Three common illness subtypes (psychosis, anxious depression, bipolar spectrum) based on three underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (neurodevelopmental, hyperarousal, circadian). These core concepts are not mutually exclusive and together may facilitate improved outcomes through a clinical stage-appropriate and transdiagnostic framework that helps guide decisions regarding the provision of appropriate and effective care options. Given its emphasis on adolescent-onset mood and psychotic syndromes, the Brain and Mind Centre's model of care also respects a fundamental developmental perspective - categorising childhood problems (eg, anxiety and neurodevelopmental difficulties) as risk factors and respecting the fact that young people are in a period of major biological and social transition. Based on these factors, a range of social, psychological and pharmacological interventions are recommended, with an emphasis on balancing the personal benefit-to-cost ratio. CHAPTER 5: A SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL TO SUPPORT HIGHLY PERSONALISED AND MEASUREMENT-BASED CARE IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH: Over the past decade, we have seen a growing focus on creating mental health service delivery models that better meet the unique needs of young Australians. Recent policy directives from the Australian Government recommend the adoption of stepped-care services to improve the appropriateness of care, determined by severity of need. Here, we propose that a highly personalised approach enhances stepped-care models by incorporating clinical staging and a young person's current and multidimensional needs. It explicitly aims to prevent progression to more complex and severe forms of illness and is better aligned to contemporary models of the patterns of emergence of psychopathology. Inherent within a highly personalised approach is the incorporation of other evidence-based processes, including real-time measurement-based care and use of multidisciplinary teams of health professionals. Data-driven local system modelling and personalised health information technologies provide crucial infrastructure support to these processes for better access to, and higher quality of, mental health care for young people.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624504>Association between  and the incidence of gastric cancer: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h2><p>Previous studies investigating the association between  (MetS) and incidence of gastric cancer (GC) showed inconsistent results. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of MetS on GC risk in a meta-analysis.Cohort studies that evaluating the association between MetS and GC were identified via systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Pooled analyses were performed via a random-effect model or a fixed effect model according to the heterogeneity among the studies. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate whether gender or ethnic group of the patients affected the results.Overall, eight cohort studies with 8,745,671 participants were included, and 37,245 GC cases occurred during follow-up. Results showed that MetS defined by the revised National Cholesterol Education Program's Adults Treatment Panel III criteria was not associated with a significantly affected GC risk (adjusted risk ratio [RR]: 1.03, p = 0.59; I = 79%). Subgroup analyses showed that MetS was not associated with a significantly affected risk of GC in male or female patients, and in Asians or Caucasians. Moreover, meta-analysis of four datasets showed that MetS defined by the International Diabetes Federation criteria was also not associated with a significant affected risk of GC (adjusted RR: 0.80, p = 0.05; I = 0%).These results indicated that current evidence from epidemiological studies does not support that patients with MetS are at higher risk for the development of GC.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604171>Visceral adipose tissue volume is associated with premature atherosclerosis in early type  diabetes mellitus independent of traditional risk factors.</a></h2><p>Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is commonly associated with abdominal obesity, predominantly with high visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and is accompanied by premature atherosclerosis. However, the association between VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with premature atherosclerosis and (i.e. arterial) inflammation is not completely understood. To provide more insight into this association, we investigated the association between arterial F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake, as a measure of arterial inflammation, and  (MetS) markers in early T2DM patients.Forty-four patients with early T2DM, without glucose lowering medication, were studied (median age 63 [IQR 54-66] years, median BMI 30.4 [IQR 27.5-35.8]). Arterial inflammation was quantified using glucose corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) FDG of the aorta, carotid, iliac, and femoral arteries, and corrected for background activity (blood pool) as target-to-background ratio (TBR). VAT and SAT volumes (cm) were automatically segmented using computed tomography (CT) between levels L1-L5. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was assessed by liver function test and CT.VAT volume, but not SAT volume, correlated with TBR (r = 0.325, p = 0.031). Linear regression models showed a significant association, even after sequential adjustment for potentially influencing MetS components. Interaction term VAT volume * sex and additional components including HbA1c, insulin resistance, NAFLD, adiponectin, leptin, and C- reactive protein (CRP) did not change the independent association between VAT volume and TBR.CT-assessed VAT volume is positively associated with FDG-PET assessed arterial inflammation, independently of factors thought to potentially mediate these effects. These findings suggest that VAT in contrast to SAT is linked to early atherosclerotic changes in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although hepatitis B and C viral infections are still the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the liver transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with obesity, type  diabetes, dyslipidemia, and . The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase  or 3 clinical trials. Here, pharmacologic therapies in clinical trials, as well as the basic principles of drug therapy, will be reviewed, focusing on pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608617>Ovarian  activity in Dehydroepiandrosterone-Induced Polycystic Ovary in Wistar rats Treated with Aspirin.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) represents 75% of the cases of anovulatory infertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of aspirin on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - induced polycystic ovary  in Wistar rats.Twenty eight (28) pre-pubertal female Wistar rats of 21 days old weighing 16 - 21 g were divided into 4 groups (7 rats/group) and treated as follows; group I received distilled water and served as Control; Group II received 6 mg/100 g body weight DHEA in 0. ml of oil subcutaneously to induce PCOS. Group III received 7.5 mg/kg of aspirin orally; Group IV received 6 mg/100kg of body weight of DHEA in 0.2ml of oil subcutaneously and 7.5 mg/kg of aspirin orally. After 15 days of administration, the rats were slaughtered by cervical dislocation. Blood samples and ovaries were collected for reproductive hormonal analysis, biochemical and histopathological analysis. The expressions of mRNA androgen receptor (AR) gene in the ovary were determined by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All the data was analyzed using one way ANOVA with the Graph pad prism software version 6. A p<0.05 was considered significant.The results obtained showed that dehydroepiandrosterone treatment caused significant decrease (p<0.05) in total protein, superoxide Dismutase (SOD), glutathione-s- transferase (GST), Ca ATPase, and significant increase (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor and estrogen as compared to Controls. The group co-administered with DHEA and aspirin showed significant increases in SOD, GST, CAT, GSH, Progesterone, Ca ATPase, Na ATPase, H ATPase and significant reduction (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde, VEGF, TNF-α and estrogen as compared with the DHEA group. The histopathological analysis showed reductions in cystic fibrosis, atretic ovaries, increased expression of Bcl- and E- Cadherin and reduced Bax expression in the group that received Aspirin and DHEA.This study clearly demonstrates that Aspirin has ameliorating effects against polycystic ovary  via anti-inflammatory and hormonal modulatory pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584681>Association of Histologic Disease Activity With Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The histologic evolution of the full spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and factors associated with progression or regression remain to be definitively established.To evaluate the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time.A prospective cohort substudy from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) NAFLD Database study, a noninterventional registry, was performed at 8 university medical research centers. Masked assessment of liver histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the NASH CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent  liver biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline NASH (84 [18.8%]), and definite NASH (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline NASH and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite NASH. Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to verify whether SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS.A 5-year prospective cohort study included 242 police officers from a rapid response unit engaged exclusively in maintaining law and order. Perceived stress levels were measured repeatedly with the demand-control-support and the effort-reward-imbalance questionnaires; insomnia symptoms were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. MetS and its components were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up.During 5-year follow-up period, 26 new cases of MetS were identified. Both occupational stress and SPs were significantly related to incident cases of MetS. Insomnia symptoms showed a highly significant association with MetS (aOR 11.038; CI95% .867-42.493). Mediation analysis confirmed that SPs mediate the relationship between stress and MetS. A reciprocal relationship was found between job stress and SPs. Work-related stress was a significant predictor of insomnia symptoms, short sleep duration, sleep dissatisfaction, and sleepiness. Compared to the reference group, police officers with SPs at baseline had significantly higher odds of reporting high stress at follow-up.SPs play a mediating role in the relationship between occupational stress and MetS.

Special focus has been given over the past decades in the use of Opuntia for the treatment of  (MetS), which is predominantly related to Diabetes Mellitus. In this sense, the prevalence of MetS is increasing at a worldwide level. This in turn has led to a notorious demand for natural and nutraceutical food sources.The objective of this work was to summarize the main contributions in the field of Opuntia spp. research highlighting the potential use of nopal fruits or cladodes in MetS treatment, providing the reader with historical and novel information in this field. Nevertheless, the present work is not a meta-analysis. We included mainly information from recognized scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. No homeopathic based studies were included since they lack scientific validation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that fairly categorizes the majority of the information in this field into subsections, which can be of interest for the reader, such as the effect of nopal against cardiovascular disease, type  diabetes mellitus, and obesity among others.Nopal constitutes one of the most studied members of the Cactaceae family; its potential effects on human health have been described since ancient times, mostly through traditional medicine.

Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter  (SGLT-) in the proximal tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for treatment of type  DM. Inhibition of SGLT- co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that treatment with SGLT- inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type  diabetes now suggest that SGLT- inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT- inhibitors on BP, and its potential value for cardio and nephroprotection.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653028>Noninvasive and Convenient Screening of  Using the Controlled Attenuation Parameter Technology: An Evaluation Based on Self-Paid Health Examination Participants.</a></h2><p>There is a medical need for an easy, fast, and non-invasive method for  (MetS) screening.

A final model that included all significant predictors that are found by univariate analysis, and a convenient model that excluded all invasive parameters were created.Of 1983 participants, 13.6% had a physical status that fulfilled MetS criteria. The results showed that the CAP score solely could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (0.76-0.82) in predicting MetS, and the AUC can be improved to 0.88 (0.85-0.90) in the final model. An AUC of 0.85 (0.83-0.88) in predicting MetS was obtained in the convenient model, which includes only 4 parameters (CAP score, gender, age, and BMI). A panel of predictability indices (the ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio: 0.78-0.89, 0.66-0.82, .64-4.47, and 0.17-0.26) concerning gender- and BMI-specific CAP cut-off values (range: 191.65-564.95) were presented for practical reference.Two prediction systems were proposed for identifying individuals with a physical status that fulfilled the MetS criteria, and a panel of predictability indices was presented for practical reference. Both systems had moderate predictive performance. The findings suggested that FibroScan evaluation is appropriate as a first-line MetS screening; however, the variation in prediction performance of such systems among groups with varying  derangements warrants further studies in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583064>Analysis of the association between health-related and work-related factors among workers and  using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016).</a></h2><p>This study analyzed health-related factors for  (Mets) among workers in South Korea.This analysis included 4,666 adults aged 19-64 years to analyzed health-related risk factors for Mets from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016).

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and  (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease. The presence of NASH on hepatic biopsy did not prove to be, in our study, a predictive of the evolution of hepatic fibrosis in the patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670618>Metformin: Up to Date.</a></h2><p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as first-line therapy for type  diabetes.

Besides its  positive effects, Metformin has direct effects on inflammation and can have immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties.The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the up-to-date evidence from the current literature about the  and non- effects of Metformin.We reviewed the current literature dealing with different effects and properties of Metformin and current recommendations about the use of this drug. We identified keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and the terms Metformin and type  diabetes, type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, heart failure, PCOS, etc, were searched, selecting only significant original articles and review in English, in particular of the last five years.Even if many new effective hypoglycemic agents have been launched in the market in the last few years, Metformin would always keep a place in the treatment of type  diabetes and its comorbidities because of its multiple positive effects and low cost.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675953>Enhancement of hypothalamic-pituitary activity in male athletes: evidence of a novel hormonal mechanism of physical conditioning.</a></h2><p>Exercise is known to induce multiple beneficial conditioning processes. Conversely, although exercise may generate several hormonal effects, an intrinsic hormonal conditioning process has not been reported. In the Endocrine and  Responses on Overtraining  (EROS) study, we observed inherent and independent conditioning processes of the hypothalamic-pituitary axes in athletes. Our objective is to describe the theory of the novel hormonal conditioning mechanism using the findings from the EROS study.In this cross-sectional study, we selected 25 healthy athletes (ATL) and 12 non-physically active healthy controls (NPAC), 18-50 years old, males, with BMI 20-30 kg/m, with similar baseline characteristics, who underwent gold-standard exercise-independent tests: cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) and insulin tolerance test (ITT), to evaluate cortisol response to CST, and ACTH, cortisol, GH, and prolactin responses to an ITT.Responses to ITT were significantly earlier and higher in ATL than NPAC for cortisol [Mean ± SD: 21.7 ± 3.1 vs 16.9 ± 4.1 μg/dL; p < 0.001], GH [Median (95% CI): 12.73 (1.1-38.1) vs 4.80 (0.33-27.36) μg/L; p = 0.015], and prolactin [24.3 (10.5-67.45) vs 10.50 (6.21-43.44) ng/mL; p = 0.002]. Cortisol response to CST was similar between ATL and NPAC. During ITT, cortisol, GH, and ACTH mean increase in ATL were 52., 265., and 18.6% higher than NPAC, respectively. Prolactin response was absent in NPAC, while present in ATL.We found sufficient evidence to propose the existence of a diffuse enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary activity in athletes, not restricted to any axis, showing an intrinsic and independent process of "hormonal conditioning" in athletes, similar to those observed in the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. This novel conditioning process may be the missing link for understanding the improved responses observed in athletes to harmful situations, traumas, infections, inflammations, and psychiatric conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679370></a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581498>Prevalence of Low Energy Availability in Competitively Trained Male Endurance Athletes.</a></h2><p> Relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) has been introduced as a broad-spectrum  leading to possible dysfunction in numerous physiological systems, driven primarily by low energy availability (EA). Research in females has identified specific EA cut-points indicative of risk level for developing physiological and performance disturbances. Cut-points in males have yet to be evaluated. This study examined the prevalence of low EA in competitive (non-elite), recreationally trained (CRT) male endurance athletes. : Subjects were 108 CRT (38.6 ± 13.8 y; 12. ± 5.4 h/wk training) male endurance athletes (runners, cyclists, triathletes) who completed a descriptive survey online via Qualtrics and returned 3 day diet and exercise training records. EA was calculated from returned surveys and training records. Resting  rate (RMR) and lean body mass (LBM) were estimated from self-reported survey data. Prevalence of risk group was categorized based on the female cut-points: at risk (AR) ≤30 kcal/kg LBM, moderate risk (MR) = 30-45 kcal/kg LBM, or no risk (NR) ≥45 kcal/kg LBM. : In this sample, 47.% ( = 51) were classified as AR, 33.3% ( = 36) as MR, and 19.4% ( = 21) as NR for low EA. Cyclists had lower EA (26.9 ± 17.4 kcal/kg LBM,  = 45) than runners (34.6 ± 13.3 kcal/kg LBM,  = 55,  = 0.016) and all other sport categories (39.5 ± 19.1 kcal/kg LBM,  = 8,  = 0.037). : The findings indicate this sample had a high prevalence of risk for low EA, at 47.%. Only 19.4% of participants were at no risk, meaning ~80% of participants were at some degree of risk of experiencing low EA. Cyclists were at greater risk in this cohort of low EA, although why this occurred was unclear and is in need of further investigation. Future research should address whether the current female cut-points for low EA are appropriate for use in male populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652917> Cytokines at Fasting and During Macronutrient Challenges: Influence of Obesity, Female Androgen Excess and Sex.</a></h2><p>Cytokines have pleiotropic functions within the organism and their levels may be influenced by obesity, visceral adiposity and sex hormones. Diet composition may also affect their systemic concentrations during fasting and in the postprandial period. Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and obesity on the circulating levels of a panel of  cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most  cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by obesity. No major differences were found between patients with PCOS and male and female controls.Obesity, but not PCOS or sex, markedly influences  cytokine levels at fasting and after macronutrient ingestion. The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by obesity and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635032>Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Lipid and Amino Acid Markers of Weight Loss in Patients with Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Cachexia is a multifactorial wasting  associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Diagnosis can be difficult and, in the clinical situation, usually relies upon reported weight loss. The 'omics' technologies allow us the opportunity to study the end points of many biological processes. Among these, blood-based metabolomics is a promising method to investigate the pathophysiology of human cancer cachexia and identify candidate biomarkers. In this study, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics to investigate the  profile of cancer-associated weight loss. Non-selected patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for upper gastrointestinal cancer were recruited. Fasting plasma samples were taken at induction of anaesthesia. LC/MS analysis showed that 6 metabolites were highly discriminative of weight loss. Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18., L-Proline, Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight weight-losing samples (≥5% weight loss) and nine weight-stable samples (<5%weight loss) between predicted and actual weight change (r = 0.976,  = 0.0014). Overall, 40 metabolites were associated with ≥5% weight loss. This study provides biological validation of the consensus definition of cancer cachexia (Fearon et al.) and provides feasible candidate markers for further investigation in early diagnosis and the assessment of therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606349>Current and future aspects of several adjunctive treatment strategies in polycystic ovary .</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age. PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders, and polycystic ovarian morphology. PCOS patients have an increased risk of type  diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and infertility. The mechanism of PCOS is not yet fully understood, but insulin resistance and genetic factors may play distinct roles in the pathomechanism. There is ongoing research on new therapeutic modalities for women with PCOS. In this minireview, we assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of selected adjunctive agents (metformin, statins, resveratrol, melatonin, and inositols) for the treatment of women with PCOS. Metformin is a safe medication used in PCOS for 25 years that is currently recommended in select PCOS subpopulations, such as adolescents, women with  disorders, and infertility infertile women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. Statins are also suggested in PCOS therapy, as these compounds decrease testosterone concentrations, improve lipid profiles, and ameliorate inflammatory reactions. Despite promising results, the role of statins in PCOS management needs to be further validated. Dietary supplements have also been tested in PCOS patients. Resveratrol was shown to decrease total testosterone production and improve fasting insulin but, until recently, only in one randomized study. Data on the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin and inositols on endocrine and  abnormalities are limited and inconclusive. The multifactorial etiology of PCOS makes tailoring of its treatment more demanding, and there is a constant need for causative and effective modes of PCOS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

None of them presented with a sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). VPSG recordings were reviewed identifying all eating episodes. For each episode, eating latency (time delay from awakening to food intake), eating duration (time between eating onset to eating offset) and sleep latency after eating offset (time delay from eating offset to sleep) were calculated. Total episode duration was considered as the time between awakening and sleep latency after eating offset.Ten patients fulfilled the A1 core criterion for NES (evening hyperphagia with consumption of at least 25% of the daily caloric intake after the evening meal); within this group, eight patients also fulfilled the A2 criterion (at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week) and were thus included in the evening hyperphagia (EH) subgroup. The remaining 10 patients satisfied only the A2 core criterion for NES, constituting the nocturnal ingestion (NI) subgroup. We recorded 20 eating episodes, seven in the EH group and 13 in the NI group. In the EH subgroup, three eating episodes occurred before sleep onset, one after an awakening from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 1 sleep, two from NREM stage  and one from REM sleep. All 13 NI episodes occurred after an awakening from sleep (1 from NREM stage 1 sleep, 8 from NREM stage  and four from NREM stage 3). In EH patients, eating latency, total episode duration and sleep latency after eating offset were significantly longer than in NI patients.Our VPSG data from a case series of 20 patients referred to our center for nocturnal eating indicate potential different NES subtypes. This distinction may have an impact on patients' treatment and follow-up.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this Review we present the existing recent literature that supports the gut microbiome's potential influence on the various risk factors of MetS. The interplay of the intestinal microbiota with host metabolism has been shown to be mediated by a myriad of factors, including a defective gut barrier, bile acid metabolism, antibiotic use, and the pleiotropic effects of microbially produced metabolites.

All participants underwent a physical examination to measure the compotents of MS and completed a questionnaire to collect data on potential risk factors. According to the current guidelines of China, MS was defined as the presence of any 3 of the following five traits: abdominal obesity, defined as a waist circumference ≥90 cm in men and ≥85 cm in women; fasting serum triglycerides ≥1.70 mmol/L, or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides; fasting serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <1.03 mmol/L, or drug treatment for low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg, or drug treatment for elevated blood pressure; fasting plasma glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L, or -hour plasma glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L after a 75-g oral glucose load, or drug treatment for elevated blood glucose.The prevalence of MS was 23.% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.%-24.%). The main risk factors associated with MS were older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.546, 95% CI 1.431-1.670), being male (OR 11.256, 95%CI 7.147-17.726), alcohol consumption (OR 1.250, 95% CI 1.070-1.461), and tobacco use (OR 1.398, 95% CI 1.232-1.586). Exercise was associated with decreased risk of MS (OR 0.865, 95% CI 0.755-0.991).The prevalence of MS was low in the study population.

We aimed to evaluate the utilization and outcome of severely obese patients with MetS who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)  laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Using the 2015 and 2016  and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database, data were obtained for patients with MetS undergoing LSG or LRYGB. There were 29,588 MetS patients (LSG: 58.7%  LRYGB: 41.3%). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (0.1% for LSG  0.% for LRYGB, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.58, confidence interval (CI) 0.32-1.05,  = 0.07) or length of stay between groups ( ±  for LSG  . ±  days for LRYGB,  = 0.40). Compared with LRYGB, LSG was associated with significantly shorter operative time (78 ± 39  122 ± 54 minutes,  < 0.01), lower overall morbidity (.3%  4.4%, AOR 0.53, CI 0.46-0.60,  < 0.01), lower serious morbidity (1.5%  .3%, AOR 0.64, CI 0.53-0.76,  < 0.01), lower 30-day reoperation (1.%  .3%, AOR 0.52, CI 0.43-0.63,  < 0.01), and lower 30-day readmission (4.%  6.6%, AOR 0.62, CI 0.55-0.69,  < 0.01).

Considering previous studies reporting the correlation of ApoL1 to triglyceride, we have hypothesized that ApoL1 associates with insulin-related metabolism. The current study examined their associations in 126 non-diabetic subjects and 36 patients with type  diabetes (T2DM). Non-diabetic subjects demonstrated triglyceride (standardized coefficients [s.c.] = 0.204, p < 0.05), body mass index (s.c. =0.232, p < 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (s.c. = -0.203, p < 0.05) as independent determinant of ApoL1 levels, and the significant elevation of ApoL1 in . Lipoprotein fractionation analysis revealed the predominant distribution of ApoL1 in large HDL fraction, and the significant increase of ApoL1 in large LDL fraction in high ApoL1 samples with insulin resistance. In T2DM, ApoL1 was higher in T2DM with , however ApoL1 was lower with β cell dysfunction. Insulin significantly promotes ApoL1 synthesis and secretion in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, circulating ApoL1 may be associated with abnormal HDL metabolism in insulin resistant status. This may suggest a regulation of insulin signal on the ApoL1 level, leading to offer a novel insight to the ApoL1 biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615320>Uric acid to HDL cholesterol ratio is a strong predictor of diabetic control in men with type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p> Despite it has some disadvantages, the most important marker of diabetic control is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

The UHR levels of well and poorly controlled diabetics and control subjects were 12%±5%, 17%±6% and 9%±3%, respectively (<.001). The UHR was significantly and inversely correlated with GFR and was significantly and positively correlated with waist circumference, body weight, body mass index, serum creatinine, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c levels.

A comprehensive study on plasma metabolites was conducted, and metabolites were compared between the OAB and control groups.Age was significantly higher in the OAB group, while prostate volume did not differ between the groups. A 24-h bladder diary revealed that nocturnal urine volume, 24-h micturition frequency, nocturnal micturition frequency, and the nocturnal index were significantly higher in the OAB group, whereas maximum voided volume was significantly lower in this group. The metabolomics analysis identified 79 metabolites from the plasma of participants. The multivariate analysis showed that increases in the fatty acids (22:1), erucic acid and palmitoleic acid, and a decrease in cholic acid correlated with incidence of male OAB. A decrease in acylcarnitine (18:)-3 and an increase in cis-11-eicosenoic acid also appeared to be associated with OAB in males.OAB in males may occur through the abnormal metabolism of fatty acids and bile acids. Further studies on these pathways will contribute to the detection of new biomarkers and development of potential targets for novel treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635966>Diabetes: a  and reproductive disorder in women.</a></h2><p>Reproductive dysfunction is a common but little studied complication of diabetes. The spectrum of reproductive health problems in diabetes is broad, and encompasses delayed puberty and menarche, menstrual cycle abnormalities, subfertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and potentially early menopause. Depending on the age at diagnosis of diabetes, reproductive problems can manifest early on in puberty, emerge later when fertility is desired, or occur during the climacteric period. Historically, women with type 1 diabetes have frequently had amenorrhoea and infertility, due to central hypogonadism. With the intensification of insulin therapy and improved  control, these problems have declined, but do persist. Additional reproductive implications of contemporary diabetes management are now emerging, including polycystic ovary  and hyperandrogenism, which are underpinned by insulin action on the ovary. The sharp rise in type  diabetes incidence in youth suggests that more women of reproductive age will encounter diabetes-related reproductive problems in their lifetimes. With an ever increasing number of young women living with diabetes, clinicians need to be aware of and equipped for the challenges of navigating reproductive health concerns across the lifespan.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
