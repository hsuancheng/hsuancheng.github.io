In this study, Δ12 and Δ12/Δ15 fatty  desaturases of the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi, termed LsFad2 and LsFad3, respectively, were identified and characterized. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing LsFAD2 converted oleic  (C18:1) to linoleic  (C18:2), while a strain of LsFAD3-expressing S. cerevisiae converted oleic  to linoleic , and linoleic  to α- (C18:3), indicating that LsFad2 and LsFad3 were Δ12 and bifunctional Δ12/Δ15 fatty  desaturases, respectively. The overexpression of LsFAD2 in L. starkeyi caused an accumulation of linoleic  and a reduction in oleic  levels. In contrast, overexpression of LsFAD3 induced the production of α-. Deletion of LsFAD2 and LsFAD3 induced the accumulation of oleic  and linoleic , respectively. Our findings are significant for the commercial production of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in L. starkeyi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098557>Non-targeted metabolomics reveals alterations in liver and plasma of gilt-head bream exposed to oxybenzone.</a></h1><p>The extensive use of the organic UV filter oxybenzone has led to its ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment, causing an ecotoxicological risk to biota. Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50 mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain, liver and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both liver and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in  (fatty  elongation, α- , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty  ) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine . Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and energy  modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about its effect on skin pH, which is maintained by epidermal lactate, free fatty acids (FFAs), and free amino acids (FAAs) which is generated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), or filaggrin degradation with peptidylarginine deiminase-3 (PADI3). We hypothesized that BO restores skin pH by regulating epidermal lactate, FFA , or FAA  in EFAD. To test this hypothesis, EFAD was induced in guinea pigs by a hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) diet for 8 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of a BO diet (group HCO + BO). As controls, groups HCO and BO were fed HCO or BO diets for 10 weeks. In group HCO + BO, skin pH, which was less acidic in group HCO, was restored; and epidermal lactate and total FFAs, including palmitate, stearate, linoleate, arachidate, behenate, and lignocerate, were higher than in group HCO. LDH and sPLA2 (mainly the PLA2G2F isoform) activities and protein expressions were similar between groups HCO + BO and BO. Epidermal acidic FAAs, as well as filaggrin and PADI3 protein and mRNA expressions were higher in group HCO + BO than in group HCO. Oleate, total FAAs including other FAAs, and LDH and sPLA2 mRNA expressions were not altered between groups HCO and HCO + BO. Basic FAAs were not altered among groups. Dietary BO restored acidic skin pH and increased epidermal levels of lactate, most FFAs, and acidic FAAs by up-regulating LDH, sPLA2, filaggrin, and PADI3 activities as well as protein or mRNA expressions in EFAD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A study using 8 multiparous (325 ± 17 DIM; mean ± SD) lactating Jersey cows was conducted to determine effects of feeding canola meal and lard versus extruded byproduct containing flaxseed as a high-C18:3  source on methane production and diet digestibility in late-lactation dairy cows. A crossover design with 32-d periods (28-d adaptation and 4-d collections) was used to compare 2 different  sources. Diets contained approximately 50% forage mixture of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and brome hay; the concentrate mixture changed between diets to include either (1) a conventional diet of corn, soybean meal, and canola meal with lard (control) or (2) a conventional diet of corn and soybean meal with an extruded byproduct containing flaxseed (EXF) as the  source. Diets were balanced to decrease corn, lard, and canola meal and replace them with soybean mean and EXF to increase the concentration of C18:3 (0.14 vs. 1.20% of DM). Methane production was measured using headbox-style indirect calorimeters. Cattle were restricted to 95% ad libitum feed intake during collections. Milk production (17.4 ± 1.04 kg/d) and dry matter intake (15.4 ± 0.71 kg/d) were similar among treatments. Milk  (5.88 ± 0.25%) and protein (4.08 ± 0.14%) were not affected by treatment. For methane production, no difference was observed for total production (352.0 vs. 349.8 ± 16.43 L/d for control vs. EXF, respectively). Methane production per unit of dry matter intake was not affected and averaged 23.1 ± 0.57 L/kg. Similarly, methane production per unit of energy-corrected milk was not affected by  source and averaged 15.5 ± 0.68 L/kg. Heat production was similar, averaging 21.1 ± 1.02 Mcal/d. Digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein was not affected by diet and averaged 69.9, 53.6, and 73.3%, respectively. Results indicated that increasing C18:3 may not affect methane production or digestibility of the diet in lactating dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

SCOs can be used as precursors for the synthesis of -based biofuels or employed as substitutes of expensive oils rarely found in the plant or animal kingdom. In the present review-article, aspects concerning SCOs (economics, biochemistry, substrates, technology, scale-up), with emphasis on the potential of Mortierella isabellina were presented. Fats and hydrophilic substrates have been used as carbon sources for cultivating Zygomycetes. Among them, wild-type M. isabellina strains have been reported as excellent SCO-producers, with conversion yields on sugar consumed and  in DCW values reported comparable to the maximum ones achieved for genetically engineered SCO-producing strains. Lipids produced on glucose contain γ- (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) of high dietary and pharmaceutical importance, though in low concentrations. Nevertheless, due to their abundance in oleic , these lipids are perfect precursors for the synthesis of 2nd generation biodiesel, while GLA can be recovered and directed to other usages. Genetic engineering focusing on over-expression of Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases and of C16 elongase may improve the fatty  composition (viz. increasing the concentration of GLA or other nutritionally important PUFAs) of these lipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29389608>Nutrigenomic studies on hilsa to evaluate flesh quality attributes and genes associated with fatty   from the rivers Hooghly and Padma.</a></h1><p>The Indian shad hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha), a commercially important food fish rich in oils, enjoys high consumer preference in the South Asian countries owing to its unique flavour and culinary properties. The present study was undertaken with the primary objective of determining the flesh quality attributes of hilsa in terms of nutritive value (gross chemical composition, amino , fatty  and mineral composition), pH, water holding capacity (WHC) and expression of genes associated with fatty   and flesh quality. Additionally, comparative studies on the flesh quality attributes in hilsa from two distributaries of river Ganga i.e. Hooghly and Padma were also carried out. A high WHC (>80%) suggested juicy and tender nature of hilsa meat. The protein content was 18-21% in hilsa from both the rivers and essential amino  lysine, valine and functional amino acids leucine and arginine were significantly higher in Hooghly hilsa (P<0.05). The predominance of umami taste amino acids, glutamic  and aspartic  and sweet taste amino acids, serine, glycine and alanine in hilsa from both the rivers could be the contributing factors to its unique flavour. The  content in hilsa from river Hooghly and Padma were found to be 9.94 and 7.84%, respectively. The concentration of flavouring fatty acids like saturated fatty acids (SFA) (myristic ) and omega (ω)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (linoleic , α-, arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic , EPA and docosahexaenoic , DHA) were significantly higher in Hooghly hilsa (P<0.05). Among the genes associated with fatty   studied, expression of cluster of differentiation (CD36), acetyl CoA oxidase (ACO), fatty  synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor beta (PPARβ), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and desaturase were significantly higher in Padma hilsa (P<0.05), and the change was <2 fold. Comparative gene expression profiling of flesh quality genes (actin, GAPDH, LDH, TPI) showed similar levels of expression in hilsa from both the rivers (P<0.05). The nutrigenomic information generated on various flesh quality attributes of hilsa has enriched the knowledgebase. Further, from comparative nutrient analysis on hilsa from river Hooghly and Padma, it was observed that Hooghly hilsa is superior in terms of oil content, ω-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA and essential amino acids; however, the expression profile of genes associated with flesh quality were found to be similar. Thus, within the scope of the present study, Hooghly hilsa (medium size category, 500-700g size) was found to be nutritionally superior.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Overexpression of COX-2 has been found in a majority of breast carcinomas, and has also been associated with increased severity and the development of the metastasis. Our lab recently demonstrated that COX-2 can also metabolize dihomo-γ- (DGLA, a precursor of ω-6 arachidonic ) to produce an anti-cancer byproduct, 8-hydroxyoctanoic  (8-HOA) that can inhibit growth and migration of colon and pancreatic cancer cells. We thus tested whether our strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, the key enzyme that converts DGLA to arachidonic ) in breast cancer cells overexpressing COX-2 can also be used to promote 8-HOA formation, thereby suppressing cancer growth, migration, and invasion.SiRNA and shRNA transfection were used to knock down D5D expression in MDA-MB 231 and 4 T1 cells (human and mouse breast cancer cell lines expressing high COX-2, respectively). Colony formation assay, FITC Annexin V/PI double staining, wound healing and transwell assay were used to assess the effect of our strategy on inhibition of cancer growth, migration, and invasion. GC/MS was used to measure endogenous 8-HOA, and western blotting was performed to evaluate the altered key protein expressions upon the treatments.We demonstrated that D5D knockdown licenses DGLA to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells via promoting formation of 8-HOA that can inhibit histone deacetylase and activate cell apoptotic proteins, such as procaspase 9 and PARP. Our strategy can also significantly inhibit cancer migration and invasion, associated with altered expression of MMP-2/- 9, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. In addition, D5D knockdown and DGLA supplementation greatly enhanced the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer growth and migration.Consistent to our previous studies on colon and pancreatic cancer, here we demonstrate again that the high level of COX-2 in breast cancer cells can be capitalized on inhibiting cancer growth and migration. The outcome of this translational research could guide us to develop new anti-cancer strategy and/or to improve current chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29285556>Mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae to enhance the quality of  for biodiesel application: effects of scale of cultivation and light spectrum on reduction of α-.</a></h1><p>The research on microalgal biodiesel is focused not only on getting the highest  productivity but also desired quality of . The experiments were initially conducted on flask scale (1L) using acetate carbon source at different concentrations viz. 0.5, 2, 3 and 4 g L. The optimum concentration of acetate was considered for further experiments in two airlift photobioreactors (10 L) equipped separately with red and white LED lights. The Feasibility Index (FI) was derived to analyze the scalability of mixotrophic cultivation based on net carbon fixation in biomass per consumption of total organic carbon. The experimental strategy under mixotrophic mode of cultivation lowered the α- content of  by 60-80% as compared to autotrophic cultivation for Scenedesmus abundans species and yielded the highest biomass and  productivities, 59 ± 2 and 17 ± 1.8 mg L day, respectively. The TOC, nitrate, and phosphate reduction rates were 74.6 ± 3.0, 11.5 ± 1.4, 9.6 ± 2.4 mg L day, respectively. The significant change was observed in  compositions due to the scale, mode of cultivation, and light spectra. As compared to phototrophic cultivation, biodiesel obtained under mixotrophic cultivation only met standard biodiesel properties. The FI data showed that the mixotrophic cultivation was feasible on moderate concentrations of acetate (2-3 g L).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665872>Maternal intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during mid-pregnancy is inversely associated with linear growth.</a></h1><p>This study investigates relations of maternal N-3 and N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake during pregnancy with offspring body mass index (BMI), height z-score and metabolic risk (fasting glucose, C-peptide, leptin,  profile) during peripuberty (8-14 years) among 236 mother-child pairs in Mexico. We used food frequency questionnaire data to quantify trimester-specific intake of N-3 , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA); N-6 linoleic  and arachidonic  (AA); and N-6:N-3 (AA:EPA+DHA), which accounts for the fact that the two PUFA families have opposing effects on physiology. Next, we used multivariable linear regression models that accounted for maternal education and parity, and child's age, sex and pubertal status, to examine associations of PUFA intake with the offspring outcomes. In models where BMI z-score was the outcome, we also adjusted for height z-score. We found that higher second trimester intake of EPA, DHA and AA were associated with lower offspring BMI and height z-score. For example, each 1-s.d. increment in second trimester EPA intake corresponded with 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) z-scores lower BMI and 0.20 (0.05, 0.36) z-scores lower height. Accounting for height z-score in models where BMI z-score was the outcome attenuated estimates [e.g., EPA: -0.16 (-0.37, 0.05)], suggesting that this relationship was driven by slower linear growth rather than excess adiposity. Maternal PUFA intake was not associated with the offspring metabolic biomarkers. Our findings suggest that higher PUFA intake during mid-pregnancy is associated with lower attained height in offspring during peripuberty. Additional research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and to confirm findings in other populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246284>Consumption of -enriched diacylglycerol induces increase in dietary  oxidation compared with -enriched triacylglycerol: A randomized, double-blind trial.</a></h1><p> is an important consideration in obesity. -enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG), which mainly occurs as ALA esterifies to 1,3-diacyl-sn-glycerol (1,3-DAG), has beneficial effects on  and body weight compared with triacylglycerol (TAG). Moreover, compared with ALA-TAG, ALA-DAG enhances β-oxidation activity in the small intestine and liver in rodents. We hypothesized that ALA-DAG consumption may increase dietary  oxidation compared with ALA-TAG in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized double-blind cross-over trial in 17 normal and moderately obese men and women (BMI: 25.7±2.0 kg/m, mean±SD). Each participant was assigned to a 4-week intervention period with 2.5 g/day of ALA-DAG or ALA-TAG consumption, followed by a 4-week washout period between consumption of each diet. Dietary  oxidation, assessed based on the CO recovery rate in the breath, was significantly increased by ALA-DAG consumption compared with ALA-TAG consumption (17.0±4.5% and 14.1±5.9%, respectively, P<.05). In addition, ALA-DAG consumption significantly decreased the visceral  area compared with ALA-TAG (102.9±51.9 cm and 110.9±51.7 cm, respectively; P<.05). These results indicate that ALA-DAG consumption may be useful for preventing obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work reports a new facet of the putative CYP74C HPLs. Initially, we found that the recombinant CYP74C13_MT (Medicago truncatula) behaved predominantly as the epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) towards the 9(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic . At the same time, the CYP74C13_MT mostly possessed the HPL activity towards the 13(S)-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α- acids. To verify whether this dualistic behaviour of CYP74C13_MT is occasional or typical, we also examined five similar putative HPLs (CYP74C). These were CYP74C4_ST (Solanum tuberosum), CYP74C2 (Cucumis melo), CYP74C1_CS and CYP74C31 (both of Cucumis sativus), and CYP74C13_GM (Glycine max). All tested enzymes behaved predominantly as EAS toward 9-hydroperoxide of linoleic . Oxiranyl carbinols such as (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acids were the major EAS products. Besides, the CYP74C31 possessed an additional minor 9-AOS activity. The mutant forms of CYP74C13_MT, CYP74C1_CS, and CYP74C31 with substitutions at the catalytically essential domains, namely the "hydroperoxide-binding domain" (I-helix), or the SRS-1 domain near the N-terminus, showed strong AOS activity. These HPLs to AOSs conversions were observed for the first time. Until now a large part of CYP74C enzymes has been considered as 9/13-HPLs. Notwithstanding, these results show that all studied putative CYP74C HPLs are in fact the versatile HPL/EASs that can be effortlessly mutated into specific AOSs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, ω-3:20-5), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, ω-3:22-6) and  (ALA, ω-3:18-3) are known ω-3 fatty acids, extracted from animal (e.g fish oil) and plant sources (e.g flaxseed oil). Furthermore, linoleic  (LA, ω-6:18-2) is recognized as ω-6 fatty  and the most prominent biological fatty  with a pro-inflammatory response. Flaxseed oil has variety of biological roles, due to the significant amount of ω-3/ω-6 fatty acids. Numerous studies have reported that ALA (ω-3:18-3) and LA (ω-6:18-2) has diverse pharmacological activities. The ALA (ω-3:18-3) and LA (ω-6:18-2) are recognised to be the pharmacological antagonist. For example, ALA (ω-3:18-3) is recognised as anti-inflammatory, whereas LA (ω-6:18-2) is considered to be pro-inflammatory. PUFA's get oxidized in three ways; firstly, free radical-mediated pathway, secondly non-free radical non-enzymatic , and lastly enzymatic degradation. The present report is an attempt to summarize various modes of PUFA's  and elaborate biological effects of the associated metabolites concerning flaxseed oil.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Gandou decoction (GDD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, exhibits unambiguous therapeutic effect on HLD in China for decades. However, the mechanism of effect on HLD is not clear. With this purpose, the effects of copper content and histopathology inspection on the HLD rat model were investigated. Then, metabolomics study based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) analysis and multivariate statistical analysis was adopted to further reveal the mechanism of action of GDD against HLD. The results showed that the characteristics of liver tissues after GDD treatment were significantly reversed, close to the control group, suggesting that GDD has a therapeutic effect on HLD. Furthermore, HLD interferes with 2 metabolites of the metabolic pathway in rats. Among them, up-regulation of Lactic , Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, Triacylglycerol and down-regulation of Linoleic , , Phosphatidylcholine, Taurine is particularly significant. Analysis of metabolic pathways by a unique pathway analysis revealed significant changes in several pathways including , amino  and glucose  in HLD.

In the nHMF group, significantly increased levels of -9 monounsaturated fatty acids were observed, formed most likely by elongation and desaturation of dietary saturated fatty acids present in HM. ALA fortification increased ALA assimilation into plasma TAG. Similarly, DHA fortification enriched the DHA content in RBC-PE, which, in this compartment, was not associated with lower arachidonic  levels as observed in plasma TAG and phospholipids.

However, its application could affect wheat growth. The present study investigates the effect of the ascomycetous fungus Trichoderma harzianum on  peroxidation, phospholipids, signaling lipids and phospholipase D in the seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) treated with 2,4-D (2.5 mg L). In the group of 4-day-old seedlings exposed to the herbicide, increased  peroxidation and inhibition of growth were observed in shoots and roots. Moreover, elevated levels of oxylipins were noted. Among them, the amount of 13-HOTrE oxygenated from  (18:3) increased the most significantly. Concurrently, in the seedlings inoculated with T. harzianum, growth was stimulated when the level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) increased. Moreover, in wheat seedlings treated with 2,4-D and T. harzianum, the level of  peroxidation was similar to that in the control and there was no increase observed in oxylipins and phospholipase D activity.

In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and palmitic  (-26%) and increased the stearic  (+50%), oleic  (+36%), vaccenic  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic  (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α- (+100%) in milk . The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty  composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α- by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , oleic , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and oleic  and lower levels of adrenic , arachidonic , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific  under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

The ChDiPiCa showed excellent in vitro biocidal activity against MRSA at 26 μg/mL compared to the antibiotic streptomycin and bacitracin 14 μg/mL and 13 μg/mL at 10 μg concentration respectively. The membrane damaging property was confirmed by the SEM analysis. Further, we addressed the new approach for the first time to overcome antibiotic resistance of MRSA through membrane microdomain miss loading to lipids. By which, the ChDiPiCa confirms the significant activity in miss loading of FMM of MRSA which is validated by the fatty  profile and  analysis. The result shows that, altered saturated (Lauric  and Myristic ), mono unsaturated (Oleic ), and poly unsaturated (Linoleic  and ) fatty acids and hypothesises, altered the membrane functional lipids. For the better understanding of miss loading of FMM by the ChDiPiCa, the in-silico molecular docking studies was analyzed and confirmed the predicted role. This suggests the way to develop ChDiPiCa in medicinal chemistry as anti-MRSA candidates and also this report opens up new window to treat microbial pathogens and infections.Copyright © 2018.

In this study, we showed that overexpressing microRNA167A (miR167OE) in camelina (Camelina sativa) under a seed-specific promoter changed fatty  composition and increased seed size. Specifically, the miR167OE seeds had a lower α- with a concomitantly higher linoleic  content than the wild-type. This decreased level of fatty  desaturation corresponded to a decreased transcriptional expression of the camelina fatty  desaturase3 (CsFAD3) in developing seeds. MiR167 targeted the transcription factor auxin response factor (CsARF8) in camelina, as had been reported previously in Arabidopsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments combined with transcriptome analysis indicated that CsARF8 bound to promoters of camelina bZIP67 and ABI3 genes. These transcription factors directly or through the ABI3-bZIP12 pathway regulate CsFAD3 expression and affect α- accumulation. In addition, to decipher the miR167A-CsARF8 mediated transcriptional cascade for CsFAD3 suppression, transcriptome analysis was conducted to implicate mechanisms that regulate seed size in camelina. Expression levels of many genes were altered in miR167OE, including orthologs that have previously been identified to affect seed size in other plants. Most notably, genes for seed coat development such as suberin and lignin biosynthesis were down-regulated. This study provides valuable insights into the regulatory mechanism of fatty   and seed size determination, and suggests possible approaches to improve these important traits in camelina.© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886843>Cell Growth,  Production and Productivity in Photosynthetic Microalga Chlorella vulgaris under Different Nitrogen Concentrations and Culture Media Replacement.</a></h1><p>The photosynthetic unicellular microalgal strain, Chlorella vulgaris is considered as a robust biomass and  producer for human food and feed and also green energy production. The culture media composition plays a crucial role in biomass and  production and productivity.The photosynthetic green microalga C. vulgaris was studied in three distinct cultivation experiments each for 22 days, using BG11 and f/2 culture media to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrogen and culture media replacement on cell growth,  production and productivity.In f/2 culture medium, the total  production reached was 0.246 g L-1 (41.55%) which was 147% higher than its counterpart in BG11 medium (0.298 g L-1). On the other hand, the highest biomass (1.492 g L-1) was attained in BG11-3 medium with 6.00 g nitrate L-1 and this was correlated with higher total chlorophyll content (15.189 mg L-1) and cell number (3.812 × 106 cell mL-1). A fatty  profile, composed of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected and included stearic , oleic , α- and γ- which have nutritional or combustion importance.These data suggest that this C. vulgaris strain may be considered as a robust source for biomass,  and green energy production.

The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high- diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%), oleic  (34.20%) and  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight,  weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high- diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109648>A Continuous and Sensitive Spectrophotometric Assay for Lipase and Phospholipase A Activities Using α-Eleostearic -Containing Substrates.</a></h1><p>To date, several sensitive methods, based on radiolabeled elements or sterically hindered fluorochrome groups, are usually employed to screen lipase and phospholipase A (PLA) activities. Here, a new ultraviolet spectrophotometric assay for lipase or PLA was developed using natural triglycerides or synthetic glycerophosphatidylcholines containing α-eleostearic  (9Z, 11E, 13E-octadecatrienoic ) purified from Aleurites fordii seed oil. The conjugated triene present in α-eleostearic  constitutes an intrinsic chromophore and consequently confers strong UV absorption properties of this free fatty  as well as of  substrates harboring it. The substrate was coated into the wells of a microplate, and the lipolytic activities were measured by the absorbance increase at 272 nm due to the transition of α-eleostearic  moiety from the adsorbed to the soluble state. This continuous assay is compatible with a high-throughput screening method and can be applied specifically to the screening of new potential lipase, PLA and PLA inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684680>miR-24 is involved in vertebrate LC-PUFA biosynthesis as demonstrated in marine teleost Siganus canaliculatus.</a></h1><p>Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of . However, the miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism on long-chain (≥C) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis in vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here, we address a potentially important role of miRNA-24 (miR-24) in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. miR-24 showed significantly higher abundance in liver of rabbitfish reared in brackish water than in seawater for fish fed vegetable oil diets and in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells incubated with  (ALA) than the control group. Similar expression patterns were also observed on the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp1) and LC-PUFA biosynthesis related genes. While opposite results were observed on the expression of insulin-induced gene 1 (insig1), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein blocking Srebp1 proteolytic activation. Luciferase reporter assays revealed rabbitfish insig1 as a target of miR-24. Knockdown of miR-24 in SCHL cells resulted in increased Insig1 protein, and subsequently reduced mature Srebp1 protein and expression of genes required for LC-PUFA biosynthesis, and these effects could be attenuated after additional insig1 knockdown. Opposite results were observed with overexpression of miR-24. Moreover, increasing endogenous insig1 by knockdown of miR-24 inhibited Srebp1 processing and consequently suppressed LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish hepatocytes. These results indicate a potentially critical role for miR-24 in regulating LC-PUFA biosynthesis through the Insig1/Srebp1 pathway by targeting insig1. This is the first report of miR-24 involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and thus may provide knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), oxidative stress, and inflammation status in liver and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E (ApoE  ), mice fed with high  diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic  (ADA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic  levels in the liver tissues compared to the HFD group. Arachidonic  (ARA) and α- (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ], and PGF ) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic ]) were reduced in the liver tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F -dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F -dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and liver tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F -phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-STΔ -9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF ) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29934171>Nutritional value and chemical composition of Greek artichoke genotypes.</a></h1><p>The nutritional value and chemical composition of various artichoke genotypes cultivated in Greece were evaluated.

Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular  (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of oleic  (18:1n-9), linoleic  (18:2n-6), and α- (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty - binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty  synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738839>Identification of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs involved in fatty  biosynthesis in tree peony seeds.</a></h1><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as important molecular regulators in a wide range of biological processes during plant development and seed formation, including oil production. Tree peony seeds contain >90% unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and high proportions of α- (ALA, > 40%). To dissect the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) pathway involved in fatty acids synthesis in tree peony seeds, we construct six small RNA libraries and six transcriptome libraries from developing seeds of two cultivars (J and S) containing different content of fatty  compositions. After deep sequencing the RNA libraries, the ncRNA expression profiles of tree peony seeds in two cultivars were systematically and comparatively analyzed. A total of 318 known and 153 new miRNAs and 22,430 lncRNAs were identified, among which 106 conserved and 9 novel miRNAs and 2785 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. In addition, potential target genes of the microRNA and lncRNAs were also predicted and annotated. Among them, 9 miRNAs and 39 lncRNAs were predicted to target  related genes. Results showed that all of miR414, miR156b, miR2673b, miR7826, novel-m0027-5p, TR24651|c0_g1, TR24544|c0_g15, and TR27305|c0_g1 were up-regulated and expressed at a higher level in high-ALA cultivar J when compared to low-ALA cultivar S, suggesting that these ncRNAs and target genes are possibly involved in different fatty  synthesis and  through post-transcriptional regulation. These results provide a better understanding of the roles of ncRNAs during fatty  biosynthesis and  in tree peony seeds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These specific roles may be of crucial importance in a context of exposure to pollutants. We recently showed that the fatty  profile of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids modulates sensitivity to an acute methylmercury challenge. In order to investigate mechanisms of effects, we herein tested whether specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may protect cells from methylmercury through decreasing intracellular mercury accumulation and/or enhancing cellular defences (e.g. via modulation of gene expression patterns). We also investigated the inverse relationship and assessed the impact of methylmercury on cellular fatty  . To do so, the fatty  composition of rainbow trout liver cell phospholipids was first modified by incubating them in a medium enriched in a specific PUFA from either the n-3 family (, ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or the n-6 family (linoleic , LA; arachidonic , AA). Cells were then exposed to methylmercury (0.15 or 0.50 μM) for 24 h and sampled thereafter for assessing phospholipid fatty  profile, intracellular total mercury burden, and expression pattern of genes involved in fatty  , synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that cells incorporated the given PUFA and some biotransformation products in their phospholipids. Methylmercury had few impacts on this cellular phospholipid composition. None of the PUFA enrichments affected the cellular mercury burden, suggesting that the previously observed cytoprotection conferred by ALA and EPA was not linked to a global decrease in cellular accumulation of mercury. Fatty  enrichments and methylmercury exposure both modulated gene expression patterns. Genes involved in the synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules, in stress response and the orphan cytochrome P450 20A1 were identified as possible sites of interaction between fatty acids and methylmercury in rainbow trout liver cells.Copyright © 2018.

However, the effect mechanisms are not yet well understood. Here, a urinary metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF-MS) was conducted to explore the changes in the endogenous metabolites and to assess the integral efficacy of TSD on acute blood stasis model rats. Then, parameters for hemorheology and coagulation functions were detected. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to investigate the global metabolite alterations and to evaluate the preventive effects of TSD in rats. Potential metabolite markers were found using OPLS-DA and t-test. Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis was performed to construct metabolic networks. The results showed that TSD could significantly decrease whole blood viscosity and plasma viscosity. It also significantly prolonged partial thromboplastin time (APPT) and prothrombin time (PT), increased thrombin time (TT) and lowered fibrinogen content (FIB). Moreover, 24 potential metabolite markers of acute blood stasis were screened, and the levels were all reversed to different degrees after TSD administration. In metabolic networks, amino   (arginine and proline ; histidine ; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate ; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine ) and  (glycerophospholipid ; linoleic  ;  ) were closely related with the intervention mechanism of TSD on acute blood stasis. The urinary metabolomic approach can be applied to clarify the mechanism of TSD in promoting blood circulation to remove acute blood stasis and to provide the theoretical basis for further research on the therapeutic mechanism of TSD in clinical practice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Most plasma FFA are bound to albumin. Only when FFA dissociate from albumin, do they become biologically active.To measure the first FFAu profiles in human infants and to measure these profiles before and during intravenous administration of the soybean , intralipid (IL).The study population was 16 premature infants, from a parent study of 130 infants with birth weights 500-2000 g and gestational age 23-34 weeks. The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound oleic, myristic, and  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of  in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of arachidonic from linoleic  may tend to promote patency.

We investigated the effect of perilla oil on obesity-induced hepatic and vascular changes in high- diet (HFD)-fed mice and provided underlying mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications. Tomato and paprika extract was added to prevent the oxidation during storage of perilla oil. HFD-fed mice were orally administered palm or perilla oil for 90 days. Food intake, body and liver weight, and serum cholesterol levels were measured. Arterial and hepatic  accumulation was determined by histological staining. Hepatic triglyceride levels and the expression of proteins regulating  were analyzed. Food intake and body weight were not different between palm oil-treated and perilla oil-treated mice. Serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in perilla oil-treated mice compared with palm oil-treated mice. HFD-induced  accumulation was also lower in thoracic aorta and liver by perilla oil compared with palm oil. Perilla oil also decreased hepatic triglyceride level without changing the liver weight. Perilla oil treatment increased the AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and the lipolytic protein levels, whereas it decreased the lipogenic protein levels in the liver. In conclusion, perilla oil reduced serum cholesterol and arterial and hepatic  accumulation in HFD-fed mice.

HDMA-20 is a new potential source of α- and eicosatetraenoic .</a></h1><p>ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are synthesized from α- (ALA, C18:3ω3) and play important roles in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in mammal cells. ALA is an essential fatty  which cannot be produced within the human body and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of ω-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3).Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty  composition of HDMA-20 .A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of ω-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total ), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total , respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and  content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3 mg L day, and the  contents was 22.6% of dry weight.HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of ω-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and  accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective ω-3 PUFAs production in future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159640>Insight into Arthrospira platensis Δ9 desaturase: a key enzyme in poly-unsaturated fatty  synthesis.</a></h1><p>Membrane-bound Δ9 desaturase perform oxygenated desaturation reactions to insert the first double bonds within fatty acyl chains between C9 and C10 positions of most saturated substrates. Arthrospira platensis, a blue green microalga, is an important source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as oleic, linoleic and  acids lending benefits and functions in dietetics and therapeutic uses. In this paper, we report homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9 desaturase from Arthrospira platensis strain. The protein model showed high topology resemblance compared to membrane-bound desaturases with a cytoplasmic core displaying the catalytic site and a transmembrane domain created by four α-helices. The cytoplasmic cap contained the three conserved-histidine boxes typical for all membrane bound desaturases. The protein model was used to perform protein-protein docking and the dimer structure was generated. The two monomers are tightly related with hydrophobic interactions between the transmembrane domain helices. The study highlighted also the potent role of a particular 53 residues sequence located at the N terminal end of the enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29720078>Genetic effects of fatty  composition in muscle of Atlantic salmon.</a></h1><p>The replacement of fish oil (FO) and fishmeal with plant ingredients in the diet of farmed Atlantic salmon has resulted in reduced levels of the health-promoting long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) in their filets. Previous studies showed the potential of selective breeding to increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels in salmon tissues, but knowledge on the genetic parameters for individual muscle fatty acids (FA) and their relationships with other traits is still lacking. Thus, we estimated genetic parameters for muscle content of individual FA, and their relationships with  deposition traits, muscle pigmentation, sea lice and pancreas disease in slaughter-sized Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased n-3 LC-PUFA content and provide insight into FA  in Atlantic salmon muscle.Among the n-3 PUFA, proportional contents of  (ALA; 18:3n-3) and DHA had the highest heritability (0.26) and EPA the lowest (0.09). Genetic correlations of EPA and DHA proportions with muscle  differed considerably, 0.60 and 0.01, respectively. The genetic correlation of DHA proportion with visceral  was positive and high (0.61), whereas that of EPA proportion with lice density was negative. FA that are in close proximity along the bioconversion pathway showed positive correlations with each other, whereas the start (ALA) and end-point (DHA) of the pathway were negatively correlated (- 0.28), indicating active bioconversion of ALA to DHA in the muscle of fish fed high FO-diet.Since contents of individual FA in salmon muscle show additive genetic variation, changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Taken together, our results show that the heritabilities of individual n-3 LC-PUFA and their genetic correlations with other traits vary, which indicates that they play different roles in muscle , and that proportional muscle contents of EPA and DHA are linked to body  deposition. Thus, different selection strategies can be applied in order to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FAin the salmon muscle. We recommend selection for the proportion of EPA + DHA in the muscle because they are both essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on other traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279702>Analysis of Time-Series Gene Expression Data to Explore Mechanisms of Chemical-Induced Hepatic Steatosis Toxicity.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from simple fatty liver through steatosis with inflammation and necrosis to cirrhosis. One of the most challenging problems in biomedical research and within the chemical industry is to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex disease, and complex adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Based on a set of 28 steatotic chemicals with gene expression data measured on primary hepatocytes at three times (2, 8, and 24 h) and three doses (low, medium, and high), we identified genes and pathways, defined as molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) of steatosis using a combination of a time series and pathway analyses. Among the genes deregulated by these compounds, the study highlighted OSBPL9, ALDH7A1, MYADM, SLC51B, PRDX6, GPAT3, TMEM135, DLGDA5, BCO2, APO10LA, TSPAN6, NEURL1B, and DUSP1. Furthermore, pathway analysis indicated deregulation of pathways related to  accumulation, such as  digestion and absorption, linoleic and  , calcium signaling pathway, fatty  , peroxisome, retinol , and steroid metabolic pathways in a time dependent manner. Such transcription profile analysis can help in the understanding of the steatosis evolution over time generated by chemical exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649233>Euglena gracilis growth and cell composition under different temperature, light and trophic conditions.</a></h1><p>Euglena gracilis, a photosynthetic protist, produces protein, unsaturated fatty acids, wax esters, and a unique β-1,3-glucan called paramylon, along with other valuable compounds. The cell composition of E. gracilis was investigated in this study to understand how light and organic carbon (photo-, mixo- and heterotrophic conditions) affected growth and cell composition (especially lipids). Comparisons were primarily carried out in cultures grown at 23 °C, but the effect of growth at higher temperatures (27 or 30 °C) was also considered.Specific growth rates were slightly lower when E. gracilis was grown on glucose in either heterotrophic or mixotrophic conditions than when grown photoautotrophically, although the duration of exponential growth was longer. Temperature determined the rate of exponential growth in all cultures, but not the linear growth rate during light-limited growth in phototrophic conditions. Temperature had less effect on cell composition.Although E. gracilis was not expected to store large amounts of paramylon when grown phototrophically, we observed that phototrophic cells could contain up to 50% paramylon. These cells contained up to 33% protein and less than 20% lipophilic compounds, as expected. The biomass contained about 8% fatty acids (measured as fatty  methyl esters), most of which were unsaturated. The fatty  content of cells grown in mixotrophic conditions was similar to that observed in phototrophic cells, but was lower in cells grown heterotrophically. Heterotrophic cells contained less unsaturated fatty acids than phototrophic or mixotrophic cells. α- was present at 5 to 18 mg g-1 dry biomass in cells grown in the presence of light, but at < 0.5 mg g-1 biomass in cells grown in the dark. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were detected at 1 to 5 mg g-1 biomass. Light was also important for the production of vitamin E and phytol.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636691>Flaxseed oil ameliorated high--diet-induced bone loss in rats by promoting osteoblastic function in rat primary osteoblasts.</a></h1><p>α- (ALA) is a plant-derived omega-3 unsaturated fatty  that is rich in flaxseed oil (FO). The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high- diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% ), FO diet (NY, 10% ), HFD (60% ), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% ) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness, energy absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30139411>Review: Modulating ruminal  to improve the fatty  composition of meat and milk. Challenges and opportunities.</a></h1><p>Growth in demand for foods with potentially beneficial effects on consumer health has motivated increased interest in developing strategies for improving the nutritional quality of ruminant-derived products. Manipulation of the rumen environment offers the opportunity to modify the  composition of milk and meat by changing the availability of fatty acids (FA) for mammary and intramuscular  uptake. Dietary supplementation with marine lipids, plant secondary compounds and direct-fed microbials has shown promising results. In this review, we have compiled information about their effects on the concentration of putative desirable FA (e.g. c9t11-CLA and vaccenic, oleic, linoleic and  acids) in ruminal digesta, milk and intramuscular . Marine lipids rich in very long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) efficiently inhibit the last step of C18 FA biohydrogenation (BH) in the bovine, ovine and caprine, increasing the outflow of t11-18:1 from the rumen and improving the concentration of c9t11-CLA in the final products, but increments in t10-18:1 are also often found due to shifts toward alternative BH pathways. Direct-fed microbials appear to favourably modify rumen  but information is still very limited, whereas a wide variety of plant secondary compounds, including tannins, polyphenol oxidase, essential oils, oxygenated FA and saponins, has been examined with varying success. For example, the effectiveness of tannins and essential oils is as yet controversial, with some studies showing no effects and others a positive impact on inhibiting the first step of BH of PUFA or, less commonly, the final step. Further investigation is required to unravel the causes of inconsistent results, which may be due to the diversity in active components, ruminant species, dosage, basal diet composition and time on treatments. Likewise, research must continue to address ways to mitigate negative side-effects of some supplements on animal performance (particularly, milk  depression) and product quality (e.g. altered oxidative stability and shelf-life).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29366970>Leaf fatty  remodeling in the salt-excreting halophytic grass Spartina patens along a salinity gradient.</a></h1><p>Spartina patens is a highly dispersed halophytic grass invader in Mediterranean marshes. It is also characterized by having a high degree of resistance to salinity, one of the main drivers of plant zonation in salt marshes. Nevertheless, the physiological basis behind the extreme resistance of S. patens requires more detailed studies. In the present work, we aimed to study how membrane fatty  remodeling could contribute to the resistance of this plant to salt. Spartina patens individuals exposed to increasing levels of salinity and its leaf fatty  profile under  peroxidation products evaluated under all tested concentrations. A significant increase in the relative amounts of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) was observed, namely palmitic  (C16:0), essential for PS II functioning, and stearic (C18:0) . The chloroplastidial trans-hexadecenoic  (C16:1t) as well as the polyunsaturated linoleic (C18:2) and  (C18:3) acids showed significant decreases in all the salt treatments. These changes led to a reduction in the double bond index in salt-treated plants which reflects reduction of the fluidity of the chloroplast membranes, which could contribute to maintain the membrane impermeable to the toxic exogenous Na. Despite the decrease observed in the total fatty  contents in plants exposed to high salt concentrations the amounts of  peroxidation products decreased highlighting the resistance of this species towards toxic exogenous salt concentrations. Membrane fatty  remodeling could represent an efficient mechanism to maintain the photosynthetic machinery of S. patens highly efficient under salt stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Genome-wide association studies have reported associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and the plasma concentrations of PUFAs, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, much remains unknown regarding the molecular mechanisms explaining how variants affect the function of FADS1-FADS2 genes.Here, we sought to identify the functional variant(s) within the FADS gene cluster.To address this question, we (1) genotyped individuals (n = 540) for the rs174547 polymorphism to confirm associations with PUFA levels used as surrogate estimates of desaturase activities and (2) examined the functionality of variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs174547 using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.The rs174547 minor allele was associated with higher erythrocyte levels of dihomo-γ- and lower levels of arachidonic , suggesting a lower Δ5-desaturase activity. In silico analyses suggested that rs174545 and rs174546, in perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs174547, might alter miRNA binding sites in the FADS1 3'UTR. In HuH7 and HepG2 cells transfected with FADS1 3'UTR luciferase vectors, the haplotype constructs bearing the rs174546T minor allele showed 30% less luciferase activity. This relative decrease reached 60% in the presence of miR-149-5p and was partly abolished by cotransfection with an miR-149-5p inhibitor.This study identifies FADS1 rs174546 as a functional variant that may explain the associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and -related phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 National  Association.

Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of linseed supplementation and feeding duration on the fatty  profile, cholesterol and bioactive compounds of bovine meat. In total, 54 Friesian steers were randomly allocated during the finishing period into six experimental treatments following a 2×3 factorial design. The six treatments consisted of two diets, the control diet (CO) with no supplemental  and the linseed diet (LS) containing 10% whole linseed, fed 40, 75 or 120 days before slaughter. At the end of each finishing period, steers from the CO and LS groups were slaughtered. After 8 days of ageing chemical analysis, the fatty  profile, cholesterol content and bioactive compounds were determined from the longissimus thoracis muscle. Including linseed in the diet increased the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, CLA and n-3 PUFA, and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA. The percentage of myristic fatty  increased with the duration of feeding, regardless of diet and a decrease in PUFA and n-6 PUFA was observed in the CO and LS diets, respectively. Furthermore, meat from steers fed linseed showed an increased percentage of n-3 PUFA, , and EPA from 40 to 75 days of feeding, whereas vaccenic , CLA 9c,11t, and total CLA increased from 40 and 75 days but declined at 120 days. Beef from the linseed group had a higher content of bioactive substances such as creatine, carnosine and anserine than beef from the control group. The duration of feeding significantly affected the creatine concentrations, with an increase in the LS group from 40 to 75 days of feeding. Feeding linseed did not modify the cholesterol content, on average and the lowest cholesterol content was found in meat after 75 days of linseed administration. This study demonstrates that a short-term diet manipulation is sufficient to improve the nutritional properties of meat, including n-3 PUFA and bioactive compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138624>Metabolic Alterations in the Enoyl-CoA Hydratase 2 Mutant Disrupt Peroxisomal Pathways in Seedlings.</a></h1><p>Mobilization of seed storage compounds, such as starch and oil, is required to provide energy and metabolic building blocks during seedling development. Over 50% of fatty acids in Arabidopsis () seed oil have a cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Degradation of these substrates requires peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation plus additional enzyme activities. Such auxiliary enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH2, convert (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates to the core β-oxidation substrate (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. ECH2 was suggested to function in the peroxisomal conversion of indole-3-butyric  (IBA) to indole-3-acetic , because  seedlings have altered IBA responses. The underlying mechanism connecting ECH2 activity and IBA  is unclear. Here, we show that  seedlings have reduced root length, smaller cotyledons, and arrested pavement cell expansion. At the cellular level, reduced oil body mobilization and enlarged peroxisomes suggest compromised β-oxidation.  seedlings accumulate 3-hydroxyoctenoate (C8:1-OH) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8:0-OH), putative hydrolysis products of catabolic intermediates for α- and linoleic , respectively. Wild-type seedlings treated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate have like growth defects and altered IBA responses.  phenotypes are not rescued by Suc or auxin application. However,  phenotypes are suppressed in combination with the core β-oxidation mutants  or , and  seedlings accumulate less C8:1-OH and C8:0-OH than  seedlings. These results indicate that  phenotypes require efficient core β-oxidation. Our findings suggest that low ECH2 activity causes metabolic alterations through a toxic effect of the accumulating intermediates. These effects manifest in altered  and IBA responses leading to disrupted seedling development.© 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Transcriptome data provide information to explore Portulaca as a model system for galactolipids, leaf , and PUFA-rich designer lipids. Poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are gaining importance due to their innumerable health benefits, and hence, understanding their biosynthesis in plants has attained prominence in recent years. The most common source of PUFAs is of marine origin. Although reports have identified Portulaca oleracea (purslane) as a leaf source of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of  (ALA), the mechanism of ALA accumulation and its distribution into various lipids has not been elucidated. Here, we present the  profiles of leaves and seeds of several accessions of P. oleracea. Among the nineteen distinct accessions, the RR04 accession has the highest amount of ALA and is primarily associated with galactolipids. In addition, we report the transcriptome of RR04, and we have mapped the potential genes involved in . Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major site of acyl editing, which is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), an integral membrane protein that plays a major role in supplying oleate to the PC pool for further unsaturation. Our investigations using mass spectrometric analysis of leaf microsomal fractions identified LPCAT as part of a membrane protein complex. Both native and recombinant LPCAT showed strong acyltransferase activity with various acyl-CoA substrates. Altogether, the results suggest that ALA-rich glycerolipid biosynthetic machinery is highly active in nutritionally important Portulaca leaves. Furthermore, lipidome, transcriptome, and mass spectrometric analyses of RR04 provide novel information for exploring Portulaca as a potential resource and a model system for studying leaf .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30391848>Concomitant production of chitosan and lipids from a newly isolated Mucor circinelloides ZSKP for biodiesel production.</a></h1><p>A newly-isolated oleaginous fungus Mucor circinelloides ZSKP concurrently yielded 21.4% lipids and 11.2% chitosan per gram of biomass.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy , promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved  profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of  activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and oleic acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29508404>Effect of substituting fresh-cut perennial ryegrass with fresh-cut white clover on bovine milk fatty  profile.</a></h1><p>Including forage legumes in dairy systems can help address increasing environmental/economic concerns about perennial ryegrass monoculture pastures. This work investigated the effect of substituting fresh-cut grass with increasing quantities of fresh-cut white clover (WC) on milk fatty  (FA) profile and transfer efficiency of dietary linoleic (LA) and α- (ALNA) acids to milk . Three groups of three crossbred dairy cows were used in a 3 × 3 crossover design. Dietary treatments were 0 g kg WC + 600 g kg grass, 200 g kg WC + 400 g kg grass, and 400 g kg WC + 200 g kg grass. All treatments were supplemented with 400 g kg concentrates on a dry matter basis. Cows had a 19-day adaptation period to the experimental diet before a 6-day measurement period in individual tie stalls.Increasing dietary WC did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield or milk concentrations of , protein or lactose. Milk polyunsaturated FA concentrations (total n-3, total n-6, LA and ALNA) and transfer efficiency of LA and ALNA were increased with increasing dietary WC supply.Inclusion of WC in pastures may increase concentrations of nutritionally beneficial FA, without influencing milk yield and basic composition, but any implications on human health cannot be drawn. © 2018 The Authors.

In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , oleic , and α-). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several fatty acids. Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with  and sterol biosynthesis, amino  , TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of volatile compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds.

We therefore hypothesized that the combination of these dietary factors may ameliorate  more than the factors individually. Moreover, α-lipoic  exerts strong anti-oxidative activity. Hence, we also hypothesized that α-lipoic  may attenuate perilla oil-mediated oxidative stress. We therefore studied the combined effects of perilla oil and α-lipoic  on  and parameters of oxidative stress. Male rats were fed diets supplemented with 0 or 2.0 g/kg R-α-lipoic  and containing 120 g/kg of palm (saturated ), corn (linoleic ), or perilla oil (α-) for 23 days. Perilla oil compared with other fats decreased serum  concentrations in rats fed α-lipoic -free diets; however, the combination of perilla oil with α-lipoic  was ineffective for observing more marked decreases in serum  levels. Alterations in hepatic fatty  synthesis and oxidation may account for the observed changes. Perilla oil, compared with palm and corn oils, strongly increased the malondialdehyde level in the serum and liver. α-Lipoic  counteracted the increases in these parameters even though the effects were attenuated in the liver. α-Lipoic  increased the parameters of the anti-oxidant system. The results suggested that α-lipoic  can ameliorate oxidative stress induced by perilla oil, but the combination of these dietary factors was ineffective for additionally reducing serum  levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α- (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and  peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal obesity.Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low- diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high- diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, , mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal obesity reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of arachidonic  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high  diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high- diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218175>Comparison of liver transcriptome from high- and low-intramuscular  Chaohu ducks provided additional candidate genes for  selection.</a></h1><p>The meat quality of ducks is closely related to the intramuscular  (IMF) content. This study explored the candidate regulatory genes of IMF formation and  deposition in Chaohu ducks. The IMF of breast muscle in 100 ducks was determined and statistically analysed by normal distribution test. Duck liver samples with high IMF (CH,  = 3) and low IMF (CL,  = 3) were selected for transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The IMF was in accordance with normal distribution ( = 0.001, = 0.999). The IMF from two tails of the normal distribution was significantly different with 2.9983% ± 0.3296% in the CH group and 1.1960% ± 0.1481% in the CL group (< 0.0001). RNA-Seq revealed 147 differentially expressed genes, including 78 up-regulated and 69 down-regulated genes in both groups. Validation by qRT-PCR was in agreement with RNA-Seq (  = 0.838). Gene ontology analysis revealed that organophosphate catabolism, oxidation-reduction process, cellular  catabolism,  transport,  localisation,  biosynthesis and cellular  catabolism were involved in . Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis,  , glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and linoleic   were involved in  deposition, wherein the genes , , , , -, , , ,  and  were involved in  deposition.

There are several types of hair loss that differ in causes, symptoms, and spatial and temporal progression. Androgenic alopecia, a common form of hair loss, is the consequence of a decreased microcirculation of the scalp as well as the toxic action of elevated dihydrotestosterone levels on the hair bulbs. In the present study, the lotions TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Uomo and TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Donna, containing dihomo-γ- (DGLA), S-equol, and propionyl-l-carnitine, were tested on 30 men and 30 women (mean age of men was 46.6 ± 6.4 years; mean age of women was 49.5 ± 9.0) with signs of androgenic alopecia, respectively. DGLA is a precursor of the prostaglandin PGE1, which acts by improving microcirculation; S-equol inhibits 5α-reductases, thus preventing the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone; and propionyl-l-carnitine promotes , stimulating energy production. These three molecules are loaded into liposomes for their effective transdermal delivery. Daily topical applications of the lotions resulted in a hair count that significantly increased for women and marginally increased for men after 6 months of treatment. Furthermore, significant increase in anagen hair and a significant decrease in telogen hair were observed starting from 3 months in male and 1 month in female patients. Thus, the formulations under investigation were effective in attenuating androgenic alopecia-related hair loss in men and women.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357272>Recent insight and future techniques to enhance rumen fermentation in dairy goats.</a></h1><p>Recent development of novel techniques in systems biology have been used to improve and manipulate the rumen microbial ecosystem and gain a deeper understanding of its physiological and microbiological interactions and relationships. This provided a deeper insight and understanding of the relationship and interactions between the rumen microbiome and the host animal. New high-throughput techniques have revealed that the dominance of Proteobacteria in the neonatal gut might be derived from the maternal placenta through fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, which gradually decreases in the reticulum, omasum, and abomasum with increasing age after birth. Multi "omics" technologies have also enhanced rumen fermentation and production efficiency of dairy goats using dietary interventions through greater knowledge of the links between nutrition, , and the rumen microbiome and their effect in the environment. For example, supplementation of dietary , such as linseed, affects rumen fermentation by favoring the accumulation of α- biohydrogenation with a high correlation to the relative abundance of Fibrobacteriaceae. This provides greater resolution of the interlinkages among nutritional strategies, rumen microbes, and  of the host animal that can set the foundation for new advancements in ruminant nutrition using multi 'omics' technologies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121511>Transcriptomic comparison of two barley genotypes differing in arsenic tolerance exposed to arsenate and phosphate treatments.</a></h1><p>Arsenic (As) is a ubiquitous metalloid and toxic to plants. Chemical similarity between arsenate and phosphate (P) indicates possible antagonism between them in uptake and transportation. However, there is little study to reveal the interaction of As and P at transcriptional level. In this study RNA-sequencing was conducted on the two barley genotypes differing in As tolerance. A total of 2942 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were inclusively expressed in both genotypes under As (100 μM) and As (100 μM) + P (50 μM), and these DEGs included hormonal signaling, stress responsive, transport related and transcription factors. P addition in the culture solution inhibited the KEGG pathways related to ABC transporters, ether ,  , endocytosis and RNA transport. ZDB160 had a higher expression of DEGs associated with hormone signaling, secondary metabolites and stress defense under P conditions compared to ZDB475, which might explain its tolerance mechanism to As under P condition. The abscisic , jasmonic  and salicylic  signaling pathways were also significantly regulated under As + P conditions, which may also account for genotypic differences. Finally we drew up a hypothetical model of high As + P stress tolerance mechanism in ZDB160. It may be concluded that ZDB160 achieves its tolerance to As under P by up-regulating P transporters, resulting in more P uptake and less As translocation. The identified candidate genes related to As + P tolerance may provide insights into understanding As tolerance under limited P conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study envisaged to develop doxorubicin (Dox) loaded folate functionalized nanoemulsion (NE) for profound therapeutic activity against mammary gland cancer. NE was prepared using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams utilizing α- (ALA) as  phase, to further enhance the anticancer potential of Dox. Box-Behnken design was employed to systematically develop the NE. Optimized NE (f-Dox-NE) was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo performance. f-Dox-NE, with globule size 55.2 ± 3.3 nm, zeta potential - 31 ± 2 mV, entrapment 92.51 ± 3.62%, drug loading 0.42 ± 0.08% and percent drug release 94.86 ± 1.87% in 72 h, was capable of reducing cell viability in MCF-7 cell lines vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug. Further, mechanistic studies in MCF-7 cell lines demonstrated that f-Dox-NE induces cellular apoptosis by reactive oxygen species generated and mitochondrial membrane mediated apoptosis. The antitumor effect was evaluated in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary gland tumor in female Albino Wistar rats. f-Dox-NE exhibited enhanced antitumor targeting potential, therapeutic safety and efficacy vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug, as revealed by tumor volume, animal survival, weight variation, cardiotoxicity and biodistribution studies. f-Dox-NE restored the biochemical parameters viz., SOD, catalase, TBARS and protein carbonyl, towards normal levels in comparison to DMBA induced animal group. f-Dox-NE displayed downregulation of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and MMP-9) proteins and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-9 and BAX). The experimental results suggest that ALA augmented folate functionalized NE are able to overcome the challenges of developing safe and effective delivery system with enhanced potential for mammary gland carcinoma therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746616>A regulatory insertion-deletion polymorphism in the FADS gene cluster influences PUFA and  profiles among Chinese adults: a population-based study.</a></h1><p>Arachidonic  (AA) is the major polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) substrate for potent eicosanoid signaling to modulate inflammation and thrombosis and is controlled in part by tissue abundance. Fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) catalyzes synthesis of omega-6 (n-3) AA and n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The rs66698963 polymorphism, a 22-base pair (bp) insertion-deletion 137 bp downstream of a sterol regulatory element in FADS2 intron 1, mediates expression of FADS1 in vitro, as well as exerting positive selection in several human populations. The associations between the polymorphism rs66698963 and plasma PUFAs as well as disease phenotypes are unclear.This study aimed to evaluate the relation between rs66698963 genotypes and plasma PUFA concentrations and blood  profiles.Plasma fatty acids were measured from a single sample obtained at baseline in 1504 healthy Chinese adults aged between 35 and 59 y with the use of gas chromatography. Blood lipids were measured at baseline and a second time at the 18-mo follow-up. The rs66698963 genotype was determined by using agarose gel electrophoresis. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between genotype and plasma PUFAs and blood lipids.A shift from the precursors linoleic  and α- to produce AA and EPA, respectively, was observed, consistent with FADS1 activity increasing in the order of genotypes D/D to I/D to I/I. For I/I compared with D/D carriers, plasma concentrations of n-6 AA and the ratio of AA to n-3 EPA plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were 57% and 32% higher, respectively. Carriers of the deletion (D) allele of rs66698963 tended to have higher triglycerides (β = 0.018; SE: 0.009; P = 0.05) and lower HDL cholesterol (β = -0.008; SE: 0.004; P = 0.02) than carriers of the insertion (I) allele.The rs66698963 genotype is significantly associated with AA concentrations and AA to EPA+DHA ratio, reflecting basal risk of inflammatory and related chronic disease phenotypes, and is correlated with the risk of dyslipidemia.

Positive effects of diet, polyenic fatty acids, statins and fibrates.]</a></h1><p>Inhibition of hydrolysis of palmitic and oleic triglycedires (TG) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), slow formation of active apoВ-100 conformation, blockade of апоЕ/В-100 ligand formation in VLDL and their reduced uptake by insulin-dependent cells cause hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Palmitic and oleic VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and  LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis.

There is a lack of data on the human milk fatty  composition of Cambodian women compared with data from Western women. Research Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the human milk fatty  composition of women living in Cambodia and compare it with that of women living in Australia.Human milk samples from Cambodian ( n = 67) and Australian ( n = 200) mothers were collected at 3 to 4 months postpartum. Fatty  composition was analyzed using capillary gas chromatography followed by Folch extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), and  content was measured gravimetrically.Compared with Australian participants, human milk from Cambodian participants contained a significantly lower level of total  (2.90 vs. 3.45 g/dL, p = .028), lower percentages of linoleic  (9.30% vs. 10.66%, p < .0001) and α- (0.42% vs. 0.95%, p < .0001), but higher percentages of arachidonic  (0.68% vs. 0.38%, p < .0001) and docosahexaenoic  (0.40% vs. 0.23%, p < .0001).Differences in human milk fatty  composition between Cambodian and Australian participants may be explained by differences in the dietary patterns between the two populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29562889>Transcriptomic analysis of Perilla frutescens seed to insight into the biosynthesis and metabolic of unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h1><p>Perilla frutescens is well known for its high α- (ALA) accumulation in seeds and medicinal values as well as a source of edible and general-purpose oils. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the biosynthesis of fatty  in its seeds remain poorly understood due to the lacking of sequenced genome. For better understanding the regulation of  and further increase its oil content or modify oil composition, time-course transcriptome and  composition analyses were performed.Analysis of fatty  content and composition showed that the α- and oleic  accumulated rapidly from 5 DAF to 15 DAF and then kept relatively stable. However, the amount of palmitic  and linoleic  decreased quickly from 5 DAF to 15DAF. No significant variation of stearic  content was observed from 5 DAF to 25DAF. Our transcriptome data analyses revealed that 110,176 unigenes were generated from six seed libraries at 5, 10, 20 DAF. Of these, 53 (31 up, 22 down) and 653 (259 up, 394 down) genes showed temporal and differentially expression during the seed development in 5 DAF vs 10 DAF, 20 vs 10 DAF, respectively. The differentially expressed genes were annotated and found to be involved in distinct functional categories and metabolic pathways. Deep mining of transcriptome data led to the identification of key genes involved in fatty  and triacylglycerol biosynthesis and . Thirty seven members of transcription factor family AP2, B3 and NFYB putatively involved in oil synthesis and deposition were differentially expressed during seed development. The results of qRT-PCR for selected genes showed a strong positive correlation with the expression abundance measured in RNA-seq analysis.The present study provides valuable genomic resources for characterizing Perilla seed gene expression at the transcriptional level and will extend our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events of oil biosynthesis and accumulation in oilseed crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580947>In vitro biohydrogenation of C-labeled α- in response to ruminal alterations associated with diet-induced milk  depression in ewes.</a></h1><p>The basis for marine -induced milk  depression (MFD) has not been established yet, but recent reports suggest the putative contribution of shifts in the ruminal  of α- (ALA). To test this hypothesis, an isotopic tracer approach was used in batch cultures of rumen microorganisms with inoculum collected from cannulated ewes fed either a total mixed ration without  supplementation (control inoculum) or the same diet supplemented with 2% of fish oil, which is known to cause MFD in lactating sheep (FO-MFD inoculum). The [1-C]ALA was added at a dose of 1% of incubated dry matter and the proportions of C-labeled fatty acids (FA) were examined after 24 h of incubation, using complementary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) analyses. Expected differences in FA profiles were confirmed between control and FO-MFD inocula (e.g., large decreases in 18:0 and increases in most 18:1 and 18:2 intermediates, particularly trans isomers, to fish oil supply). The biohydrogenation of ALA was extensive and yielded multiple metabolites, with a total of 48 chromatographic peaks showing C enrichment, regardless of the inoculum type. However, although ALA was biohydrogenated through common pathways under standard or MFD conditions, large changes in the accumulation of C-labeled FA suggest important differences in the relative contribution of each specific route. First, increased accumulation of trans-11-containing FA in FO-MFD incubations was accompanied by a general repression of the trans-13/14 pathway (supported by lower trans-13+14 18:1 or trans-11,trans-13 18:2 proportions), together with a lower production of cis FA (e.g., cis-9, -12, and -15 18:1 and some cis,cis 18:2). Results also downplayed the relevance of the trans-11 to trans-10 shift as an effective marker of diet-induced MFD in sheep, and challenged the involvement of some trans-10 intermediates (e.g., trans-10 18:1 and trans-10,cis-15 18:2) in the low- milk syndrome in this species. Conversely, increased abundance of most 18:3 intermediates (including some unidentified isomers) might be representative of ruminal alterations related to fish oil supplementation in ewes. Further research is necessary to examine the potential association between these findings and MFD in lactating animals.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To compare the separate effects of individual dietary n-3 PUFA on oxylipins in different adipose depots (gonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, subcutaneous) in males and females, rats were provided diets containing higher levels of α- (ALA), EPA or DHA. Each n-3 PUFA enhanced its respective oxylipins the most, while effects on other n-3 oxylipins varied. For example: in perirenal and subcutaneous depots, more DHA oxylipins were higher with dietary ALA than with EPA; dietary EPA uniquely decreased 14-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic , in contrast to increasing many other DHA oxylipins. The n-3 PUFAs also reduced oxylipins from n-6 PUFAs in order of effectiveness: DHA > EPA > ALA. Diet by sex interactions in all depots except the perirenal depot resulted in higher oxylipins in males given DHA, and higher oxylipins in females given the other diets. Diet and sex effects on oxylipins did not necessarily reflect effects on either their tissue phospholipid or neutral  PUFA precursors. These varying diet and sex effects on oxylipins in the different adipose sites indicate that they may have distinct effects on adipose function.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Linoleic  (LA) and α- (ALA) are members of two classes of PUFAs, namely the n-6 and n-3 series, which are required for normal human health. Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (inflammation, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins. Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of n-3 PUFAs seems mostly to be tissue-dependent and acts in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, dietary n-3 PUFAs widely affect the  oxidation susceptibility of all tissues. In conclusion, sustainable sources of n-3 PUFAs are limited and exert a different effect about (1) the form in which they are administered, precursor or derivatives; (2) their antioxidant protections; and (3) the purpose to be achieved (health improvement, physiological and reproductive traits, metabolic pathways, etc.).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114195>Delivering amoxicillin at the infection site - a rational design through  nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>Amoxicillin is a commonly used antibiotic, although degraded by the acidic pH of the stomach.

The reproductive system appears to be strongly affected by administration of n-3 PUFA, and ingredients rich in α- (ALA; i.e. vegetable sources) or EPA and DHA acids (i.e. fish oil) can be included in animal diets to balance PUFA intake. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with flaxseed (ALA) or fish oil (EPA and DHA) on PUFA  in rabbit does. A total of 60 New Zealand White female rabbits were assigned to three experimental groups: control group, FLAX group fed 10% extruded flaxseed and FISH group fed 3% fish oil. Blood, milk, liver and ovaries were collected from the does to assess the  composition; furthermore, FADS2 gene expression was assessed in liver and ovary tissues. Reproductive performance of does was also recorded. The fertility rate and number of weaned rabbits improved with n-3 dietary supplementation: does at first parity showed the lowest reproductive results, but the administration of n-3 reduced the gap between primiparous and multiparous does. Feed consumption and milk production were not affected by the feeding regime. The fatty  composition of milk, plasma, liver and ovaries were widely influenced by diet, showing higher concentrations of n-3 long-chain PUFA (LCP) in does fed with n-3 enriched diets. FISH diet resulted in the highest n-3 LCP enrichment, whereas in the FLAX group, this increase was lower. Blood and milk showed low levels of LCP, whereas liver and ovaries were the main sites of n-3 LCP synthesis and accumulation. Accordingly, although the liver is the main metabolic centre for LCP synthesis, ovaries also have a prominent role in LCP generation. FADS2 expression in liver and ovary tissue was downregulated by FISH administration. In conclusion, the enrichment of diets with n-3 PUFA could be an effective strategy for improving the reproductive performance of does.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337051>Identification and Characterization of MiRNAs in  C-169.</a></h1><p> C-169 (C-169) is an oleaginous microalga which is promising for renewable biofuel production. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as the pivotal modulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level, are prospective candidates for bioengineering practice. However, so far, no miRNA in C-169 has been reported and its potential impact upon CO supplementation remains unclear. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from C-169 cultured in air or 2% CO revealed 124 miRNAs in total, including 118 conserved miRNAs and six novel ones. In total, 384 genes were predicted as their potential target genes, 320 for conserved miRNAs and 64 for novel miRNAs. The annotated target genes were significantly enriched in six KEGG pathways, including pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, C5-branched dibasic  , 2-oxocarboxylic  , butanoate , valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and  . The miRNAs' target genes were enriched in  as well as RNA-interacting proteins involved in translation, transcription and rRNA processing.

However, FA  differs between different organs, suggesting a distinct partitioning of highly relevant FA. For the present study in cattle, a novel technology was applied to overcome rumen biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA. Angus heifers were fed a straw-based diet supplemented for 8 weeks with 450 g/day of rumen-protected oil, either from fish (FO) or sunflower (SO). The FA composition in blood and five important organs, namely heart, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen, was examined. In blood, proportions of polyunsaturated FA were increased by supplementing FO compared to SO. The largest increase of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) proportion was found with FO instead of SO in the kidney, the lowest in the lung. Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was increased more in the liver than in kidney, lung, and spleen. The heart incorporated seven times more EPA than DHA, which is more than all other organs and described here for the first time in ruminants. In addition, the heart had the highest proportions of α- (18:3n-3) and linoleic  (18:2n-6) of all organs. The proportions of polyunsaturated FA in the lung and spleen were exceptionally low compared to heart, liver, and kidney. In conclusion, it was shown that the response to FO in the distribution of dietary n-3 FA was organ-specific while proportions of n-6 FA were quite inert with respect to the type of oil supplemented.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30237797>Dietary Supplementation With ω6 LC-PUFA-Rich Algae Modulates Zebrafish Immune Function and Improves Resistance to Streptococcal Infection.</a></h1><p>Arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4-6) and dihomo-γ- (DGLA, 20:3-6) are omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), which are key precursors for  mediators of the immune system and inflammatory response. The microalga  (WT) and its Δ5-desaturase mutant P127 (MUT) are unique photosynthetic sources for ARA and DGLA, respectively. This study explores the effect of dietary supplementation with  and P127 biomass on tissue fatty  composition, immune function, and disease resistance in zebrafish (). The broken microalgal biomass was added to commercial fish feed at 7.5 and 15% (w/w), providing 21.8 mg/g feed ARA for the WT-supplemented group and 13.6 mg/g feed DGLA for the MUT-supplemented group at the 15% inclusion levels. An unsupplemented group was used as the control. After 1 month of feeding, fish were challenged with . Fish were sampled before the challenge and 1 week after the challenge for various analyses. Tissue ARA and DGLA levels significantly increased in the liver, corresponding to microalgal supplementation levels. The elevated expression of specific immune-related genes was evident in the kidneys in all treatment groups after 1 month of feeding, including genes related to eicosanoid synthesis, lysozyme, and NF-κB. In the liver, microalgal supplementation led to the upregulation of genes related to immune function and antioxidant defense while the expression of examined genes involved in ARA  was downregulated. Importantly, fish fed with 15% of both WT- and MUT-supplemented feed showed significantly ( < 0.05) higher survival percentages (78 and 68%, respectively, as compared to only 46% in the control group). The elevated expression of genes related to inflammatory and immune responses was evident post-challenge. Collectively, the results of the current study demonstrate the potential of microalgae-derived dietary ARA and DGLA in improving immune competence and resistance to bacterial infection in zebrafish as a model organism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376347>Effects of dietary perilla seed oil supplementation on , meat quality, and fatty  profiles in Yellow-feathered chickens.</a></h1><p>This study evaluated the effect of the dietary replacement of 1% lard (CT) with 1% perilla oil (PO), 0.9% perilla oil + 0.1% anise oil (PA), or 0.9% perilla oil + 0.1% ginger oil (PG) on indices of , antioxidant capacity, meat quality, and fatty  profiles from Yellow-feathered chickens at day 63. Compared with the CT chickens, those given perilla oil had decreased (P < 0.05) plasma  levels including triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCH), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Hepatic TG, TCH levels, and fatty  synthase activity were also decreased (P < 0.05) in chickens fed diets containing perilla oil. Abdominal  percentage was significantly decreased in birds fed the PG compared to CT diets. Birds fed the PA or PG diets had increased (P < 0.05) hepatic total SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase than in chickens given PO alone. In addition, the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in breast muscle was lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed PO compared with those given PG, and the reverse was true for content of malondialdehyde. Compared with the CT diet, the PO diet decreased breast muscle shear values and increased yellowness (b*) of breast muscle (P < 0.05). Birds fed the PA or PG diets had meat with better overall acceptability than those fed the CT diet. Chickens fed perilla oil diets exhibited higher contents of α- (C18:3n-3), DHA (22:6n-3), polyunsaturated fatty acids, and n-3 fatty acids, together with a lower content of myristic  (C14:0), palmitic  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0), total saturated fatty acids, and n-6/n-3 ratio compared to controls (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that perilla oil has the potential to decrease -related indices and improve fatty  profiles of breast meat in chickens without adverse effect on antioxidant status or meat quality; this was even better when perilla oil was given together with anise oil or ginger oil.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790287>Nutritional properties of organic and conventional beef meat at retail.</a></h1><p>Consumers perceive that organic meat has superior nutritional properties compared to conventional meat, although the available evidence from commercial samples is very scarce. The present study compared the nutritional composition of organic and conventional beef meat sold at retail, including, for the first time, the bioactive compounds coenzyme Q , carnosine, anserine, creatine and taurine. Sampling comprised two muscles: longissimus thoracis and supraspinatus.Organic beef had 17% less cholesterol, 32% less , 16% less fatty acids, 24% less monounsaturated fatty acids, 170% more α-, 24% more α-tocopherol, 53% more β-carotene, 34% more coenzyme Q and 72% more taurine than conventional beef. Differences between organic and conventional samples were clearly dependent on the muscle because longissimus thoracis and supraspinatus showed different patterns of compound accumulation.To our knowledge, a higher amount of bioactive compounds in organic beef meat is reported for the first time in the present study. Retail organic beef had a higher nutritional value than retail conventional beef, which resulted from better-balanced  and bioactive compound contents. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201972>Co-overexpression of native phospholipid-biosynthetic genes plsX and plsC enhances  production in Synechocystis sp.

Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets consisting of 50% calories from lard, 5% from soybean, and 5% from corn oil (HFD), or 50% calories from lard and 10% from BRS oil (HFD + BRS oil diet) for 12 weeks. Six-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed diets consisting of 16% calories from soybean oil (standard diet), 8% from soybean, and 8% from BRS oil, or 16% from BRS oil for 10 weeks. The BRS oil diets lowered the levels of triacylglycerol, nonesterified fatty acids, and total cholesterol in serum and liver of both of the obese and db/db mice as compared with the HFD and standard diet, respectively. mRNA levels of lipogenesis markers including cluster of differentiation 36, fatty--binding protein 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty- synthase, and solute carrier family 25 member 1 in the liver of the BRS oil groups were lower than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. On the other hand, fatty- oxidation markers including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase α, and acyl-CoA oxidase in the liver of the BRS oil groups were higher than those in the liver of the HFD and standard groups in the obese and db/db mice, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mRNA and protein levels increased in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of the obese and db/db mice fed BRS oil compared with HFD and standard diet, respectively.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated. In this work, the effect of oral supplementation of ALA from chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seed oil and anthocyanins from a purple corn extract (PCE) on gene expression of SREBP-1c, PPAR-α and Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases (Δ5D and Δ6D), the activity of these enzymes in the liver as well as the hepatic  profile were evaluated in thirty-six female Sprague Dawley rats whose diet was supplemented with olive oil (OL), chia oil (CH), olive oil and PCE (OL + PCE) or chia oil and PCE (CH + PCE). Gene expression of PPAR-α was significantly higher when supplemented with CH and CH + PCE, SREBP-1c gene expression was higher when supplemented with chia oil. CH supplementation enhanced Δ5D expression whereas no significant differences between treatments were observed concerning Δ6D gene expression. Activities of both desaturases were increased by including olive oil (OL + PCE and OL), and they were found to be higher in CH + PCE respect to CH for both enzymes. The ALA and n-3 LCPUFAs hepatic content was higher with CH, decreasing the levels of AA and n-6 LCPUFAs. It is concluded that the joint action of flavonoids such as anthocyanins and ALA show an anti-adipogenic effect. Desaturase activity was inhibited by ALA and kept by the anthocyanins from PCE, thus anthocyanins would exert a protective effect on the desaturase activity but they would not affect on its gene expression, however, high doses of ALA increased the production of its metabolites, masking the effect of PCE.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, excessive or unresolved inflammation can lead to uncontrolled tissue damage, pathology and disease. In humans on a Western diet, the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  arachidonic  (ARA) makes a significant contribution to the fatty acids present in the membrane phospholipids of cells involved in inflammation. ARA is a precursor to a number of potent pro-inflammatory mediators including well described prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which has led to the development of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals that target the ARA pathway to successfully control inflammation. Hence, it is commonly believed that increasing dietary intake of the omega-6 fatty acids ARA or its precursor linoleic  (LA) will increase inflammation. However, studies in healthy human adults have found that increased intake of ARA or LA does not increase the concentrations of many inflammatory markers. Epidemiological studies have even suggested that ARA and LA may be linked to reduced inflammation. Contrastingly, there is also evidence that a high omega-6 fatty  diet inhibits the anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving effect of the omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, the interaction of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and their  mediators in the context of inflammation is complex and still not properly understood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown -specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous  pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic  (STA; 18:0), oleic  (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic  (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α- (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ- (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic  (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty  effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty  and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation. These results indicate that different adipocyte cell types have different levels of sensitivity to both LCFA and beta agonists in regard to induction of brown -specific gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591336>Production, milk fatty  profile, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows supplemented with ground flaxseed.</a></h1><p>Flaxseed has been extensively used as a supplement for dairy cows because of its high concentrations of energy and the n-3 fatty  (FA) cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3. However, limited information is available regarding the effect of ground flaxseed on dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, and nutrient utilization in grazing dairy cows. Twenty multiparous Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 111 ± 49 d in milk in the beginning of the study were used in a randomized complete block design to investigate the effects of supplementing herbage (i.e., grazed forage) with ground corn-soybean meal mix (control diet = CTRL) or ground flaxseed (flaxseed diet = FLX) on animal production, milk FA, ruminal , and nutrient digestibility. The study was conducted from June to September 2013, with data and sample collection taking place on wk 4, 8, 12, and 16. Cows were fed a diet formulated to yield a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio consisting of (dry matter basis): 40% cool-season perennial herbage, 50% partial total mixed ration, and 10% of ground corn-soybean meal mix or 10% ground flaxseed. However, estimated herbage DMI averaged 5.59 kg/d or 34% of the total DMI. Significant treatment by week interactions were observed for milk and blood urea N, and several milk FA (e.g., trans-10 18:1). No significant differences between treatments were observed for herbage and total DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, concentrations and yields of milk components, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Total-tract digestibility of organic matter decreased, whereas that of neutral detergent fiber increased with feeding FLX versus CTRL. No treatment effects were observed for ruminal concentrations of total volatile FA and NH-N, and ruminal proportions of acetate and propionate. Ruminal butyrate tended to decrease, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio decreased in the FLX diet. Most saturated and unsaturated FA in milk  were changed. Specifically, milk proportion of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σn-3 FA, and Σ18C FA increased, whereas that of cis-9,cis-12 18:2, Σn-6 FA, Σ odd-chain FA, Σ<16C FA, and Σ16C FA decreased with feeding FLX versus the CTRL diet. In conclusion, feeding FLX did not change yields of milk and milk components, but increased milk n-3 FA. Therefore, costs and industry adoption of premiums for n-3-enriched milk will determine the adoption of ground flaxseed in pasture-based dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The results showed that EQ and extracts of Angelica sinensis (EAs) inhibited  oxidation in material above. Of all of the examined EAs, EAE showed the strongest protective effects against the  oxidation. Moreover, EAE at high concentrations showed a stronger inhibitory effect on  oxidation than that of EQ. Next, 7 experimental diets that respectively supplemented 0.0, 0.2, 0.8 and 3.2 g kg of EQ and EAE were fed to 280 juvenile red carp (Cyprinus carpio var. xingguonensis) with seven treatment groups for 30 days. The results indicated that dietary EAE improved growth performance in carp. Moreover, dietary EAE increased the activities of trypsin, lipase, alpha-amylase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and decreased plasma ammonia content in carp. Meanwhile, dietary EAE reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and raised the activities of anti-superoxide anion, anti-hydroxyl radical, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase and the content of reduced glutathione in the hepatopancreas and intestine of carp. However, with the exception of GPT, dietary EQ got the opposite results to dietary EAE in carp. These results revealed that dietary EAE improved the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish. However, dietary EQ inhibited the digestive, absorptive and antioxidant capacities in fish.

The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in  content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic  (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated  acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic  (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

We investigated changes to the n-3 HUFA score of healthy adults, induced by different types and amounts of conjugated linoleic  (CLA)-enriched (ENCH) cheeses consumed for different periods of time, compared to dietary fish oil (FO) pills (500 mg, each containing 100 mg of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids—EPA+DHA) or α- (ALA)-rich linseed oil (4 g, containing 2 g of ALA). A significant increase in the n-3 HUFA score was observed, in a dose-dependent manner, after administration of the FO supplement. In terms of the impact on the n-3 HUFA score, the intake of ENCH cheese (90 g/day) for two or four weeks was equivalent to the administration of one or two FO pills, respectively. Conversely, the linseed oil intake did not significantly impact the n-3 HUFA score. Feeding ENCH cheeses from different sources (bovine, ovine and caprine) for two months improved the n-3 HUFA score by increasing plasma DHA, and the effect was proportional to the CLA content in the cheese. We suggest that the improved n-3 HUFA score resulting from ENCH cheese intake may be attributed to increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) activity.

The gut microbiota is involved in the host energy  through the regulation of body  storage, and a link between diet, FFA and the intestinal microbiota seems to exist. Our aim was to explore the interaction among serum FFA levels, gut microbiota, diet and obesity through a model regression tree in 66 subjects (age 52.7 ± 11.2 y) classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma- and palmitic acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively.

The search for sustainable disease control measure is of extreme importance, thus becoming imperative to fully characterize the mechanisms leading to an incompatible interaction. We have previously shown that  signalling events play an important role in grapevine's response to this pathogen, namely through changes in  content,  peroxidation and jasmonic  synthesis. Here, we have characterized the modulation of  in leaves from two V. vinifera cultivars (resistant and susceptible to P. viticola) in the first hours after pathogen inoculation. Prior to pathogen inoculation both genotypes present an inherently different fatty  composition that is highly modulated in the resistant genotype after pathogen challenge. Such changes involve modulation of phospholipase A activity suggesting that the source of lipids mobilized upon pathogen infection are the chloroplast membranes. This work thus provides original evidence on the involvement of  signalling and phospholipases in grapevine immune responses to pathogen infection. The results are discussed considering the implications on the plant's physiological status and the use of discriminating /fatty acids pattern in future selection procedures of cultivars.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30740707>n-3 Fatty Acids Abrogate Dyslipidemia-Induced Changes in Bile  Uptake, Synthesis, and Transport in Young and Aged Dyslipidemic Rats.</a></h1><p>In this study, the effect of n-3 fatty acids (FA) [α- (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) + docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] on the intestinal bile  (BA) uptake, hepatic BA synthesis, and enterohepatic bile  transporters (BAT) was assessed in young and aged dyslipidemic rats. Dyslipidemia was induced in young and aged rats by feeding a high- (HF) diet. Experimental groups received diets containing canola oil (HF + CNO) and fish oil (HF + FO) as a source of ALA and EPA + DHA, respectively. After 60 days of feeding, intestinal BA uptake and expression of apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter (Asbt), organic solute transporter-alpha/beta (Osta/b) messenger RNA (mRNA), and hepatic expression of Na taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), bile salt export pump (Bsep), cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase A1 (Cyp7a1), Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp), liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), and hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha (Hnf4a) mRNA were measured. Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and total BA in serum, liver, and feces were assessed. The dyslipidemic HF group had: (1) increased intestinal BA uptake and Asbt and Osta/b mRNA expression, (2) increased BA in serum, (3) decreased hepatic expression of Ntcp, Bsep, and Cyp7a1 mRNA, (4) increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, (5) increased hepatic expression of Fxr and Shp mRNA, (6) decreased hepatic expression of Lrh-1 and Hnf4a mRNA, and (7) decreased BA in feces, when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. Immunostaining revealed increased expression of intestinal Asbt and hepatic Ntcp protein in the HF group when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. n-3 FA abrogated dyslipidemia-induced changes in the intestinal uptake, hepatic synthesis, and enterohepatic transporters of BA in both young and aged rats. EPA + DHA was more effective than ALA in modulating dyslipidemia-induced changes.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195114>Growth performance and immune status in common carp Cyprinus carpio as affected by plant oil-based diets complemented with β-glucan.</a></h1><p>Omnivorous fish species such as the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are able to biosynthesise long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) from plant oil PUFA precursors, but the influence of the amount and quality of the LC-PUFAs biosynthesised from these oils on the immunocompetence status of the fish has received little attention. This study aims to evaluate whether the conversion of PUFA by carp induces a sufficient biosynthesis of LC-PUFA to maintain a good immunocompetence status in this species. Six iso-nitrogenous (crude protein = 39.1%) and iso-lipidic (crude lipids = 10%) diets containing three different  sources (cod liver oil (CLO) as fish oil; linseed oil (LO) and sunflower oil (SFO) as plant oils) were formulated with or without β-glucan supplementation at 0.25 g/kg diet. Juvenile carp (16.3 ± 0.6 g initial body weight) were fed a daily ration of 4% body weight for 9 weeks and then infected at day 64 with the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophyla. No significant differences in survival rate, final body weight, specific growth rate and feed conversion rate were observed between diets. After bacterial infection, mortality rate did not differ between fish fed CLO and plant oil-based diets, indicating that the latter oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence status of common carp. Plant oil-based diets did not alter lysozyme activity in healthy and infected fish. No negative effects of plant oils on complement activity (ACH50) were observed in healthy fish, even if both plant oil-based diets induced a decrease in stimulated fish two days after infection. Furthermore, the levels of various immune genes (nk, lys, il-8, pla, pge, alox) were not affected by plant oil-based diets. The expression of pla and pge genes were higher in SFO-fed fish than in CLO ones, indicating that this plant oil rich in linoleic  (LA) better stimulated the eicosanoid  process than fish oil. In response to β-glucan supplementation, some innate immune functions seemed differentially affected by plant oil-based diets. LO and SFO induced substantial LC-PUFA production, even if fish fed CLO displayed the highest EPA and DHA levels in tissues. SFO rich in LA induced the highest ARA levels in fish muscle while LO rich in α- (ALA) sustained higher EPA production than SFO. A significantly higher fads-6a expression level was observed in SFO fish than in LO ones, but this was not observed for elovl5 expression. In conclusion, the results show that common carp fed plant oil-based diets are able to produce substantial amounts of LC-PUFA for sustaining growth rate, immune status and disease resistance similar to fish fed a fish oil-based diet. The differences in the production capacity of LC-PUFAs by the two plant oil-based diets were associated to a differential activation of some immune pathways, explaining how the use of these oils did not affect the overall immunocompetence of fish challenged with bacterial infection. Moreover, plant oil-based diets did not induce substantial negative effects on the immunomodulatory action of β-glucans, confirming that these oils are suitable for sustaining a good immunocompetence status in common carp.Copyright © 2019.

The preimplantation embryo can utilize the fatty acids (FA) therein via direct incorporation into cell membrane  bilayers and for energy production via β-oxidation. The FA concentration and composition of the oviduct (OF) and uterine fluid (UF) might be regulated by ovarian hormones to meet the changing needs of the growing embryo. In our study, we analyzed the FA profile of blood plasma (BP) and reproductive fluid samples obtained post mortem from slaughtered mares by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Cycle stage was determined by visual evaluation of the ovary and measurement of plasma progesterone. No major effect of cycle stage on the FA profile was observed. However, the composition of FA was different between BP and both OF and UF. While linoleic, stearic, oleic and palmitic  were the four most prevalent FA in both BP and reproductive fluids, the latter contained higher concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and dihomo-γ-. The finding suggests selective endometrial transport mechanisms from plasma into the reproductive fluids or increased endometrial synthesis of selected FA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Alternative mRNA splicing is increasingly recognized as a modulator of protein structure and function. Here we report identification of a novel alternative transcript (AT) of fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) that inhibits production of omega-3 but not omega-6 LCPUFA, discovered during study of ATs in human milk  globules (MFG).Human breastmilk collected from a single donor was used to isolate MFG. An mRNA-sequencing library was constructed from the total RNA isolated from the MFG. The constructed library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq instrument operating in high output mode. Expression levels of evolutionary conserved FADSAT were measured using cDNA from MFG by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay.RNA sequencing revealed >15,000 transcripts, including moderate expression of the FADS2 classical transcript (CS). A novel FADS2 alternative transcript (FADS2AT2) with 386 amino acids was discovered. When FADS2AT2 was transiently transfected into MCF7 cells stably expressing FADS2, delta-6 desaturation (D6D) of  18:3n-3 → 18:4n-3 was suppressed as were downstream products 20:4n-3 and 20:5n-3. In contrast, no significant effect on D6D of linoleic  18:2n-6 → 18:3n-6 or downstream products was observed. FADS2, FADS2AT1 and 5 out of 8 known FADS3AT were expressed in MFG. FADS1, FADS3AT3, and FADS3AT5 are undetectable.The novel, noncatalytic FADS2AT2 regulates FADS2CS-mediated Δ6-desaturation of omega-3 but not omega-6 PUFA biosynthesis. This spliced isoform mediated interaction is the first molecular mechanism by which desaturation of one PUFA family but not the other is modulated.Copyright © 2018.

Integrated Analysis of Transcriptomics and Metabolomics in Blunt Snout Bream (Megalobrama amblycephala).</a></h1><p>Fish is a protein-rich food and is increasingly favored by consumers. It has been well recognized that the flesh composition of fish is closely related to its maturation and growth stage, but few studies have explored these differences. Additionally, hormone residues in fish after artificial induction of reproduction also attract consumer concern. In this study, we attempt to address these concerns by using a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses to identify key regulated pathways, genes, and metabolites that may affect the flesh nutrition of one typical aquaculture species in China, blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala).The four groups of fish were used for transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses, including one-year-old immature (group I), two-year-old immature (group II), two-year-old mature (group III) and successfully spawned (group IV) female M. amblycephala after artificial induction of reproduction.We identified a total of 1460 differential compounds and 1107 differentially expressed unigenes in muscle among the different groups. Differential metabolites related to fish age (group II vs group I, group III vs group I) were largely enriched in "Glycerophospholipid ", "Linoleic  ", "α- ", and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids". Between these two pairwise comparisons, metabolites that are beneficial to human health, such as docosapentaenoic , α-, eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  were found to be significantly decreased in two-year-old (group II, group III) compared with one-year-old (group I) M. amblycephala. Only one differential metabolite related to fish maturation, a triglyceride, was detected between groups III and II. Transcriptomics data showed that differently expressed genes (between group III vs group II, group III vs group I) related to maturation were highly enriched in "Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)", "Sphingolipid " and "Phagosome". DEGs (between group II vs group I, group III vs group I) relating to fish age were enriched in the "cGMP-PKG signaling pathway", "FoxO signaling pathway", and "AMPK signaling pathway". The gene-metabolite interaction network showed pivotal genes, including fumarate hydratase and GNPAT, which played a major role in the regulation of glycerphospholipid . The nutritional components were also measured, which verified the metabolomics results. Moreover, the metabolomics results showed that after 24 hours of artificial hormone injection, the drug was completely metabolized.Integrated analysis demonstrated that the nutrition value of fish fillet was much more related to fish age compared with maturation status in M. amblycephala females.© 2018 The Author(s).

One hundred and seventy-six heifers of three crossbreed commonly reared by Emilia-Romagna farmers: 48 Bleu Belge × Freisian (ITA), 48 Charolais × Aubrac (FRA), and 80 Angus (ANG) were used. Animals of each breed were randomly subdivided in two experimental groups that received two diets, differing for the dietary  source. Control group (C) received a basal diet containing protected vegetable fats, whereas treated one (T) received the same basal diet supplemented with 0.9 kg/head/day of extruded flaxseed. After slaughtering, a sample of Longissimus thoracis was collected from each animal for meat quality analysis. Our results demonstrated that, in a shorter fattening period, ANG animals obtained the best dry matter intake, average daily gain and the best fattening scores. ITA and ANG meat presented the highest marbling scores. ANG breed had the highest amount of C18:1, the highest unsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio and the lowest n-6/n-3 ratio.

In recent years, tree peony has been emerging as an oil crop. Therefore, combined analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tree peony () seeds at 25, 32, 39, 53, 67, 81, 88, 95, and 109 days after pollination (DAP) was conducted to better understand the transcriptional and translational regulation of seed development and oil biosynthesis. A total of 38,482 unigenes and 2841 proteins were identified. A total of 26,912 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 592 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were clustered into three groups corresponding to the rapid growth, seed inclusion enrichment and conversion, and late dehydration and mature stages of seed development. Fifteen  pathways were identified at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that a period of rapid fatty  biosynthesis occurred at 53-88 DAP. Furthermore, 211 genes and 35 proteins associated with the fatty   pathway, 63 genes and 11 proteins associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and 115 genes and 24 proteins associated with ALA  were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 16 putative fatty  desaturase (FAD)-encoding genes clustered into four  groups, eight of which exhibited the highest expression at 53 DAP, suggesting that they play an important role in ALA accumulation. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the temporal expression patterns of oil biosynthesis genes were largely similar to the RNA-seq results. The expression patterns of fatty  - and seed development-related proteins determined by MRM were also highly consistent with the results obtained in the proteomic analysis. Correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the number and abundance of DEGs and DEPs but a high level of consistency in expression patterns and metabolic pathways. The results of the present study represent the first combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of tree peony seeds and provide insight into tree peony seed development and oil accumulation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29442208>The role of acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT8I in mediating intracellular  in oleaginous fungus Mortierella alpina.</a></h1><p>Thioesterases (TEs) play an essential role in the  of fatty acids (FAs).

We recently showed that the phospholipid composition of rainbow trout liver cells (RTL-W1 cell line) modulates their tolerance to an acute cadmium (Cd) challenge. Here, we investigated (i) the extent to which PUFAs and Cd impact fatty  homeostasis and  in these cells and (ii) possible mechanisms by which specific PUFAs may confer cytoprotection against Cd. First, RTL-W1 cells were cultivated for one week in growth media spiked with 50 μmol L of either  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) or arachidonic  (AA, 20:4n-6) in order to modulate their fatty  profile. Then, the cells were challenged with Cd (0, 50 or 100 μmol L) for 24 h prior to assaying viability, fatty  profile, intracellular Cd content, proteomic landscape and expression levels of genes involved in fatty  , synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that the fatty  supply and, to a lesser extent, the exposure to Cd influenced cellular fatty  homeostasis and . The cellular fatty  composition of fish liver cells modulated their tolerance to an acute Cd challenge. Enrichments in ALA, EPA, and, to a lesser extent, AA conferred cytoprotection while enrichment in LA had no impact on cell viability. The present study ruled out the possibility that cytoprotection reflects a decreased Cd burden. Our results rather suggest that the PUFA-derived cytoprotection against Cd occurs through a reduction of the oxidative stress induced by Cd and a differential induction of the eicosanoid cascade, with a possible role of peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin (antioxidant enzymes) as well as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (enzyme initiating the eicosanoid cascade).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the Chia oil- or HxT-enriched-RP effect on the lipoprotein profile of aged rats fed high-, high-energy, and cholesterol-enriched diets. RP samples were prepared by mixing lean pork and lard with or without Chia oil (152.2 g/kg fresh matter) or HxT (3.6 g/kg fresh matter). Diets were prepared by mixing a semisynthetic diet with freeze-dried RP. Groups of 1-year male Wistar rats were fed the following experimental diets for 8 weeks: C, control-RP diet; HC, cholesterol-enriched-RP diet; and Chia oil-RP (CHIA) and HxT, Chia oil- or hydroxytyrosol-RP, cholesterol-enriched diet. Plasma , lipoprotein profile, SREBP-1c protein, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor gene () expressions were evaluated. Compared to C diet, the HC diet increased plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c expression, but reduced  expression and significantly modified the lipoprotein profile, giving rise to the presence of high levels of atherogenic cholesterol-enriched very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles. Compared to the HC diet, the HxT diet did not produce significant changes in feed intake but it reduced the body weight. Chia oil and HxT partially arrested the negative effects of the high-, high-energy, and cholesterol-enriched meat-based diets on lipemia and lipoproteinemia, mostly by reducing the amount of cholesterol content in VLDL (60% and 74% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively) and the VLDL total mass (59% and 63% less in CHIA and HxT vs. HC, respectively). Free fatty acids (FFA) significantly correlated with adipose tissue weight and VLDL total mass (both  < 0.05), and plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, total lipids, and SREBP-1c (all  < 0.001), suggesting the important role of FFA in lipoprotein .

Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ- in LD were positively associated with gestational weight gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention.

Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be converted into  mediators here collectively named oxylipins. These include classical eicosanoids, but also pro-resolving mediators. A balanced production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving oxylipins is of importance for adequate inflammatory responses and subsequent return to homeostasis.Here we investigated if PUFA  is disturbed in COPD patients.Free PUFA and oxylipin levels were measured in induced sputum samples from the Bergen COPD cohort and COPD exacerbation study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, effects of whole cigarette smoke on PUFA  in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells were assessed.Significantly lower levels of free , linoleic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were detected in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. During acute exacerbation (AE), levels of free arachidonic  and docosapentaenoic  were higher than in stable COPD patients. Furthermore, levels of omega-3 EPA- and docosahexaenoic -derived oxylipins were lower in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. Cyclooxygenase-2-converted mediators were mostly increased during AE. In vitro studies additionally showed that cigarette smoke exposure may also directly contribute to altered epithelial PUFA , and indirectly by causing airway epithelial remodelling.Our findings show significant differences in PUFA  in COPD patients compared to controls, further changed during AE. Airway epithelial remodelling may contribute to these changes. These findings provide new insight in impaired inflammatory resolution in COPD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The degradation in quality and excessive  accumulation in cultured C. idellus have long been attributed to possible alterations in the  of fish muscle tissues as a result of overnutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 250 tails of C. idellus.The experimental fish were divided into four groups based on sex and diet-female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed, male artificial feed (MAF), and male grass feed (MGF). After a 113-day rearing period, the artificial feed (AF) group showed a significantly higher total mass of muscle  (P < 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic , dihomo-gamma-, and arachidonic , whereas grass feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic , , and gamma-. Artificial feeding also resulted in significant increased docosahexaenoic  in MAF muscle than in MGF fish, whereas there was no significance in the comparison of female samples. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted and untargeted approaches consistently revealed that arachidonic   and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways were significantly different between AF and grass fed groups.Our results suggest that grass is a better source of dietary fatty  and protein when compared to artificial feed. Grass feeding could effectively lower triglycerides in serum, reduce  accumulation, and alter  compositions in fish muscle by increasing the concentrations of n-3 UFAs, leading to better nutrition and health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29465730>Dihomo-gamma- induces  loss in C. elegans in an omega-3-independent manner by promoting peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation.</a></h1><p>Bioactive compounds, including some fatty acids (FAs), can induce beneficial effects on body -content and .

We aimed to investigate the effect of fish and camelina sativa oil (CSO) intakes on fatty  composition of erythrocyte membranes (EM), plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG). We also aimed to identify the most appropriate blood  fraction for assessing n-3 PUFA intake.Altogether 79 volunteers with impaired glucose  were randomly assigned either to CSO, fatty fish, lean fish or control groups for 12 weeks. Fatty  compositions of  pools were measured by gas chromatography. The proportion of  (ALA) increased in all  pools in the CSO group (false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0.001 for all). Similarly, the proportions of EPA and DHA increased in all  fractions in the fatty fish group (FDR p < 0.001 for EM, PL and CE; FDR p = 0.005 for TG; FDR p < 0.001 for EM, PL, CE; FDR p < 0.007 for TG, respectively). Changes in the dietary intakes of ALA, EPA and DHA correlated with the changes in their proportions in all  pools (r = 0.3-0.5, p < 0.05).There is no difference in the ability of blood  fractions in reflecting the dietary intake of different n-3 PUFAs over a time period of 12 weeks in subjects with high baseline omega-3 index.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64%  (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and  MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, , ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

The use of sources rich in linoleic and α- favors the accumulation of conjugated linoleic acids isomers, increasing the healthy properties of milk. Ruminal microbiota plays a pivotal role in defining milk FA composition, and its profile is affected by diet composition. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of rumen FA production and microbial structure to hemp or linseed supplementation in diets of dairy goats. Ruminal microbiota composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing, whereas FA composition was obtained by gas-chromatography technique. In all, 18 pluriparous Alpine goats fed the same pre-treatment diet for 40±7 days were, then, arranged to three dietary treatments consisting of control, linseed and hemp seeds supplemented diets. Independently from sampling time and diets, bacterial community of ruminal fluid was dominated by Bacteroidetes (about 61.2%) and Firmicutes (24.2%) with a high abundance of Prevotellaceae (41.0%) and Veillonellaceae (9.4%) and a low presence of Ruminococcaceae (5.0%) and Lachnospiraceae (4.3%). Linseed supplementation affected ruminal bacteria population, with a significant reduction of biodiversity; in particular, relative abundance of Prevotella was reduced (-12.0%), whereas that of Succinivibrio and Fibrobacter was increased (+50.0% and +75.0%, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found among the average relative abundance of archaeal genera between each dietary group. Moreover, the addition of linseed and hemp seed induced significant changes in FA concentration in the rumen, as a consequence of shift from C18 : 2n-6 to C18 : 3n-3 biohydrogenation pathway. Furthermore, dimethylacetal composition was affected by  supplementation, as consequence of ruminal bacteria population modification. Finally, the association study between the rumen FA profile and the bacterial microbiome revealed that Fibrobacteriaceae is the bacterial family showing the highest and significant correlation with FA involved in the biohydrogenation pathway of C18 : 3n-3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29886195>Gene network of oil accumulation reveals expression profiles in developing embryos and fatty  composition in Upland cotton.</a></h1><p>Cottonseed oil accumulated dramatically from 20 days post-anthesis (DPA) to 30 DPA in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). To reveal the gene network of oil accumulation and fatty  composition in developing embryos, embryos at 10, 20 and 30 DPA in cottonseed were sampled and used for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). In total, 8629, 7891, and 12,555 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the comparison sets of '20 DPA vs 10 DPA', '30 DPA vs 20 DPA', and '30 DPA vs 10 DPA', respectively. The gene network highlighted the dynamic expression profiles of oil accumulation in fatty  (FA) synthesis, FA desaturation, and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis. WRI1 and NF-YB6 were suggested elite transcription factors in regulating . Compared with the gene expression levels in developing seeds, GhPDAT was highly expressed and might play a more important role than GhDGAT in transforming diacylglycerol to TAG in cotton. Expression patterns of 12 FA-biosynthesis-related genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To reveal the reason for the high content of linoleic  (C18:2) in cottonseed oil, we carried out a comparative analysis of gene expression levels in Upland cotton, rapeseed (Brassica napus), and oleaster (Olea europaea). Compared with in rapeseed and oleaster, GhFAD2 genes were up-regulated and GhFAD3 genes down-regulated in cottonseed, taking into account the relative high amount of C18:2 but low content of  (C18:3) in Upland cotton. The present study offers new information to interpret the mechanism of the FA biosynthesis network and to alter FA composition in cotton breeding projects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the production of CFAs is generally difficult. Several challenges are the low CFAs content in natural sources, the difficulty to chemically synthesize target CFA isomers in high purity, and the sensitive characteristics of CFAs. In this article, the current technologies to produce CFAs, including physical, chemical, and biotechnical approaches were summarized, with a focus on the conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated  acids (CLNAs) which are the most common investigated CFAs. CFAs usually demonstrate stronger physiological effects than other non-conjugated fatty acids; however, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation. Consequently, the quality control throughout the entire production process of CFAs is significant. Special attention was given to the micro- or nano-encapsulation which presented as an emerging technique to improve the bioavailability and storage stability of CFAs. The current applications of CFAs and the potential research directions were also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE.83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58 643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose  (HbA mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting insulin 1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of α-, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose  was seen, except that increasing α- may increase fasting insulin (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose .This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose , including previously unpublished data following contact with authors.

Eight castrated Nellore steers were fitted with a ruminal and duodenal silicone cannula, and distributed in a double, simultaneous, Latin square 4 × 4 design with four diets and four experimental periods. Concentrates contained ground maize, urea, mineral salts, CG (100 g/kg DM) and soybean products with different availability of soybean oil: (1) no additional  (CO), (2) WS, (3) SO or (4) CS.  supplementation was fixed to obtain 50 g ether extract/kg DM. Experimental treatments had no effect on DM intake, DM duodenal flow or ruminal turnover rate of C:16 FA. However,  addition increased C:18 and turnover rates of total FA rumen (p < 0.05). CS resulted in lower C:18 turnover rates and lower ruminal BH of monounsaturated and unsaturated FA (UFA) than WS (p < 0.05). SO resulted in a greater duodenal flow of C18:0 (stearic ), C18:1t-11 (vaccenic ) and saturated FA than the WS and CS diets (p < 0.05). CS resulted in a higher duodenal flow of C18:3n-3 () than WS (p < 0.05). The association of CG and calcium salts in Nellore steers was the best nutritional strategy to increase duodenal flow of healthier UFA, which may increase the deposition of these FA in meat.

However, their concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient for any therapeutic application to be implemented. From a biotechnological standpoint, microbial production of these conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) has been explored as an alternative, and strains of the genera , , and  have shown promising producing capacities. Current screening research works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies. This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently, the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and  acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers. Thus, the availability of  gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved. As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of  , further research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626820>Updates to the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis pathway: DHA synthesis rates, tetracosahexaenoic  and (minimal) retroconversion.</a></h1><p>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the numerous families of  mediators derived from them collectively regulate numerous biological processes. The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA regulate biological processes begins with an understanding of the n-3 biosynthetic pathway that starts with  (18:3n-3) and is commonly thought to end with the production of docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3). However, our understanding of this pathway is not as complete as previously believed. In the current review we provide a background of the evidence supporting the pathway as currently understood and provide updates from recent studies challenging three central dogma of n-3 PUFA . By building on nearly three decades of research primarily in cell culture and oral dosing studies, recent evidence presented focuses on in vivo kinetic modelling and compound-specific isotope abundance studies in rodents and humans that have been instrumental in expanding our knowledge of the pathway. Specifically, we highlight three main updates to the n-3 PUFA biosynthesis pathway: (1) DHA synthesis rates cannot be as low as previously believed, (2) DHA is both a product and a precursor to tetracosahexaenoic  (24:6n-3) and (3) increases in EPA in response to DHA supplementation are not the result of increased retroconversion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the use of new and safe molecules are important, and this study evaluated the toxicity of active substances against this mosquito. The oleic, linoleic, , palmitic and stearic acids and their respective methyl esters were tested against fourth instar C. quinquefasciatus larvae. Oleic, linoleic and  acids had LC50 values of 8.58, 10.04 and 19.78 mg/L, respectively. Histological analysis showed that these three compounds caused cell instability with an increase in the number of vesicles in the  body and in the midgut cells. Based on these results, glucose, triglyceride, and protein levels were evaluated after 1 h of  exposure. These compounds decreased in insects treated with linoleic .  also caused a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase activity.

However, this molecule is naturally found in plants such as flaxseed and canola which currently limits production. Here, we demonstrate the potential to sustainably produce ALA using the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Through the use of a recently identified Δ12-15 desaturase (Rk Δ12-15), we were able to enable production in Y. lipolytica. When combined with a previously engineered -overproducing strain with high precursor availability, further improvements of ALA production were achieved. Finally, the cultivation of this strain at lower temperatures significantly increased ALA content, with cells fermented at 20 °C accumulating nearly 30% ALA of the total lipids in this cell. This low-temperature fermentation represents improved ALA titer up to 3.2-fold compared to standard growth conditions.

An accurate prediction of future type 2 diabetes risk in the early postpartum period after GDM would allow for timely interventions to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition, new targets for interventions may be revealed by understanding the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to identify both a predictive signature and early-stage pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes.We used a well-characterised prospective cohort of women with a history of GDM pregnancy, all of whom were enrolled at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline), were confirmed not to have diabetes via 2 h 75 g OGTT and tested anually for type 2 diabetes on an ongoing basis (2 years of follow-up). A large-scale targeted lipidomic study was implemented to analyse ~1100  metabolites in baseline plasma samples using a nested pair-matched case-control design, with 55 incident cases matched to 85 non-case control participants. The relationships between the concentrations of baseline plasma lipids and respective follow-up status (either type 2 diabetes or no type 2 diabetes) were employed to discover both a predictive signature and the underlying pathophysiology of the transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes. In addition, the underlying pathophysiology was examined in vivo and in vitro.Machine learning optimisation in a decision tree format revealed a seven- metabolite type 2 diabetes predictive signature with a discriminating power (AUC) of 0.92 (87% sensitivity, 93% specificity and 91% accuracy). The signature was highly robust as it includes 45-fold cross-validation under a high confidence threshold (1.0) and binary output, which together minimise the chance of data overfitting and bias selection. Concurrent analysis of differentially expressed  metabolite pathways uncovered the upregulation of α-/linoleic   (false discovery rate [FDR] 0.002) and fatty  biosynthesis (FDR 0.005) and the downregulation of sphingolipid  (FDR 0.009) as being strongly associated with the risk of developing future type 2 diabetes. Focusing specifically on sphingolipids, the downregulation of sphingolipid  using the pharmacological inhibitors fumonisin B1 (FB1) and myriocin in mouse islets and Min6 K8 cells (a pancreatic beta-cell like cell line) significantly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but had no significant impact on whole-body glucose homeostasis or insulin sensitivity.We reveal a novel predictive signature and associate reduced sphingolipids with the pathophysiology of transition from GDM to type 2 diabetes.

Effects on the prepartum performance of the dam and birth weight of the progeny1.</a></h1><p>A 2-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effects of level and source of  in the diet of gestating beef cows on their prepartum performance and birth weight of progeny. Each year, 75 multiparous (≥3 calving) pregnant Angus cows were stratified by BW (663 ± 21.5 kg) and BCS (2.6 ± 0.12; 1 to 5 scale) and randomly assigned to 1 of 15 outdoor pens. Subsequently, each pen was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 (n = 5) treatments: a low- diet (LF; 1.4 ± 0.12% EE) consisting of grass-legume hay, barley straw, and barley grain, or 1 of 2 high- diets (HF; 3.3 ± 0.20% EE) that included either a canola seed (CAN) or a flaxseed (FLX) based pelleted feed. Diets were formulated to meet the requirements of pregnant beef cows during the last 2 trimesters of gestation (0.183 ± 4.8 d), adjusted for changes in environmental conditions, and offered such that each pen on average received similar daily amounts of DE (31.2 ± 2.8 Mcal/cow), CP (1.36 ± 0.13 kg/cow), and DM (12.9 ± 1.0 kg/cow). Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with contrasts to separate the effects of level (LF vs. HF) and source (CAN vs. FLX) of . After 160 d on trial, conceptus corrected-BW (CC-BW) of LF cows (708 kg) and the proportion of overconditioned cows (13.2%) were greater (P ≤ 0.04) than those of HF, with no difference (P ≥ 0.84) between CAN and FLX for CC-BW (697 kg) and proportion of overconditioned cows (3.6% vs. 2.9%). Feeding FLX diet during gestation resulted in cows with a greater (P ≤ 0.01) concentration of conjugated  (0.12% vs. 0.05%) and n-3 (0.58% vs. 0.37%) fatty acids, and a tendency (P = 0.09) for conjugated linoleic  concentration (1.05% vs. 0.88%) to be greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) when compared with cows fed the CAN diet. By the end of gestation, serum NEFA concentration of LF cows (592 µEq/L) was lower (P < 0.01) than that of HF cows, and FLX cows had greater (P < 0.01) serum NEFA concentration than CAN cows (636 vs. 961 µEq/L). Cows receiving the LF diet during gestation gave birth to lighter (P < 0.01) calves compared with those receiving the HF diets (40.2 vs. 42.9 kg), with no difference (P = 0.24) between calves born to CAN (42.4 kg) and FLX (43.3 kg) cows. In conclusion, these results suggest a partitioning of the ME in pregnant beef cows that is dependent on the type of dietary energy, resulting in heavier calves at birth for cows fed high- diets. Also, the type of fatty  in the diet of gestating beef cows affected the fatty  profile in SCAT and serum NEFA concentration.© The Author(s) 2019.

To explore this possibility with a focus on metabolic health, this study investigated the impact of walnut consumption on lipoprotein  composition and changes in LDL anti-inflammatory properties, as reported by inflamed adipocyte. Hypercholesterolemic, postmenopausal females were treated with 40 g/day (i.e., 1.6 servings/day; n=15) of walnuts for 4 weeks. Fatty acids and their oxygenated metabolites, i.e., oxylipins, were quantified in isolated lipoproteins. Human primary adipocytes were exposed to LDL and TNFα-stimulated adipokine production was measured. Walnut treatment elevated α- and its epoxides in all lipoproteins and depleted mid-chain alcohols in VLDL and LDL, but not HDL. Walnuts also reduced TNFα-induced diabetic adipocyte production of IL-6 (-48%, P=.0006) and IL-8 (-30%, P=.01), changes inversely correlated with levels of α--derived epoxides but not α- itself. In conclusion, modest walnut consumption can alter lipoprotein  profiles and enhance their ability to inhibit TNFα-dependent pro-inflammatory responses in human diabetic primary adipocytes. Moreover, this study suggests the oxylipins, rather than the parent fatty acids, mediate LDL action of adipocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), dihomo-gamma  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and oleic , but decreased arachidonic  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty acids and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty acids were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total  or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty acids, most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Our findings indicate that altered fatty   or utilization is present in CD and is related to disease activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274304>MiR-205 Mediated Cu-Induced  Accumulation in Yellow Catfish .</a></h1><p>The present working hypothesis is that the Cu-induced changes in  may be mediated by miRNAs. Here, we describe the miRNA profile of the liver tissues of yellow catfish exposed to waterborne Cu, based on larger-scale sequencing of small RNA libraries. We identified a total of 172 distinct miRNAs. Among these miRNAs, compared to the control, mRNA expression levels of 16 miRNAs (miR-203a, 205, 1788-3p, 375, 31, 196a, 203b-3p, 2187-5p, 196d, 459-3p, 153a and miR-725, and two novel-miRNAs: chr4-1432, chr-7684) were down-regulated, and mRNA levels of miR-212 and chr20-5274 were up-regulated in Cu-exposed group. The functions of their target genes mainly involved ether , glycerophospholipid , linoleic   and α- . Cu exposure inhibited the expression of miR-205, whose predicted target genes were enriched in the pathway of , including , , , ,  and . These potential target genes were further verified by Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Using primary hepatocytes of yellow catfish, Cu incubation down-regulated miR-205 expression, and increased TG contents and FAS activity. LXR antagonist effectively ameliorate the Cu-induced change of TG content and FAS activity. These data suggest that down-regulation of the miRNA-205 may be an important step in Cu-induced changes in  in yellow catfish.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667852>Regulation mechanism of silkworm pupa oil PUFAs on cholesterol  in hepatic cell L-02.</a></h1><p>Silkworm Pupa Oil Polyunsaturated Fatty  (SPO PUFAs) has confirmed to have cholesterol-lowering function.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs: palmitic  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05),  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the  profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

We focused on the use of deuterated substrates of 100 μM α- and linoleic  to determine the relative amounts of their converted PUFAs and specific phospholipids that are incorporated into cell plasma membranes. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used to image and analyze lipids in model cell membranes with and without FA treatment. Because of its high spatial resolution, TOF-SIMS can be used to simultaneously provide both chemical information and distribution of various molecules in the sample surface down to the subcellular scale. Data obtained from this analysis of isotopes in the cell samples were used to calculate the relative amounts of long-chain PUFAs and phospholipids from their precursors, α- and linoleic . Our results show that the FA treatments induced an increase in the amounts of α- and linoleic  and their long-chain conversion products. Moreover, an enhanced level of phospholipid turnover of these FAs in lipids such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylinositols was also observed in the cell plasma membrane.Copyright © 2018 Philipsen et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586917>Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals an Efficient Mechanism of α- in Tree Peony Seeds.</a></h1><p>Tree peony ( section  DC.) species are woody oil crops with high unsaturated fatty  content, including α- (ALA/18:3; >40% of the total fatty ).

After multivariate adjustment, intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was associated with a lower cardiovascular disease mortality, compared with total carbohydrates: hazard ratios comparing the highest with the lowest quarter were 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.99; P for trend=0.03) for total PUFAs, 0.69 (0.52 to 0.90; P=0.007) for marine n-3 PUFAs, 1.13 (0.85 to 1.51) for α-, and 0.75 (0.56 to 1.01) for linoleic . Inverse associations with total mortality were also observed for intakes of total PUFAs, n-3 PUFAs, and linoleic , whereas monounsaturated fatty acids of animal, but not plant, origin were associated with a higher total mortality. In models that examined the theoretical effects of substituting PUFAs for other fats, isocalorically replacing 2% of energy from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs or linoleic  was associated with 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 0.77 to 0.99) or 15% (0.85, 0.73 to 0.99) lower cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively. A 2% replacement of energy from saturated fatty acids with total PUFAs was associated with 12% (hazard ratio 0.88, 0.83 to 0.94) lower total mortality.In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher intake of PUFAs, in comparison with carbohydrates or saturated fatty acids, is associated with lower total mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the  of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and  mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Recent studies suggest that phospholipid (PL) form of dietary n-3 PUFA may lead to their higher tissue accretion than triacylglycerol (TAG) form. We compared efficacy of PL-docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) (DHA) and TAG-DHA on onset and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a mouse model of MS. Female mice were fed low  (18:3n-3) (ALA) diet (control) for 2 weeks and then fed either control, 0.3%, or 1.0% DHA (PL or TAG) for 4 weeks pre-EAE induction and 4 weeks post-EAE induction. The brain and spinal cord n-6:n-3 ratio was significantly lower in all mice fed DHA compared to control. EAE onset was delayed in mice fed both DHA forms and concentrations, except for 1% TAG-DHA. The inverse association between the EAE score and the brain DHA concentration was nonsignificant at the end of the study (p = 0.08). Daily EAE scores of mice fed different DHA diets did not differ from control, however, the score of all DHA groups combined during days 9-16 was lower (p = 0.028) compared to the control. During days 17-22, the EAE score trended lower in 0.3% TAG-DHA and during days 23-28, the EAE score trended lower in both PL-DHA groups than those in all other groups. These findings suggest that TAG-DHA may be more effective than PL-DHA in the early phases of EAE, and in the final outcome, PL-DHA may be more effective than TAG-DHA.Published 2019.

Two experimental diets containing 10% LA-rich sunflower seed oil (diet LA) or 10% ALA-rich perilla oil (diet ALA) were used in the feeding trial. LA and ALA in diets were characteristically incorporated into fish tissues while no significant difference was observed in growth performance and body proximate composition between groups LA and ALA. Compared to LA, ALA up-regulated transcription of 49 unigenes and down-regulated those of 311 unigenes. Quantitative RT-PCR studies on eight -related genes and seven randomly selected genes were conducted to validate the transcriptomic results. -related genes ApoA1, ApoA4, ApoE, FABP1, FABP3, FABP4, FATP6, and DGAT1, as well as ribosomal proteins L9e, L13e, and S4e, were transcriptionally down-regulated by ALA. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were primarily enriched in Gene Ontology terms such as  transport, Protein metabolic process, and Ribosome biogenesis, as well as in KEGG pathways such as Complement and coagulation cascades and Ribosome. The Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network based on the peptide biosynthesis-related DEGs showed that ribosomal proteins such as SAe, L4e, S4e, L15e, L9e, and L13Ae had high betweenness centrality in the dietary regulation of peptide biosynthetic processes. In conclusion, under the present experimental conditions, a high level of dietary α- tended to suppress  transport and protein biosynthetic processes in the liver of Japanese seabass at the gene expression level.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral  area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, palmitic , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ- levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS), 30:45 (RCS), 45:30 (RCS), and 60:15 (RCS) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic  content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic  in the milk up to 4%. Proportions of α- in milk increased 2-fold with RCS compared with RCS, which resulted from the linear increase in α- intake with incremental levels of RCS. Vaccenic  in the milk  was reduced by 24%. Rumenic , a conjugated linoleic  (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic ) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22%. Reduced rumenic  in the milk  was probably due to a reduced amount of vaccenic  produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of vaccenic  to be desaturated to rumenic  in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. Oleic  was enriched in the milk , although the dietary concentration of oleic  decreased. Stearic  proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12%, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic  was reduced linearly, but palmitic  remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2%. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic  intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of α- in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

The objective of the present work was to compare the metabolite profile of the  fraction of organic and conventional bovine milk using NMR metabolomics analysis. ¹H-NMR and 1D TOCSY NMR methods of analysis were performed on extracted  fraction of lyophilized milk. For this purpose, 14 organic and 16 conventional retail milk samples were collected monthly, and 64 bulk-tank (58 conventional and 6 organics) milk samples were collected over a 14-month longitudinal study in Cyprus. Data were treated with multivariate methods (PCA, PLS-DA). Minor components were identified and quantified, and modification of the currently used equations is proposed. A significantly increased % content of conjugated (9-, 11-)18:2 linoleic  (CLA), α-, linoleic , allylic protons and total unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and decreased % content for caproleic  were observed in the organic samples compared to the conventional ones. The present work confirms that  profile is affected by contrasting management system (organic vs. conventional), and supports the potential of NMR-based metabolomics for the rapid analysis and authentication of the milk from its  profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454700>Technical note: An in vivo method to determine kinetics of unsaturated fatty  biohydrogenation in the rumen.</a></h1><p>Rumen microbial biohydrogenation (BH) of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) has been extensively studied in vitro; however, in vitro BH pathways, rates, and extents may not parallel those in vivo. The objective was to develop an assay to assess in vivo rates, pathways, and extent of BH of oleic (OA), linoleic (LA), and α- (ALA) acids. Each UFA was characterized in a separate experiment, each using 4 ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows. A single bolus consisting of 200 g of a UFA-oil [experiment 1 (EXP1): 87% OA sunflower, experiment 2 (EXP2): 70% LA safflower, and experiment 3 (EXP3): 54% ALA flaxseed] and 12 g of heptadecanoic  (C17:0) was mixed into the rumen through the fistula. Rumen digesta was collected at -1, -0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h relative to the bolus. Overall, the triglyceride boluses increased total fatty acids (FA) in the rumen from 3.9 (standard deviation = ±1.4) to 7.3% (±1.4) of rumen dry matter and enriched C17:0 from 0.4 (±0.1) to 2.5% (±0.5) of FA. The bolus enriched OA from 8.9 (±1.0) to 30.1% (±4.6) of FA in EXP1, LA from 11.1 (±1.8) to 35.9% (±5.0) of FA in EXP2, and ALA from 2.1 (±0.1) to 19.8% (±4.3) of FA in EXP3. The disappearances of C17:0, OA, LA, and ALA were fit to a single exponential decay model. The first-order rate of C17:0 rumen disappearance (turnover) was 9.1, 6.9, and 5.2%/h in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively, and was used as a marker of FA passage. The rate of total rumen turnover of OA was 54.1%/h, LA was 60.5%/h, and ALA was 93.0%/h in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Rumen concentration of all 3 UFA reached prebolus concentrations within 4 h. The calculated extent of lipolysis and initial isomerization was 85.6% for OA, 89.8% for LA, and 94.7% for ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Assuming that BH equals total disappearance minus passage, the rates of lipolysis and initial isomerization were 45.0, 53.6, and 87.8%/h for OA, LA, and ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Analysis of the data using compartmental modeling showed that the normal BH pathways proposed in the literature explained 46.0, 37.3, and 49.8% of the BH of OA, LA, and ALA in EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3, respectively. Based on the model, BH of trans C18:1 FA was the rate-limiting step to complete BH. Importantly, oils were provided as triglycerides and the reported rates represent the rate of lipolysis and BH. In conclusion, the rate of ruminal BH of OA, LA, and ALA was higher than that commonly observed in vitro, but the extent of BH was near expected values. The method developed provides a potential in vivo assay of ruminal BH for use in future experiments and modeling efforts.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic  while α- is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These ω-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with ω-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic  from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in ω-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier ω-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on  of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease. From the public health viewpoint worldwide the daily consumption of fruits and vegetables has become the main tool for prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke. We review the important dietary role of cereal grains in prevention of coronary disease and stroke. Polyphenols from grapes, wine and alcoholic beverages are discussed, in particular their effects on coagulation. The mechanisms of action of probiotics and vitamins are also included.Copyright © 2019.

Prior evidence suggests that DHA is mobilized from maternal liver and adipose to meet fetal accretion and physiological requirements. However, changes in the DHA levels of various maternal tissues throughout pregnancy and into lactation of mothers on diets with and without dietary DHA, and with a background dietary fatty  profile that resembles human intake has not been examined. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a total western diet with (TWD + ) or without DHA (TWD-) along with a commercial rodent chow control (Chow) throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The fatty  compositions of adipose, brain, heart, liver, erythrocytes, and plasma were determined before pregnancy, at 15 and 20 days of pregnancy, and 7 days postpartum. The placenta, fetuses, and pups were also examined when available. Maternal DHA concentrations were increased in plasma at 20 days pregnancy in all the diets with TWD + > Chow > TWD-. Maternal DHA concentrations in the TWD- group were lower in adipose throughout pregnancy as compared with the other diets. At postpartum, DHA concentrations decreased below baseline levels in the heart of the TWD- and Chow dams and the liver of the TWD- dams. Whole body DHA concentrations of the fetuses did not differ but there was evidence of decreased DHA in the whole body and tissues of the TWD- and Chow 7d old pups. In conclusion, it appears that in this rodent model of pregnancy, maternal adaptations were made to meet fetal DHA requirements, but they may compromise maternal DHA status and the ability to deliver DHA during lactation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the pharmacological mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD has not been clearly elucidated and needs to be further explored.We aimed to identify relevant biological pathways by assessing changes in biomarkers in response to DLT intervention in CHD to reveal the potential biological mechanism of DLT treatment for CHD.The major chemical components in DLT were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and a model of CHD in rats was subsequently established with a high- diet and left anterior coronary artery ligation (LADCA) followed by DLT intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after DLT administration were measured by PLS-DA, and two pathways of DLT treatment for CHD were predicted. Finally, predicted metabolomic pathways were verified by detecting and analyzing tissues from the rat model, revealing the mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD.Forty-five major chemical components were identified by the chemical characterization of DLT. In terms of , 17 biomarkers of CHD in rats were identified. Among these biomarkers, linoleic , γ- and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were found to play an important role in energy  and glycerophospholipid . Protein analysis revealed that EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in CHD rats after DLT treatment, which lowered the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9, decreased the expression levels of ox-LDL and MDA, and increased the expression of SOD.The mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD involves inhibiting the expression of EGFR and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by regulating glycerophospholipid  (LPCs) and energy  (linoleic  and γ-). Therefore, inflammation-related (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9) and oxidative stress-related (ox-LDL, MDA, SOD) indicators are affected, leading to the regulation of the oxidative stress state and anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This narrative review discusses the signs, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of essential fatty  deficiency (EFAD). EFAD may occur in patients with conditions that severely limit the intake, digestion, absorption, and/or  of . EFAD may be prevented in patients requiring parenteral nutrition by inclusion of an intravenous  emulsion (ILE) as a source of LA and ALA. Early ILEs consisted solely of soybean oil (SO), a good source of LA and ALA, but being rich in LA may promote the production of proinflammatory fatty acids. Subsequent ILE formulations replaced part of the SO with other  sources to decrease the amount of proinflammatory fatty acids. Although rare, EFAD is diagnosed by an elevated triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio, which reflects increased  of oleic  to Mead  in the absence of adequate LA and ALA. Assays for measuring fatty acids have improved over the years, and therefore it is necessary to take into account the particular assay used and its reference range when determining if the T:T ratio indicates EFAD. In patients with a high degree of suspicion for EFAD, obtaining a fatty  profile may provide additional useful information for making a diagnosis of EFAD. In patients receiving an ILE, the T:T ratio and fatty  profile should be interpreted in light of the fatty  composition of the ILE to ensure accurate diagnosis of EFAD.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830454> profiles reveal different responses to brown planthopper infestation for pest susceptible and resistant rice plants.</a></h1><p>Brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive insect pest for rice, causing major reductions in rice yield and large economic losses. More than 31 BPH-resistance genes have been located, and several of them have been isolated. Nevertheless, the metabolic mechanism related to BPH-resistance genes remain uncharacterized.To elucidate the resistance mechanism of the BPH-resistance gene Bph6 at the metabolic level, a Bph6-transgenic line R6 (BPH-resistant) and the wild-type Nipponbare (BPH-susceptible) were used to investigate their  profiles under control and BPH treatments.In conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, BPH-induced  changes in leaf blade and leaf sheath were investigated by GC-MS-based lipidomics.Forty-five lipids were identified in leaf sheath extracts. Leaf sheath lipidomics analysis results show that BPH infestation induces significant differences in the  profiles of Nipponbare and R6. The levels of hexadecanoic , methyl ester, linoleic , methyl ester, , methyl ester, glycidyl palmitate, eicosanoic , methyl ester, docosanoic , methyl ester, beta-monolinolein, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, cycloartenol, phytol and phytyl acetate had undergone enormous changes after BPH feeding. These results illustrate that BPH feeding enhances sterol biosynthetic pathway in Nipponbare plants, and strengthens wax biosynthesis and phytol  in R6 plants. The results of quantitative real-time PCR of 5 relevant genes were consistent with the changes in metabolic level. Forty-five lipids were identified in the leaf blade extracts. BPH infestation induces distinct changes in the  profiles of the leaf blade samples of Nipponbare and R6. Although the  changes in Nipponbare are more drastic, the changes within the two varieties are similar.  profiles in leaf sheath brought out significant differences than in leaf blade within Nipponbare and R6. We propose that Bph6 mainly affects the levels of lipids in leaf sheath, and mediates resistance by deploying metabolic re-programming during BPH feeding.The results indicate that wax biosynthesis, sterol biosynthetic pathway and phytol  play vital roles in rice response to BPH infestation. This finding demonstrated that the combination of lipidomics and quantitative real-time PCR is an effective approach to elucidating the interactions between brown planthopper and rice mediated by resistance genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323448>Effect of moisture on wheat grains  patterns and infection with Fusarium graminearum.</a></h1><p>Suitable conditions of temperature and humidity are required to maintain wheat grains quality, but during processing and storage, the grains can be exposed to adverse environmental conditions and presence of infectious fungi. Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight on wheat, affects crop yields and grain quality by alteration of their biochemical components and mycotoxin contamination, which reduces the possibilities of wheat end use and compromises food safety.  degradation by hydrolytic, oxidative and microbial deterioration is the predominant cause of the loss of sensory acceptability, nutritional value and baking quality. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of adverse environmental conditions -as the increasing moisture - on  patterns of whole wheat flours contaminated with F. graminearum in relation to the infection degree. In vitro cultures of F. graminearum were carried out on wheat grains under different degrees of relative humidity (11, 50, 75 and 100%) throughout 45 days of incubation at 28 °C. The fungal biomass measured by q-PCR increased proportionally with the humidity. A decrease in the signals of saturated (palmitic and estearic) and unsaturated (oleic, linoleic and ) fatty acids, analyzed as fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) by GC-MS, was observed in relation with the humidity and infection degree. The degradation rate of the lipids was high during the first 15 days of incubation, reaching the fatty acids content, values around 20-40% of those found in the control. From that moment on, the rate of degradation was slower or even null. It was observed that in all treatments, the  reached the highest degradation ratio in comparison with the other fatty acids, which may be caused by the action of lipoxygenases. The lipase activity and the content of deoxynivalenol were also determinate on the flours. The lipase activity increased until day 25 of incubation reaching twice the initial value. The deoxynivalenol content also increased along incubation while fatty acids decreased. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude in the signal of fatty acids in whole wheat flours varied in relation to the degree of humidity and fungal infection of the grains from which they were obtained. Otherwise, lipids and their oxidation products are related with the pathogenesis and production of mycotoxins. These observations highlight the importance of an adequate manipulation of wheat grains on the processing chain to prevent quality changes and mycotoxins contamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

They have also been demonstrated in vitro as antimicrobial agents against plant fungi and bacteria. To reach the phytopathogens in vivo, the HPOs biosynthesized in the plant cells must cross the plant plasma membrane (PPM) where they can also interact with plasma membrane lipids and have an effect on their organization. In the present study, we have investigated the interaction properties of HPOs with PPM at a molecular level using biophysical tools combining in vitro and in silico approaches and using plant biomimetic  systems. Our results have shown that HPOs are able to interact with PPM lipids and perturb their lateral organization. Glucosylceramide (GluCer) is a privileged partner, sitosterol lessens their binding and the presence of both GluCer and sitosterol further reduces their interaction. Hydrophobic effect and polar interactions are involved in the binding. The chemical structure of HPOs influences their affinity for PPM lipids. The presence of three double bonds in the HPO molecule gives rise to a higher affinity comparatively to two double bonds, which can be explained by their differential interaction with the  polar headgroups.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Semen and blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Dietary information was recorded throughout the trial. Changes in conventional semen parameters (pH, volume, sperm count and concentration, motility, and morphology) were determined as primary outcomes. The effect of nut consumption on sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, chromosome anomalies (X, Y, and 18), total DNA methylation, and microRNA expression were measured in sperm samples as potential causes of the changes in the seminogram.Compared with the control group, improvements in total sperm count (P = 0.002) and vitality (P = 0.003), total motility (P = 0.006), progressive motility (P = 0.036), and morphology of sperm (P = 0.008) were observed in the nut group. Participants in the nut group showed an increase in the consumption of total , monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, magnesium, vitamin E, α-, total omega-3 (n-3) and ω-3:ω-6 ratio intake during the intervention. Participants in the nut group showed a significant reduction in SDF (P < 0.001) and in the expression of hsa-miR-34b-3p (P = 0.036). No significant changes in ROS, sperm chromosome anomalies, or DNA methylation were observed between groups.The inclusion of nuts in a Western-style diet significantly improves the total sperm count and the vitality, motility, and morphology of the sperm.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are cytotoxic to cancer cells and play a critical role in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM). PUFAs are produced in the body by desaturases and elongases from dietary essential fatty acids (EFAs), primarily involving delta-6-desaturase (D6D). D6D is a rate-limiting enzyme for maintaining many aspects of  homeostasis and normal health. D6D is important to recognize the mechanisms that regulate the expression of this enzyme in humans. A lower level of D6D was seen in breast tumors compared to normal tissues. Interestingly, the elevated serum level of D6D was seen in MS and DM, which explains the critical role of D6D in inflammatory diseases.We searched databases of PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Google Scholar, Scopus and related studies by predefined eligibility criteria. We assessed their quality and extracted data.Regarding the mTOR signaling pathway, there is remarkable contributions of many inflammatory diseases to attention to common metabolic pathways are depicted. Of course, we need to have the insights into each disorder and their pathological process. The first step in balancing the intake of EFAs is to prevent the disruption of  and expression of the D6D enzyme.The ω6 and ω3 pathways are two major pathways in the biosynthesis of PUFAs. In both of these, D6D is a vital bifunctional enzyme desaturating linoleic  or . Therefore, if ω6 and ω3 EFAs are given together in a ratio of 2: 1, the D6D expression will be down-regulated and normalized.Creative Commons Attribution License</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753111>A novel nanoformulation of α-eleostearic  restores molecular pathogenesis of hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p>The present work provides first-time empirical and molecular interaction evidence to establish the higher biofunctionality of a therapeutic , α-eleostearic  (ESA), encapsulated in a novel and thoroughly characterized biocompatible nanoemulsion (NE) system (particle size <200 nm).A novel methodology was employed to fabricate novel formulations of ESA.

The purpose of this research was to monitor in detail the goat milk fatty  (FA) profile during the first 24 h after linseed oil (LO) supplementation or suppression in the diet. Particular emphasis was placed in the changes of FA with bioactive properties. Milk  was analysed by gas chromatography from milkings at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after diet shift.The α- levels increased 12 h after LO incorporation in the diet and decreased 3 h after oil suppression. Most of the milk 10:0 to 16:0 saturated FA decreased 24 h after LO supplementation, whereas oil suppression raised their levels after 6 h. Similarly, raising of mono- and polyunsaturated trans-FA after LO inclusion was delayed in comparison with their decrease after oil suppression.This study supports that ruminal bacteria and mammary glands would exhibit a fast responsiveness after the inclusion or suppression of LO in ruminant rations. Milk with an improved FA profile could be collected between 12 h after LO supplementation and the last milking before LO suppression in the diet. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30203512>Dietary Unsaturated Fatty Acids Modulate Maternal Dyslipidemia-Induced DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation in Placenta and Fetal Liver in Rats.</a></h1><p>The present study assessed the role of dietary unsaturated fatty acids in maternal dyslipidemia-induced DNA methylation and histone acetylation in placenta and fetal liver and accumulation of lipids in the fetal liver. Weanling female Wistar rats were fed control and experimental diets for 2 months, mated, and continued on their diets during pregnancy. At gestation days of 18-20, rats were euthanized to isolate placenta and fetal liver. DNA methylation, DNA methyl transferase-1 (DNMT1) activity, acetylation of histones (H2A and H2B), and histone acyl transferase (HAT) activity were evaluated in placenta and fetal liver. Fetal liver  accumulation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) were assessed.

Stearidonic  (18:4 n-3, SDA) is a plant source of n-3 PUFA that is elongated to 20:4 n-3, an analogue of AA. However, no 5-LO metabolites of 20:4 n-3 have been reported. In this study, control and 5-LO-expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated in the presence of 20:4 n-3. Metabolites were characterized by LC-MS/MS and their anti-inflammatory properties assessed using AA-induced autocrine neutrophil stimulation and leukotriene B-mediated chemotaxis. 8‑hydroxy‑9,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic  (Δ-8-HETE) and 8,15-dihydroxy-9,11,13,17-eicosatetraenoic  (Δ-8,15-diHETE) were identified as novel metabolites. Δ-8,15-diHETE production was inhibited by the leukotriene A hydrolase inhibitor SC 57461A. Autocrine neutrophil leukotriene stimulation and neutrophil chemotaxis, both BLT1-dependent processes, were inhibited by Δ-8,15-diHETE at low nM concentrations. These data support an anti-inflammatory role for Δ-8,15-diHETE, a novel 5-LO product.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

While evidence suggests that high PUFA intake can impact hypothalamic activity, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by essential dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA (i.e., linoleic  and α-, respectively) remain poorly described in this brain region. To differentiate the roles of essential dietary PUFA on hypothalamic function, we fed male rats high- diets (35% kcal/d) containing either safflower (linoleic ) or flaxseed (α-) oil for 2 months. Control rats were fed a low- (16% kcal/d) diet containing soybean oil. Hypothalamic fatty acids and gene expression were investigated by gas chromatography and microarray, respectively. Safflower-fed rats had higher total n-6 PUFA content due to increases in linoleic , arachidonic , and osbond  compared to the other diet groups, while flaxseed-fed rats had higher total n-3 content due to increases in α-, eicosapentaenoic , docosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic . Safflower-fed rats showed augmented expression of genes related to hypothalamic insulin signalling compared to controls. This was mirrored by significant increases in phosphorylated AKT and AKT levels; indicative of increased PI(3)K/AKT pathway activity. These changes were not observed in the hypothalamus of flaxseed-fed rats. Our findings provide new molecular insights into how essential fatty acids influence the hypothalamus and, potentially, whole-body energy homeostasis. This work also provides new knowledge to better understand the impact of essential fatty acids on metabolic and behavioral phenotypes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in the structure and function of cell membrane components have been linked to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by chronic ethanol consumption or cancer transformation has been implicated in changing the levels of phospholipids and fatty acids in the cell membrane. In this study, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to quantitate the effects of alcohol and malignant transformation on membrane components, namely phospholipids and free fatty acids. Ethanol increased the phospholipid levels. Moreover, the process of malignant transformation was accompanied by increased levels of phospholipids and arachidonic  as well as decreased levels of linoleic  and α-. Thus, these oxidative stress-inducing conditions that cause variations in the cellular composition affect the actions of the cell membrane and cell function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540275>Circulating odd-chain saturated fatty acids were associated with arteriosclerosis among patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension in Sri Lanka but not Japan.</a></h1><p>The differences in the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations might be explained by the differences in their diet, especially . To test the hypothesis that the fatty  (FA) compositions differ between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and that high concentrations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  are associated with a low level of arteriosclerosis, the authors compared the circulating FA compositions between Sri Lankan and Japanese populations and examined the association of the circulating FA composition with arterial stiffness in each population. The study participants were patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension in Sri Lanka (n = 100) or Japan (n = 236). Serum FA compositions were measured by gas chromatography. Arterial stiffness was measured using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Analysis of covariance was used to compare the FA compositions between the populations. Multiple regression was used to assess the association between each FA and CAVI levels. The concentrations of myristic, γ-, dihomo-γ-, and arachidonic acids were higher in the Sri Lankan patients than in the Japanese patients. In contrast, the concentrations of linoleic, α-, and eicosapentaenoic acids were higher in the Japanese patients than in the Sri Lankan patients. Although no associations of n-3 polyunsaturated FAs and linoleic  with CAVI were observed in both patient populations, odd-chain saturated FAs (pentadecanoic and heptadecanoic acids) were significantly inversely associated with CAVI levels in the Sri Lankan (P for trend = .03) but not the Japanese patients. The odd-chain saturated FAs might be inversely associated with atherosclerosis in this Sri Lankan population.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sixty 4-month-old castrated male Albas white cashmere kids (average BW 18.6 ± 0.1 kg) were randomly allocated among three dietary treatments: (i) basal diet without supplementation (Control), (ii) basal diet supplemented with linseed oil (LSO), (iii) basal diet supplemented with heated linseed grain (HLS). The concentrate:forage ratio was 5:5 and the LSO and HLS treatments provided the kids with similar dietary FA profiles. The diets were fed for 104 d, consisting of 14 d for adaptation followed by 90 d of experimental observation. Treatment did not significantly influence BW, DMI, or bacterial richness or diversity. On the other hand, the relative abundance of bacteria participating in hydrogenation differed significantly among the three groups: the Veillonellaceae and Christensenellaceae were more abundant in LSO kids, Prevotellaceae were more abundant in HLS kids, and the Fibrobacteriaceae were more abundant in Control kids (P < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis indicated that Ruminobacter, Selenomonas_1, Fretibacterium, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Succinimonas, and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group were the genera that participated in hydrogenation of long-chain FAs. HLS-fed kids had a lower relative abundance of Ruminobacter, but a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Fretibacterium than LSO-fed kids. These changes were associated with greater rumen concentrations of C18:3n3 and n-3 PUFA, but lower concentrations of n-6 PUFA and lower n-6/n-3 ratios, in HLS than in LSO-fed kids. In conclusion, feeding kids with HLS increased rumen concentrations of C18:3n3 and n-3 PUFA, but decreased the n-6/n-3 ratio by decreasing the abundance of bacteria that hydrogenate C18:3n3 and increasing the abundance of bacteria that hydrogenate C18:2n6.© The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, we examined whether polymorphisms of FADS1 and FADS2 are associated with these changes.Postmenopausal women (the mean age: 60.5 ± 5.0 y) were randomized for 16 weeks to two different calorie-restricted diets: a Central European diet (CED) or a Mediterranean diet (MED).After the intervention, levels of most FAs in red blood cells decreased in both groups. The delta values for the 20:1n-9 and the 20:2n-6 levels differed between the CED and the MED (-1.55 ± 4.02 μg/mL vs 0.39 ± 4.11 μg/mL and -0.62 ± 10.93 μg/mL vs 3.06 ± 8.75 μg/mL; P < 0.05). Women in the CED group with at least one minor allele of FADS genes had greater decreases of α-, dihomo-γ-, total n-6, and total PUFA (by approximately 70%, 40%, 35%, and 35%, respectively) than did women with the major alleles. After the intervention, the change in the  accumulation product index was -28.28 ± 27.84 and -32.00 ± 78.55 in the CED and the MED group, respectively.The effect of the dietary intervention on FA  seems to depend mostly on calorie restriction, but not on type of diet.

Lipotoxicity to the pancreatic beta cells is considered to be a major underlying cause for this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to analyse the toxicity profile of FFAs in the human EndoC-βH1 beta-cell line and to compare the results with isolated rat and human islets with special reference to the physiologically most prevalent FFAs palmitic  (PA) and oleic  (OA). Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ- (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The lack of a protective effect of the monounsaturated fatty  OA has important consequences for a beta-cell protective  composition of a diet. A cardioprotective diet with a high OA content does not fulfil this requirement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326753>Punicic  was metabolised and incorporated in the form of conjugated linoleic  in different rat tissues.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a supplementation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO), being rich in punicic , on the biochemical parameters of healthy rats.

There were no changes in their total body weight gain, their serum biochemical markers, or in the oxidative stress in their tissues. However, the TBARS values were reduced in the brains of the animals, noting that no significant amounts of conjugated fatty acids were found in this tissue.

Obesity is recognized as a state of chronic inflammation accompanied by various co-morbidities like T2D or cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that obesity impairs muscle regeneration, which is mainly due to chronic inflammation and to excessive accumulation of lipids in adipose and non-adipose tissue. To compare fatty  profiles and changes in gene expression at different time points after muscle injury, we used an established drop tower-based model with a defined force input to damage the  on the left hind limb of female C57BL/6J mice of normal weight and obese mice. Although most changes in fatty  content in muscle tissue are diet related, levels of eicosaenoic (normal weight) and DHG- (obese) in the phospholipid and docosahexaenoic  (normal weight) in the triglyceride fraction are altered after injury. Furthermore, changes in gene transcription were detected in 3829 genes in muscles of normal weight mice, whereas only 287 genes were altered in muscles of obese mice after trauma. Alterations were found within several pathways, among them notch-signaling, insulin-signaling, sonic hedgehog-signaling, apoptosis related pathways,  related cholesterol homeostasis, fatty  biosynthetic process, fatty  elongation, and acyl-CoA metabolic process. We could show that genes involved in  are affected 3 days after trauma induction mostly in normal weight but not in obese mice. The strongest effects were observed in normal weight mice for , the activating protein for leukotriene synthesis, and , an enzyme substantial for LDL synthesis. In summary, we show that obesity changes the  content of skeletal muscle and generally shows a negative impact upon blunt muscle injury on various cellular processes, among them fatty  related , notch-, insulin-, sonic hedgehog-signaling, and apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α--rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against  abnormality in both rodent models and humans. However, the metabolic response of FO to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high  diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation, mainly focusing on hepatic n-3 fatty  remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results showed that lard-based HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% -derived calories) induced whole-body insulin resistance,  profile abnormality, and inflammation in mice, which was alleviated by FO in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FO effectively improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice by modulating the specific location of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids across hepatic  fractions and enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor subtract-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine 632 and protein kinase B (AKT) ( p < 0.05). Importantly, the differential depositions of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids in plasma and ER membranes were observed, concomitant with the rescued ER unfolded protein response and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in mice liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920531>Low-phosphate-selected Auxenochlorella protothecoides redirects phosphate to essential pathways while producing more biomass.</a></h1><p>Despite the capacity to accumulate ~70% w/w of lipids, commercially produced unicellular green alga A. protothecoides may become compromised due to the high cost of phosphate fertilizers. To address this limitation A. protothecoides was selected for adaptation to conditions of 100× and 5× lower phosphate and peptone, respectively, compared to 'wild-type media'. The A. protothecoides showed initial signs of adaptation by 45-50 days, and steady state growth at ~100 days. The low phosphate (P)-adapted strain produced up to ~30% greater biomass, while total lipids (~10% w/w) remained about the same, compared to the wild-type strain. Metabolomic analyses indicated that the low P-adapted produced 3.3-fold more saturated palmitic  (16:0) and 2.2-fold less  (18:3), compared to the wild-type strain, resulting in an ~11% increase in caloric value, from 19.5kJ/g for the wild-type strain to 21.6kJ/g for the low P-adapted strain, due to the amounts and composition of certain saturated fatty acids, compared to the wild type strain. Biochemical changes in A. protothecoides adapted to lower phosphate conditions were assessed by comparative RNA-Seq analysis, which yielded 27,279 transcripts. Among them, 2,667 and 15 genes were significantly down- and up-regulated, at >999-fold and >3-fold (adjusted p-value <0.1), respectively. The expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular processes such as division, growth, and membrane biosynthesis, showed a trend toward down-regulation. At the genomic level, synonymous SNPs and Indels were observed primarily in coding regions, with the 40S ribosomal subunit gene harboring substantial SNPs. Overall, the adapted strain out-performed the wild-type strain by prioritizing the use of its limited phosphate supply for essential biological processes. The low P-adapted A. protothecoides is expected to be more economical to grow over the wild-type strain, based on overall greater productivity and caloric content, while importantly, also requiring 100-fold less phosphate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669503>Development and Validation of a LC⁻MS/MS-Based Assay for Quantification of Free and Total Omega 3 and 6 Fatty Acids from Human Plasma.</a></h1><p>Few high-performance liquid chromatography⁻tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods have been developed for the full quantitation of fatty acids from human plasma without derivatization. Therefore, we propose a method that requires fewer sample preparation steps, which can be used for the quantitation of several polyunsaturated fatty acids in human plasma. The method offers rapid, accurate, sensitive, and simultaneous quantification of omega 3 (α-, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) and omega 6 fatty acids (arachidonic and linoleic acids) using high-performance LC-MS/MS. The selected fatty acids were analysed in  extracts from both free and total forms. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed phase C18 column with isocratic flow using ammonium acetate for improving negative electrospray ionization (ESI) response. Mass detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and deuterated internal standards were used for each target compound. The limits of quantification were situated in the low nanomolar range, excepting linoleic , for which the limit was in the high nanomolar range. The method was validated according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, and offers a fast, sensitive, and reliable quantification of selected omega 3 and 6 fatty acids in human plasma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934976>Enhancing Omega-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty  Content of Dairy-Derived Foods for Human Consumption.</a></h1><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA) are termed essential fatty acids because they cannot be synthesized  by humans due to the lack of delta-12 and delta-15 desaturase enzymes and must therefore be acquired from the diet.  PUFA include α- (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the less recognized docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-3). The three long-chain (≥C)  PUFA (n-3 LC-PUFA), EPA, DHA, and DPA play an important role in human health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Up to the present time, seafood, and in particular, fish oil-derived products, have been the richest sources of n-3 LC-PUFA. The human diet generally contains insufficient amounts of these essential FA due largely to the low consumption of seafood. This issue provides opportunities to enrich the content of  PUFA in other common food groups. Milk and milk products have traditionally been a major component of human diets, but are also among some of the poorest sources of  PUFA. Consideration of the high consumption of milk and its processed products worldwide and the human health benefits has led to a large number of studies targeting the enhancement of  PUFA content in dairy products. The main objective of this review was to evaluate the major strategies that have been employed to enhance  PUFA content in dairy products and to unravel potential knowledge gaps for further research on this topic. Nutritional manipulation to date has been the main approach for altering milk fatty acids (FA) in ruminants. However, the main challenge is ruminal biohydrogenation in which dietary PUFA are hydrogenated into monounsaturated FA and/or ultimately, saturated FA, due to rumen microbial activities. The inclusion of oil seed and vegetable oil in dairy animal diets significantly elevates ALA content, while the addition of rumen-protected marine-derived supplements is the most effective way to increase the concentration of EPA, DHA, and DPA in dairy products. In our view, the mechanisms of  LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway from ALA and the biohydrogenation of individual  LC-PUFA in ruminants need to be better elucidated. Identified knowledge gaps regarding the activities of candidate genes regulating the concentrations of 3 PUFA and the responses of ruminants to specific  supplementation regimes are also critical to a greater understanding of nutrition-genetics interactions driving .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901932>In Vitro Study for Lipolysis of Soybean Oil, Pomegranate Oil, and Their Blended and Interesterified Oils under a pH-Stat Model and a Simulated Model of Small Intestinal Digestion.</a></h1><p>In this study, two in vitro digestion models were employed to compare the rate of lipolysis in soybean oil (SBO), pomegranate oil (PGO), a physical blend (PHY, 1:1 molar ratio of SBO:PGO, /), and their enzymatically interesterified oil (IO).

Interestingly, we found that the GLA content of  FR3 was up to 21% (proportion of total lipids) when trehalose was used as a carbon source, significantly higher than the 13% found when glucose was used. Trehalose is quite common and can be accumulated in microorganisms under stress conditions. However, little information is available regarding the role of trehalose in GLA synthesis and accumulation.

We profiled the major sugars, fatty acids, phospholipids, and gene transcripts of  FR3 grown in trehalose medium with glucose as a control by  transcriptomics, lipidomics, and other methods. The results showed that trehalose could influence the expression of desaturases and that the GLA proportion increased because of delta-6 desaturase upregulation. The increased GLA was transferred to the extracellular environment through the active PI ion channel, which prefers polyunsaturated acyl chains. At the same time, trehalose might prevent GLA from peroxidation by forming a trehalose-polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) complex.

This study determined the fatty  profile of Spanish lacto-ovo vegetarians (LO-vegetarians) and vegans. Participants were 104 healthy adults, LO-vegetarians ( = 49) and vegans ( = 55). Lifestyle habits and consumption of food and omega-3 supplements were estimated by questionnaires. BMI, blood pressure, and abdominal and body  were determined. Serum was collected to analyze fatty acids, glucose, lipids, homocysteine, insulin, and leptin. Volunteers were classified according to serum omega-6 to omega-3 (-6/-3) ratio into three groups: -6/-3 < 10, -6/-3 ≥ 10 to 20, and -6/-3 > 20. Results showed low cardiovascular risk and high insulin sensitivity with negligible differences between diet types.

Eicosanoids have potent pro-inflammatory actions, but also act as important autocrine/paracrine signaling molecules in skeletal muscle growth and development. Whether dietary ARA is incorporated into skeletal muscle phospholipids and the resulting impact on intramuscular inflammatory and adaptive processes in-vivo is not known. In the current study, resistance trained men (≥1 year) received dietary supplementation with 1.5g/day ARA (n=9, 24 ± 1.5 years) or placebo (n=10, 26 ± 1.3 years) for 4-weeks while continuing their normal training regimen. Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected in an overnight fasted state at baseline and week 4. ARA supplementation increased plasma content of ARA and gamma-, while decreasing relative abundance of linoleic , eicosapentaenoic , and dihomo-gamma-. In skeletal muscle, ARA and dihomo-gamma- content increased, whereas  was reduced. Compared to placebo, ARA supplementation reduced circulating platelet and monocyte number, and decreased the mRNA expression of the immune cell surface markers; neutrophil elastase/CD66b and interleukin 1-beta, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In muscle, ARA supplementation increased mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors; MyoD and myogenin, but had no effect on a range of immune cell markers or inflammatory cytokines. These data show that dietary ARA supplementation can rapidly and safely modulate plasma and muscle fatty  profile and promote myogenic gene expression in resistance trained men, without a risk of increasing basal systemic or intramuscular inflammation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decreases nutrient digestibility and limits the availability of n-3 FA. Addition of carbohydrase enzymes to flaxseed-based diets can decrease the anti-nutritive effects of NSP.

Five day-old broiler chicks were fed a corn-soybean basal diet with 0% flaxseed, a basal diet with 10% of flaxseed, or 10% flaxseed + 0.05% enzyme diet up to day 42 of growth. Total lipids, including long-chain (≥20C) n-3 FA and monounsaturated FA, were increased in flax-fed broiler livers. Enzyme addition reduced arachidonic  and total long chain n-6 FA. These changes were similarly reflected in phosphatidylcholine  species. Dietary flax and enzyme treatments up-regulated PPARα target genes  and  while reducing expression of  FA synthesis-related genes. This study concludes that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation in broiler diets enhances LC n-3 FA species, while reducing n-6 FA species in hepatic phospholipids (PL). Flaxseed-based diets changes the expression of genes involved in FA  without affecting growth or production performance in broilers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31054680>Fatty  metabolic flux and  peroxidation homeostasis maintain the biomembrane stability to improve citrus fruit storage performance.</a></h1><p>Little is known about the variations of fresh fruit biomembrane and its physiological and biochemical characteristics during storage. A navel orange mutant 'Gannan No.1' (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) showed higher membrane stability and titratable  while lower calyx senescence compared with wild-type 'Newhall'. The membrane damage was significantly reduced in 'Gannan No.1' under 10% polyethylene-glycol (41.16% vs. 8.77%) and 30% polyethylene-glycol (52.59% vs.16.11%) treatments on day 45 after harvest. Consistently, membrane electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde were significantly decreased in 'Gannan No.1', and superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were activated. A metabolic analysis was performed to evaluate membrane fatty  unsaturation and peroxidation.  and hexadecylenic  contributed to the higher degree of unsaturated fatty acids in 'Gannan No.1'. Furthermore, 'Gannan No.1' accumulated stress-resistant metabolites such as proline, α-tocopherol and glutathione. Correlation analysis of membrane homeostasis indexes with quality parameters showed the importance of biomembrane stability in maintaining citrus fruit quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The propensity of n-6 PUFA, such as linoleic , γ- and arachidonic , to undergo radical-induced peroxidation and generate 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) has been widely demonstrated. The ability of the latter to form covalent adducts with macromolecules and modify cellular functions has been linked to numerous pathological processes. Concomitantly, evidence has accumulated on specific signaling properties of low concentrations of 4-HNE that may induce hormetic and protective responses to peroxidation stress in cells. It has long been known that peroxidation of PUFA, and particularly arachidonic , also give rise to 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), which is more chemically reactive than 4-HNE. Few studies on 4-HDDE revealed its ability to avidly interact covalently with electronegative moieties in macromolecules and to its ability to selectively activate the transcriptional regulator Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR)-β/δ. The research on 4-HDDE has been impeded due to the lack of available pure 4-HDDE and antibodies that recognize 4-HDDE-modified epitopes in proteins. The purpose of this study was to employ an established procedure to synthesize 4-HDDE and use it to create and characterize a monoclonal antibody against 4-HDDE-modified proteins and establish its application for ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis of cells and tissues and further expand  peroxidation research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, a systematic comparison of effects of diets with different composition of 18-C fatty acids on browning/beiging phenotype has not been done. In this study, we compared the effects of different dietary fats, rich in specific 18-carbon fatty acids, on thermogenesis and . Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet containing 5.6% kcal  from lard and 4.4% kcal  from soybean oil (CON) or high- diets (HFD) containing 25% kcal from lard and 20% kcal  from shea butter (stearic -rich ; SHB), olive oil (oleic -rich oil; OO), safflower oil (linoleic -rich oil; SFO), or soybean oil (mixed oleic, linoleic, and α- acids; SBO)  for 12 weeks, with or without a terminal 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. When compared to SHB, feeding OO, SFO, and SBO resulted in lower body weight gain. The OO fed group had the highest thermogenesis level, which resulted in lower body  accumulation and improved glucose and . Feeding SFO downregulated expression of  oxidation-related genes and upregulated expression of lipogenic genes, perhaps due to its high n-6:n-3 ratio. In general, HFD-feeding downregulated  expression in both subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose tissue, and suppressed NE-induced  expression in brown adipose tissue. These results suggest that the position of double bonds in dietary fatty acids, as well as the quantity of dietary , may have a significant effect on the regulation of oxidative and thermogenic conditions in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295978>Cooperative interactions between seed-borne bacterial and air-borne fungal pathogens on rice.</a></h1><p>Bacterial-fungal interactions are widely found in distinct environments and contribute to ecosystem processes.

Chia seed is an ancient seed and is the richest plant source of α-. We aimed to determine how cellular senescence markers will be altered in adipose tissue of senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice fed with high- diets (HFDs); and how chia seed can affect the above markers. SAMP8 mice and their control senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) were divided into four groups, that is, SAMR1 low- diet group (R1LF), SAMP8LF group (P8LF), SAMP8 high- group (P8HF), and SAMP8HF group supplemented with 10% chia seed (P8HC). At the end of the intervention, body composition was measured through T-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and epididymal (EPI) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues were dissected for further analysis. Compared with the R1LF group, the P8HF and P8HC groups had significantly increased body  mass. In EPI , p16, CD68 and PAI-1 mRNA expression from P8HF group were significantly increased; chia seed partially reduced p16 and CD68 mRNA expression. The P8LF group has increased p16 and CD68, and the P8HF group has increased p16, p21, and CD68; and P8HC group has increased p16 mRNA expression. The protein expression of p-AMPK in EPI and SC  from the P8HF group was reduced. In conclusion, reductions in AMPK activity might be partially responsible for elevation in HFD-induced senescence markers in both EPI and SC , and chia seed supplementation is able to reduce senescence-associated markers at least in EPI adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661600>Lowering the linoleic  to alpha-linoleic  ratio decreases the production of inflammatory mediators by cultured human endothelial cells.</a></h1><p> (ALA) and linoleic  (LA) are precursors for longer-chain more unsaturated fatty acids and for  signalling molecules that may influence inflammatory processes through a variety of mechanisms. The actions of LA and ALA may be divergent and interdependent. The aim of this study was to investigate the incorporation and  of ALA and LA in cultured in EA.hy926 endothelial cells and the production of inflammatory mediators (VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-8) by these cells when exposed to different concentrations of ALA, LA and ratios of LA:ALA. Human endothelial cells were cultured with either culture medium or culture medium supplemented with ALA, LA or various ratios of LA:ALA (1:4, 1:1, 4:1, 9:1 or 19:1) followed by 24 h TNF-α stimulation; the total concentration of ALA plus LA was kept constant at 100 μM. The incorporation and  of ALA and LA was measured using gas chromatography. The production of inflammatory mediators in the supernatant was assessed using a Luminex Multi-Analyte kit. Both ALA and LA were incorporated and metabolised by the endothelial cells. Cells incubated with ALA had a statistically significantly lower production of VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 compared to cells incubated without additional ALA. LA was not found to exert pro-inflammatory effects. Cells incubated with low LA:ALA ratios had lower production of VEGF, RANTES, MCP-1 and IL-6 when compared with a LA:ALA ratio of 19:1. These findings suggest that a low LA:ALA ratio exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering the production VEGF, RANTES, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 in TNF-α stimulated endothelial cells compared to a high ratio. These effects were likely mediated by ALA, but LA may also possess some anti-inflammatory effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative pathways, including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity,  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids (Palmitic acid16:0;  acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2; Arachidonic  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and  metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we showed that a lipase designated HEAT INDUCIBLE LIPASE1 (HIL1) induces the catabolism of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) under heat stress in  leaves. Using thermotolerance tests, a T-DNA insertion mutant with disrupted  was shown to have a heat stress-sensitive phenotype. Lipidomic analysis indicated that the decrease of 34:6-MGDG under heat stress was partially impaired in the  mutant. Concomitantly, the heat-induced increment of 54:9-triacylglycerol in the  mutant was 18% lower than that in the wild-type plants. Recombinant HIL1 protein digested MGDG to produce 18:3-free fatty  (18:3-FFA), but not 18:0- and 16:0-FFAs.

This study aimed to determine the effect of the consumption of omega-3 PUFA-enriched hen eggs on the microvascular reactivity (primary outcome), blood pressure (BP), and serum  profile in young healthy individuals. The control group (N = 16) ate 3 ordinary hen eggs (277 mg of omega-3 PUFAs/day), and the OMEGA-3 group (N = 20) ate 3 omega-3 PUFA-enriched eggs containing 259 mg of omega-3 PUFAs/egg daily (α- (ALA), 167 mg/egg; eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), 7 mg/egg; docosahexaenoic  (DHA), 84 mg/egg) for 3 weeks (777 mg of omega-3 PUFA/day). Postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) in skin microcirculation assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry, serum  profile, fasting blood glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and arterial BP were measured in all subjects before and after the protocol. PORH was significantly enhanced, and triglycerides, hsCRP, and BP were significantly decreased in the OMEGA-3 group compared with baseline measurements, whereas there was no significant difference in the control group after the protocol when compared with baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that consumption of a mixture of omega-3 PUFA (ALA + EPA + DHA), provided via enriched hen eggs, elicits changes in the microvascular reactivity, BP, and triglyceride level in healthy subjects that are associated with CV benefits, thus suggesting that daily consumption of omega-3 PUFA-enriched eggs in healthy individuals may potentially contribute to CV risk factor attenuation and disease prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258511>Association between increased visceral  area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects: a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Visceral  accumulation in overweight status has been resulted in changes of fatty  profiles.

Hence, RetSat is speculated to be involved in a rapid unusual conversion of α-ESA to conjugated linoleic  (CLA), giving a less priority to its usual substrate all trans retinol, which would subsequently be converted into "all trans retinoic " (atRA). Otherwise, all trans retinol is converted by RetSat into all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol and eventually forms all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic , but not the atRA. The atRA controls differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of cells and it's deficiencies end up as neoplasms. Thus, here it is emphasized that safeguarding atRA would help controlling cell division and growth in a favourable manner.

The fatty acids esterified in sn-2 are thus preferentially absorbed, which means that the bioavailability of a single fatty  is affected by its position on the triglyceride. This experiment is carried out with the milk used to make cheese applied in a study with 42 human volunteers. In that study the authors detected an improvement in the blood  profile. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of this kind of cheese in improving human health by studying how linseed supplementation affects the milk fatty  composition of the 3 different triglyceride positions and thus the fatty  bioavailability. The sn-2 were obtained by reacting total milk lipids with swine pancreatic lipase. The milk came from 24 sheep fed a control diet and 24 sheep fed a diet containing 200 g of extruded linseed per day. The sn-2 were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The fatty  composition of total lipids and sn-2 was obtained by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector apparatus equipped with a high polar 100 m length capillary column. The bioavailability of the fatty acids was evaluated by a putative preferential intestinal absorption index (PPIAi), where PPIAi <0 indicated a disadvantageous nutritional condition and PPIAi >0 indicated a preferential intestinal absorption. With regard to the fatty  composition of triglycerides, the linseed group showed a significantly higher content of both  and rumenic  compared with the control. As a consequence of linseed supplementation, the  and rumenic  content esterified in the β-position increased greatly. This was highlighted by the PPIAi.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of genetically modified flaxseed (W86) rich in phenylpropanoid compounds and hydrolysable tannin in high cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis rabbit models compared to parental cultivar Linola.Twenty-Eight White New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 months were randomly divided into four groups, control group, high cholesterol group (10 g/kg), Linola flaxseed group (100 g/kg) and W86 flaxseed group (100 g/kg). The rabbits were fed a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. Levels of blood lipids, hematological values, total antioxidative status and superoxide dismutase activity in serum were determined. Moreover, body weight and feed intake were measured after sixth and tenth weeks. After each stage of the experiment atherogenic indexes (non-HDL-C/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and atherogenic index of plasma) was calculated.The intake of a dyslipidaemic diet negatively influenced  profile in rabbits at the 10 weeks of feeding. W86 flaxseed significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG serum levels in cholesterolemic rabbits compared with parental Linola after 10 weeks. Atherogenic indexes decreased over time with a significant difference between the diets and they were the best for W86 flaxseed. Similarly, the experimental addition of W86 significantly decreased atherogenic predictors such as heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and the mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio. In rabbits, W86 flaxseed increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidative status compared to Linola.Results of the presented study suggest that the addition of W86 flaxseed alleviate serum  changes in high cholesterolemic diet-administered rabbits.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1), oleic  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma- (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, many of these compounds with in vitro activity fail to respond in vivo, probably due to the sophistication of the physiological energy regulatory networks. In this context, C. elegans has emerged as a plausible model for the identification and characterization of the effect of such compounds on  storage in a complete organism. However, the results obtained in such a simple model are not easily extrapolated to more complex organisms such as mammals, which hinders its application in the short term. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain new experimental data about the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of  loss between worms and mammals. Previously, we found that some omega-6 fatty acids promote  loss in C. elegans by up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation in an omega-3 independent manner. In this work, we prove that the omega-6 fatty acids' effects on worms are also seen when they are supplemented with a natural omega-6 source (borage seed oil, BSO). Additionally, we explore the anti-obesity effects of two doses of BSO in a diet-induced obesity rat model, validating the up-regulation of peroxisomal fatty  β-oxidation. The supplementation with BSO significantly reduces body weight gain and energy efficiency and prevents white adipose tissue accumulation without affecting food intake. Moreover, BSO also increases serum HDL-cholesterol levels, improves insulin resistance and promotes the down-regulation of Cebpa, an adipogenesis-related gene. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids are highly conserved between worms and obesity-induced mammals, so these compounds could be considered to treat or prevent obesity-related disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890432> droplets participate in modulating innate immune genes in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.</a></h1><p> droplets (LDs) are increasingly being recognized as important immune modulators in mammals, in additional to their function of  ester deposition. However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and  catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of  transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous  mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]: [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a -free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in  levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous  mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been increasing interest in the relationship of fish oil with skin protection and homeostasis, especially with respect to the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The other PUFAs, such as α- (ALA) and linoleic  (LA), also show a beneficial effect on the skin. The major mechanisms of PUFAs for attenuating cutaneous inflammation are the competition with the inflammatory arachidonic  and the inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoid production. On the other hand, PUFAs in fish oil can be the regulators that affect the synthesis and activity of cytokines for promoting wound healing. A systemic review was conducted to demonstrate the association between fish oil supplementation and the benefits to the skin. The following describes the different cosmetic and therapeutic approaches using fatty acids derived from fish oil, especially ALA, LA, DHA, and EPA. This review summarizes the cutaneous application of fish oil and the related fatty acids in the cell-based, animal-based, and clinical models. The research data relating to fish oil treatment of skin disorders suggest a way forward for generating advances in cosmetic and dermatological uses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29645359>Intake of Fatty Fish Alters the Size and the Concentration of  Components of HDL Particles and Camelina Sativa Oil Decreases IDL Particle Concentration in Subjects with Impaired Glucose .</a></h1><p>Intake of long-chain n-3 PUFAs affects the lipoprotein subclass profile, whereas the effect of shorter chain n-3 PUFAs remains unclear. We investigated the effect of fish and camelina sativa oil (CSO) intakes on lipoprotein subclasses.Altogether, 79 volunteers with impaired glucose  were randomly assigned to CSO, fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF), or control group for 12 weeks. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine lipoprotein subclasses and their  components. The average HDL particle size increased in the FF group (overall p = 0.032) as compared with the control group. Serum concentrations of cholesterol in HDL and HDL (overall p = 0.024 and p = 0.021, respectively) and total lipids and phospholipids in large HDL particles (overall p = 0.012 and p = 0.019, respectively) increased in the FF group, differing significantly from the LF group. The concentration of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles decreased in the CSO group (overall p = 0.033) as compared with the LF group.Our study suggests that FF intake causes a shift toward larger HDL particles and increases the concentration of  components in HDL, which may be associated with the antiatherogenic properties of HDL. Furthermore, CSO intake decreases IDL particle concentration. These changes may favorably affect cardiovascular risk.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.</p></html>
