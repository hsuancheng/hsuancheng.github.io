Whether these effects are due to the high dietary lipid content or to the concomitant decrease of carbohydrate intake is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether higher amounts of dietary fat reaching the colon (through orlistat administration) affect the colonic ecosystem in healthy volunteers and the effect of the prebiotic oligofructose (OF) in this model.Forty-one healthy young subjects were distributed among four groups: Control (C), Prebiotic (P), Orlistat (O), and Orlistat/Prebiotic (OP). They consumed a fat-standardized diet (60 g/day) during Week-1 (baseline) and after 1 week of washout, Week-3. During Week-3, they also received their respective treatment (Orlistat: 2 × 120 mg/day, OF: 16 g/day, and maltodextrin as placebo). A 72-h stool collection was carried out at the end of Week-1 (T0) and Week-3 (T1). Fecal fat, calprotectin, and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) as well as the antioxidant activity of fecal waters (ferric-reducing antioxidant power), fecal microbiota composition (by deep sequencing), and gut permeability (Sucralose/Lactulose/Mannitol test) were determined at these times.Fecal fat excretion was higher in the O (P=0.0050) and OP (P=0.0069) groups. This event was accompanied, in the O group, by an increased calprotectin content (P=0.047) and a decreased fecal antioxidant activity (P=0.047). However, these alterations did not alter gut barrier function and the changes observed in the composition of the fecal microbiota only affected bacterial populations with low relative abundance (<0.01%); in consequences, fecal SCFA remained mainly unchanged. Part of the colonic alterations induced by orlistat were prevented by OF administration.In the context of an equilibrated diet, the acute exposition of the colonic ecosystem to high amounts of dietary lipids is associated with an incremented excretion of fecal calprotectin and pro-oxidant activity of the colonic content, in the absence of significant changes in the microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950280>Type 2 Diabetes and Bacteremia.</a></h2><p>A high proportion of type 2 diabetes cases are associated with host genetic and environmental factors. During the past decade, microorganisms that inhabit the gut have emerged as contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, manipulation of the human gut microbiota will provide essential clues regarding new therapeutic targets for diabetes.Several studies have established the presence of gut dysbiosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, even though there are some differences among the studies that could be explained by differences in ethnicity, diet, and methodology. Gut dysbiosis affects the quality and quantity of short-chain fatty  and secondary bile  that act as signaling molecules in energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In addition, gut dysbiosis affect intestinal permeability. In particular, a high-fat diet can lead to changes in the gut microbiota that strongly reduce intestinal permeability due to the malfunction of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1 [<citeref rid="ref1">1</citeref>]. The formation of leaky gut results in increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide, which activate Toll-like receptor 4 and result in innate and adaptive immune responses [<citeref rid="ref2">2</citeref>]. Key messages: Gut dysbiosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes, for example, via chronic low-grade inflammation. Normalizing gut dysbiosis could be a new approach to overcome diseases of insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus.© 2017 S.

Two serotypes of lipopolysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] O55:B5 and O127:B8) were tested at shock-inducing doses (0.5-2 mg/kg). Phasic rises in RER were observed consistently across LPS serotypes and doses. The RER rise often exceeded the ceiling of the quotient for oxidative metabolism, and was mirrored by depletion of arterial bicarbonate and decreases in pH It occurred independently of ventilatory adjustments. These data indicate that the rise in RER results from a nonmetabolic CO load produced via an -induced equilibrium shift in the bicarbonate buffer. Having validated this new experimental aid, we asked whether acidosis was interconnected with the metabolic and thermal responses that accompany endotoxic shock in unanesthetized rats. Contrary to this hypothesis, however, acidosis persisted regardless of whether the ambient temperature favored or prevented downregulation of mitochondrial oxidation and regulated hypothermia. We then asked whether the substrate that fuels aerobic metabolism could be a relevant factor in LPS-induced acidosis. Food deprivation was employed to divert metabolism away from glucose oxidation and toward fatty  oxidation. Interestingly, this intervention attenuated the RER response to LPS by 58%, without suppressing other key aspects of systemic inflammation. We conclude that  production in unanesthetized rats with endotoxic shock results from a phasic activation of glycolysis, which occurs independently of physiological changes in mitochondrial oxidation and body temperature.© 2017 The Authors.

Among these, some of the most exciting advances are occurring in the area of flavonoids, bioactive phytochemicals found in plant foods; and in the area of dairy, including milk, yogurt, and cheese. Many of the relevant ingredients and mechanistic pathways are now being clarified, shedding new light on both the ingredients and the pathways for how diet influences health and well-being. Flavonoids, for example, have effects on skeletal muscle, adipocytes, liver, and pancreas, and myocardial, renal, and immune cells, for instance, related to 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, endothelial NO synthase activation, and suppression of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) and TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4). Effects of dairy are similarly complex and may be mediated by specific amino , medium-chain and odd-chain saturated fats, unsaturated fats, branched-chain fats, natural  fats, probiotics, vitamin K1/K2, and calcium, as well as by processing such as fermentation and homogenization. These characteristics of dairy foods influence diverse pathways including related to mammalian target of rapamycin, silent information regulator transcript-1, angiotensin-converting enzyme, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, osteocalcin, matrix glutamate protein, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, hepatic and adipose fatty  oxidation and inflammation, and gut microbiome interactions such as intestinal integrity and . The complexity of these emerging pathways and corresponding biological responses highlights the rapid advances in nutritional science and the continued need to generate robust empirical evidence on the mechanistic and clinical effects of specific foods.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30065236>A Polysaccharide Isolated from Dictyophora indusiata Promotes Recovery from Antibiotic-Driven Intestinal Dysbiosis and Improves Gut Epithelial Barrier Function in a Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Despite the tremendous biological activity of polysaccharides from the mushroom , its role in the restoration of gut microbiota has not yet been explored. The present study aimed to investigate whether  polysaccharide (DIP) could modulate the recovery of gut microbiota composition and intestinal barrier function after broad-spectrum antibiotic-driven dysbiosis. Alteration and restoration in the microbial communities were elucidated by the Illumina MiSeq platform. Colon histology, expression of tight-junction associated proteins, and serum/tissue endotoxin and cytokine levels were evaluated. Two-week daily oral administration of clindamycin and metronidazole resulted in reduced bacterial diversity and richness, and perturbed the microbial flora at various taxonomic levels (altered Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased relative abundance of harmful flora (Proteobacteria, and )), whereas DIP administration reversed the dysbiosis and increased beneficial flora, including Lactobacillaceae (lactic -producing bacteria), and Ruminococaceae (butyrate-producing bacteria). In addition, it resulted in the reduction of  (through lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)) levels, with the increased expression of tight-junction associated proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1). These findings not only suggested a comprehensive understanding of the protective effects of a DIP in the restoration of gut microbiota but also highlighted its role in the enhancement of gut barrier integrity, reduction of inflammation and lowering of endotoxin levels in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28000223>Western diet induces colonic nitrergic myenteric neuropathy and dysmotility in mice via saturated fatty - and lipopolysaccharide-induced TLR4 signalling.</a></h2><p>A high-fat diet (60% kcal from fat) is associated with motility disorders inducing constipation and loss of nitrergic myenteric neurons in the proximal colon. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, which occurs in response to HFD, contributes to . High levels of lipopolysaccharide lead to apoptosis in cultured myenteric neurons that express Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Consumption of a Western diet (WD) (35% kcal from fat) for 6 weeks leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis associated with altered bacterial metabolites and increased levels of plasma free fatty . These disorders precede the nitrergic myenteric cell loss observed in the proximal colon. Mice lacking TLR4 did not exhibit WD-induced myenteric cell loss and dysmotility. Lipopolysaccharide-induced in vitro enteric neurodegeneration requires the presence of palmitate and may be a result of enhanced NO production. The present study highlights the critical role of plasma saturated free fatty  that are abundant in the WD with respect to driving enteric neuropathy and colonic dysmotility.The consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with myenteric neurodegeneration, which in turn is associated with delayed colonic transit and constipation. We examined the hypothesis that an inherent increase in plasma free fatty  (FFA) in the HFD together with an HFD-induced alteration in gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of these disorders. C57BL/6 mice were fed a Western diet (WD) (35% kcal from fat enriched in palmitate) or a purified regular diet (16.9% kcal from fat) for 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Gut microbiota dysbiosis was investigated by fecal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) measurement and metabolomics (linear trap quadrupole-Fourier transform mass spectrometer) analysis. Plasma FFA and LPS levels were assessed, in addition to colonic and ileal nitrergic myenteric neuron quantifications and motility. Compared to regular diet-fed control mice, WD-fed mice gained significantly more weight without blood glucose alteration. Dysbiosis was exhibited after 6 weeks of feeding, as reflected by increased fecal LPS and bacterial metabolites and concomitant higher plasma FFA. The numbers of nitrergic myenteric neurons were reduced in the proximal colon after 9 and 12 weeks of WD and this was also associated with delayed colonic transit. WD-fed Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mice did not exhibit myenteric cell loss or dysmotility. Finally, LPS (0.5-2 ng·ml ) and palmitate (20 and 30 μm) acted synergistically to induce neuronal cell death in vitro, which was prevented by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. In conclusion, WD-feeding results in increased levels of FFA and microbiota that, even in absence of hyperglycaemia or overt , synergistically induce TLR4-mediated neurodegeneration and dysmotility.© 2016 The Authors.

The current study investigates whole-body and splanchnic tissue metabolism in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge with or without a supplement of six AA (cysteine, glutamine, methionine, proline, serine and threonine). Eight sheep were surgically prepared with vascular catheters across the gut and liver. On two occasions, four sheep were infused through the jugular vein for 20 h with either saline or LPS from Escherichia coli (2 ng/kg body weight per min) in a random order, plus saline infused into the mesenteric vein; the other four sheep were treated with saline or LPS plus saline or six AA infused via the jugular vein into the mesenteric vein. Whole-body AA irreversible loss rate (ILR) and tissue protein metabolism were monitored by infusion of [ring-2H2]phenylalanine. LPS increased (P<0·001) ILR (+17 %), total plasma protein synthesis (+14 %) and lymphocyte protein synthesis (+386 %) but decreased albumin synthesis (-53 %, P=0·001), with no effect of AA infusion. Absorption of dietary AA was not reduced by LPS, except for glutamine. LPS increased the hepatic removal of leucine, lysine, glutamine and proline. Absolute hepatic extraction of supplemented AA increased, but, except for glutamine, this was less than the amount infused. This increased net appearance across the splanchnic bed restored arterial concentrations of five AA to, or above, values for the saline-infused period. Infusion of key AA does not appear to alter the acute period of endotoxaemic response, but it may have benefits for the chronic or recovery phases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574193>Green Tea Extract Treatment in Obese Mice with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Restores the Hepatic Metabolome in Association with Limiting -TLR4-NFκB-Mediated Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Catechin-rich green tea extract (GTE) alleviates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by lowering endotoxin-TLR4 (Toll-like receptor-4)-NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-B) inflammation. This study aimed to define altered MS-metabolomic responses during high-fat (HF)-induced NASH that are restored by GTE utilizing livers from an earlier study in which GTE decreased endotoxin-TLR4-NFκB liver injury.Mice are fed a low-fat (LF) or HF diet for 12 weeks and then randomized to LF or HF diets containing 0% or 2% GTE for an additional 8 weeks. Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia insulin resistance, and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino , lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile , flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino , B-vitamins, and bile  are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκB inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκB-mediated liver injury in NASH.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

By gut microbiota assay, ratio of Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes for gut microbiota was reduced by butyrate. In Caco-2 cells, butyrate significantly promoted cell proliferation, decreased inflammatory cytokines' secretion, enhanced cell anti-oxidative stress ability and preserved the epithelial monocellular integrity, which was damaged by LPS.

Therefore, there is a need for effective preventive and treatment strategies aimed at minimizing the host's inflammatory reaction to these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from gastrointestinal disease. Resveratrol (RES, trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a phytoalexin commonly found in fruits and beverages, including red wine. Health benefits associated with the consumption of red wine have been attributed to RES. Resveratrol has been significantly shown to exert a powerful anti-inflammatory effect in laboratory animals subjected to experimental /sepsis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine in vitro whether RES had an inhibitory effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in cultivated whole blood (Cwb) following stimulation by PAMPs. We hypothesized that RES would inhibit TNF production in Cwb following stimulation by LPS or lipoteichoic  (LTA). Production of TNF bioactivity in Cwb was measured in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (control), ethanol (solvent control), dexamethasone (anti-inflammatory control), LPS, LTA, and three different concentrations of RES. Both LPS and LTA stimulated TNF production, and addition of dexamethasone was inhibitory to this effect. An anti-inflammatory effect for RES was not demonstrated under the current experimental conditions. Further studies are required to characterize the effect of RES on the equine innate immune system during systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The intestine has a highly specialized epithelial membrane which regulates transport across the mucosa. Due to dysbiosis, impairment of the intestinal barrier and altered immunity status, bacterial products can reach the liver through the portal vein, where they are recognized by specific receptors, activate the immune system and lead to a proinflammatory response. Gut microbiota and bacterial translocation play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and its complications, such as portal hypertension, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopaty. The gut microbiota also plays a critical role as a modulator of bile  metabolism which can also influence intestinal permeability and portal hypertension through the farnesoid-X receptor. On the other hand, cirrhosis and portal hypertension affect the microbiota and increase translocation, leading to a "chicken and egg" situation, where translocation increases portal pressure, and vice versa. A myriad of therapies targeting gut microbiota have been evaluated specifically in patients with chronic liver disease. Further studies targeting intestinal microbiota and its possible hemodynamic and metabolic effects are needed. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases and portal hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29268595>Microbiota, a key player in alcoholic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Only 20% of heavy alcohol consumers develop alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The intestinal microbiota (IM) has been recently identified as a key player in the severity of liver injury in ALD. Common features of ALD include a decrease of gut epithelial tight junction protein expression, mucin production, and antimicrobial peptide levels. This disruption of the gut barrier, which is a prerequisite for ALD, leads to the passage of bacterial products into the blood stream (). Moreover, metabolites produced by bacteria, such as short chain fatty , volatile organic compounds (VOS), and bile  (BA), are involved in ALD pathology. Probiotic treatment, IM transplantation, or the consumption of dietary fiber, such as pectin, which all alter the ratio of bacterial species, have been shown to improve liver injury in animal models of ALD and to be associated with an improvement in gut barrier function. Although the connections between the microbiota and the host in ALD are well established, the underlying mechanisms are still an active area of research. Targeting the microbiome through the use of prebiotic, probiotic, and postbiotic modalities could be an attractive new approach to manage ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397344>Interactions between Roseburia intestinalis and diet modulate atherogenesis in a murine model.</a></h2><p>Humans with metabolic and inflammatory diseases frequently harbour lower levels of butyrate-producing bacteria in their gut. However, it is not known whether variation in the levels of these organisms is causally linked with disease development and whether diet modifies the impact of these bacteria on health. Here we show that a prominent gut-associated butyrate-producing bacterial genus (Roseburia) is inversely correlated with atherosclerotic lesion development in a genetically diverse mouse population. We use germ-free apolipoprotein E-deficient mice colonized with synthetic microbial communities that differ in their capacity to generate butyrate to demonstrate that Roseburia intestinalis interacts with dietary plant polysaccharides to: impact gene expression in the intestine, directing metabolism away from glycolysis and toward fatty  utilization; lower systemic inflammation; and ameliorate atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intestinal administration of butyrate reduces  and atherosclerosis development. Together, our results illustrate how modifiable diet-by-microbiota interactions impact cardiovascular disease, and suggest that interventions aimed at increasing the representation of butyrate-producing bacteria may provide protection against atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793772>Effect of Dietary Lipids on  Influences Postprandial Inflammatory Response.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) results in postprandial metabolic alterations that predisposes one to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and increased oxidative stress. We aimed to assess the effect of the consumption of the quantity and quality of dietary fat on fasting and postprandial plasma lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A subgroup of 75 subjects with metabolic syndrome was randomized to receive 1 of 4 diets: HSFA, rich in saturated fat; HMUFA, rich in monounsaturated fat; LFHCC n-3, low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty ; LFHCC low-fat, rich in complex carbohydrate diet supplemented with placebo, for 12 weeks each. We administered a fat challenge reflecting the fatty  composition of the diets at postintervention. We determined the plasma lipoproteins and glucose and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and adipose tissue. LPS and LPS binding protein (LBP) plasma levels were determined by ELISA, at fasting and postprandial (4 h after a fat challenge) states. We observed a postprandial increase in LPS levels after the intake of the HSFA meal, whereas we did not find any postprandial changes after the intake of the other three diets. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between the LPS plasma levels and the gene expression of IkBa and MIF1 in PBMC. No statistically significant differences in the LBP plasma levels at fasting or postprandial states were observed. Our results suggest that the consumption of HSFA diet increases the intestinal absorption of LPS which, in turn, increases postprandial  levels and the postprandial inflammatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29179781>Low-fat yogurt consumption reduces biomarkers of chronic inflammation and inhibits markers of endotoxin exposure in healthy premenopausal women: a randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of low-fat dairy product consumption are largely unknown.

Intriguingly, dysregulation of the gut barrier is a key factor promoting the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). A functional gut barrier, which consists of a mucus layer, an intact epithelial monolayer and mucosal immune cells, supports nutrient absorption and prevents bacterial penetration. Compromised gut barrier function is associated with the progression of ALD. Indeed, alcohol consumption disrupts the gut barrier, increases gut permeability, and induces bacterial translocation both in ALD patients and in experimental models with ALD. Moreover, alcohol consumption also causes enteric dysbiosis with both numerical and proportional perturbations. Here, we review and discuss mechanisms of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction to better understand the contribution of the gut-liver axis to the pathogenesis of ALD. Unfortunately, there is no effectual Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for any stage of ALD. Therefore, we conclude with a discussion of potential strategies aimed at restoring the gut barrier in ALD. The principle behind antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics and fecal microbiota transplants is to restore microbial symbiosis and subsequently gut barrier function. Nutrient-based treatments, such as dietary supplementation with zinc, niacin or fatty , have been shown to regulate tight junction expression, reduce intestinal inflammation, and prevent  as well as liver injury caused by alcohol in experimental settings. Interestingly, saturated fatty  may also directly control the gut microbiome. In summary, clinical and experimental studies highlight the significance and efficacy of the gut barrier in treating ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28463404>A synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 and FOS prevents the development of fatty  liver and glycemic alterations in rats fed a high fructose diet associated with changes in the microbiota.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of a high fructose diet (HFD) on Sprague Dawley rats and the impact of a synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 and fructooligosaccharides. Feeding the HFD for 5 weeks resulted in liver steatosis and insulin resistance but not obesity. These changes were associated with increased production of short-chain fatty  and increased Bacteroidetes in feces, with an augmented Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, among other changes in the microbiota. In addition, barrier function was weakened, with increased LPS plasma levels. These data are consistent with increased fructose availability in the distal gut due to saturation of absorptive mechanisms, leading to dysbiosis, , hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Treatment with the synbiotic prevented some of the pathological effects, so that treated rats did not develop steatosis or systemic inflammation, while dysbiosis and barrier function were greatly ameliorated. In addition, the synbiotic had hypolipidemic effects. The synbiotic composed by L. fermentum CECT5716 and fructooligosaccharides has beneficial effects in a model of metabolic syndrome induced by a HFD, suggesting it might be clinically useful in this type of condition, particularly considering that high fructose intake has been related to metabolic syndrome in humans.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It has been employed in traditional medicine for its several health benefits including the prevention and cure of many debilitating diseases. Anti-inflammatory properties of Plectranthus amboinicus grown within this environment have not been adequately explored.The protective and therapeutic effects of Oregano against  and inflammation were evaluated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat models.A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly selected for this study and divided into six groups, with each group having 5 rats. Inflammation was induced on appropriate animal groups using LPS injection at a concentration of 4 mg/kg. Aqueous leaf extract of Indian borage was administered orally in four doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg post-LPS exposure and 150 mg/kg pre-LPS exposure) to respective treatment rat groups. Haematological profile, toxicity profile of liver and kidney and levels of biomarkers of inflammation were assayed using standard methods.Rats injected with LPS showed severe anaemia and marked leucopoenia with significant decrease in monocytes compared to the control group (p< 0.05). There was increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p< 0.05) in the peripheral circulation of rats exposed to LPS. Treatment with Indian borage significantly (p< 0.05) reduced the toxic effects in the LPS-treated animals and attenuated the increase in the expression of circulating proinflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TN-Fα) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) caused by LPS. Indian borage pretreatment also significantly (p< 0.05) counteracted the associated haematological dyscrasias caused by exposure to LPS. The extract elicited a significant protective effect on the kidney and liver as evidenced by the decreased renal markers and hepatic enzyme activities when compared with the control. The extract demonstrated protective and suppressive role against the overexpression of inflammatory mediators by ameliorating the induced inflammation and endotoxaemic conditions in the affected rat groups thereby validating its folkloric use.Our study thus reveals that the extract might be an active, natural and non-toxic drug lead against -induced inflammation and toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28132721>Hepatic interleukin-6 production is maintained during endotoxin tolerance and facilitates lipid accumulation.</a></h2><p>Gut-derived bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), contribute to the pathogenesis of steatosis and steatohepatitis by activating Kupffer cells, the resident liver macrophages. Exposure of macrophages to low doses of LPS causes hyporesponsiveness upon subsequent endotoxin challenge, a phenomenon termed endotoxin or LPS tolerance. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether LPS-induced lipid accumulation is affected by endotoxin tolerance. LPS pretreatment reduced the expression of proinflammatory mediators upon subsequent high-dose LPS treatment in murine livers. Total lipid and lipid class analysis indicated that LPS-induced lipid accumulation was not affected by endotoxin tolerance, although it was dependent on the presence of Kupffer cells. Analysis of the expression of lipogenic genes revealed that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and its target ELOVL fatty  elongase 6 (Elovl6) were upregulated upon LPS administration in livers from LPS-tolerant and non-tolerant mice, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (Ppara), a key inducer of lipid degradation, was decreased. Neither Interleukin (IL)-6 expression nor the activation of its downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 were suppressed in liver tissues of LPS-tolerized mice. In vitro experiments confirmed that recombinant or macrophage-derived IL-6 was a potent activator of the lipogenic factor STAT3 in hepatocytes. Accordingly, IL-6 treatment led to increased lipid levels in this cell type. In summary, our data show that endotoxin tolerance does not influence LPS-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and suggest that IL-6 drives hepatic lipid storage.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Recently research have found the anti-inflammatory effects of emodin. Here, we investigated the potential effects of emodin on a mouse model with a lethal dose of the potential mechanisms and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory lung injury in mice. The pulmonary histological abnormalities, the Evans blue's leakage, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the grades of TNF-α, IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), lactic  (LA) in lung tissues were determined 18 h post exposure of LPS. Based on the expression of LC3-II with BECN1 was determined using Western blotting. Besides, the LPS-exposed mice for survival rate was monitored. The results indicated that intervention with emodin was important for mitigating LPS-induced pulmonary histological change and LPS-induced leakage of Evans blue, which were associated with suppressed elevation of MPO activity and inhibited up-regulation of TNF-α, IL-6, NO with LA in lung tissues. Moreover, intervention with emodin enhanced the survival rate of LPS-exposed mice. Finally, therapy with emodin increased the LC3 and BECN1 in lungs of LPS-exposed mice. Treatment with 3-MA (the autophagy inhibitor) reversed the beneficial effects of emodin. In conclusion, emodin might provide pharmacological benefits in LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury, and the mechanisms might be related to the restoration of autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27186363>Contribution of the distal small intestine to metabolic improvement after bariatric/metabolic surgery: Lessons from ileal transposition surgery.</a></h2><p>Roux-en Y gastric bypass is a highly effective bariatric/metabolic surgical procedure that can induce robust weight loss and even remission of type 2 diabetes. One of the characteristic consequences of Roux-en Y gastric bypass is the expedited nutrient delivery to the distal small intestine, where L-cells are abundant and bile  reabsorption occurs. To examine the role of the distal small intestine in isolation from other components of Roux-en Y gastric bypass, the ileal transposition (IT) surgery has been used in various rat models. IT relocates the distal ileal segment to the upper jejunum distal to the ligament of Treitz without any other alterations in the gastrointestinal anatomy. Therefore, IT exposes the distal ileal tissue to ingested nutrients after a meal faster than the normal condition. Although there is some inconsistency in the effect of IT according to different types of rat models and different types of surgical protocols, IT typically improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin sensitivity and induced weight loss, and the findings were more prominent in obese diabetic rats. Suggested mechanisms for the metabolic improvements after IT include increased L-cell secretion (e.g., glucagon-like peptides and peptide YY), altered bile  metabolism, altered host-microbial interaction, attenuated metabolic  and many others. Based on the effect of IT, we can conclude that the contribution of the distal small intestine to the metabolic benefits of bariatric/metabolic surgery is quite considerable. By unveiling the mechanism of action of IT, we might revolutionize the treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26626919>Low-Grade Inflammation, Obesity, and Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Obesity and its comorbidities are closely related to the inflammatory environment created by expanded adipose tissue.

New strategies against lung endothelial barrier dysfunction may provide therapeutic benefits against lung vascular injury. Cell-cell junctions and microtubule cytoskeleton are basic components in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity. HDAC6, a deacetylase primarily localized in the cytoplasm, has been reported to modulate nonnuclear protein function through deacetylation. Both α-tubulin and β-catenin are substrates for HDAC6. Here, we examined the effects of tubastatin A, a highly selective HDAC6 inhibitor, on TNF-α induced lung endothelial cell barrier disruption and endotoxin-induced pulmonary edema. Selective HDAC6 inhibition by tubastatin A blocked TNF-α-induced lung endothelial cell hyperpermeability, which was associated with increased α-tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability. Tubastatin A pretreatment inhibited TNF-α-induced endothelial cell contraction and actin stress fiber formation with reduced myosin light chain phosphorylation. Selective HDAC6 inhibition by tubastatin A also induced β-catenin acetylation in human lung endothelial cells, which was associated with increased membrane localization of β-catenin and stabilization of adherens junctions. HDAC6 knockdown by small interfering RNA also prevented TNF-α-induced barrier dysfunction and increased α-tubulin and β-catenin acetylation in endothelial cells. Furthermore, in a mouse model of , tubastatin A was able to prevent endotoxin-induced deacetylation of α-tubulin and β-catenin in lung tissues, which was associated with reduced pulmonary edema. Collectively, our data indicate that selective HDAC6 inhibition by tubastatin A is a potent approach against lung endothelial barrier dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30503960>Microbial balance in the intestinal microbiota and its association with diabetes, obesity and allergic disease.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have been considered to symbiotic interactions of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and human lifestyle-related disorders. The human gastrointestinal microbiota continuously stimulates the immune system against opportunistic and pathogen bacteria from infancy. Changes in gastrointestinal microbiota have been associated with numbers of human diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune encephalitis, atherosclerosis, colorectal cancer, obesity, diabetes etc. In this review article, we evaluate studies on the roles of human gastrointestinal microbiota and interference pathogenicity in allergic diseases, obesity, and diabetes. Several studies indicated association between allergic diseases and changes in bacterial balance such as increased of Clostridium spp., some species of Bifidobacterium spp., or decreased of Bacteroidetes phylum and some species of Bifiobacterium spp. and production of specific short-chain fatty  due to food type, delivery modes of infant, infant evolvement environment and time of getting bacteria at an early-life age.

It is unclear how dietary fat composition may alter these parameters. We hypothesized that a meal rich in n-3 (ω3) fatty  would reduce  and associated inflammation but a saturated or n-6 (ω6) fatty -rich meal would increase postprandial serum endotoxin concentrations and systemic inflammation in healthy adults.Healthy adults (n = 20; mean age 25 ± 3.2 S.D. years) were enrolled in this single-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Participants were randomized to treatment and reported to the laboratory, after an overnight fast, on four occasions separated by at least one week. Participants were blinded to treatment meal and consumed one of four isoenergetic meals that provided: 1) 20 % fat (control; olive oil) or 35 % fat provided from 2) n-3 (ω3) (DHA = 500 mg; fish oil); 3) n-6 (ω6) (7.4 g; grapeseed oil) or 4) saturated fat (16 g; coconut oil).

Serum was analyzed for metabolites, inflammatory markers, and endotoxin. Data from all 20 participants were analyzed using repeated-measures ANCOVA.Participant serum endotoxin concentration was increased during the postprandial period after the consumption of the saturated fat meal but decreased after the n-3 meal (p < 0.05). The n-6 meal did not effect a different outcome in participant postprandial serum endotoxin concentration from that of the control meal (p > 0.05). There was no treatment meal effect on participant postprandial serum biomarkers of inflammation. Postprandial serum triacylglycerols were significantly elevated following the n-6 meal compared to the n-3 meal. Non-esterified fatty  were significantly increased after consumption of the saturated fat meal compared to other treatment meals.Meal fatty  composition modulates postprandial serum endotoxin concentration in healthy adults.

The present study aimed to investigate whether these symptoms were associated with markers of enterocyte disintegrity,  and inflammation. Patients with IBS were recruited consecutively from our outpatient clinic (n=94) and compared with a group of healthy controls (n=20). Habitual symptoms were assessed using the IBS Severity Scoring System, the Fatigue Impact Scale and Visual Analogue Scales for measuring musculoskeletal pain. A lactulose challenge test was performed to induce post‑prandial symptoms, and blood samples were obtained prior to and 90 min following lactulose ingestion to determine levels of intestinal fatty  binding protein (iFABP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the LPS co‑receptor soluble cluster of differentiation (sCD) 14, monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (MCP‑1) and calprotectin. Habitual symptom scores were high among the included patients, and lactulose ingestion induced significantly more symptoms in the patient group compared with the healthy control group (P=0.0001). Serum levels of iFABP were reduced in IBS patients compared with healthy controls, prior to and following lactulose ingestion (P=0.0002 and P=0.0001, respectively). Following lactulose ingestion, iFABP levels decreased in IBS patients (P=0.0001) and in healthy controls (P=0.02). Fasting levels of LPS, sCD14, MCP‑1 and calprotectin were not significantly different between IBS patients and healthy controls. However, following lactulose ingestion, LPS levels increased in healthy controls (P=0.03), whereas MCP‑1 levels decreased in IBS patients (P=0.008). Intestinal and extra‑intestinal symptom severities were not correlated with levels of circulating biomarkers. No assessed biomarker in the present study appeared to be associated with symptom development in IBS patients.

Both sevelamer and nicotinamide are prescribed for this purpose. In addition, they exert pleiotropic effects such as an improvement of inflammatory status and potentially enhanced clearance of uremic toxins. In the present secondary analysis of the NICOREN trial, we investigated the impact of sevelamer and nicotinamide on uremic toxins, toxin precursors, and  in chronic hemodialysis patients.Circulating uremic toxins (including phenylacetylglutamine, trimethylamine-N-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, kynurenine, hippuric , indole-3-acetic , 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic , kynurenic , and p-cresyl glucuronide) and precursors were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and urea, uric , phosphate, C-reactive protein, and intact parathyroid hormone by routine biochemistry methods. Serum endotoxin (evaluated by lipopolysaccharide levels) and C-terminal fibroblast growth factor-23 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.One hundred hemodialysis patients were randomized to receive either nicotinamide or sevelamer treatment. Among them, 63% were male, mean (± standard deviation) age was 65 ± 14 years, 47% had diabetes mellitus, and 51% had a history of cardiovascular disease. In the sevelamer group, but not the nicotinamide group, serum levels of urea, uric , and fibroblast growth factor-23 were significantly reduced after 6 months of treatment. The other circulating uremic toxins and toxin precursors remained unchanged in response to either phosphate-lowering agent. Sevelamer treatment led to a marked decrease in serum lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.001) whereas nicotinamide treatment induced an only modest decrease of borderline significance (p = 0.057). There was no change in C-reactive protein levels.In contrast to sevelamer, nicotinamide did not reduce circulating levels of low-molecular-weight uremic toxins other than phosphate, and neither agent reduced circulating uremic toxins of high-molecular-weight or protein-bound toxins. Sevelamer, but not nicotinamide, reduced serum endotoxin levels.

Diabetes and kidney disease are also commonly associated with a chronic inflammatory state, which is now considered a non-traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. In the case of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), inflammation is mainly a consequence of visceral obesity, while in the case of CKD or ESRD patients on dialysis, inflammation is caused by multiple factors, classically grouped as dialysis-related and non-dialysis-related. More recently, a key role has been credited to the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation present in both disease states. While many recent data on the intestinal microbiota and its relationship to chronic inflammation are available for CKD patients, very little is known regarding T2DM and patients with diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the main pathophysiological issues of intestinal microbiota in patients with T2DM and CKD/ESRD.The presence of intestinal dysbiosis, along with increased intestinal permeability and high circulating levels of lipopolysaccharides, a condition known as "," characterize T2DM, CKD, and ESRD on dialysis. The hallmark of intestinal dysbiosis is a reduction of saccharolytic microbes mainly producing short-chain fatty  (SCFA) and, in the case of CKD/ESRD, an increase in proteolytic microbes that produce different substances possibly related to uremic toxicity. Dysbiosis is associated with  and chronic inflammation, with disruption of the intestinal barrier and depletion of beneficial bacteria producing SCFAs. T2DM and CKD/ESRD, whose coexistence is increasingly found in clinical practice, share similar negative effects on both intestinal microbiota and function.

Nevertheless, their potential hepatoprotective effect against ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is still obscure. This study examined the possible hepatoprotective effect of telluric  (TELL), one of tellurium-based compound, against the deteriorating effect hepatic IR injury in rats through directing toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) cascade, phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt axis, and nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) pathway as possible mechanisms contributed to TELL's effect. Indeed, male Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: sham-operated, control IR and TELL (50 µg/kg). TELL was administrated once daily for seven consecutive days prior to the IR induction. Pretreatment with TELL attenuated hepatic IR injury as manifested by hampered plasma aminotransaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Also, TELL opposed IR induced elevation in tissue expression/activity of high-mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB1), TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (p-NF-κB p65), phospho-mitogen activated protein kinasep38 (p-MAPKp38) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, TELL reduced the elevated thiobarbituric  reactive substances along with increased both Nrf-2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, beside replenishment of hepatic reduced glutathione. In addition, TELL induced obvious upregulation of p-PI3K and p-Akt protein expressions together with restoration of histopathological changes in IR injury. In conclusion, TELL purveyed conceivable novel hepatoprotective mechanisms and attenuated events associated with acute hepatic injury via inhibition of TLR4 downstream axis and activation of Nrf-2 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Thus, TELL may provide a novel therapeutic potential for complications of hepatic IR injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Results showed that GLN administration reduced the number of neutrophils in the inflamed lungs, partially recovery of the reduced number of leukocytes in the blood; reduced adhesion molecules on lung endothelium and on circulating neutrophils. Moreover, GLN treatment diminished the number of neutrophils, levels of chemotactic cytokine CXCL2 in the inflamed peritoneum, and neutrophils collected from the peritoneum of GLN-treated mice presented lower levels of Rho, Rac, and JNK.

In  or sepsis, an enhanced activation of the rate-limiting enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is associated with a higher mortality risk. It is assumed that IDO induced immunosuppressive effects provoke the development of a protracted compensatory hypoinflammatory phase up to a complete paralysis of the immune system, which is characterized by an endotoxin tolerance. However, the role of IDO activation in the development of life-threatening immunoparalysis is still poorly understood. Recent reports described the impact of inflammatory IDO activation and aryl hydrocarbon receptor- (AhR-) mediated pathways on the development of LPS tolerance and immune escape of cancer cells. These immunosuppressive mechanisms offer new insights for a better understanding of the development of cellular dysfunctions in immunoparalysis. This review provides a comprehensive update of significant biological functions of TRP metabolites along the kynurenine pathway and the complex regulation of LPS-induced IDO activation. In addition, the review focuses on the role of IDO-AhR-mediated immunosuppressive pathways in endotoxin tolerance and carcinogenesis revealing the significance of enhanced IDO activity for the establishment of life-threatening immunoparalysis in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646594>Halobacterial nano vesicles displaying murine bactericidal permeability-increasing protein rescue mice from lethal endotoxic shock.</a></h2><p>Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) had been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and endotoxin neutralizing activity by interacting with LPS of Gram-negative bacteria.

The farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) ameliorates the histological features of NASH; satisfactory antifibrotic effects have not yet been reported. Here, we investigated the combined effects of OCA + a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fifty Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 12 weeks. The in vitro and in vivo effects of OCA + sitagliptin were assessed along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade and intestinal barrier function. Direct inhibitory effects of OCA + sitagliptin on activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSCs) were assessed in vitro.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin potentially inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis along with Ac-HSC proliferation and hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, α1(I)-procollagen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA expression and hydroxyproline levels. Obeticholic  inhibited hepatic TLR4 expression and increased hepatic matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. Obeticholic  decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating CDAA diet-induced zonula occludens-1 disruption, whereas sitagliptin directly inhibited Ac-HSC proliferation. The in vitro suppressive effects of OCA + sitagliptin on TGF-β1 and α1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression and p38 phosphorylation in Ac-HSCs were almost consistent. Sitagliptin directly inhibited the regulation of Ac-HSC.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin synergistically affected hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting  induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing Ac-HSC proliferation.

Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal gluconeogenesis gene expression that controls glucose regulation.

To understand whether changes in intestinal metabolism interact with gut microbiota and its release of inflammatory markers, we studied the effects of sprint interval (SIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on intestinal metabolism and microbiota in insulin resistance.Twenty-six, sedentary subjects (prediabetic n=9, T2D n=17; age 49[SD 4] years; BMI 30.5[SD 3]) were randomized into SIT or MICT. Intestinal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (GU) and fatty  uptake (FAU) from circulation were measured using PET. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and serum inflammatory markers with multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunoassay kit.VO2peak improved only after SIT (p=0.01). Both training modes reduced systematic and intestinal inflammatory markers (TNF α, LBP) (time p<0.05).

Under aerobic conditions, endotoxemic hearts had impaired LV function as judged by echocardiography in vivo (% ejection fraction, 66.0 ± 3.2 vs 78.0 ± 2.1, p < 0.05) or by LV work ex vivo (2.14 ± 0.16 vs 3.28 ± 0.16, Joules min(-1) g dry wt(-1), p < 0.05). However, rates of glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and glucose oxidation were not altered. Palmitate oxidation was lower in endotoxemic hearts in proportion to the decreased workload, thus metabolic efficiency was unaffected. In hearts reperfused following global ischemia, untreated hearts had impaired recovery of LV work (52.3 ± 9.4 %) whereas endotoxemic hearts had significantly higher recovery (105.6 ± 11.3 %, p < 0.05). During reperfusion, fatty  oxidation, acetyl CoA production and metabolic efficiency were similar in both groups.

Newborn monocytes massively release the alarmins S100A8/S100A9. In adults, these are major regulators of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We investigated whether S100A8/S100A9 cause an expansion of monocytic MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs) in neonates, thereby contributing to an immunocompromised state. Mo-MDSCs have been assigned to CD14/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR/CD33 monocytes in humans and to CD11b/Gr-1/Ly6G/Ly6C cells in mice. We found monocytes with these phenotypes significantly expanded in their respective newborns. Functionally, however, they did not prove immunosuppressive but rather responded inflammatorily to microbial stimulation. Their expansion did not correlate with high S100A8/S100A9 levels in cord blood. Murine studies revealed an excessive expansion of CD11b/Gr-1/Ly6G/Ly6C monocytes in S100A9 neonates compared to wild-type neonates.

Previous attempts to identify key mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction in experimental models have been limited by the lack of suitable methods for system-wide analyses of vascular bed biology. Here, we aimed to develop a novel method for investigating vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis that enables system-wide analyses of molecular interactions between endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in murine. Approach and Results- We developed a new technique using whole-body differential perfusion with increasing concentrations of detergent buffer to selectively solubilize distinct layers of vascular bed tissue in rodents. When combined with proteomics techniques, our novel approach of differential systemic decellularization in vivo enabled quantitative profiling of vascular beds throughout the body. Initial perfusion with phosphate buffer was used to obtain the endothelial glycocalyx, followed by subsequent extraction of endothelial cell components, and finally by smooth muscle cell constituents with increasing concentrations of detergent. Differential systemic decellularization in vivo has also been successfully applied to characterize molecular events in the vascular bed pathology of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice. Conclusions- Together, these data indicate that differential systemic decellularization in vivo permits system-wide molecular characterization of vascular bed proteomes in rodent models and can be used to advance our current understanding of vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis and progression in a wide range of disease settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930165>DLL4 and Jagged1 are angiogenic targets of orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77.</a></h2><p>Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of many diseases. Previously, we reported that orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77 was a critical mediator of angiogenesis to regulate tumor growth and skin wound healing via regulating the expression of the junctional proteins and integrins. However, the molecular mechanism, by which TR3/Nur77 regulates angiogenesis is not completely understood. Here, we were the first to find that TR3/Nur77, via its various amino  fragments, regulated the expression of DLL4 and Jagged 1 in cultured endothelial cells. DLL4 and Jagged1 mediated TR3/Nur77-induced angiogenic responses and signaling molecules, but not the expression of integrins. Instead, integrins regulated the expressions of DLL4 and Jagged1 induced by TR3/Nur77. Further, DLL4, Jagged1 and integrins α1, α2, β3 and β5 were regulated by TR3/Nur77 in animal sepsis models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced , and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), in which, TR3/Nur77 expression was significantly and tranciently increased. Mouse survival rates were greatly increased in Nur77 knockout mice bearing both CLP and LPS models. The results elucidated a novel axis of VEGF/histamine ➔ TR3/Nur77 ➔ integrins ➔ DLL4/Jagged1 in angiogenesis, and demonstrated that TR3/Nur77 was an excellent target for sepsis. These studies supported our previous findings that TR3/Nur77 was an excellent therapeutic target, and further our understanding of the molecular mechanism, by which TR3/Nur77 regulated angiogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been shown that high-fat feeding modulates gut microbiota which strongly increased intestinal permeability leading to lipopolysaccharide absorption causing metabolic  that triggers inflammation and metabolic disorders. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) have been shown associated with anti-obesity properties, but results still remain heterogeneous and very few studies underlined the metabolic pathways involved. Thus, the use of Fat-1 transgenic mice allows to better understanding whether endogenous n-3 PUFAs enrichment contributes to obesity and associated metabolic disorders prevention. It specially evidence that such effects occur through modulations of gut microbiota and intestinal permeability. Then, by remodeling gut microbiota, endogenous n-3 PUFAs improve HF/HS-diet induced features of the metabolic syndrome which in turn affects host metabolism. Thus, increasing anti-obesogenic microbial species in the gut microbiota population (i.e Akkermansia) by appropriate n-3 PUFAs may represent a promising strategy to control or prevent metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The NLRP3 inflammasome acts as a ligand-sensing element and plays an important role in mediating the immune and inflammatory response in the course of alcoholic liver disease.

We propose that one consequence of dietary overnutrition is increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut that cause increased inflammation, impaired gut function, and  that further dysregulate the already compromised antioxidant vitamin status in MetS. This discussion is timely because "healthy" individuals are no longer the societal norm and specialized dietary requirements are needed for the growing prevalence of MetS. Further, these lines of evidence provide the foundational basis for investigation that poor vitamin C status promotes , leading to metabolic dysfunction that impairs vitamin E trafficking through a mechanism involving the gut-liver axis. This report will establish a critical need for translational research aimed at validating therapeutic approaches to manage -an early, but inflammation-inducing phenomenon, which not only occurs in MetS, but is also prognostic of more advanced metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the increasing severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated whether the facilitation of central γ-amino butyric  (GABA) neurotransmission blunts these favorable influences of CSA. The LPS-CSA interaction was determined in the absence and presence of drugs that activate GABA or GABA receptors or elevate synaptic GABA levels in the central nervous system. The consequent i.v. administration of CSA (10 mg/kg) blunted the LPS-evoked hypotension, tachycardia, and reductions in time- and frequency-domain indices of heart rate variability (measures of cardiac autonomic control) evoked by LPS (10 mg/kg i.v.). The ability of CSA to reverse the LPS effects disappeared in rats treated intracisternally (i.c.) with baclofen (selective GABA agonist, 2 μg/rat) but not muscimol (selective GABA agonist, 1 μg/rat), indicating a preferential compromising action for central GABA receptors on the advantageous effects of CSA. Moreover, the improvement by CSA of LPS-evoked cardiovascular derangements was also eliminated after concurrent i.c. administration of vigabatrin (GABA transaminase inhibitor, 200 μg/rat) or tiagabine (GABA reuptake inhibitor, 100 μg/rat). These results demonstrate that the activation of central GABA receptors either directly via baclofen or indirectly following interventions that boost GABA levels in central synapses counterbalances the rectifying action of CSA on .© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28685413>Telluric  Ameliorates Endotoxemic Kidney Injury in Mice: Involvement of TLR4, Nrf2, and PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Being one of the most abundant trace elements in the human body, the therapeutic potential of tellurium-based compounds has been a target of interest. Recent reports denoted their redox-modulating and anti-inflammatory activities in experimental . However, their potential nephroprotective effect against endotoxemic kidney injury is yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the possible renoprotective effect of telluric  (TEL) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice, targeting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathways as possible mechanistic contributors to TEL's effect. AKI was induced by LPS (2 mg/kg). TEL (60 μg/kg; i.p.) was administered once daily for seven consecutive days before LPS injection. Pretreatment with TEL alleviated LPS-induced AKI as evidenced by the hampered serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C. TEL also opposed LPS-induced elevation in renal kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, nuclear factor-kappa B p65, interleukin-1β, and thiobarbituric -reactive substance contents. This was accompanied by a replenishment of renal glutathione, transcriptional upregulation of Nrf2, enhancement of heme oxygenase-1 activity, and a marked upregulation of phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt protein expressions. Histopathological findings corroborated with the amendment of biochemical parameters. In view of these findings, we may conclude that TEL pretreatment purveyed novel nephroprotective effects against endotoxemic kidney injury, which might be partly attributed to the modulation of TLR4, PI3K/Akt, and Nrf2 signaling pathways and may hence provide a valuable asset for the management of endotoxemic renal complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600357>The natural phosphoinositide derivative glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory and thrombotic responses.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory responses are elicited through lipid products of phospholipase A activity that acts on the membrane phospholipids, including the phosphoinositides, to form the proinflammatory arachidonic  and, in parallel, the glycerophosphoinositols. Here, we investigate the role of the glycerophosphoinositol in the inflammatory response. We show that it is part of a negative feedback loop that limits proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This inhibition is exerted both on the signaling cascade initiated by the lipopolysaccharide with the glycerophosphoinositol-dependent decrease in IκB kinase α/β, p38, JNK, and Erk1/2 kinase phosphorylation and at the nuclear level with decreased NF-κB translocation and binding to inflammatory gene promoters. In a model of  in the mouse, treatment with glycerophosphoinositol reduced TNF-α synthesis, which supports the concept that glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the  synthesis of proinflammatory and prothrombotic compounds and might thus have a role as an endogenous mediator in the resolution of inflammation. As indicated, this effect of glycerophosphoinositol can also be exploited in the treatment of manifestations of severe inflammation by exogenous administration of the compound.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624100>Leucine supplementation stimulates protein synthesis and reduces degradation signal activation in muscle of newborn pigs during acute .</a></h2><p>Sepsis disrupts skeletal muscle proteostasis and mitigates the anabolic response to leucine (Leu) in muscle of mature animals. We have shown that Leu stimulates muscle protein synthesis (PS) in healthy neonatal piglets. To determine if supplemental Leu can stimulate PS and reduce protein degradation (PD) signaling in neonatal muscle during , overnight-fasted neonatal pigs were infused for 8 h with LPS or saline while plasma amino , glucose, and insulin were maintained at fasting levels during pancreatic-substrate clamps. Leu or saline was infused during the last hour. Markers of PS and PD were determined in skeletal muscle. Compared with controls, Leu increased PS in longissimus dorsi (LD), gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles. LPS decreased PS in these three muscles by 36%, 28%, and 38%, but Leu antagonized that reduction by increasing PS by 84%, 81%, and 83%, respectively, when supplemented to LPS. Leu increased eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)3b-raptor interactions, eIF4E-binding protein-1, and S6 kinase 1 phosphorylation as well as eIF4E·eIF4G complex formation in LD, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles of control and LPS-treated pigs. In LD muscle, LPS increased the light chain (LC)3-II-to-LC3 ratio and muscle-specific RING finger (MuRF-1) abundance but not atrogin-1 abundance or AMP-activated protein kinase-α phosphorylation. Leu supplementation to LPS-treated pigs reduced the LC3-II-to-LC3 ratio, MuRF-1 abundance, and AMP-activated protein kinase-α phosphorylation compared with LPS alone. In conclusion, parenteral Leu supplementation attenuates the LPS-induced reduction in PS by stimulating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1-dependent translation and may reduce PD by attenuating autophagy-lysosome and MuRF-1 signaling in neonatal skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024522>Forebrain Cholinergic Signaling Regulates Innate Immune Responses and Inflammation.</a></h2><p>The brain regulates physiological functions integral to survival. However, the insight into brain neuronal regulation of peripheral immune function and the neuromediator systems and pathways involved remains limited. Here, utilizing selective genetic and pharmacological approaches, we studied the role of forebrain cholinergic signaling in the regulation of peripheral immune function and inflammation. Forebrain-selective genetic ablation of acetylcholine release and vagotomy abolished the suppression of serum TNF by the centrally-acting cholinergic drug galantamine in murine . Selective stimulation of acetylcholine action on the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR) by central administration of the positive allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic  (BQCA) suppressed serum TNF (TNFα) levels in murine . This effect was recapitulated by peripheral administration of the compound. BQCA also improved survival in murine  and these effects were abolished in M1 mAChR knockout (KO) mice. Selective optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons innervating brain regions with abundant M1 mAChR localization reduced serum TNF in endotoxemic mice. These findings reveal that forebrain cholinergic neurons regulate innate immune responses and inflammation, suggesting the possibility that in diseases associated with cholinergic dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease this anti-inflammatory regulation can be impaired. These results also suggest novel anti-inflammatory approaches based on targeting forebrain cholinergic signaling in sepsis and other disorders characterized by immune dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27427274>Hesperidin prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxicity in rats.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major trigger of septic shock resulting in multiple organ damage through excessive stimulation of the host's immune cells resulting in the release of cytokines. Previous studies have shown that hesperidin has several beneficial properties against inflammation and oxidative stress.The influence of hesperidin on , endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress was investigated using a murine model of sepsis.Rats were pretreated for 15 d with three doses (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg) of hesperidin prior to LPS administration. Afterwards, the levels of biomarkers of , endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress were assessed. Reverse transcriptase PCR technique was used to assess the expression of hepatic proinflammatory cytokines.Hesperidin pretreatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced circulating endotoxin, as well as the levels of bactericidal permeability increasing protein and procalcitonin, and the associated endothelial dysfunction by reducing the levels of plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecules 1 and inducible nitric oxide (iNO) synthase. There was also down-regulation of the expression of gene for interleukin 1α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 1 receptor, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in the liver of rats treated with LPS as a result of hesperidin pretreatment. Hesperidin also showed anti-oxidative properties through the significant (p < 0.05) reduction of NO, hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric  reactive substances and increase of glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase in the organs.Different doses of hesperidin can prevent -induced oxidative stress as well as inflammatory and endothelial perturbation in rats when administered for as few as 15 d before exposure to endotoxin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29338886>Overweight and obesity status in pregnant women are related to intestinal microbiota and serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles.</a></h2><p>Overweight and obesity may predispose women to clinical complications during their pregnancy. We hypothesize that a higher degree of overweight status is related to a range of aberrations in biomarkers already in early pregnancy. Our objective was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota, serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ in relation to the degree of overweight status in pregnant women.This study investigated 52 overweight and 47 obese pregnant women in early pregnancy. Fecal samples were analyzed for intestinal microbiota composition by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and Qiime pipeline. Circulating serum metabolites, including lipids, amino  and GlycA, a marker of low-grade inflammation, were analyzed by NMR metabolomics and hsCRP was quantified by immunoassay. Serum zonulin levels were analyzed to depict intestinal permeability by Zonulin ELISA kit and LPS activity for  by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. The analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate controlling.The relative abundance of bacterial family Prevotellaceae (adjusted P = 0.19) and markers of low-grade inflammation, hsCRP (P = 0.0015) and GlycA (P < 0.001) and three branched chain amino  (isoleucine, adjusted P = 0.024; leucine, adjusted P = 0.026; valine, adjusted P = 0.10) and one aromatic amino  (phenylalanine, adjusted P = 0.050) and concentrations of several VLDL particles and lipid measures in several VLDL particles were higher in obese pregnant women compared to their overweight pregnant counterparts (adjusted P < 0.12). In contrast, lipid measures in a few HDL particles and many fatty  were lower in obese compared to overweight pregnant women (adjusted P < 0.12).The detected alterations in intestinal microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory profiles related to obesity status may offer new alternative tools to supplement standard clinical measures to predict the risk for metabolic alterations during the early phase of pregnancy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

These include survival, quality of life, development of other complications and post liver transplantation survival. Radiological image analysis is currently utilized to diagnose sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Nutrient supplementation and physical activity are used to counter sarcopenia but have not been consistently effective because the underlying molecular and metabolic abnormalities persist or are not influenced by these treatments. Even though alterations in food intake, hypermetabolism, alterations in amino  profiles, , accelerated starvation and decreased mobility may all contribute to sarcopenia in cirrhosis, hyperammonemia has recently gained attention as a possible mediator of the liver-muscle axis. Increased muscle ammonia causes: cataplerosis of α-ketoglutarate, increased transport of leucine in exchange for glutamine, impaired signaling by leucine, increased expression of myostatin (a transforming growth factor beta superfamily member) and an increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species that decrease protein synthesis and increased autophagy mediated proteolysis, also play a role. These molecular and metabolic alterations may contribute to the anabolic resistance and inadequate response to nutrient supplementation in cirrhosis. Central and skeletal muscle fatigue contributes to impaired exercise capacity and responses. Use of proteins with low ammoniagenic potential, leucine enriched amino  supplementation, long-term ammonia lowering strategies and a combination of resistance and endurance exercise to increase muscle mass and function may target the molecular abnormalities in the muscle.

Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a diet containing high fat and high sucrose (HSHF) for 24 weeks to induce NASH. Blood and liver tissues were sampled at selected time points throughout the study. Compared with control animals, the content of alanine transaminase (ALT), triglycerides (TGs), and free fatty  (FFAs) in plasma and the TG and FFA content in the liver was increased from week 4 to 24. The level of TNFα and MCP-1 in plasma, the content of TNFα in the liver, the insulin resistance index, inflammatory cell infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and endoplasmic stress-associated protein expression were unaltered at 4 weeks. However, these levels were significantly elevated in HSHF fed rats at 12 weeks. At the same time, the level of endotoxin progressively increased from 0.08 ± 0.02 endotoxin EU/ml at week 4 to 0.7 ± 0.19 EU/ml at week 24. Moreover, these rats had elevated blood endotoxin levels, which were positively associated with their NASH indexes. Liver histology progressively worsened over the course of the study. However, we found that with concomitant treatment with glycine, the level of endotoxin decreased, while NASH indexes significantly decreased and liver status markedly improved,. These data support the hypothesis that glycine protects against NASH in rats by decreasing the levels of intestinal endotoxin, alleviating endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623115>Intravascular heavy chain-modification of hyaluronan during endotoxic shock.</a></h2><p>During inflammation, the covalent linking of the ubiquitous extracellular polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) with the heavy chains (HC) of the serum protein inter alpha inhibitor (IαI) is exclusively mediated by the enzyme tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated-gene-6 (TSG-6). While significant advances have been made regarding how HC-modified HA (HC-HA) is an important regulator of inflammation, it remains unclear why HC-HA plays a critical role in promoting survival in intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  while exerting only a modest role in the outcomes following intratracheal exposure to LPS. To address this gap, the two models of intraperitoneal LPS-induced endotoxic shock and intratracheal LPS-induced acute lung injury were directly compared in  knockout mice and littermate controls. HC-HA formation, endogenous TSG-6 activity, and inflammatory markers were assessed in plasma and lung tissue.  knockout mice exhibited accelerated mortality during endotoxic shock. While both intraperitoneal and intratracheal LPS induced HC-HA formation in lung parenchyma, only systemically-induced  increased plasma TSG-6 levels and intravascular HC-HA formation. Cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells secreted TSG-6 in response to both TNFα and IL1β stimulation, indicating that, in addition to inflammatory cells, the endothelium may secrete TSG-6 into circulation during systemic inflammation.

In recent years, an increasing body of evidence has emerged that suggests that the intestinal microbial flora or "gut microbiota" may play a crucial role in the development of metabolic syndrome and associated disorders. Studies on animals and humans have shown that diet-induced changes in gut microbiota may be causally involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. This article reviews the available evidence from studies on animal models and humans with or without metabolic syndrome that have investigated the impact of diet on intestinal microbial composition and activity on the metabolic syndrome.

Circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gut microbiota (metabolic ), proposed as a triggering factor for the low-grade inflammation in obesity, might also be responsible for AT dysfunction. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not been explored in human obesity. To analyze the relationship between metabolic  and AT markers for lipogenesis, lipid handling, and inflammation in human obesity, 33 patients with obesity scheduled for surgery were recruited and classified according to their LPS levels. Visceral and subcutaneous AT gene and protein expression were analyzed and adipocyte and AT in vitro assays performed. Subjects with obesity with a high degree of metabolic  had lower expression of key genes for AT function and lipogenesis ( SREBP1, FABP4, FASN, and LEP) but higher expression of inflammatory genes in visceral and subcutaneous AT than subjects with low LPS levels. In vitro experiments corroborated that LPS are responsible for adipocyte and AT inflammation and downregulation of PPARG, SCD, FABP4, and LEP expression and LEP secretion. Thus, metabolic  influences AT physiology in human obesity by decreasing the expression of factors involved in AT lipid handling and function as well as by increasing inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284063>Soybean polar lipids differently impact adipose tissue inflammation and the endotoxin transporters LBP and sCD14 in flaxseed vs. palm oil-rich diets.</a></h2><p>Obesity and type 2 diabetes are nutritional pathologies, characterized by a subclinical inflammatory state. Endotoxins are now well recognized as an important factor implicated in the onset and maintain of this inflammatory state during fat digestion in high-fat diet. As a preventive strategy, lipid formulation could be optimized to limit these phenomena, notably regarding fatty  profile and PL emulsifier content. Little is known about soybean polar lipid (SPL) consumption associated to oils rich in saturated FA vs. anti-inflammatory omega-3 FA such as α-linolenic  on inflammation and metabolic . We then investigated in mice the effect of different synthetic diets enriched with two different oils, palm oil or flaxseed oil and containing or devoid of SPL on adipose tissue inflammation and endotoxin receptors. In both groups containing SPL, adipose tissue (WAT) increased compared with groups devoid of SPL and an induction of MCP-1 and LBP was observed in WAT. However, only the high-fat diet in which flaxseed oil was associated with SPL resulted in both higher WAT inflammation and higher circulating sCD14 in plasma. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LPS transporters LBP and sCD14 and adipose tissue inflammation can be modulated by SPL in high fat diets differing in oil composition. Notably high-flaxseed oil diet exerts a beneficial metabolic impact, however blunted by PL addition. Our study suggests that nutritional strategies can be envisaged by optimizing dietary lipid sources in manufactured products, including fats/oils and polar lipid emulsifiers, in order to limit the inflammatory impact of palatable foods.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EETs) are pulmonary vasoconstrictors, which are metabolized to less vasoactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic  (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). We hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition or a congenital deficiency of sEH in mice would reduce the metabolism of EETs and enhance HPV in mice after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HPV was assessed 22 h after intravenous injection of LPS by measuring the percentage increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance of the left lung induced by left mainstem bronchial occlusion (LMBO). After LPS challenge, HPV was impaired in sEH, but not in sEH mice or in sEH mice treated acutely with a sEH inhibitor. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protected mice from the LPS-induced decrease in systemic arterial oxygen concentration (Pa ) during LMBO. In the lungs of sEH mice, the LPS-induced increase in DHETs and cytokines was attenuated. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protects mice from LPS-induced impairment of HPV and improves the Pa after LMBO. After LPS challenge, lung EET degradation and cytokine expression were reduced in sEH mice.

It was found that PBP10, a synthetic rhodamine B-conjugated peptide, based on the phosphoinositide-binding site of pGSN, exerts bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, interacts specifically with LPS and LTA, and limits microbial-induced inflammatory effects. The therapeutic efficiency of PBP10 when immobilized on the surface of iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles was not evaluated, to date.Using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT stimulated by bacterially-derived LPS and LTA as an in vitro model of bacterial infection, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of nanosystems consisting of iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles with aminosilane (MNP@NH) or gold shells (MNP@Au) functionalized by a set of peptides, derived from the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding site of the human plasma protein gelsolin, which also binds LPS and LTA. Our results indicate that these nanosystems can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and limit the production of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the response to heat-killed microbes or extracted bacterial cell wall components. The nanoparticles possess the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy and are characterized by lower toxicity and improved hemocompatibility when compared to free peptides. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that these PBP10-based nanosystems prevented changes in nanomechanical properties of cells that were otherwise stimulated by LPS.Neutralization of -mediated cellular effects by gelsolin-derived peptides and PBP10-containing nanosystems might be considered as potent therapeutic agents in the improved therapy of bacterial infections and microbial-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405551> by  Injection Aggravates Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Disrupts Glucose/Lipid Metabolism, and Alters Gut Microbiota in Mice.</a></h2><p>Many risk factors related to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have been proposed, including the most well-known of diabetes and obesity as well as periodontitis.

The mice were fed a high-fat diet and administered sonicated  (HFPg) or saline (HFco) injections for 12 weeks. Liver steatosis, glucose metabolism, and gene expression in the liver were evaluated. 16S rRNA gene sequencing with metagenome prediction was performed on the gut microbiota. Compared to HFco mice, HFPg mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance along with increased liver steatosis. Liver microarray analysis demonstrated that 1278 genes were differentially expressed between HFco and HFPg mice. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that fatty  metabolism, hypoxia, and TNFα signaling via NFκB gene sets were enriched in HFPg mice. Although sonicated  did not directly reach the gut, it changed the gut microbiota and decreased bacterial diversity in HFPg mice. Metagenome prediction in the gut microbiota showed enriched citrate cycle and carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes. Overall, intravenous injection of sonicated  caused impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis in mice fed high-fat diets.

However, it is often difficult to detect the subtle effects of n-3 PUFA on inflammatory biomarkers in traditional intervention studies. We aimed to identify novel n-3 PUFA modulated gene expression using unbiased adipose transcriptomics during evoked  in a clinical trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation. We analyzed adipose gene expression using RNA sequencing in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty  modulation of  (FFAME) trial of healthy individuals at three timepoints: before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation (n=8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) for 6weeks compared with placebo (n=6), as well as during a subsequent evoked inflammatory challenge (lipopolysaccharide 0.6ng/kg i.v.). As expected, supplementation with n-3 PUFA vs. placebo alone had only modest effects on adipose tissue gene expression, e.g., increased expression of immediate early response IER2. In contrast, the transcriptomic response to evoked  was significantly modified by n-3 PUFA supplementation, with several genes demonstrating significant n-3 PUFA gene-nutrient interactions, e.g., enhanced transcriptional responses in specific immune genes IER5L, HES1, IL1RN, CCL18, IL1RN, IL7R, IL8, CCL3 and others. These data highlight potential mechanisms whereby n-3 PUFA consumption may enhance the immune response to an inflammatory challenge. In conclusion, unbiased transcriptomics during evoked inflammation reveals novel immune modulating functions of n-3 PUFA nutritional intervention in a dynamic pathophysiological setting.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Increased intestinal permeability may favour  generated by lipopolysaccharides, a substance present in the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and, consequently, an increase in systemic inflammation and metabolic diseases. In contrast (On the other hand), consumption of a healthy diet can help in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. In this way, chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.), rich in polyunsaturated fatty , may present an anti-inflammatory role. In addition, chia is rich in antioxidants like caffeic and gallic  and fiber. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between chia seeds, inflammatory mechanisms and intestinal permeability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of chia administration on metabolism in obese mice. Swiss mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet either supplemented with or without 3% chia flour for 16 weeks. The results showed that supplementation could not reduce the deleterious effects of the lipid-rich diet in terms of body composition, glucose intolerance and activity of antioxidants enzymes in the liver. In addition, supplementation with chia in the control diet decreased the amount of occludin in the intestinal colon. In conclusion, although chia did not improve metabolic parameters it seemed to restore the intestinal barriers integrity. The beneficial effects of chia seem to be dependent of the quantity used, since our data conflict with those in the literature; however, it is important to note that other studies, unlike our protocol, used chia in the form of seeds or oil, and not flour.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances in this field reveal a possible relationship between the compositional pattern of gut microbiota and genesis of obesity. Several study results have shown that short-chain fatty  (SCFAs, microbiota-induced fermentation products) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, an integral component of Gram negative microorganisms) play the key role in linking the two. Though several SCFAs are produced as microbiota-fermentation products, three of them, i.e., butyrate, propionate and acetate have been found to be definitely involved in obesity; though individually they are neither purely obesogenic nor antiobesogenic. Out of these, butyrate and propionate are predominantly antiobesogenic. Butyrate, though a major energy source for colonocytes, has been found to increase mitochondrial activity, prevent metabolic , improve insulin sensitivity, possess anti-inflammatory potential, increase intestinal barrier function and protect against diet-induced obesity without causing hypophagia. Propionate has been found to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, thereby antagonizing the cholesterol increasing action of acetate, and to inhibit the expression of resistin in adipocytes. Moreover, both these SCFAs have been found to cause weight regulation through their stimulatory effect on anorexigenic gut hormones and to increase the synthesis of leptin. Unlike butyrate and propionate, acetate, which is substantially absorbed, shows more obesogenic potential, as it acts as a substrate for hepatic and adipocyte lipogenesis. High fat diet increases the absorption of LPS, which, in turn, has been found to be associated with metabolic  and to induce inflammation resulting in obesity. Multiple independent and interrelated mechanisms have been found to be involved in such linking processes which are discussed in this review work along with some possible remedial measures for prevention of weight gain and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619275>L-Arginine and L-Citrulline Supplementation Have Different Programming Effect on Regulatory T-Cells Function of Infantile Rats.</a></h2><p>Arginine is a semiessential amino  in healthy adult human, but is essential for preterm, newborn or critically ill patients. Arginine can be supplied from our diet or  synthesis from citrulline. In conditions of sepsis or , arginine may be deficient and be accompanied with altered immune response. L-arginine supplementation can ameliorate dysregulated immune condition and improve prognosis. Many studies had tried L-arginine or L-citrulline supplementation to examine the effect on immune response in the adult population. Few had studied on the young children. In this study, we determined the effect of L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation on the immune response of infantile rats. Male infantile rats received normal saline, L-arginine (200 mg/kg/day) or L-citrulline (200 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally over postnatal day 8 to day 14. The infantile rats were then sacrificed. The blood was analyzed while the spleen was indicated for immune analysis after stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found L-arginine supplementation enhanced Th1 immune response by increasing IFN-γ production. Both the L-arginine and L-citrulline therapy can modulate regulatory T-cell (Treg) immune effects by increasing the IL-10 level. Only the L-citrulline group showed a TGF-β1 increase. Both L-arginine and L-citrulline therapy were also noted to decrease SMAD7 expression and enhance SIRT-1 abundance. However, FOXP3 expression was only modulated by L-citrulline treatment. We then concluded that L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation can modulate the regulatory T-cells function differently for infantile rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27001279>Lactobacillus sakei OK67 ameliorates high-fat diet-induced blood glucose intolerance and obesity in mice by inhibiting gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide production and inducing colon tight junction protein expression.</a></h2><p>A high-fat diet (HFD) induces obesity and the associated increases in blood glucose and inflammation through changes in gut microbiota, , and increased gut permeability. To counteract this, researchers have suggested that the use of probiotics that suppress production of proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we tested whether Lactobacillus sakei OK67, which inhibits gut microbiota LPS production selected from among the lactic  bacteria isolated from kimchi, exerted antihypoglycemic or anti-inflammatory effects in HFD-fed mice. Mice were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed an HFD or a low-fat diet for 4 weeks. These groups were further subdivided; 1 subgroup was treated with L sakei OK67 and fed the experimental diet for 4.5 weeks, whereas the other subgroup was fed the experimental diet alone. L sakei OK67 treatment lowered HFD-elevated LPS levels in blood and colonic fluid and significantly decreased HFD-elevated fasting blood glucose levels and the area under the curve in an oral glucose tolerance test. L sakei OK67 treatment inhibited HFD-induced body and epididymal fat weight gains, suppressed HFD-induced tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β expression and nuclear factor-κB activation in the colon, and significantly increased HFD-suppressed interleukin-10 and tight junction protein expression in the colon. Oral administration of L sakei OK67 significantly downregulated HFD-induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, fatty  synthase, and tumor necrosis factor-α in adipose tissue. In addition, L sakei OK67 treatment strongly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages.

Fecal dysbiosis, characterized by an overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in autochthonous non-pathogenic bacteria, becomes prominent with the progression of liver cirrhosis. In cirrhotic patients, disruption of the intestinal barrier causes intestinal hyperpermeability (i.e. leaky gut), which is closely related to gut dysmotility, dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may induce pathological bacterial translocation. Although the involved microbial taxa are somewhat different between the cirrhotic patients from the East and the West, the common manifestation of a shortage of bacteria that contribute to the production of short-chain fatty  and secondary bile  may facilitate intestinal inflammation, leaky gut and gut dysbiosis. Translocated endotoxin and bacterial DNA are capable of provoking potent inflammation and affecting the metabolic and hemodynamic systems, which may ultimately enhance the progression of liver cirrhosis and its various complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), variceal bleeding, infection and renal disturbances. Among studies on the microbiome-based therapeutics, findings of probiotic effects on HE have been contradictory in spite of several supportive results. However, the effects of synbiotics and prebiotics are substantially documented. The background of their effectiveness should be evaluated again in relation to the cirrhosis-related changes in gut microbiome and their metabolic effects. Strict indications for the antibiotic rifaximin remain unestablished, although its effect is promising, improving HE and other complications with little influence on microbial populations. The final goal of microbiome-based therapeutics is to adjust the gut-liver axis to the maximal benefit of cirrhotic patients, with the aid of evolving metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29289514>Nutrient excess and autophagic deficiency: explaining metabolic diseases in obesity.</a></h2><p>Over-nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle are the driving forces behind the development of metabolic diseases. Conversely, caloric restriction and exercise have proven to be the most effective strategies in combating metabolic diseases. Interestingly, exercise and caloric restriction share a common feature: both represent a potent mechanism for upregulating autophagy. Autophagy is rapidly induced by nutrient deprivation, and conversely, inactivated by amino  as well as growth factors (e.g. insulin). Here, we review evidence demonstrating that autophagy may indeed be attenuated in metabolic tissue such as liver, muscle, and adipose, in the context of obesity. We also highlight the mechanistic basis by which defective autophagy may contribute to the manifestation of metabolic diseases. This includes a compromised ability of the cell to perform quality control on the mitochondrial matrix, since autophagy plays a pivotal role in the degradation of defective mitochondria. Similarly, autophagy also plays an indispensable role in the clearance of protein aggregates and redundant large protein platforms such as inflammasomes. Autophagy might also play a key role in the metabolism of endotoxins, implicating the importance of autophagy in the pathogenesis of metabolic .

Adult Wistar rats were administered D‑galactose and AlCl3 to create the aluminum neurotoxicity model. The learning and memory abilities of the rats were subsequently observed using a Morris water maze test and the serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1, diamine oxidase (DAO), glutamine (Gln) and glutaminase were measured. The expression of S‑100β in the serum was detected using an enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of the amyloid β‑protein (Aβ) precursor (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), β‑site APP‑cleaving enzyme (BACE), zona occludens protein (ZO)‑1 and Aβ 1‑40 in the brain of rats were detected via reverse‑transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The levels of LPS, TNF‑α, IL‑1, DAO, Gln and S‑100β in serum and the mRNA and protein expression levels of APP, PS1, BACE and Aβ1‑40 in the brain were markedly increased in the model rats compared with controls. The level of glutaminase in the serum and the expression of ZO‑1 in the brain were decreased in the model rats compared with controls.

This study aimed to determine the effects of carbohydrate and protein intake during EHS on gastrointestinal integrity, symptoms, and systemic responses. Eleven (male, n = 6; female, n = 5) endurance runners completed 2 h of running at 60% maximal oxygen uptake in 35 °C ambient temperature on 3 occasions in randomised order, consuming water (WATER), 15 g glucose (GLUC), or energy-matched whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) before and every 20 min during EHS. Rectal temperature and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded every 10 min during EHS. Blood was collected pre- and post-EHS, and during recovery to determine plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty- binding protein (I-FABP) as a marker of intestinal epithelial injury, cortisol, endotoxin, and inflammatory cytokines. Urinary lactulose/l-rhamnose ratio was used to measure small intestine permeability. Compared with WATER, GLUC, and WPH ameliorated EHS associated intestinal epithelial injury (I-FABP: 897 ± 478 pg·mL vs. 123 ± 197 pg·mL and 82 ± 156 pg·mL, respectively, p < 0.001) and small intestine permeability (lactulose/l-rhamnose ratio: 0.034 ± 0.014 vs. 0.017 ± 0.005 and 0.008 ± 0.002, respectively, p = 0.001).  was observed post-EHS in all trials (10.2 pg·mL, p = 0.001). Post-EHS anti-endotoxin antibodies were higher (p < 0.01) and cortisol and interleukin-6 lower (p < 0.05) on GLUC than WATER only. Total and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were greater on WPH, compared with GLUC and WATER (p < 0.05), in response to EHS. In conclusion, carbohydrate and protein intake during EHS ameliorates intestinal injury and permeability. Carbohydrate also supports endotoxin clearance and reduces stress markers, while protein appears to increase gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting that carbohydrate is a more appropriate option.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709962>The role of macrophages in the development of biliary injury in a lipopolysaccharide-aggravated hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion model.</a></h2><p>Endotoxins, in the form of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are potent inducers of biliary injury. However the mechanism by which injury develops remains unclear. We hypothesized that hepatic macrophages are pivotal in the development of endotoxin-induced biliary injury and that no injury would occur in their absence.Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages from the liver. Forty-eight rats were equally divided across six study groups: sham operation (sham), liposome treatment and sham operation (liposomes+sham), 1mg/kg LPS i.p. (LPS), liposome treatment and LPS administration (liposomes+LPS), hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury with LPS administration (IRI+LPS) and liposome treatment followed by IRI+LPS (liposomes+IRI+LPS). Following 6h of reperfusion, blood, bile, and liver tissue was collected for further analysis. Small bile duct injury was assessed, serum liver tests were performed and bile composition was evaluated. The permeability of the blood-biliary barrier (BBB) was assessed using intravenously administered horseradish peroxidase (HRP).The presence of hepatic macrophages was reduced by 90% in LPS and IRI+LPS groups pre-treated with clodronate liposomes (P<0.001). Severe small bile duct injury was not affected by macrophage depletion, and persisted in the liposomes+IRI+LPS group (50% of animals) and liposomes+LPS group (75% of animals). Likewise, BBB impairment persisted following macrophage depletion. LPS-induced elevation of the chemokine Mcp-1 in bile was not affected by macrophage depletion.Depletion of hepatic macrophages did not prevent development of biliary injury following LPS or LPS-enhanced IRI. Cholangiocyte activation rather than macrophage activation may underlie this injury.

In certain diseases, including , cholestasis, diabetes, and hepatocarcinoma, Ntcp/NTCP expression is markedly reduced, which interferes with enterohepatic circulation of bile salts, impairing the absorption of lipophilic compounds. Therefore, normal Ntcp/NTCP expression in the liver is physiologically important. Berberine is an herbal medicine used historically to improve liver function and has recently been shown to repress STAT signaling. However, berberine effects on Ntcp/NTCP expression are unknown, prompting use to investigate this possible connection. Our results showed that berberine dose-dependently increased Ntcp expression in male mouse liver and decreased taurocholic  levels in serum but increased them in the liver. In mouse and human hepatoma cells, berberine induced Ntcp/NTCP mRNA and protein expression and increased cellular uptake of [3H] taurocholate. Mechanistically, berberine decreased nuclear protein levels of phospho-JAK2 and phospho-STAT5, thus disrupting the JAK2-STAT5 signaling. Moreover, berberine stimulated luciferase reporter expression from the mouse Ntcp promoter when one putative STAT5 response element (RE) (-1137 bp) was deleted and from the human NTCP promoter when three putative STAT5REs (-2898, -2164, and -691 bp) were deleted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that berberine decreased binding of phospho-STAT5 protein to the-2164 and -691 bp STAT5REs in the human NTCP promoter. In summary, berberine-disrupted STAT5 signaling promoted mouse and human Ntcp/NTCP expression, resulting in enhanced bile  uptake. Therefore, berberine may be a therapeutic candidate compound for maintaining bile  homeostasis.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118407>Effect of Physical Exercise on the Febrigenic Signaling is Modulated by Preoptic Hydrogen Sulfide Production.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that the neuromodulator hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus modulates the febrigenic signaling differently in sedentary and trained rats. Besides H2S production rate and protein expressions of H2S-related synthases cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MPST) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) in the POA, we also measured deep body temperature (Tb), circulating plasma levels of cytokines and corticosterone in an animal model of systemic inflammation. Rats run on a treadmill before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 μg/kg) or saline. The magnitude of changes of Tb during the LPS-induced fever was found to be similar between sedentary and trained rats. In sedentary rats, H2S production was not affected by LPS. Conversely, in trained rats LPS caused a sharp increase in H2S production rate that was accompanied by an increased CBS expression profile, whereas 3-MPST and CSE expressions were kept relatively constant. Sedentary rats showed a significant LPS-induced release of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) which was virtually abolished in the trained animals. Correlation between POA H2S and IL-6 as well as TNF-α was observed. Corticosterone levels were augmented after LPS injection in both groups. We found correlations between H2S and corticosterone, and corticosterone and IL-1β. These data are consistent with the notion that the responses to systemic inflammation are tightly regulated through adjustments in POA H2S production which may play an anti-inflammatory role downmodulating plasma cytokines levels and upregulating corticosterone release.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575583>The critical role played by endotoxin-induced liver autophagy in the maintenance of lipid metabolism during sepsis.</a></h2><p>Macroautophagy/autophagy is a central mechanism by which cells maintain integrity and homeostasis, and endotoxin-induced autophagy plays important roles in innate immunity. Although TLR4 stimulation mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also upregulates autophagy in hepatocytes and liver, its physiological role remains elusive. The objective of this study was to determine the role of LPS-induced autophagy in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism. LPS treatment (5 mg/kg) increased autophagy, as detected by LC3 conversion and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in C57BL6 mouse livers. AC2F hepatocytes also showed increased autophagic flux after LPS treatment (1 μg/ml). To investigate the role of LPS-induced autophagy further, liver lipid metabolism changes in LPS-treated mice and fasted controls were compared. Interestingly, LPS-treated mice showed less lipid accumulation in liver than fasted mice despite increased fatty  uptake and lipid synthesis-associated genes. In vitro analysis using AC2F hepatocytes demonstrated LPS-induced autophagy influenced the degradation of lipid droplets. Inhibition of LPS-induced autophagy using bafilomycin A or Atg7 knockdown significantly increased lipid accumulation in AC2F hepatocytes. In addition, pretreatment with chloroquine aggravated LPS-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in C57BL6 mouse livers. The physiological importance of autophagy was verified in LPS-treated young and aged rats. Autophagic response was diminished in LPS-treated aged rats and lipid metabolism was impaired during sepsis, indicating autophagy response is important for regulating lipid metabolism after endotoxin challenge. Our findings demonstrate endotoxin-induced autophagy is important for the regulation of lipid metabolism, and suggest that autophagy helps maintain lipid metabolism homeostasis during sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27446914>In vitro Modulation of the LPS-Induced Proinflammatory Profile of Hepatocytes and Macrophages- Approaches for Intervention in Obesity?</a></h2><p>Low grade  is a feature of obesity which is linked to development of steatohepatitis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Our earlier study suggested that finger millet (FM) could ameliorate high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic derangements. The present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of FM-AX supplementation, a key bioactive from finger millet, on HFD-induced metabolic and gut bacterial derangements. Male Swiss albino mice were fed with normal chow diet (NPD) or HFD (60%kcal from fat) for 10 weeks.

Glucose tolerance, serum hormones, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, white adipose tissue marker gene expression, adipocyte size and inflammation; metagenomic alterations in cecal bacteria; cecal short chain fatty  and colonic tight junction gene expressions were studied. FM-AX supplementation prevented HFD-induced weight gain, alerted glucose tolerance and serum lipid profile, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation.

Adding EPO or forskolin to celecoxib regimen significantly decreased the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. A positive correlation (r = 0.8501) was found between TF activity and TAT. Co-administration of EPO or forskolin decreased the activity of TF and mitigated the prothrombotic effect of celecoxib. Therefore, these combinations may have the utility to abrogate the prothrombotic adverse effect of celecoxib in clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29103910>Nanotherapeutics for Gene Modulation that Prevents Apoptosis in the Brain and Fatal Neuroinflammation.</a></h2><p>The failure of therapeutic agents to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been a major impediment in the treatment of neurological disorders and brain tumors. We have addressed this issue using an immunoliposome nanocomplex (designated scL) that delivers therapeutic nucleic  across the BBB into the deep brain via transcytosis mediated by transferrin receptors. We validated brain delivery of payloads after systemic administration by monitoring uptake of fluorescently labeled payloads and by confirming up- or down-modulation of specific target gene expression in the brain, mainly in neuronal cells. As proof of concept for the therapeutic potential of our delivery system, we employed scL delivering an siRNA targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha to suppress neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis and to protect mice in lethal  triggered by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Brain delivery of therapeutic payloads via scL has major implications for the development of treatments for neurological disorders and brain tumors.Copyright © 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Although there are recent reports about the benefits of statins in experimental sepsis and  in peripheral organs, little is known about their effects in the CNS. Here, we investigated the antioxidant properties of simvastatin and its possible neuroprotective role during experimental sepsis. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were submitted to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, n = 34) or remained as non-manipulated (naive, n = 34). Both groups were treated by gavage with simvastatin (20 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline. The animals submitted to CLP were treated 4 days before and 48 h after surgery. One animal group was decapitated and the blood and brain were collected to quantify plasma levels of cytokines and assess astrogliosis and apoptosis in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Another group was perfused with PBS (0.01 M), and the same brain structures were dissected to analyze oxidative damage. The CLP rats treated with simvastatin showed a reduction in nitric oxide (P < 0.05), IL1-β (P < 0.001), IL-6 (P < 0.01), and TBARS levels (P < 0.001) and an increase in catalase activity (P < 0.01), citrate synthase enzyme (P < 0.05), and normalized GSH/GSSG ratio. In addition, the histopathological analysis showed a reduction (P < 0.001) in reactive astrocytes and caspase 3-positive apoptotic cells. The results suggest a possible neuroprotective effect of simvastatin in structures responsible for spatial learning and memory and indicate the need for behavioral studies evaluating the impact on cognitive damage, as frequently seen in patients surviving sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28017682>Cross-talking between lymphocytes and platelets and its regulation by nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in physiological condition and .</a></h2><p>Cross-talk between platelets and lymphocytes may play a role in different pathological conditions like sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of lymphocytes on platelet aggregation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated and non-stimulated cells.Lymphocytes and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were obtained from rat arterial blood. Platelets (1.2×10platelets/ml) were incubated with lymphocytes (0.8×10cells/ml) in the presence or not of LPS (100μg/ml), after which ADP (5μM)-induced platelet aggregation was carried out.Lymphocytes inhibited by 51% the platelet aggregation, which was significantly prevented by the non-selective NO inhibitor l-NAME (300μM) or the selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W (100μM), as well as by the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ (10μM). The platelet inhibition by lymphocytes was accompanied by 2-fold increase of intraplatelet cGMP levels. Next, lymphocytes and platelets were co-incubated with LPS for 6h. In LPS-treated cells, lymphocytes produced a larger inhibition of platelet aggregation (62%), despite the same elevation of cGMP levels (2.2-fold increase). This inhibitory effect was prevented by l-NAME and 1400W, but rather unaffected by ODQ. The peroxynitrite (ONOO) scavenger -(-)epigallocatechin gallate (ECG, 100μM) abolished the inhibition by lymphocytes on platelet aggregation in LPS-treated cells, but not in non-treated cells.Our results show that lymphocytes act to inhibit platelet aggregation via iNOS-derived NO release and cGMP generation. In presence of LPS, ONOO production accounts for the platelet inhibition.Copyright © 2016.

Obesity itself have been associated with modifications in gut microbiota composition, and a tendency towards an overgrowth of microorganisms that obtain more efficient energy from diet. It's capacity to decompose the polysaccharides that can not be digested by the host, increase monosaccharide and short chain fatty  (SCFA) production. However, the increase in fat mass is not only due to a more efficient harvest of energy, but also the microbiota participates in changes in , bowel permeability, insulin resistance, hormonal environment, expression of genes regulating lipogenesis, interaction with bile , as well as changes in the proportion of brown adipose tissue, and effects associated with the use of drugs such as metformin.

It is known that bone marrow derived macrophages are important in resolving the inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Here, we hypothesize that treatment in combination of DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-Aza 2-deoxycytidine (Aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Trichostatin A (TSA) mitigates the inflammation induced pyroptosis and apoptosis during  induced ALI. To test this hypothesis, the mice challenged with a sublethal dose of LPS followed by one-hour post-treatment with a single dose of Aza and TSA intraperitoneally showed a substantial attenuation of apoptosis and inflammation. Importantly, we observed significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane structure, and lower levels of DNA fragmentation, reduced expression of apoptotic and pyroptotic genes both transcriptionally and translationally in LPS induced BMDMs treated by a combination of Aza and TSA than in LPS-induced BMDMs treated with either drug alone. The protection was mediated by an inhibition of JNK-ERK and STAT3-JMJD3 activated pathways. Thus, targeting these important signaling pathways with the combination of Aza and TSA would be a good treatment modality for ALI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We also examined the association between serum FFAs and LBP in the participants.In this age-matched and gender-matched case-control study, 164 abdominally obese subjects were recruited from June to November 2015 in the northwest of Iran. Demographic data, dietary intake, body composition, anthropometric indices and physical activity (PA) were assessed. Basal blood samples were collected to determine serum metabolic parameters, FFAs and LBP. Abdominal obesity was defined as having waist circumference ≥95 cm. Those with three or more metabolic alterations were defined as MUAO and those having two or less were classified as MHAO. Data were analysed using SPSS V.17.0.There were no significant differences in dietary intake, anthropometric indices, body composition and PA between the two groups. The odds of MUAO significantly increased by increments in serum fasting blood sugar (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.25 to 6.40), triglycerides (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04) and diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06) and decreased by increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52). The levels of LBP and FFAs showed no significant differences between the two groups. However, significant correlations were found between LBP and FFAs in pooled population (r=0.712; p<0.001) as well as in cases (r=0.717; p<0.001) and controls (r=0.704; p<0.001). Neither FFAs nor LBP were significantly correlated with dietary intake or metabolic parameters (p>0.05).The results indicated that serum LBP and FFAs are highly correlated both in MHAO and MUAO states. In addition, the levels of LBP and FFAs seem to be more related to abdominal obesity than to the presence or absence of metabolic health.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Camu camu () is an Amazonian fruit with a unique phytochemical profile, strong antioxidant potential and purported anti-inflammatory potential.By using metabolic tests coupled with 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiling and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT), we have assessed the effect of a crude extract of camu camu (CC) on obesity and associated immunometabolic disorders in high fat/high sucrose (HFHS)-fed mice.Treatment of HFHS-fed mice with CC prevented weight gain, lowered fat accumulation and blunted metabolic inflammation and . CC-treated mice displayed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and were also fully protected against hepatic steatosis. These effects were linked to increased energy expenditure and upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 mRNA expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of CC-treated mice, which strongly correlated with the mRNA expression of the membrane bile  (BA) receptor TGR5. Moreover, CC-treated mice showed altered plasma BA pool size and composition and drastic changes in the GM (eg, bloom of  and a strong reduction of ). Germ-free (GF) mice reconstituted with the GM of CC-treated mice gained less weight and displayed higher energy expenditure than GF-mice colonised with the FM of HFHS controls.Our results show that CC prevents visceral and liver fat deposition through BAT activation and increased energy expenditure, a mechanism that is dependent on the GM and linked to major changes in the BA pool size and composition.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

At later stages in some patients, immunoparalysis may be encountered, which is associated with a poor outcome. By transcriptional and metabolic profiling of human patients with sepsis, we found that a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis was an important component of initial activation of host defense. Blocking metabolic pathways with metformin diminished cytokine production and increased mortality in systemic fungal infection in mice. In contrast, in leukocytes rendered tolerant by exposure to lipopolysaccharide or after isolation from patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis, a generalized metabolic defect at the level of both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism was apparent, which was restored after recovery of the patients. Finally, the immunometabolic defects in humans were partially restored by therapy with recombinant interferon-γ, which suggested that metabolic processes might represent a therapeutic target in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989851>Saturated fatty  combined with lipopolysaccharide stimulates a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is a risk factor for NAFLD. The HFD not only increases intake of saturated fatty  (SFA) but also induces metabolic , an HFD-associated increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although it is known that SFA or LPS promote hepatic inflammation, a hallmark of NAFLD, it remains unclear how SFA in combination with LPS stimulates host inflammatory response in hepatocytes. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effect of SFA in combination with LPS on proinflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes. Our animal study showed that feeding low-density lipoprotein-deficient mice HFD enriched with SFA and injection of low-dose LPS cooperatively stimulated IL-6 expression in livers. To understand how SFA and LPS interact to promote IL-6 expression, our in vitro studies showed that palmitic  (PA), a major SFA, and LPS exerted synergistic effect on the expression of IL-6 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS. Finally, we observed that LPS and PA increased ceramide production by cooperatively stimulating ceramide de novo synthesis, which played an essential role in the synergistic stimulation of proinflammatory gene expression by LPS and PA. Taken together, this study showed that SFA in combination with LPS stimulated a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565753>Acute glutamine supplementation does not improve 20-km self-paced cycling performance in the heat.</a></h2><p>The premise of this study was to investigate the effect of acute glutamine supplementation on 20 km time trial cycling performance in the heat, neuromuscular function, inflammation and .Twelve cyclists completed two, 20-km time trials (20TT) in 35 °C (50% relative humidity). Participants ingested either glutamine (GLUT; 0.9 g kg fat-free mass) or a placebo (CON) 60 min before each 20TT. Physiological and perceptual measures were recorded during each 20TT, and neuromuscular function assessed pre- and post-exercise. Venous blood was analysed for endotoxins, markers of gut damage (inflammatory fatty  binding protein; I-FABP) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6; tumour necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-α). Data were analysed using linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework.20TT in the heat increased I-FABP and elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) compared to pre-exercise values but did not result in . Completion time was not statistically different between conditions (mean difference [95% credible interval] = 11 s [- 23, 44]). Relative to CON, GLUT did not alter any physiological or perceptual measures during the 20TT.Glutamine supplementation does not improve 20TT performance in the heat or preserve neuromuscular function when compared to a placebo.

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Previous studies using 2D-gel electrophoresis found that defensin-related cryptdin-2 (Cry-2), an intestinal α-defensin, is upregulated in intestinal tissues during heatstroke in mice, and that treatment with ulinastatin, a multivalent enzyme inhibitor, reduced heat-induced acute lung injury. To investigate the association between Cry-2 and heat stress (HS)-induced intestinal injury and the probable protective role of ulinastatin, the present study examined the intestinal expression of Cry-2 via histopathologic analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in mice with heatstroke. The heat-stressed mice were exposed to different core temperatures and cooling treatments, and intestinal pathological changes and Chiu scores were determined. Chemical markers of intestinal injury, serum and intestinal concentrations of diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactic  (D-Lac), and serum and intestinal concentrations of Cry-2 were also determined. Correlations were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. It was found that HS upregulated the expression of Cry-2, and the serum and intestinal concentrations of Cry-2 were correlated with the severity of HS-induced intestinal damage, indicated by pathology scores and concentrations of DAO and D-lac. Ulinastatin protected the intestines from HS-induced injury and downregulated the expression of Cry-2, which was also correlated with the extent of intestinal injury. Therefore, ulinastatin administration may be beneficial for patients with heatstroke, and Cry-2 may be a novel predictor of HS-induced intestinal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948767>Investigation of the adsorption capacity of the enterosorbent Enterosgel for a range of bacterial toxins, bile  and pharmaceutical drugs.</a></h2><p>Oral intestinal adsorbents (enterosorbents) are orally administered materials which pass through the gut where they bind (adsorb) various substances. The enterosorbent Enterosgel (Polymethylsiloxane polyhdrate) is recommended as a symptomatic treatment for acute diarrhoea and chronic diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Since 1980's there have been many Enterosgel clinical trials, however, the detailed mechanism of Enterosgel action towards specific toxins and interaction with concomitantly administered medications has not been fully investigated. Our in vitro study assessed the adsorption capacity of Enterosgel for bacterial enterotoxins and endotoxin, bile  and interaction with the pharmaceutical drugs; Cetirizine and Amitriptyline hydrochloride. Our data demonstrate the good adsorption capacity of Enterosgel for bacterial toxins associated with gastrointestinal infection, with a lower than the comparator charcoal Charcodote capacity for bile  whose levels can be raised in IBS patients. Adsorption capacity for the two drugs varied but was significantly lower than Charcodote. These findings suggest that the mechanism of Enterosgel action in the treatment of gastrointestinal infection or IBS is adsorption of target molecules followed by removal from the body.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in heart, brain and kidney mitochondrial function in an experimental model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced .Samples were collected 4 and 24 h after single injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) in mice. Marked increases in inflammation-related gene expression were observed in all studied tissues 4 h after LPS administration. At 24 h post LPS administration, this expression of inflammation-related genes remained upregulated only in kidneys. Significantly increased concentrations of kidney function markers confirmed that kidneys were severely damaged. Echocardiographic measurements showed that the ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly reduced 4 h after LPS administration, whereas 24 h after LPS administration, the cardiac function was restored to baseline. A two-fold decrease in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity in the kidney was observed 4 and 24 h after LPS administration. Significant decrease in mitochondrial fatty  oxidation was observed in heart 4 h after LPS administration. Furthermore, 24 h after LPS administration, the respiration rates in cardiac fibres at OXPHOS and electron transport (ET) states were significantly increased, which resulted in increased ET coupling efficiency in the LPS-treated group, whereas four-fold increases in the H2O2 production rate and H2O2/O ratio were observed.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulation of expression of genes related to the inflammatory response. Also, diet can indirectly induce post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, which may affect the risk for the development of chronic diseases.This study investigated the effect of high-fat high-saturated meal ingestion on plasma miRNA expression and LPS levels during the postprandial period in healthy women.An interventional study was carried out in which a high-fat breakfast (1067.45 kcal), composed mainly of saturated fatty  (56 g), and 500 mL of water, was offered. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 1, 3 and 5 h after meal intake. The studied population consisted of healthy women (n = 11), aged between 20 and 40 years, and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m. Plasma levels of lipid profile, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and LPS were measured at the 3 time points. A profile of 752 human plasma miRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR assay. These analyzes were performed for all blood collection time-points.Expression profile analysis revealed 33 differentially expressed plasma circulating miRNAs compared to that of the control group. MiR-145-5p and miR-200 were differentially modulated in all time-points post meal consumption. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma LPS, triglycerides, myristic and palmitic saturated fatty  levels at the 3 time-points in comparison with the control basal levels. We also observed increased levels of the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokine and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels after 5 h post meal ingestion.Ingestion of high-fat high-saturated meal was able to induce metabolic  and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF-alpha and VCAM-1, as well as modulating circulating miRNAs possibly controlling inflammatory and lipid metabolism proteins at the postprandial period.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In this context, fructose feeding promotes endotoxin translocation from the gut, contributing to disease progression via an inflammatory process. Citrulline is protective against fructose-induced NAFLD; we hypothesised that this property might be related to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative action against endotoxin-induced hepatic injuries. This hypothesis was evaluated in a model of perfused liver isolated from NAFLD rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n 30) were fed either a standard rodent chow or a 60 % fructose diet alone, or supplemented with citrulline (1 g/kg per d) for 4 weeks. After an evaluation of their metabolic status, fasted rats received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2·5 mg/kg). After 1 h, the livers were isolated and perfused for 1 h to study liver function and metabolism, inflammation and oxidative status. In vivo, citrulline significantly decreased dyslipidaemia induced by a high-fructose diet and insulin resistance. In the isolated perfused rat livers,  resulted in higher cytolysis (alanine aminotransferase release) and higher inflammation (Toll-like receptor 4) in livers of fructose-fed rats, and it was prevented by citrulline supplementation. Oxidative stress and antioxidative defences were similar in all three groups. Amino  exchanges and metabolism (ammonia and urea release) were only slightly different between the three groups. In this context of mild steatosis, our results suggest that fructose-induced NAFLD leads to an increased hepatic sensitivity to LPS-induced inflammation.

Historically thought to result from overnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle, recent evidence suggests that diets high in sugar (from sucrose and/or high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]) not only increase the risk of NAFLD, but also non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we review the experimental and clinical evidence that fructose precipitates fat accumulation in the liver, due to both increased lipogenesis and impaired fat oxidation. Recent evidence suggests that the predisposition to fatty liver is linked to the metabolism of fructose by fructokinase C, which results in ATP consumption, nucleotide turnover and uric  generation that mediate fat accumulation. Alterations to gut permeability, the microbiome, and associated  contribute to the risk of NAFLD and NASH. Early clinical studies suggest that reducing sugary beverages and total fructose intake, especially from added sugars, may have a significant benefit on reducing hepatic fat accumulation. We suggest larger, more definitive trials to determine if lowering sugar/HFCS intake, and/or blocking uric  generation, may help reduce NAFLD and its downstream complications of cirrhosis and chronic liver disease.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were randomized to receive a standard diet ad libitum (CON, n = 9) or to undergo catabolic injuries on day 0 (D0, n = 49), and EN (Sondalis HP energy® 290 kcal/kg/d) from day 1 (D1) combined with Cit (2 g/kg/d) or isonitrogenous non-essential AAs (NEAAs) until day 3 (D3).  was induced by IP injection of LPS from E. coli (3 mg/kg), TBI by hydraulic percussion, and infectious complications (TBI-Ec) by administration of luminescent E. coli on D1. Nitrogen balance (ΔN) and 3-methylhistidine (3-MHis) were measured daily. Muscle protein synthesis (MPS, measured by the SUnSET method) and mTORC1 activation (S6K-1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation) were measured on D3 2 h after the arrest of enteral nutrition in soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles. ΔN was lower (p < 0.001) in all three models of injury compared with basal and CON from D1 to D3, and more negative in the LPS-CIT (p < 0.05) than in the LPS group. The 3-MHis/creatinine ratio was significantly increased on D1 in all groups compared with CON, and on D2 only in the LPS and TBI groups (p < 0.0001, LPS and TBI vs. CON). MPS was similar in all groups in soleus and tibialis but significantly higher in EDL in LPS-CIT [LPS-CIT: 4.5 ± 1.7 (mean ± SD) vs. CON: 2.3 ± 1.2; and vs. LPS-NEAA: 3.1 ± 2.3] and in gastrocnemius (LPS-CIT vs. CON; p = 0.05). S6K-1 phosphorylation in the EDL was also higher in LPS-CIT vs. CON (LPS-CIT: 0.94 ± 0.51 CON: 0.42 ± 0.28), but not in gastrocnemius. IL-6 plasma level was significantly higher in all the catabolic groups vs. CON (p < 0.005) with no difference between treatments (Cit or NEAAs). In conclusion, the TBI model showed only a rise in muscle proteolysis, whereas the LPS model displayed a rise in both protein synthesis and proteolysis. Secondly, our results show that the Cit effect varies according to the type of injury and to the muscle under study. The stimulation of MPS rate and the mTOR pathway in LPS-treated rats contrasts with degraded ΔN, suggesting that the Cit effect on protein metabolism in critically ill rats is limited at the whole-body level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Most complications are mediated through a dysfunctional gut-liver axis. New techniques have made culture-independent analysis of the gut microbiome widespread. With insight into an unfavorable microbiome (dysbiosis) and how it affects liver disease, investigators have discovered new targets to potentially improve outcomes. Dysbiosis is associated with  and propagates liver injury due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and alcohol. The composition and functionality of the microbiome changes with the development of cirrhosis, decompensation, and with treatments for these conditions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We used 18 adult male Wistar rats in this study. Twelve rats given LPS for  were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=6). Group I was treated with 1 mL/kg 0.9% NaCl i.p. and Group II was treated with 40 mg/kg agomelatine. Six normal rats served as the control group and were not given LPS for . Cylindrical steel cages containing vertical and horizontal metal bars with top cover were used. Rats were put in these cages for the purpose of orientation for 10 min. Apomorphine was given to rats removed from cages, and then they were immediately put back in the cages for the purpose of observing stereotyped conduct. Brain HVA levels and plasma TNF-a levels were evaluated in tissue homogenates using ELISA. The proportion of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured in samples taken from plasma for detection of lipid peroxidation similar to thiobarbituric  reactive substances. RESULTS LPS induced-plasma TNF-α, brain TNF-α, and plasma MDA levels were significantly lower in the LPS+agomelatine group compared to the LPS+saline group (p<0.05). HVA levels and stereotype scores were significantly lower in the LPS+agomelatine group compared to the LPS+saline group (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS Agomelatine reduced TNF-α, HVA, MDA levels, and the stereotype score in relevant models of psychosis. Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of agomelatine involved oxidant cleansing properties and that its effects on the metabolism of dopamine can play an important role in the model of psychosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291665>Protease-Activated Receptors 1 and 3 are Differentially Expressed on Human Monocyte Subsets and are Upregulated by Lipopolysaccharide Ex Vivo and In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Monocytes are activated in inflammatory conditions via a variety of cytokine receptors as well as in a procoagulatory setting through thrombin, acting upon protease-activated receptors (PARs). This study investigated the expression pattern of PAR1 and PAR3 on human monocyte subsets. Furthermore, a possible regulation of the expression of PAR1 and PAR3 in these cells by inflammatory activation were studied. CD16 monocytes showed significantly higher levels of PAR1 and PAR3 as compared with CD16 monocytes. Ex vivo treatment of whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased PAR1 and PAR3 messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) in human monocytes. In addition, increase of PAR1 was seen in all three subsets upon LPS treatment, whereas PAR3 increased significantly only in CD16 monocytes and nonclassical CD16 monocytes. Protein levels of PAR1 and PAR3 significantly increased on monocytes in vivo in human  1 hour after LPS infusion. PAR1 increased significantly in CD16 monocytes and nonclassical CD16 monocytes. In this in vivo model, PAR3 was also significantly elevated in CD16 monocytes and increased slightly albeit not significantly in CD16 monocytes.  increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue factor (TF) expression in monocytes in humans.

The DNA of these bacteria dwarfs the human genome. Diet and ethanol can cause rapid shifts in the number and types of bacteria in the gut. The psoriatic microbiome is similar to that seen in alcoholics; there is a decrease in bacterial diversity and overgrowth of bacteria in the small bowel. Psoriatics often have liver disease and deficiencies in bile . Psoriasis is a disease characterized by a leaky gut. All of the comorbidities of this disease are due to systemic . Bacterial peptidoglycans absorbed from the gut have direct toxic effects on the liver and skin. Their absorption, as well as endotoxin absorption, must be eliminated to treat psoriasis successfully. Endotoxin absorption is markedly increased by ethanol and peppers. Bioflavonoids, such as quercetin and citrus bioflavonoids, prevent this absorption. Bile , given orally, break up endotoxin in the intestinal lumen.

These organisms are likely to originate from the gut, however, how and why they breach the intestinal interface in the context of malaria infection remains unclear. One explanation is that accumulation of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) in the intestinal microvasculature contributes to tissue damage and subsequent microbial translocation which can be addressed through investigation of the impact of cytoadhesion in patients with malaria and intestinal damage.Using a static adhesion assay, cytoadhesion of iRBCs was quantified in 48 children with malaria to recombinant proteins constitutively expressed on endothelial cell surfaces. Cytoadhesive phenotypes between children with and without biochemical evidence of intestinal damage [defined as  or elevated plasma intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP)] was compared.The majority of parasites demonstrated binding to the endothelial receptors CD36 and to a lesser extent to ICAM-1. Reduced adhesion to CD36 but not adhesion to ICAM-1 or rosetting was associated with malarial anaemia (p = 0.004). Increased adhesion of iRBCs to ICAM-1 in children who had evidence of elevated I-FABP (p = 0.022), a marker of intestinal ischaemia was observed. There was no correlation between the presence of  and increased adhesion to any of the recombinant proteins.Increased parasite adhesion to ICAM-1 in children with evidence of intestinal ischaemia lends further evidence to a link between the cytoadherence of iRBCs in gut microvasculature and intestinal damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28180063>Carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT) expression in macrophages is dispensable for nutrient stress sensing and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Fatty  oxidation in macrophages is thought to regulate inflammatory status and insulin-sensitivity.

Methods and Results The prevalence of MetS was evaluated in 1065 subjects of Mexico City, Mexico, and the gut microbiota in a subsample. Subjects with MetS were selected for a pragmatic study based on a lifestyle intervention with a low-saturated-fat diet, reduced-energy intake, with functional foods and physical activity, and a second group was selected for a randomized control-placebo study to assess the gut microbiota after the dietary intervention. Prevalence of MetS was 53%, and the higher the body mass index, the higher the gut microbiota dysbiosis. The higher the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The pragmatic study revealed that after 15 days on a low-saturated-fat diet, there was a 24% reduction in serum triglycerides; and after a 75-day lifestyle intervention, MetS was reduced by 44.8%, with a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small low-density lipoprotein particles, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide, and branched-chain amino . The randomized control-placebo study showed that after the lifestyle intervention, there was a decrease in the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota associated with a reduction in the Prevotella/ Bacteroides ratio and an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.

P-113 is a clinically active histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide. Nal-P-113, a β-naphthylalanine-substituted P-113, is salt-resistant but has limited LPS neutralizing activity. We suspected the size and shape of the non-natural bulky amino  may affect its LPS neutralizing activity.

In vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities were further confirmed by LPS-induced inflammation inhibition in an  mouse model.Bip-P-113 and Dip-P-113 had the longest and widest non-nature amino , respectively. Bip-P-113 enhanced salt resistance, serum proteolytic stability, peptide-induced permeabilization, zeta potential measurements, LPS aggregation, and in vitro and in vivo LPS neutralizing activities.

In many ways, the phenotype of sepsis survivors resembles the phenotype associated with accelerated aging. Since telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging, we investigated whether sepsis also leads to telomere shortening. Male balb/c mice were divided into two groups: the control group received 100 μl of normal saline intraperitoneally; the sepsis group received 15 mg/kg of bacterial lipopolysaccharide i.p. After 48 hours, animals were sacrificed to collect blood, spleen and kidney. The human component of our study utilized blood samples obtained from patients in the Trauma Department and samples collected 7 days later in those patients who developed sepsis. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR. Since oxidative stress is a known inducer of telomere shortening, thiobarbituric  reactive substances and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were analyzed in order to evaluate oxidative stress burden. Induction of  in mice resulted in significant telomere shortening in spleen and kidney.

The lungs were analysed by histology, NO production in the mouse lungs determined by modified Griess (Sigma-Aldrich) reaction, cytokine levels utilizing commercialkits, and protein abundance by Western blotting.GYY4137, a slowly-releasing H2S donor, improved the histopathological changes in the lungs of endotoxemic mice. Treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, increased anti-oxidant biomarkers such as thetotal antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and theactivities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) but decreased a marker of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) action and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in endotoxemic lung. L-NAME administration also suppressed inflammation in endotoxemic lung, as evidenced by the decreased pulmonary levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the increased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. GYY4137 treatment reversed endotoxin-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogenperoxide (H2O2) and 3-NT and an increase in the antioxidant biomarker ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione(GSH/GSSG ratio) and T-AOC, CAT and SOD activity. GYY4137 also attenuated endotoxin-induced lung inflammation. Moreover, treatment with GYY4137 inhibited inducible NOS (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in the  lung.GYY4137 conferred protection against acute -associated lung injury, which may have beendue to the anti-oxidant, anti-nitrative and anti-inflammatory properties of GYY4137.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration is the most often used approach to model the consequences of bacterial sepsis. We created an  rat model, simulating sepsis-related lung injury, in order to quantify the time and dose dependent severity lesions induced by the administration of lipopolysaccharide. Our study included 42 male Wistar rats, randomly divided into four groups: one control group (n=6) and three experimental groups (n=12/group) in whom we induced sepsis by intraperitoneal injection of progressively increasing doses of LPS (3, 5, 10 mg/kg). At six hours, the animals included in the groups with higher doses of LPS developed thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and liver and renal injury in a dose and time dependent manner. The severity of hypoxemia at six hours correlated with the increasing doses of LPS, with a slight improvement at 24 hours. Lung injury scores became more severe with increased dose and time of exposure to LPS without reaching the level of hyaline membranes formation. We also demonstrated translocation of a protein from the airspaces into plasma (RAGE - receptor for advanced glycation end products). Induction of sepsis using LPS is a known experimental model, but LPS treatment in rats does not cause the severe endothelial and epithelial injury that occurs in humans with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (LC n-3 PUFA) may have systemic and adipose tissue-specific anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective action. Interactions between calgranulins and the unsaturated fatty  arachidonic  (AA) have been reported, yet little is known about the relationship between calgranulins and the LC n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). We explored tissue-specific action of calgranulins in the setting of evoked  and n-3 PUFA supplementation. Expression of calgranulins in adipose tissue in vivo was assessed by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation and evoked  in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty  modulation of  (FFAME) Study. Subjects received n-3 PUFA (n = 8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) or matched placebo (n = 6) for 6-8 weeks, before completing an endotoxin challenge (LPS 0.6 ng/kg). Calgranulin genes were up-regulated post-LPS, with greater increase in n-3 PUFA (S100A8 15-fold, p = 0.003; S100A9 7-fold, p = 0.003; S100A12 28-fold, p = 0.01) compared to placebo (S100A8 2-fold, p = 0.01; S100A9 1.4-fold, p = 0.4; S100A12 5-fold, p = 0.06). In an independent evoked  study, calgranulin gene expression correlated with the systemic inflammatory response. Through in vivo and in vitro interrogation we highlight differential responses in adipocytes and mononuclear cells during inflammation, with n-3 PUFA leading to increased calgranulin expression in adipose, but decreased expression in circulating cells.

The role of dysbacteriosis in obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic syndrome].</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota is well-known for a long time, but due to newly recognized functions, clinician's attention has turned to it again in the last decade. About 100 000 billion bacteria are present in the human intestines. The composition of bacteriota living in diverse parts of the intestinal tract is variable according to age, body weight, geological site, and diet as well. Normal bacteriota defend the organism against the penetration of harmful microorganisms, and has many other functions in the gut wall integrity, innate immunity, insulin sensitivity, metabolism, and it is in cross-talk with the brain functions as well. It's a recent recognition, that intestinal microbiota has a direct effect on the brain, and the brain also influences the microbiota. This two-way gut-brain axis consists of microbiota, immune and neuroendocrine system, as well as of the autonomic and central nervous system. Emerging from fermentation of carbohydrates, short-chain fatty  develop into the intestines, which produce butyrates, acetates and propionates, having favorable effects on different metabolic processes. Composition of the intestinal microbiota is affected by the circadian rhythm, such as in shift workers. Dysruption of circadian rhythm may influence intestinal microbiota. The imbalance between the microbiota and host organism leads to dysbacteriosis. From the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysacharides penetrate into the blood stream, via impaired permeability of the intestinal mucosa. These processes induce metabolic , inflammation, impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, obesity, and contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, inflammarory bowel diseases, autoimmunity and carcinogenesis. Encouraging therapeutic possibility is to restore the normal microbiota either using pro- or prebiotics, fecal transplantation or bariatric surgery. Human investigations seem to prove that fecal transplant from lean healthy individuals into obese diabetic patients improved all the pathological parameters. Wide spread use of bariatric surgery altered gut microbiota and improved metabolic parameters apart from surgery itself. Pathomechanism is not yet completely clarified. Clinicians hope, that deeper understanding of complex functions of intestinal microbiota will contribute to develop more effective therapeutic proceedings against diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536293>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonism attenuates -induced muscle protein loss and lactate accumulation in rats.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) appears to provide protection against organ dysfunction during . We examined the potential benefits of Rosi on skeletal muscle protein maintenance and carbohydrate metabolism during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced . Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow (control) or standard chow containing Rosi (8.5 ± 0.1 mg·kg·day) for 2 weeks before and during 24 h continuous intravenous infusion of LPS (15 μg·kg·h) or saline. Rosi blunted LPS-induced increases in muscle tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA by 70% (<0.05) and 64% (<0.01) respectively. Furthermore, Rosi suppressed the LPS-induced reduction in phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated Forkhead box O (FOXO) 1 protein, as well as the up-regulation of muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1; <0.01) mRNA and the LPS-induced increase in 20S proteasome activity (<0.05).

The renal damage was estimated by periodic  Schiff's staining; renal injury was evaluated by detection of urinary and plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and albumin/creatinine ratio via ELISAs. Renal mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR, whereas the protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting.LPS administration increased tubular injury, microalbuminuria, IL-6 plasma levels and renal TNF-α expression in MORG1  mice. This was accompanied with enhanced infiltration of the inflammatory T-cells in renal tissue and activation of the NF-κB transcription factors. In contrast, endotoxemic MORG1  showed significantly less tubular injury, reduced plasma IL-6 levels, significantly decreased renal TNF-α expression and T-cells infiltration. In support, the renal levels of activated caspase-3 were lower in endotoxemic MORG1  mice compared with endotoxemic MORG1  mice. Interestingly, LPS application induced a significantly higher accumulation of renal HIF-2α in the kidneys of MORG1 mice than in wild-type mice, accompanied with a diminished phosphorylation of IκB-α and IKK α,β and decreased iNOS mRNA in the renal tissues of the LPS-challenged MORG1 mice, indicating an inhibition of the NF-κB transcriptional activation.MORG1 heterozygosity protects against histological renal damage and shows anti-inflammatory effects in a murine  model through modulation of HIF-2α stabilisation and/or simultaneous inhibition of the NF-κB signalling.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate the expression of genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) involved in: (i) adipogenesis (lipoprotein lipase [Lpl], fatty  binding protein-4 [Ap2] and adiponectin [Adipoq]); (ii) insulin signaling (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [Pparg], suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 [Socs3], solute carrier family 2 [facilitated glucose transporter], member 4 [Slc2a4]); and (iii) inflammation (tumor necrosis factor [Tnf], interleukin-6 [Il6], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [Ccl2], cyclo-oxygenase-2 [prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; Ptgs2]).Experimental  downregulated mRNA expression of Pparg, Slc2a4, Adipoq, Lpl, and Ap2, which coincided with upregulation of Il6, Tnf, Ccl2, Ptgs2, and Socs3 expression. Pioglitazone dose-dependently decreased Tnf, Il6, Ccl2, Ptgs2, and Socs3 expression in WAT, in association with upregulation of Lpl, Ap2, Slc2a4, and Adipoq expression, indicating improvement in endotoxin-induced IR.The findings suggest that LPS challenge exacerbates IR in db/db mice by altering the expression of genes in WAT involved in adipogenesis and inflammation, which is effectively controlled by pioglitazone treatment.© 2016 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567900>Fh15 Blocks the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Cytokine Storm While Modulating Peritoneal Macrophage Migration and CD38 Expression within Spleen Macrophages in a Mouse Model of Septic Shock.</a></h2><p>Sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacteria is the consequence of an unrestrained infection that continuously releases lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the bloodstream, which triggers an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response leading to multiorgan failure and death. After scrutinizing the immune modulation exerted by a recombinant  fatty  binding protein termed Fh15, our group demonstrated that addition of Fh15 to murine macrophages 1 h prior to LPS stimulation significantly suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL1-β). The present study aimed to demonstrate that Fh15 could exert a similar anti-inflammatory effect  using a mouse model of septic shock. Among the novel findings reported in this article, (i) Fh15 suppressed numerous serum proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines when injected intraperitoneally 1 h after exposure of animals to lethal doses of LPS, (ii) concurrently, Fh15 increased the population of large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) in the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of LPS-injected animals, and (iii) Fh15 downregulated the expression on spleen macrophages of CD38, a cell surface ectoenzyme with a critical role during inflammation. These findings present the first evidence that the recombinant parasitic antigen Fh15 is an excellent modulator of the PerC cell content and  macrophage activation, endorsing Fh15's potential as a drug candidate against sepsis-related inflammatory response. Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. Sepsis is mostly the consequence of systemic bacterial infections leading to exacerbated activation of immune cells by bacterial products, resulting in enhanced release of inflammatory mediators. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis, which is sensed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The scientific community highly pursues the development of antagonists capable of blocking the cytokine storm by blocking TLR4. We report here that a recombinant molecule of 14.5 kDa belonging to the  fatty  binding protein (Fh15) is capable of significantly suppressing the LPS-induced cytokine storm in a mouse model of septic shock when administered by the intraperitoneal route 1 h after a lethal LPS injection.

Twenty obese children/adolescents (9-17 years old, 11 boys) underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test and, 7-14 days later, a 5-h fat meal test (fat=69% of energy, saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty =31.5%/35%/33.5%), with serial measures of IL-6 and two markers of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and translocation, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14). IL-6 correlated not only with basal (homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) but also with post-prandial (Matsuda index) insulin sensitivity (r=0.61 (0.24-0.82), P=0.005, r=-0.53 (0.12-0.78), P=0.03, respectively). IL-6 did not change after the meal whereas LBP and sCD14 decreased significantly, indicating LPS translocation. Neither basal sCD14 and LBP nor their incremental concentrations correlated with IL-6 or glucose homeostasis. In our sample, IL-6 was associated with insulin sensitivity but not with LPS exposure, suggesting that meals with a balanced content of saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty  may not be associated with LPS-induced inflammation and metabolic impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129737> is modulated by quantity and quality of dietary fat in older adults.</a></h2><p>Aging is an important determinant of the rate of atherosclerosis development, mainly through low-grade inflammation. Diet, and particularly its fat content, modulates the inflammatory response in fasting and postprandial states.We aimed to study the effects of dietary fat on  in healthy older adults.Twenty healthy older adults were randomized to three diets, lasting three-weeks each, using a crossover design: 1. A Mediterranean diet enriched in MUFA with virgin olive oil. 2. An SFA-rich diet. 3. A low-fat high-carbohydrate diet enriched in n-3 PUFA (α-linolenic  of plant origin) (CHO-PUFA diet). At the end of each period, after a 12-h fast, the subjects received a meal with a composition similar to the dietary period just completed. We determined the fasting and the postprandial plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP).In the fasting state, we observed lower LPS plasma levels after the consumption of the CHO-PUFA diet (P=0.046) in comparison with the consumption of the Med and SFA-rich diets. In the postprandial measurements, we observed a statistically significant increase in plasma levels of LPS (P=0.044) and a decrease in LBP (P=0.003) after the intake of the CHO-PUFA meal, whereas no postprandial changes were observed after the ingestion of the Med and SFA-rich meals.Our results, together with those obtained in a previous study, support the concept that the consumption of the Med Diet, in contrast to a low-fat PUFA diet, constitutes a more suitable dietary lifestyle for preventing the development of atherosclerosis in a population at risk, such as older adults.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive lipid which in vivo administration was reported to mitigate inflammation and injuries caused by bacterial  in the liver and lung. The objective of the present study was to determine whether LPA can protect against sepsis-associated AKI. C57BL/6 mice were treated with LPA 18:1 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before being injected with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and AKI was evaluated after 24 h. LPA significantly decreased the elevation of plasma urea and creatinine caused by LPS. In the kidney, LPA pretreatment significantly reduced the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)), and completely prevented downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 caused by LPS. LPA also prevented LPS-mediated alterations of the renal mitochondrial ultrastructure. In vitro pretreatment with LPA 18:1 significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and MCP-1) in RAW264 macrophages. Moreover, in vivo LPS treatment lowered urinary LPA concentration and reduced LPA anabolic enzymes (autotaxin and acylglycerol kinase), and increased the LPA catalytic enzyme (lipid phosphate phosphatase 2) expression in the kidney cortex. In conclusion, exogenous LPA exerted a protective action against renal inflammation and injuries caused by bacterial . Moreover, LPS reduces the renal production of LPA suggesting that sepsis-associated AKI could be mediated, at least in part, by alleviation of the protective action of endogenous LPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128398>A sense oligonucleotide to inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA increases the survival rate of rats in septic shock.</a></h2><p>Natural antisense transcripts (asRNAs) that do not encode proteins are transcribed from rat, mouse, and human genes, encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which catalyzes the production of the inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO). In septic shock, NO is excessively produced in hepatocytes and macrophages. The iNOS asRNA interacts with and stabilizes iNOS mRNA. We found that single-stranded 'sense' oligonucleotides corresponding to the iNOS mRNA sequence reduced iNOS mRNA levels by interfering with the mRNA-asRNA interactions in rat hepatocytes. The iNOS sense oligonucleotides that were substituted with phosphorothioate bonds and locked nucleic  efficiently decreased the levels of iNOS mRNA and iNOS protein. In this study, the gene expression patterns in the livers of two  model rats with acute liver failure were compared. Next, we optimized the sequence and modification of the iNOS sense oligonucleotides in interleukin 1β-treated rat hepatocytes. When a sense oligonucleotide was simultaneously administered with d-galactosamine and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rats, their survival rate significantly increased compared to the rats administered d-galactosamine and LPS alone. In the livers of the sense oligonucleotide-administered rats, apoptosis in the hepatocytes markedly decreased. These results suggest that natural antisense transcript-targeted regulation technology using iNOS sense oligonucleotides may be used to treat human inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis and septic shock.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the relative contribution of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-mediated alterations in the microbiota to metabolic parameter changes in mice. Four groups were compared: male fat-1 transgenic mice (with constitutive production of ω3 PUFAs) and male wild-type (WT) littermates fed an obesogenic (high fat/high sucrose [HFHS]) or a control diet. Unlike WT mice, HFHS-fed fat-1 mice were protected against obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. Unlike WT mice, fat-1 mice maintained a normal barrier function, resulting in a significantly lower metabolic . The fat-1 mice displayed greater phylogenic diversity in the cecum, and fecal microbiota transplantation from fat-1 to WT mice was able to reverse weight gain and to normalize glucose tolerance and intestinal permeability. We concluded that the ω3 PUFA-mediated alteration of gut microbiota contributed to the prevention of metabolic syndrome in fat-1 mice. It occurred independently of changes in the PUFA content of host tissues and may represent a promising strategy to prevent metabolic disease and preserve a lean phenotype.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925102>Continued Alcohol Misuse in Human Cirrhosis is Associated with an Impaired Gut-Liver Axis.</a></h2><p>Cirrhosis and alcohol can independently affect the gut-liver axis with systemic inflammation. However, their concurrent impact in humans is unclear.Our aim was to determine the effect of continued alcohol misuse on the gut-liver axis in cirrhotic patients. Age- and MELD-balanced cirrhotic patients who were currently drinking (Alc) or abstinent (NAlc) and healthy controls underwent serum and stool collection. A subset underwent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy for biopsies and duodenal fluid collection. The groups were compared regarding (i) inflammation/intestinal barrier: systemic tumor necrosis factor levels, intestinal inflammatory cytokine (duodenum, ileum, sigmoid), and ileal antimicrobial peptide expression; (ii) microbiota composition: 16SrRNA sequencing of duodenal, ileal, and colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota; and (iii) microbial functionality: duodenal fluid and fecal bile  (BA) profile (conjugation and dehydroxylation status), intestinal BA transporter (ASBT, FXR, FGF-19, SHP) expression, and stool metabolomics using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Alc patients demonstrated a significant duodenal, ileal, and colonic mucosal and fecal dysbiosis, compared to NAlc and controls with lower autochthonous bacterial taxa. BA profile skewed toward a potentially toxic profile (higher secondary and glycine-conjugated BAs) in duodenal fluid and stool in Alc patients. Duodenal fluid demonstrated conjugated secondary BAs only in the Alc group. There was a greater expression of all ileal BA transporters in Alc patients. This group also showed higher , systemic and ileal inflammatory expression, and lower amino  and bioenergetic-associated metabolites, without change in antimicrobial peptide expression.Despite cirrhosis, continued alcohol misuse predisposes patients to widespread dysbiosis with alterations in microbial functionality such as a toxic BA profile, which can lead to intestinal and systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27042162>Hydrogen sulfide modulates chromatin remodeling and inflammatory mediator production in response to endotoxin, but does not play a role in the development of endotoxin tolerance.</a></h2><p>Pretreatment with low doses of LPS (lipopolysaccharide, bacterial endotoxin) reduces the pro-inflammatory response to a subsequent higher LPS dose, a phenomenon known as endotoxin tolerance. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseous mediator (gasotransmitter) can exert anti-inflammatory effects.

Animals were sacrificed after 4 or 12 h; plasma IL-6 and TNF-α levels were measured. Changes in histone H3 and H4 acetylation were analyzed by Western blotting.LPS tolerance decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. AOAA did not affect the effect of tolerance on reducing cytokine production. Treatment of the cells with the H2S donor reduced cytokine production. Induction of the tolerance increased the acetylation of H3; AOAA reduced histone acetylation. H2S donation increased histone acetylation. Tolerance did not affect the responses to H2S with respect to histone acetylation.In conclusion, both LPS tolerance and H2S donation decrease LPS-induced cytokine production in vitro and modulate histone acetylation. However, endogenous, CSE-derived H2S does not appear to play a significant role in the development of LPS tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28536285>Gut Microbiota Mediates the Protective Effects of Dietary Capsaicin against Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation and Associated Obesity Induced by High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Metabolic  originating from dysbiotic gut microbiota has been identified as a primary mediator for triggering the chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) responsible for the development of obesity. Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pungent bioactivator in chili peppers and has potent anti-obesity functions, yet the mechanisms linking this effect to gut microbiota remain obscure. Here we show that mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with CAP exhibit lower levels of metabolic  and CLGI associated with lower body weight gain. High-resolution responses of the microbiota were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing, short-chain fatty  (SCFA) measurements, and phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis. The results showed, among others, that dietary CAP induced increased levels of butyrate-producing  and , while it caused lower levels of members of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing family S24_7. Predicted function analysis (PICRUSt) showed depletion of genes involved in bacterial LPS synthesis in response to CAP. We further identified that inhibition of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB) by CAP also contributes to prevention of HFD-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation experiments conducted in germfree mice demonstrated that dietary CAP-induced protection against HFD-induced obesity is transferrable. Moreover, microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block the CAP-induced protective phenotype against obesity, further suggesting the role of microbiota in this context. Together, our findings uncover an interaction between dietary CAP and gut microbiota as a novel mechanism for the anti-obesity effect of CAP acting through prevention of microbial dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Metabolic  due to gut microbial dysbiosis is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI), which primarily mediates the development of obesity. A dietary strategy to reduce  appears to be an effective approach for addressing the issue of obesity. Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pungent component in red chili (genus ). Little is known about the role of gut microbiota in the anti-obesity effect of CAP. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that CAP significantly increased butyragenic bacteria and decreased LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., members of the S24-7 family) and LPS biosynthesis. By using antibiotics and microbiota transplantation, we prove that gut microbiota plays a causal role in dietary CAP-induced protective phenotype against high-fat-diet-induced CLGI and obesity. Moreover, CB inhibition was partially involved in the beneficial effect of CAP. Together, these data suggest that the gut microbiome is a critical factor for the anti-obesity effects of CAP.Copyright © 2017 Kang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585832>Treatment With Acetylsalicylic  Reverses Endotoxin Tolerance in Humans In Vivo: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study.</a></h2><p>To investigate immunostimulatory effects of acetylsalicylic  during experimental human  and in sepsis patients.Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers and ex vivo stimulation experiments using monocytes of septic patients.Intensive care research unit of an university hospital.Thirty healthy male volunteers and four sepsis patients.Healthy volunteers were challenged IV with endotoxin twice, at a 1-week interval, with each challenge consisting of a bolus of 1 ng/kg followed by continuous administration of 1 ng/kg/hr during 3 hours. Volunteers were randomized to acetylsalicylic  prophylaxis (80 mg acetylsalicylic  daily for a 14-d period, starting 7 d before the first endotoxin challenge), acetylsalicylic  treatment (80 mg acetylsalicylic  daily for the 7-d period in-between both endotoxin challenges), or the control group (receiving placebo). Furthermore, monocytes of sepsis patients were incubated with acetylsalicylic  preexposed platelets and were subsequently stimulated with endotoxin.Acetylsalicylic  prophylaxis enhanced plasma tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations upon the first endotoxin challenge by 50% compared with the control group (p = 0.02) but did not modulate cytokine responses during the second endotoxin challenge. In contrast, acetylsalicylic  treatment resulted in enhanced plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (+53%; p = 0.02), interleukin-6 (+91%; p = 0.03), and interleukin-8 (+42%; p = 0.02) upon the second challenge, whereas plasma levels of the key antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 were attenuated (-40%; p = 0.003). This proinflammatory phenotype in the acetylsalicylic  treatment group was accompanied by a decrease in urinary prostaglandin E metabolite levels (-27% ± 7%; p = 0.01). Ex vivo exposure of platelets to acetylsalicylic  increased production of tumor necrosis factor-α (+66%) and decreased production of interleukin-10 (-23%) by monocytes of sepsis patients.Treatment, but not prophylaxis, with low-dose acetylsalicylic , partially reverses endotoxin tolerance in humans in vivo by shifting response toward a proinflammatory phenotype. This acetylsalicylic -induced proinflammatory shift was also observed in septic monocytes, signifying that patients suffering from sepsis-induced immunoparalysis might benefit from initiating acetylsalicylic  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875318>Influence of gut microbiota on the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH has increased with the obesity epidemic, but its etiology is multifactorial. The current studies suggest the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of NASH. The aim is to review the studies that investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and NASH. These review also discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of diet on the gut-liver axis.The available literature has proposed mechanisms for an association between gut microbiota and NASH, such as: modification energy homeostasis, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-, increased endogenous production of ethanol, and alteration in the metabolism of bile  and choline. There is evidence to suggest that NASH patients have a higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. However, there is still a controversy regarding the microbiome profile in this population. The abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum may be increased, decreased, or unaltered in NASH patients. There is an increase in the Escherichia and Bacteroides genus. There is depletion of certain taxa, such as Prevotella and Faecalibacterium.Although few studies have evaluated the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with NASH, it is observed that these individuals have a distinct gut microbiota, compared to the control groups, which explains, at least in part, the genesis and progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms. Modulation of the gut microbiota through diet control offers new challenges for future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012191>Saturated and Unsaturated Dietary Fats Differentially Modulate Ethanol-Induced Changes in Gut Microbiome and Metabolome in a Mouse Model of Alcoholic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) ranks among major causes of morbidity and mortality. Diet and crosstalk between the gut and liver are important determinants of ALD. We evaluated the effects of different types of dietary fat and ethanol on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity and the effect of these changes on liver injury in ALD. Compared with ethanol and a saturated fat diet (medium chain triglycerides enriched), an unsaturated fat diet (corn oil enriched) exacerbated ethanol-induced , liver steatosis, and injury. Major alterations in gut microbiota, including a reduction in Bacteroidetes and an increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, were seen in animals fed an unsaturated fat diet and ethanol but not a saturated fat diet and ethanol. Compared with a saturated fat diet and ethanol, an unsaturated fat diet and ethanol caused major fecal metabolomic changes. Moreover, a decrease in certain fecal amino  was noted in both alcohol-fed groups. These data support an important role of dietary lipids in ALD pathogenesis and provide insight into mechanisms of ALD development. A diet enriched in unsaturated fats enhanced alcohol-induced liver injury and caused major fecal metagenomic and metabolomic changes that may play an etiologic role in observed liver injury.

The antibiotic-dependent and -independent effects of rifaximin need to be elucidated in the setting of MHE-associated microbiota. To assess the action of rifaximin on intestinal barrier, inflammatory milieu and ammonia generation independent of microbiota using rifaximin.Four germ-free (GF) mice groups were used (1) GF, (2) GF+rifaximin, (3) Humanized with stools from an MHE patient, and (4) Humanized+rifaximin. Mice were followed for 30 days while rifaximin was administered in chow at 100 mg/kg from days 16-30. We tested for ammonia generation (small-intestinal glutaminase, serum ammonia, and cecal glutamine/amino- moieties), systemic inflammation (serum IL-1β, IL-6), intestinal barrier (FITC-dextran, large-/small-intestinal expression of IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, e-cadherin and zonulin) along with microbiota composition (colonic and fecal multi-tagged sequencing) and function (, fecal bile  deconjugation and de-hydroxylation).All mice survived until day 30. In the GF setting, rifaximin decreased intestinal ammonia generation (lower serum ammonia, increased small-intestinal glutaminase, and cecal glutamine content) without changing inflammation or intestinal barrier function. Humanized microbiota increased systemic/intestinal inflammation and  without hyperammonemia. Rifaximin therapy significantly ameliorated these inflammatory cytokines. Rifaximin also favorably impacted microbiota function (reduced endotoxin and decreased deconjugation and formation of potentially toxic secondary bile ), but not microbial composition in humanized mice.Rifaximin beneficially alters intestinal ammonia generation by regulating intestinal glutaminase expression independent of gut microbiota. MHE-associated fecal colonization results in intestinal and systemic inflammation in GF mice, which is also ameliorated with rifaximin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748832>Effect of  in mice genetically deficient in cystathionine-γ-lyase, cystathionine-β-synthase or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed to exert pro- as well as anti-inflammatory effects in various models of critical illness. In this study, we compared bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced changes in inflammatory mediator production, indices of multiple organ injury and survival in wild‑type (WT) mice and in mice with reduced expression of one of the three H2S‑producing enzymes, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with LPS (10 mg/kg). After 6 h, the animals were sacrificed, blood and organs were collected and the following parameters were evaluated: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in blood, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the lung, cytokine levels in plasma and the expression of the three H2S‑producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3MST) in the spleen, lung, liver and kidney. LPS induced a tissue‑dependent upregulation of some of the H2S‑producing enzymes in WT mice (upregulation of CBS in the spleen, upregulation of 3MST in the liver and upregulation of CBS, CSE and 3MST in the lung). Moreover, LPS impaired glomerular function, as evidenced by increased BUN levels. Renal impairment was comparable in the CSE‑/‑ and Δ3MST mice after LPS challenge; however, it was attenuated in the CBS+/‑ mice. MPO levels (an index of neutrophil infiltration) and MDA levels (an index of oxidative stress) in lung homogenates were significantly increased in response to LPS; these effects were similar in the WT, CBS+/‑, CSE‑/‑ and Δ3MST mice; however, the MDA levels tended to be lower in the CBS+/‑ and CSE‑/‑ mice. LPS induced significant increases in the plasma levels of multiple cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, IL‑10, IL‑12 and interferon (IFN)γ] in plasma; TNFα, IL‑10 and IL‑12 levels tended to be lower in all three groups of animals expressing lower levels of H2S‑producing enzymes. The survival rates after the LPS challenge did not show any significant differences between the four animal groups tested. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that a deficiency in 3MST does not significantly affect , while a deficiency in CBS or CSE slightly ameliorates the outcome of LPS-induced  in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896356>Impact of exercise-induced hypohydration on gastrointestinal integrity, function, symptoms, and systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profile.</a></h2><p>It is commonly believed that gastrointestinal issues during exercise are exacerbated by hypohydration. This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise-induced hypohydration on gastrointestinal integrity, function, symptoms, and systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles. In a randomized crossover design, male endurance runners ( = 11) performed 2 h of running at 70% of maximum oxygen uptake in 25°C ambient temperature with water provision [euhydration (EuH)] and total water restriction [hypohydration (HypoH)] during running, which accounted for 0.6 ± 0.6% and 3.1 ± 0.7% body mass loss, respectively. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after exercise. Breath samples (H determination) were collected and gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) recorded before, during, and after exercise. HypoH resulted in a higher, yet insignificant, ∆ preexercise to postexercise plasma cortisol concentration (+286 nmol/l vs. +176 nmol/l;  = 0.098) but significantly higher intestinal fatty -binding protein (I-FABP) (+539 pg/ml vs. +371 pg/ml;  = 0.047) concentration compared with EuH. A greater breath H response ( = 0.026) was observed on HypoH (1,188 ppm/3 h, peak +12 ppm) vs. EuH (579 ppm/3 h, peak +6 ppm). Despite greater GIS incidence on HypoH (82%) vs. EuH (64%), GIS severity scores were not significant between trials. Exercise-induced leukocytosis (overall pre- to postexercise: 5.9 × 10/l to 12.1 × 10/l) was similar on both trials. Depressed in vitro neutrophil function was observed during recovery on HypoH (-36%) but not on EUH (+6%). A pre- to postexercise increase ( < 0.05) was observed for circulating cytokine concentrations but not endotoxin values. Hypohydration during 2 h of running modestly perturbs gastrointestinal integrity and function and increases GIS incidence but does not affect systemic  and cytokinemia.  Despite anecdotal beliefs that exercise-induced hypohydration exacerbates perturbations to gastrointestinal status, the present study reports only modest perturbations in gastrointestinal integrity, function, and symptoms compared with euhydration maintenance. Exercise-induced hypohydration does not exacerbate systemic  and cytokinemia compared with euhydration maintenance.

Our objective was to identify LfcinB17-31 derivatives with reduced hemolysis and improved antimicrobial activity via substituting Cys3, Arg4, Gln7, Met10, and Gly14 with more hydrophobic residues. Two peptides, Lfcin4 and Lfcin5, showed higher activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enteritidis and lower hemolytic activity than the parent peptide LfcinB17-31. These peptides permeabilized the outer and inner membranes of S. enteritidis; however, Lfcin5 did not permeabilize the inner membrane of S. aureus. Gel retardation and circular dichroism spectra showed that Lfcin4 and Lfcin5 bound to bacterial genomic DNA. Lfcin4 inhibited DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Both peptides induced the peeling of membranes and the lysis of S. enteritidis. At doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg, Lfcin4 and Lfcin5 reduced the bacterial counts in infected thigh muscles by 0.03‒0.10 and 0.05‒0.63 log CFU/g of tissue, respectively, within 10 h. Lfcin4 and Lfcin5 enhanced the survival rate of endotoxemic mice; reduced serum IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α levels; and protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury. These data suggest that Lfcin4 and Lfcin5 may be antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin peptides that could serve as the basis for the development of dual-function agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491842>Inflammatory Response to Different Toxins in Experimental Sepsis Models.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated host response to infection. Despite serious mortality and morbidity, no sepsis-specific drugs exist.  is often used to model the hyperinflammation associated with early sepsis. This model classically uses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative pathogens to activate the immune system, leading to hyperinflammation, microcirculatory disturbances and death. Other toxins may also be used to activate the immune system including Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic  (LTA). In addition to these standard toxins, other bacterial components can induce inflammation. These molecules activate different signaling pathways and produce different physiological responses which can be taken advantage of for sepsis modeling.  modeling can provide information on pathways to inflammation in sepsis and contribute to preclinical drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28073414>[Protective effect of Saccharomyces boulardii against intestinal mucosal barrier injury in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease].</a></h2><p> To investigate the protective effect of Saccharomyces boulardii against intestinal mucosal barrier injury in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  A total of 36 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats with a mean body weight of 180±20 g were randomly divided into control group, model group, and treatment group, with 12 rats in each group, after adaptive feeding for 1 week. The rats in the control group were given basic feed, and those in the model group and treatment group were given high-fat feed. After 12 weeks of feeding, the treatment group was given Saccharomyces boulardii (75×10 CFU/kg/d) by gavage, and those in the control group and model group were given isotonic saline by gavage. At the 20th week, blood samples were taken from the abdominal aorta to measure the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and endotoxins. The liver pathological changes, intestinal histopathological changes, and expression of occludin in the intestinal mucosa were observed. Fecal samples were collected to measure the changes in Escherichia coli and Bacteroides. A one-way analysis of variance and the SNK test were used for comparison between multiple groups, and the rank sum test was used as the non-parametric test.  Compared with the control group, the model group had significantly higher body weight, liver mass, and liver index ( < 0.05), and compared with the model group, the treatment group had significant reductions in body weight, liver mass, and liver index ( < 0.05). The model group had significant increases in TG, ALT, and AST compared with the control group ( < 0.05), the treatment group had a significant reduction in AST compared with the model group ( < 0.05), and the treatment group had slight reductions in TG and ALT compared with the model group ( > 0.05). Compared with the control group, the model group had significant increases in the levels of endotoxin, TNF-α, and IFABP ( < 0.05), and the treatment group had significant reductions in the levels of endotoxin, TNF-α, and IFABP ( < 0.05). Liver tissue staining showed that the model group had significantly increased hepatocyte steatosis compared with the control group ( < 0.05), and that the treatment group had significantly reduced hepatocyte steatosis compared with the model group ( < 0.05). The intestinal villi in the control group had ordered arrangement and a complete structure; in the model group, the intestinal villi were shortened with local shedding and a lack of ordered arrangement; compared with the model group, the treatment group had mild edema and ordered arrangements of the intestinal villi. The model group had a significantly reduced level of occludin protein compared with the control group ( < 0.05), and the treatment group had a slight increase compared with the model group. The model group had a significantly increased number of Escherichia coli and a significantly reduced number of Bacteroides compared with the control group ( < 0.05), and the treatment group had a significantly reduced number of Escherichia coli and a significantly increased number of Bacteroides compared with the model group ( < 0.05).  High-fat diet can successfully induce NAFLD in rats, and intervention with Saccharomyces boulardii can reduce body weight and improve hepatocyte steatosis. Saccharomyces boulardii can reduce  in NAFLD rats and thus alleviate inflammatory response. Saccharomyces boulardii can also adjust the proportion of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides in the intestine of NAFLD rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29765489>Gallic -L-Leucine Conjugate Protects Mice against LPS-Induced Inflammation and Sepsis via Correcting Proinflammatory Lipid Mediator Profiles and Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>The pathology of endotoxin LPS-induced sepsis is hallmarked by aberrant production of proinflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new product gallic -L-leucine (GAL) conjugate could ameliorate the LPS-induced dysregulation of arachidonic  metabolism and NO production. We first investigated the effects of GAL conjugate on the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and the production of proinflammatory NO and lipid mediators in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, primary peritoneal macrophages, and mouse model. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL attenuated LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX-2, and 5-LOX in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, probing NO-mediated fluorescence revealed that GAL antagonized the stimulatory effect of LPS on iNOS activity. By profiling of lipid mediators with ESI-MS-based lipidomics, we found that GAL suppressed LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2. We further discovered that GAL might exhibit anti-inflammatory activities by the following mechanisms: (1) suppressing LPS-induced activation of MAP kinases (i.e., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38); (2) reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (3) preventing LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. Consequently, GAL significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and iNOS expression and the plasma levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-treated mice. GAL pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Taken together, our results suggest that GAL may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of  and sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792349>Role for nuclear interleukin-37 in the suppression of innate immunity.</a></h2><p>The IL-1 family member IL-37 broadly suppresses innate inflammation and acquired immunity. Similar to IL-1α and IL-33, IL-37 is a dual-function cytokine in that IL-37 translocates to the nucleus but also transmits a signal via surface membrane receptors. The role of nuclear IL-37 remains unknown on the ability of this cytokine to inhibit innate inflammation. Here, we compared suppression of innate inflammation in transgenic mice expressing native human IL-37 (IL-37Tg) with those of transgenic mice carrying the mutation of aspartic  (D) to alanine (A) at amino  20 (IL-37D20ATg). The mutation D20A prevents cleavage of caspase-1, a step required for IL-37 nuclear translocation. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages from IL-37Tg mice reduced LPS-induced IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ by 40-50% whereas in macrophages from IL-37D20ATg mice this suppression was not observed, consistent with loss of nuclear function. Compared with macrophages from IL-37Tg mice, significantly less or no suppression of LPS-induced MAP kinase and NFκB activation was also observed in macrophages from IL-37D20ATg mice. In vivo, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in the lungs and liver were markedly reduced during  in IL-37Tg mice but not observed in IL-37D20ATg mice. However, suppression of innate inflammation remains intact in the IL-37D20A mice once the cytokine is released from the cell and binds to its receptor. These studies reveal a nuclear function for suppression of innate inflammation and are consistent with the dual function of IL-37 and a role for caspase-1 in limiting inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239174>Acute phase protein, α - 1-  glycoprotein (AGP-1), has differential effects on TLR-2 and TLR-4 mediated responses.</a></h2><p>Alpha-1- glycoprotein (AGP-1) is a major positive acute phase glycoprotein with unknown functions that likely play a role in inflammation. We tested its involvement in a variety of inflammatory responses using human AGP-1 purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. AGP-1 alone upregulated MAPK signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages. However, when given in combination with TLR ligands, AGP-1 selectively augmented MAPK activation induced by ligands of TLR-2 (Braun lipoprotein) but not TLR-4 (lipopolysaccharide). In vivo treatment of AGP-1 in a murine model of sepsis with or without TLR-2 or TLR-4 ligands, selectively potentiated TLR-2-mediated mortality, but was without significant effect on TLR-4-mediated mortality. Furthermore, in vitro, AGP-1 selectively potentiated TLR-2 mediated adhesion of human primary immune cell, neutrophils. Hence, our studies highlight a new role for the acute phase protein AGP-1 in sepsis via its interaction with TLR-2 signaling mechanisms to selectively promote responsiveness to one of the two major gram-negative endotoxins, contributing to the complicated pathobiology of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

We therefore assessed whether the hygienic status of animal facilities alters the gut barrier in DIO mice.Male C57BL/6N mice were housed in a conventional (CV) or a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility and were fed identical diets represented by a high-fat (60kJ% fat) or control diet (11kJ% fat) for 12 wks. Intestinal barrier function in small and large intestine was evaluated in Ussing chambers by electrical resistance and permeability measurements. Jejunal (p < 0.01) and proximal colonic (p < 0.05) barrier function was altered in CV DIO mice, but not in SPF DIO mice. Moreover, only CV DIO mice were characterized by metabolic  and low-grade inflammation. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant differences in fecal bacterial diversity and composition between the two animal facilities, but only in mice fed the HFD. Moreover, cecal DCA concentrations correlated positively with two yet uncultivated Clostridiales species.We demonstrated that housing conditions and associated changes in gut bacterial colonization are pivotal for maintenance of gut barrier integrity in DIO mice.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, melatonin was given not before first symptoms of systemic inflammation became manifest. Lipopolysaccharide was infused at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg × h to induce systemic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Melatonin (single dose 3 mg/kg × 15 min) was intravenously administered 180 and 270 min after starting of the lipopolysaccharide infusion. Systemic and vital parameters (e.g., systemic blood pressure and breathing rate) as well as blood and plasma parameters (-base parameters; electrolytes; parameters of tissue injury such as glucose concentration, lactate concentration, hemolysis, and aminotransferase activities; parameters of thromboelastometry; and platelet count) were determined in regular intervals. Infusion of lipopolysaccharide led to characteristic symptoms of severe systemic inflammation including hypotension, metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia, electrolyte and hemostatic disturbances, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. Melatonin neither decreased mortality nor reduced lipopolysaccharide-dependent changes to vital, blood, and plasma parameters.

The impact of sepsis on electrophysiological and molecular determinants of learning is underexplored. We observed that mice that survived sepsis or  experienced loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated (BDNF-mediated) process responsible for spatial memory formation. Memory impairment occurred despite preserved hippocampal BDNF content and could be reversed by stimulation of BDNF signaling, suggesting the presence of a local BDNF inhibitor. Sepsis is associated with degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, releasing heparan sulfate fragments (of sufficient size and sulfation to bind BDNF) into the circulation. Heparan sulfate fragments penetrated the hippocampal blood-brain barrier during sepsis and inhibited BDNF-mediated LTP. Glycoarray approaches demonstrated that the avidity of heparan sulfate for BDNF increased with sulfation at the 2-O position of iduronic  and the N position of glucosamine. Circulating heparan sulfate in endotoxemic mice and septic humans was enriched in 2-O- and N-sulfated disaccharides; furthermore, the presence of these sulfation patterns in the plasma of septic patients at intensive care unit (ICU) admission predicted persistent cognitive impairment 14 days after ICU discharge or at hospital discharge. Our findings indicate that circulating 2-O- and N-sulfated heparan sulfate fragments contribute to septic cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854319>Endogenous Intoxication and Saliva Lipid Peroxidation in Patients with Lung Cancer.</a></h2><p>This research was aimed at a search for regularities in changes to parameters of endogenous intoxication and saliva lipid peroxidation in patients with lung cancer, non-malignant lung diseases, and apparently healthy people. All patients went through saliva sampling at an amount of 1 mL. A concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured according to a reaction with thiobarbituric , and a level of middle molecules (MM) was measured with UV spectroscopy at 254 and 280 nm, while the content of lipid peroxidation products was measured according to a degree of heptane extract light absorption at wavelengths of 220, 232, 278, and 400 nm. It has been revealed that in the context of lung cancer, the level of diene conjugates decreases, increasing the level of triene conjugates, Schiff's bases, and MM. As a tumor grows, there is a decrease in the level of lipid peroxidation primary products and an increase in  phenomena.

Sepsis can involve activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which activates numerous inflammatory pathways. The breadth of this inflammation has limited the efficacy of pharmacological interventions that target a single molecular pathway. Here, we developed cargo-less particles as a single-agent, multi-target platform to elicit broad anti-inflammatory action against innate immune cells challenged by multiple TLR agonists. The particles, prepared from poly(lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) and poly(lactic ) (PLA), displayed potent molecular weight-, polymer composition-, and charge-dependent immunomodulatory properties, including downregulation of TLR-induced costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion. Particles prepared using the anionic surfactant poly(ethylene-alt-maleic ) (PEMA) significantly blunted the responses of antigen presenting cells to TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide) and TLR9 (CpG-ODN) agonists, demonstrating broad inhibitory activity to both extracellular and intracellular TLR ligands. Interestingly, particles prepared using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a neutrally-charged surfactant, only marginally inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretions. The biochemical pathways modulated by particles were investigated using TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRrays (TRACER), which implicated IRF1, STAT1, and AP-1 in the mechanism of action for PLA-PEMA particles. Using an LPS-induced  mouse model, administration of PLA-PEMA particles prior to or following a lethal challenge resulted in significantly improved mean survival. Cargo-less particles affect multiple biological pathways involved in the development of inflammatory responses by innate immune cells and represent a potentially promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The preconditioning with low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes leading to less tissue damage and better outcome. This hyporesponsive state called tolerance is associated to alterations in chromatin structure and nitric oxide (NO) production. In the current study, we demonstrated that tolerance induced by LPS was found to be NO-dependent and related to epigenetic changes.THP-1 cells were cultivated in RPMI medium (Control), submitted to tolerance (500ng/mL of LPS 24h before challenge with 1000ng/mL of LPS during 24h Tolerant group) and challenge (1000ng/mL of LPS during 24h Directly challenged group). The analyses performed were: cytokines production, histone acetyl transferases/histone deacetylases (HAT/HDAC) activity, nitrosylation of HDAC-2 and -3, expression of acetylated histones H3 and H4. HDAC and Nitric Oxide Synthases (NOS) activities were inhibited with 30mM trichostatin (TSA) and 100μM LNAME, respectively.Administration of low doses of LPS repressed the production of IL-6 and IL-10, however this effect was abolished with the inhibition of NOS activity and by TSA in the case of IL-10. Tolerance modulates the activity of HAT and, consequently, the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Inhibition of NO decreases acetylation of Histones. The HDACs 2 and 3 were nitrosylated after the tolerance induction.The tolerance to LPS regulates the cytokine production by modulating chromatin structure and this event is NO dependent.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of eight semi-synthetic amide derivatives of betulinic . Screening of derivatives BA1-BA8 led to the identification of compounds with superior immunomodulatory activity than BA on activated macrophages and lymphocytes. BA5, the most potent derivative, inhibited nitric oxide and TNFα production in a concentration-dependent manner, and decreased NF-κB activation in Raw 264.7 cells. Additionally, BA5 inhibited the proliferation of activated lymphocytes and the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A and IFNɣ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with BA5 induces cell cycle arrest in pre-G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, BA5 also inhibited the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the progression of cell cycle and T lymphocyte activation. BA5 has a synergistic inhibitory effect with dexamethasone on lymphoproliferation, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, we observed immunosuppressive effects of BA5 in vivo in mouse models of lethal  and delayed type hypersensitivity.

This alteration has been explained by an impairment of the lipid-mediated signaling in taste bud cells (TBC). However, factors responsible for this defect remain elusive. Diet rich in saturated fatty  is known to elicit a metabolic inflammation by promoting intestinal permeation to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxins. To determine whether a local inflammation of the gustatory tissue might explain the obese-induced impairment of the oro-sensory detection of lipids, mice were subjected to a DIO protocol. Using a combination of behavioral tests, transcriptomic analyses of gustatory papillae and biochemical assays, we have found that i) DIO elicits a pro-inflammatory genic profile in the circumvallate papillae (CVP), known to house the highest density of lingual taste buds, ii) NFkB, a key player of inflammatory process, might play a role in this transcriptomic pattern, iii) plasma LPS levels are negatively correlated with the preference for oily solution, and iv) a chronic infusion of LPS at a level similar to that found in DIO mice is not sufficient to alter the spontaneous preference for fat in lean mice. Taken together these data bring the demonstration that a saturated high fat diet elicits an inflammatory response at the level of peripheral gustatory pathway and a LPS-induced low-grade  alone does not explain the change in the preference for dietary lipids observed in DIO mice.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Rats were divided into four groups as the control, LPS (20 mg/kg), simvastatin (20 mg/kg), and simvastatin+LPS group. Galectin-3 expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections was demonstrated by using the immunohistochemistry methods. There were reduced densities, and the decreased number of Galectin-3 immunoreactivities in the simvastatin+LPS group compared with the LPS group in the pneumocytes, and in the bronchial epithelium of lung tissue. In the LPS group, GR, GSH-Px, and SOD were found lower than the levels in simvastatin-treated LPS group (<0.05, <0.01, <0.01 respectively) in the lung tissue. However, TBARS decreased in the simvastatin+LPS group compared with the levels in LPS group (<0.001).

Low doses of sodium pyruvate reduced signs of inflammation, enhanced systemic blood pressure, and ameliorated metabolic acidosis when administered in a prophylactic manner during endotoxemic shock. In the present study, we investigated whether low-dosed infusions of sodium pyruvate exhibited beneficial effects when applied therapeutically after the induction of systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide was infused at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg × h over a period of 360 min to induce systemic inflammation in male Wistar rats. Sodium pyruvate (single dose 50 mg/kg × 15 min) was administered intravenously 180 and 270 min after starting of the lipopolysaccharide infusion. Systemic/vital parameters (e.g., systemic blood pressure and breathing rate) and blood/plasma parameters (e.g., -base parameters; electrolytes; glucose and lactate concentration; hemolysis; aminotransferase activities; and parameters of coagulation) were determined in regular intervals. Lipopolysaccharide infusion led to metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte as well as hemostatic disturbances, and hemolysis. Except for the -base status (amelioration of metabolic acidosis) and the plasma chloride concentration (reduction of hyperchloremia), the additional infusion of sodium pyruvate failed in significantly improving lipopolysaccharide-dependent alterations (e.g. vital, blood and plasma parameters).

The use of a 12-week LAB⁴ intervention significantly reduced endotoxin units both pre-race (4.37 ± 0.51 pg·mL) and six days post-race (5.18 ± 0.57 pg·mL;  = 0.03, ηp² = 0.35), but only six days post-race with LAB⁴ (5.01 ± 0.28 pg·mL;  = 0.01, ηp² = 0.43). In contrast, endotoxin units remained unchanged with PL. L:M significantly increased from 0.01 ± 0.01 at baseline to 0.06 ± 0.01 with PL only ( = 0.004, ηp² = 0.51). Mean race times (h:min:s) were not statistically different between groups despite faster times with both pro/prebiotoic groups (LAB⁴: 13:17:07 ± 0:34:48; LAB⁴: 12:47:13 ± 0:25:06; PL: 14:12:51 ± 0:29:54;  > 0.05). Combined multistrain pro/prebiotic use may reduce endotoxin unit levels, with LAB⁴ potentially conferring an additive effect via combined GI modulation and antioxidant protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767075>Ovine hippocampal mRNA expression in offspring from dams supplemented with fishmeal and stress challenged in late pregnancy with endotoxin.</a></h2><p>Previous research has shown that adulthood disease can be attributed to stress events that occur during gestation. The objective of the present study was to determine whether maternal stress during late pregnancy, using a bacterial  model, causes changes in hippocampal mRNA expression of candidate genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) regulation in sheep. This study also sought to investigate whether maternal diets supplemented with fishmeal (FM) rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) offer protection to the fetus when subjected to maternal endotoxin stress. Using RT-qPCR, relative mRNA expression was assessed in both fetal lambs and 6-month-old lambs from dams supplemented with soybean meal (SM) or FM and challenged with either endotoxin or saline. From this it was found that fetal mineralocorticoid receptor () gene expression had a tendency to be altered during endotoxin challenge, however, in the 6-month-old offspring,  and glucocorticoid receptor () gene expression were differently altered across treatment groups. These results suggest that gene regulation within the hippocampus is altered into adulthood by maternal endotoxin stress and that dietary supplementation affects outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795486>A reassessment of the blood-brain barrier transport of large neutral amino  during acute systemic inflammation in humans.</a></h2><p>We reassessed data from a previous study on the transcerebral net exchange of large neutral amino  (LNAAs) using a novel mathematical model of blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport. The study included twelve healthy volunteers who received a 4-h intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion (total dose: 0·3 ng/kg), a human experimental model of the systemic inflammatory response during the early stages of sepsis. Cerebral blood flow and arterial-to-jugular venous LNAA concentrations were measured prior to and after LPS, and the BBB transport and brain extracellular concentrations of LNAAs were calculated. The arterial concentration and unidirectional cerebral influx of phenylalanine increased after LPS. The BBB transport of tyrosine was unaffected, while its concentration in the brain extracellular fluid increased. These findings suggest that LPS infusion leads to an increased cerebral uptake of phenylalanine, which is then metabolized to tyrosine. This may reflect a neuroprotective mechanism that 'detoxifies' excess intracerebral phenylalanine in the clinical setting of sepsis.© 2017 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Elevated blood lactate and slow lactate clearance are associated with mortality; however, regulatory roles are unknown. We hypothesized that lactic  (LA) contributes to the late phase and is not solely a consequence of bacterial infection. No studies have examined LA effects in sepsis models in vivo or a mechanism by which it suppresses LPS-induced activation in vitro. Because mast cells can be activated systemically and contribute to sepsis, we examined LA effects on the mast cell response to LPS. LA significantly suppressed LPS-induced cytokine production and NF-κB transcriptional activity in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and cytokine production in peritoneal mast cells. Suppression was MCT-1 dependent and reproducible with sodium lactate or formic . Further, LA significantly suppressed cytokine induction following LPS-induced  in mice. Because glycolysis is linked to inflammation and LA is a byproduct of this process, we examined changes in glucose metabolism. LA treatment reduced glucose uptake and lactate export during LPS stimulation. LA effects were mimicked by glycolytic inhibitors and reversed by increasing ATP availability. These results indicate that glycolytic suppression and ATP production are necessary and sufficient for LA effects. Our work suggests that enhancing glycolysis and ATP production could improve immune function, counteracting LA suppressive effects in the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345057>Circulating levels of butyrate are inversely related to portal hypertension, , and systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) are gut microbiota-derived products that participate in maintaining the gut barrier integrity and host's immune response. We hypothesize that reduced SCFA levels are associated with systemic inflammation, , and more severe hemodynamic alterations in cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis referred for a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement ( = 62) or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement ( = 12) were included. SCFAs were measured in portal (when available), hepatic, and peripheral blood samples by GC-MS. Serum endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, and NO levels were quantified. SCFA levels were significantly higher in portal  hepatic and peripheral blood. There were inverse relationships between SCFAs and the severity of disease. SCFAs (mainly butyric ) inversely correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score and were further reduced in patients with history of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There was an inverse relationship between butyric  and HVPG values. SCFAs were directly related with systemic vascular resistance and inversely with cardiac index. Butyric  inversely correlated with inflammatory markers and serum endotoxin. A global reduction in the blood levels of SCFA in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a more advanced liver disease, suggesting its contribution to disease progression.-Juanola, O., Ferrusquía-Acosta, J., García-Villalba, R., Zapater, P., Magaz, M., Marín, A., Olivas, P., Baiges, A., Bellot, P., Turon, F., Hernández-Gea, V., González-Navajas, J.

Among the TLR family, TLR4 is the best understood. However, while its downstream signaling pathways have been well defined, not all ligands of TLR4 are currently known. Current evidence suggests that saturated fatty  (SFA) act as non-microbial TLR4 agonists, and trigger its inflammatory response. Thus, our present review provides a new perspective on the potential mechanism by which SFAs could modulate TLR4-induced inflammatory responses: (1) SFAs can be recognized by CD14-TLR4-MD2 complex and trigger inflammatory pathways, similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). (2) SFAs lead to modification of gut microbiota with an overproduction of LPS after a high-fat intake, enhancing this natural TLR4 ligand. (3) In addition, this metabolic  leads to an oxidative stress thereby producing atherogenic lipids - oxLDL and oxidized phospholipids - which trigger CD36-TLR4-TLR6 inflammatory response. (4) Also, the high SFA consumption increases the lipemia and the mmLDL and oxLDL formation through oxidative modifications of LDL. The mmLDL, unlike oxLDL, is involved in activation of the CD14-TLR4-MD2 inflammatory pathway. Those molecules can induce TLR4 inflammatory response by MyD88-dependent and/or MyD88-independent pathways that, in turn, promotes the expression of proinflammatory transcript factors such as factor nuclear kappa B (NF-κB), which plays a crucial role in the induction of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, or costimulatory molecules) implicated in the development and progression of many chronic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

MS has been proven to be associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, leading to morbidity and mortality. In this manuscript, we review recent studies concerning the role of the gut microbiota in MS modulation. Manipulation of the gut microbiota through the administration of prebiotics or probiotics may assist in weight loss and reduce plasma glucose and serum lipid levels, decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To the best of our knowledge, short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), bile salt hydrolase (BSH), metabolic  and the endocannabinoid (eCB) system are essential in regulating the initiation and progression of MS through the normalization of adipogenesis and the regulation of insulin secretion, fat accumulation, energy homeostasis, and plasma cholesterol levels. Therefore, the gut microbiota may serve as a potential therapeutic target for MS. However, further studies are needed to enhance our understanding of manipulating the gut microbiota and the role of the gut microbiota in MS prevention and treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29907203>Bile and circulating HMGB1 contributes to systemic inflammation in obstructive jaundice.</a></h2><p>Obstructive jaundice (OJ) patients with cholangitis are prone to sepsis; however, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear and need to be clarified.Analyzing all available published data related to the title of this article.OJ leads to absence of gut luminal bile and accumulation of hepatic and circulating bile . Absence of gut luminal bile deprives the gut from its antiinflammatory, endotoxin-binding, bacteriostatic, mucosal-trophic, epithelial tight-junction maintaining, and gut motility-regulating effects, leading to gut bacterial overgrowth, mucosal atrophy, mucosal tight-junction loss, and gut motility dysfunction. These alterations promote intestinal endotoxin and bacterial translocation (BT) into portal and systemic circulation. Gut BT triggers systemic inflammation, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunctions in OJ. The accumulation of hepatic and circulating bile  kills/damages hepatocyte and Kupffer cells, and it also significantly decreases the number of liver natural killer T-cells in OJ. This results in impaired hepatic and systemic immune function, which facilitates BT. In addition, neutralizing bile HMGB1 can reverse endotoxemic bile-induced gut BT and mucosal injury in mice, suggesting that bile HMGB1 in OJ patients can be responsible for internal drainage-related clinical complications. Moreover, the elevated circulating HMGB1 level may contribute to multiple organ injuries, and it might also mediate gut BT in OJ.HMGB1 may significantly contribute to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunctions in OJ.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The dogs in CVVHDF group were given the typical CVVHDF treatment for 24h after the completion of endotoxin intravenous infusion, while those in MODS group were offered the i.v heparin instead only. Serum sample were collected at five time points, i.e. before anesthesia, 0h, 6h, 12h and 24h after the endotoxin injection (T1~T5, respectively), and meanwhile, the changes of mRNA, protein and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) apoptosis rates in JNK, CHOP and Caspase-12 were observed before and after interfered by RNA interference technology.The levels of DLA-DR, IL-1β and IL-4 were higher than those in MODS group after the CVVHDF treatment, and the early and late apoptosis rates showed downward trend compared with MODS group. In vitro and prior to RNA interference (RNAi), the levels of mRNA and protein expression and HUVECs apoptosis rates of JNK, CHOP and Caspase-12 in CVVHDF group were significantly lower compared to T1 and MODS group respectively. However, the levels of mRNA and protein expression and HUVECs apoptosis rates were significantly lower than those before interfered by RNAi in both two groups. The serum levels of LPCs, ornithine, proline, methionine, etc. were down-regulated while carnitines, FFAs, PC, etc. were increased significantly in MODS (T4), and the serum levels of methionine, proline, arginine and lysine were increased while carnitine, LPCs, PCs, SMs and orthophosporic  were decreased after 12 hours CVVHDF treatment (T4).CVVHDF treatment could reduce the apoptosis of the cells by enhancing the antigen presentation, improving the anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory imbalance and even correcting the metabolic disorder of amino  and phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348560>Specific Strains of Lactic  Bacteria Differentially Modulate the Profile of Adipokines .</a></h2><p>Obesity induces local/systemic inflammation accompanied by increases in macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue and production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and hormones. Previous studies have shown that probiotics could improve the intestinal dysbiosis induced by metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Microorganisms could (directly or indirectly) affect adipokine levels due to their capacity to induce translocation of several intestinal microbial antigens into systemic circulation, which could lead to metabolic  or produce immunomodulation in different organs. The aim of the present study was to select non-inflammatory lactic  bacteria (LAB) strains with the capacity to modulate adipokine secretion by the adipose tissue. We wish to elucidate the role of potential probiotic strains in the regulation of the cross talking between immune cells such as macrophages and adipose cells. Mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was used for evaluating the ability of 14 LAB strains to induce cytokine production. The LAB strains were chosen based on their previously studied beneficial properties in health. Then, in murine adipocyte culture and macrophage-adipocyte coculture, we determined the ability of these strains to induce cytokines and leptin secretion. Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and leptin levels were measured in cell supernatants. We also performed the detection and quantification of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) expression in macrophage cell lines stimulated by these LAB strains. Differential secretion profile of cytokines in macrophage cells induced by LAB strains was observed. Also, the levels of Ob-Rb expression diverged among different LAB strains. In LAB-stimulated coculture cells (adipocytes and macrophages), we observed differential production of leptin and cytokines. Furthermore, we detected lower production levels in single culture than cocultured cells. The principal component analysis showed an association between the four clusters of strains established according to their inflammatory profiles and leptin adipocyte production and leptin receptor expression in macrophages. We conclude that coculture is the most appropriate system for selecting strains with the ability to modulate adipokine secretion. The use of microorganisms with low and medium inflammatory properties and ability to modulate leptin levels could be a strategy for the treatment of some metabolic diseases associated with dysregulation of immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741300>Food-borne patulin toxicity is related to gut barrier disruption and can be prevented by docosahexaenoic  and probiotic supplementation.</a></h2><p>Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin widely found in fruits and vegetables. Several reviews and studies have hypothesized that in vivo PAT toxicity is related to gut barrier dysfunction, but evidence for this is not substantial. The goal of the present study was to further demonstrate the role of the gut barrier in food-borne PAT toxicity. In vitro assays showed that PAT exposure induced significant cell death, inhibited the mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins and increased gut permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers. An acute PAT exposure animal trial reported for the first time an association between PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and  in mice. Sub-chronic PAT exposure also inhibited the expression of ZO-1 in the gut and induced both intestinal and systematic inflammation in mice. Dietary supplements with previously reported protective effects on the gut barrier, such as docosahexaenoic  and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, were able to recover the PAT-induced gut barrier dysfunction and significantly alleviate PAT toxicity in vivo. Another L. plantarum strain, CCFM11, with poor gut barrier modulation ability, failed to exhibit identical protective effects against PAT toxicity to L. plantarum CCFM8610. Our results indicated that PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and bacterial translocation may be another toxic mechanism of PAT besides its inherent cytotoxicity. Gut barrier protection may be considered an important target for the prevention of PAT toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500907>Alterations in gut microbial function following liver transplant.</a></h2><p>Liver transplantation (LT) improves daily function and ameliorates gut microbial composition. However, the effect of LT on microbial functionality, which can be related to overall patient benefit, is unclear and could affect the post-LT course. The aims were to determine the effect of LT on gut microbial functionality focusing on , bile  (BA), ammonia metabolism, and lipidomics. We enrolled outpatient patients with cirrhosis on the LT list and followed them until 6 months after LT. Microbiota composition (Shannon diversity and individual taxa) and function analysis (serum endotoxin, urinary metabolomics and serum lipidomics, and stool BA profile) and cognitive tests were performed at both visits. We enrolled 40 patients (age, 56 ± 7 years; mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, 22.6). They received LT 6 ± 3 months after enrollment and were re-evaluated 7 ± 3 months after LT with a stable course. A significant improvement in cognition with increase in microbial diversity, increase in autochthonous and decrease in potentially pathogenic taxa, and reduced  were seen after LT compared with baseline. Stool BAs increased significantly after LT, and there was evidence of greater bacterial action (higher secondary, oxo and iso-BAs) after LT although the levels of conjugated BAs remained similar. There was a reduced serum ammonia and corresponding rise in urinary phenylacetylglutamine after LT. There was an increase in urinary trimethylamine-N-oxide, which was correlated with specific changes in serum lipids related to cell membrane products. The ultimate post-LT lipidomic profile appeared beneficial compared with the profile before LT. In conclusion, LT improves gut microbiota diversity and dysbiosis, which is accompanied by favorable changes in gut microbial functionality corresponding to BAs, ammonia, , lipidomic, and metabolomic profiles.

An LPS-induced  mouse model was used to confirm the anti-inflammatory activity of SSa in vivo. The primary mouse macrophages were used to investigate the molecular mechanism and targets of SSa in vitro. In vivo, the results showed that SSa improved survival during lethal . In vitro, our results showed that SSa dose-dependently inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-β-and RANTES in LPS-stimulated primary mouse macrophages. Western blot analysis showed that SSa suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB and IRF3 activation. Furthermore, SSa disrupted the formation of lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and inhibited TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts. Moreover, SSa activated LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1. Silencing LXRα abrogated the effect of SSa. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of SSa is associated with activating LXRα dependent cholesterol efflux pathway which result in disrupting lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and reducing translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts, thereby attenuating LPS mediated inflammatory response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27671340>Effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation in resuscitation fluids on renal microcirculatory oxygenation, inflammation, and function in a rat model of .</a></h2><p>Modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress appears to limit sepsis-induced damage in experimental models. The kidney is one of the most sensitive organs to injury during septic shock. In this study, we evaluated the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration in conjunction with fluid resuscitation on renal oxygenation and function. We hypothesized that reducing inflammation would improve the microcirculatory oxygenation in the kidney and limit the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI).Rats were randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (1) control group, (2) control + NAC, (3) endotoxemic shock with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) without fluids, (4) LPS + fluid resuscitation, and (5) LPS + fluid resuscitation + NAC (150 mg/kg/h). Fluid resuscitation was initiated at 120 min and maintained at fixed volume for 2 h with hydroxyethyl starch (HES 130/0.4) dissolved in acetate-balanced Ringer's solution (Volulyte) with or without supplementation with NAC (150 mg/kg/h). Oxygen tension in the renal cortex (CμPO2), outer medulla (MμPO2), and renal vein was measured using phosphorimetry. Biomarkers of renal injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed in kidney tissues.Fluid resuscitation significantly improved the systemic and renal macrohemodynamic parameters after LPS. However, the addition of NAC further improved cortical renal oxygenation, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption (p < 0.05). NAC supplementation dampened the accumulation of NGAL or L-FABP, hyaluronic , and nitric oxide in kidney tissue (p < 0.01).The addition of NAC to fluid resuscitation may improve renal oxygenation and attenuate microvascular dysfunction and AKI. Decreases in renal NO and hyaluronic  levels may be involved in this beneficial effect.

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of clinically relevant combinations of antiplatelet therapy on the immune response in experimental  in humans in vivo. Forty healthy subjects were randomised to seven days of placebo, placebo with ASA, ticagrelor and ASA, or clopidogrel and ASA treatment. Systemic inflammation was elicited at day seven by intravenous administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin. ASA treatment profoundly augmented the plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but did not affect anti-inflammatory cytokines. Addition of either P2Y antagonist to ASA did not affect any of the circulating cytokines, except for an attenuation of the ASA-induced increase in TNFα by ticagrelor. Systemic inflammation increased plasma adenosine, without differences between groups, and although P2Y inhibition impaired platelet reactivity, there was no correlation with cytokine responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266575>A dietary intervention with functional foods reduces metabolic  and attenuates biochemical abnormalities by modifying faecal microbiota in people with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>To study the effects of a functional food-based dietary intervention on faecal microbiota and biochemical parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study included 81 patients with T2D divided into two 3-month treatment groups: one following a reduced-energy diet with a dietary portfolio (DP) comprising high-fibre, polyphenol-rich and vegetable-protein functional foods; the other taking a placebo (P). The primary outcome was the effect of the DP on faecal microbiota. Secondary endpoints were biochemical parameters, lipopolysaccharide, branched-chain amino , trimethylamine N-oxide, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA) and free fatty  (FFAs).Patients with T2D exhibited intestinal dysbiosis characterized by an increase in Prevotella copri. Dietary intervention with functional foods significantly modified faecal microbiota compared with P by increasing alpha diversity and modifying the abundance of specific bacteria, independently of antidiabetic drugs. There was a decrease in P. copri and increases in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila, two bacterial species known to have anti-inflammatory effects. The DP group also exhibited significant reductions in areas under the curve for glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, FFAs, HbA (P< 0.05), triglycerides and CRP, and an increase in antioxidant activity (P< 0.01) vs. the P group.Long-term adherence to a high-fibre, polyphenol-enriched and vegetable-protein-based diet provides benefits for the composition of faecal microbiota, and may offer potential therapies for improvement of glycaemic control, dyslipidaemia and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). Obeticholic (30mg/(kg·d)) and/or a combination of antibiotics were administered orally by gavage to mice for 12 weeks. Gut microbiota profiles were established through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The effects of obeticholic  on liver inflammation, the gut barrier, , gut microbiome and composition of the bile  were also investigated.  Obeticholic  treatment can significantly improve obesity, circulation metabolism disorders, liver inflammation and fibrosis, and intestinal barrier damage caused by HFD. Removal of normal commensal bacteria can weaken the effect of obeticholic . The gut microbial structure was changed, and abundance of Blautia was increased significantly after treated with obeticholic . After obeticholic  treatment, the concentration of taurine-bound bile  caused by HFD was reduced in the liver.

Ten horses received aspirin orally in the morning with one loading dose of 4.7-5 mg/kg and maintenance doses of 1-1.3 mg/kg daily the following 4 days. Aggregometries (COLtest, ASPItest, ADPtest) and serum salicylic  were measured. ASPItest showed significant difference in inhibition at 24 and 48 hr (p < .05) and 96 hr (p < .01). Significant change for ADPtest and COLtest couldn't be detected. Serum salicylic  concentrations were significantly (p < .01) increased at 6 and 12 hr. Despite this, three horses failed any inhibitory effect of platelet function, suspecting an aspirin resistance. Regarding the other seven horses platelet aggregation induced by ASPItest was reduced between 37% and 100% from baseline at 6 and 12 hr and between 0 and 98% during the next 4 days. Correlations of serum concentration of salicylic  and aggregometries couldn't be detected.

We studied innate immune responses in  mice, emulating human loss of the gene encoding production of Neu5Gc, a major cell surface sialic . CMP--acetylneuraminic  hydroxylase () loss occurred ∼2-3 million years ago, after the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, perhaps contributing to speciation of the genus  mice manifested a decreased survival in  following bacterial LPS injection. Macrophages from  mice secreted more inflammatory cytokines with LPS stimulation and showed more phagocytic activity. Macrophages and whole blood from  mice also killed bacteria more effectively. Metabolic reintroduction of Neu5Gc into  macrophages suppressed these differences.  mice also showed enhanced bacterial clearance during sublethal lung infection. Although monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from humans and chimpanzees exhibited marginal differences in LPS responses, human monocyte-derived macrophages killed  and ingested  BioParticles better. Metabolic reintroduction of Neu5Gc into human macrophages suppressed these differences. Although multiple mechanisms are likely involved, one cause is altered expression of C/EBPβ, a transcription factor affecting macrophage function.

The relations of ALA and LA intakes with T2D risk were modified by BMI, with significant associations restricted to obese/overweight subjects. Among them, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) comparing extreme quartiles of intakes were 0.55 (0.32-0.93) in men and 0.53 (0.34-0.85) in women for ALA, while 0.71 (0.41-1.16) in men and 0.56 (0.36-0.89) in women for LA.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential link between glucose control, intestinal permeability, diet and intestinal microbiota in patients with T2D. Thirty-two males with well-controlled T2D and 30 age-matched male controls without diabetes were enrolled in a case-control study. Metabolic parameters, inflammatory markers, , and intestinal microbiota in individuals subdivided into high (HP) and normal (LP) colonic permeability groups, were the main outcomes. In T2D, the HP group had significantly higher fasting glucose (P = 0.034) and plasma nonesterified fatty  levels (P = 0.049) compared with the LP group. Increased colonic permeability was also linked with altered abundances of selected microbial taxa. The microbiota of both T2D and control HP groups was enriched with Enterobacteriales. In conclusion, high intestinal permeability was associated with poorer fasting glucose control in T2D patients and changes in some microbial taxa in both T2D patients and nondiabetic controls. Therefore, enrichment in the gram-negative order Enterobacteriales may characterize impaired colonic permeability prior to/independently from a disruption in glucose tolerance.© 2018 The Authors.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that central GABAergic neurotransmission mediates the detrimental inflammatory, hemodynamic, and cardiac autonomic actions of . The effects of drugs that block GABA receptors or interfere with GABA uptake or degradation on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and HR variability (HRV) responses elicited by i.v. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were assessed in conscious rats. The hypotensive effect of LPS (10 mg/kg) was blunted after intracisternal (i.c.) administration of bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) or saclofen (GABAB receptor antagonist). By contrast, the concomitant LPS-evoked tachycardia and decreases in time domain and frequency domain indices of HRV (measures of cardiac autonomic control) were abolished upon treatment with bicuculline but not saclofen. Increases in serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) caused by LPS disappeared in the presence of bicuculline or saclofen, whereas LPS-evoked increases in serum nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) were counteracted by bicuculline only. None of the  effects was altered in rats treated with i.c. tiagabine (GABA reuptake inhibitor) or vigabatrin (GABA transaminase inhibitor).

This is of particular concern in light of the attractiveness of developing SCFA-mediated therapies and considering that SCFAs work as inhibitors of histone deacetylases which are known to interfere with host defenses. Here we show that propionate, one of the main SCFAs, dampens the response of innate immune cells to microbial stimulation, inhibiting cytokine and NO production by mouse or human monocytes/macrophages, splenocytes, whole blood and, less efficiently, dendritic cells. In proof of concept studies, propionate neither improved nor worsened morbidity and mortality parameters in models of  and infections induced by gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Candida albicans. Moreover, propionate did not impair the efficacy of passive immunization and natural immunization. Therefore, propionate has no significant impact on host susceptibility to infections and the establishment of protective anti-bacterial responses. These data support the safety of propionate-based therapies, either via direct supplementation or via the diet/microbiota, to treat non-infectious inflammation-related disorders, without increasing the risk of infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680087>Effect and Mechanism of Portal Blood Stasis Removal on Intestinal  and Hepatic Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.</a></h2><p>We used a rabbit model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion in situ to observe the change of portal venous endotoxin level before reperfusion, and the effect of portal blood stasis removal on intestinal  and hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. The purpose was to find an ideal method for portal blood stasis removal and provide the experimental proof for clinical application of hepatectomy.To investigate the effect of portal blood stasis removal on intestinal  and hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, a rabbit hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury model was established and treated with removal of portal blood stasis before the portal blood circulation was resumed. Serum endotoxin content, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hyaluronic  (HA), and content of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in liver tissue were examined respectively.In portal blood stasis the level of serum endotoxin significantly decreased with each 2.5 mL blood removal (P < .01), subsequently reaching a minima at the 7.5 mL blood removal (P > .05). Removing portal blood stasis ameliorated  and hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury as shown by ALT, HA, MDA, SOD, TNF-α, IL-6, and activation of NF-κB compared to no removal. The first 5 mL portal blood stasis contains high volume of endotoxin which may be responsible for hepatic reperfusion injury.Removal of portal blood stasis before the resume of splanchnic circulation may ameliorate intestinal  and hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

High-fat diets have been implicated in reduced gut microbiota richness, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and several changes at family, genus and species levels. Saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA) and conjugated linolenic fatty  share important pathways of immune system activation/inhibition with gut microbes, modulating obesogenic and proinflammatory profiles. Mechanisms that link dietary fat, gut microbiota and obesity are mediated by increased intestinal permeability, systemic , and the activity of the endocannabinoid system. Although the probiotic therapy could be a complementary strategy to improve gut microbiota composition, it did not show permanent effects to treat fat-induced dysbiosis. Based upon evidence to date, we believe that high-fat diets and SFA consumption should be avoided, and MUFA and omega-3 PUFA intake should be encouraged in order to regulate gut microbiota and inflammation, promoting body weight/fat control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28937612>Houttuynia cordata Facilitates Metformin on Ameliorating Insulin Resistance Associated with Gut Microbiota Alteration in OLETF Rats.</a></h2><p>Metformin and  are representative anti-diabetic therapeutics in western and oriental medicine, respectively. The current study examined the synergistic anti-diabetic effect of  extraction (HCE) and metformin combination in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR. Combining HCE + metformin resulted in significantly ameliorated glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT))-the same as metformin alone. Particularly, results of the insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that combining HCE + metformin dramatically improved insulin sensitivity as compared to metformin treatment alone. Both fecal and serum endotoxin, as well as cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)) were significantly ameliorated by HCE + metformin compared to metformin alone. Meanwhile, the activation of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) by metformin was distinctly enhanced by HCE. Both of HCE and metformin evidently changed the gut microbiota composition, causing the alteration of bacterial metabolite, like short-chain fatty . , together with metformin, exerts intensive sensibilization to insulin; the corresponding mechanisms are associated with alleviation of  via regulation of gut microbiota, particularly , , and Gram-negative bacterium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486221>Endogenous HS resists mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal glands via ATP5A1 S-sulfhydration in male mice.</a></h2><p>In a previous study, we showed that endogenous hydrogen sulfide (HS) plays a key role in the maintenance of intact adrenal cortex function via the protection of mitochondrial function during endoxemia. We further investigated whether mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is involved in HS protection of adrenal function. LPS treatment resulted in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal glands of male mice, and these effects were prevented by the HS donor GYY4137. In the model of Y1 cells, the LPS-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and blunt response to ACTH were rescued by GYY4137. The HS-generating enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) knockout heterozygous (CBS) mice showed mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal gland and adrenal insufficiency. GYY4137 treatment restored adrenal function and eliminated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Maleimide assay combined with mass spectrometry analysis showed that a number of proteins in mitochondria were S-sulfhydrated in the adrenal gland. ATP5A1 was further confirmed as S-sulfhydrated using a modified biotin switch assay. The level of S-sulfhydrated ATP5A1 was decreased in the adrenal gland of endotoxemic and CBS mice, which was restored by GYY4137. ATP5A1 was identified as sulfhydrated at cysteine 244 by HS. Overexpression of the cysteine 244 mutant ATP5A1 in Y1 cells resulted in a loss of LPS-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and GYY4137 restoration of LPS-induced hyporesponsiveness to ACTH. Collectively, the present study revealed that decreased HS generation leads to mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the adrenal cortex and a blunt response to ACTH. S-sulfhydration of ATP5A1 at cysteine 244 is an important molecular mechanism by which HS maintains mitochondrial function and steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic , defined as a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of bacterial endotoxin, has been proposed as a cause of inflammation during metabolic dysfunction. As the largest source of endotoxins in the human body, the GI microbiota represents a crucial area for research on strategies for reducing . Diets high in saturated fat and low in fiber contribute to metabolic  through several mechanisms, including changes in the GI microbiome and bacterial fermentation end products, intestinal physiology and barrier function, and enterohepatic circulation of bile . Thus, the Mediterranean diet pattern, rich in unsaturated fats and fiber, may be one dietary strategy to reduce metabolic . Preclinical studies have demonstrated the differential effects of dietary saturated and unsaturated fats on the microbiota and metabolic health, but human studies are lacking. The role of dietary fiber and the GI microbiome in metabolic  is underinvestigated. Clinical research on the effects of different types of dietary fat and fiber on the GI microbiota and GI and systemic inflammation is necessary to determine efficacious dietary strategies for reducing metabolic , inflammation, and subsequent metabolic disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28484247>Total fecal microbiota transplantation alleviates high-fat diet-induced steatohepatitis in mice via beneficial regulation of gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an epidemic metabolic disease with limited therapeutic strategies. Cumulative data support the pivotal role of gut microbiota in NASH. Here, we investigated the hypothesis regarding whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in attenuating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatohepatitis in mice. Mice were randomized into control, HFD and HFD + FMT groups. After an 8-week HFD, FMT treatment was initiated and carried out for 8 weeks. The gut microbiota structure, butyrate concentrations of the cecal content, liver pathology and intrahepatic lipid and cytokines were examined. Our results showed that after FMT, the gut microbiota disturbance was corrected in HFD-fed mice with elevated abundances of the beneficial bacteria Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillus. FMT also increased butyrate concentrations of the cecal content and the intestinal tight junction protein ZO-1, resulting in relief of endotoxima in HFD-fed mice. Steatohepatitis was alleviated after FMT, as indicated by a significant decrease in intrahepatic lipid accumulation (reduced Oli-red staining, decreased intrahepatic triglyceride and cholesterol), intrahepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the NAS score. Accordingly, intrahepatic IFN-γ and IL-17 were decreased, but Foxp3, IL-4 and IL-22 were increased after FMT intervention. These data indicate that FMT attenuated HFD-induced steatohepatitis in mice via a beneficial effect on the gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247356>Current and future pharmacological therapies for NAFLD/NASH.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and there is no approved pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of vitamin E and pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD. GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH, and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects. Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways. The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation. Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate, elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor axis [obeticholic ; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues. A second target is oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This class of drug includes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is intestinal microbiomes and metabolic . Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124, TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine-cysteine motif chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and galectin 3 antagonist. Among a variety of medications in development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1 inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH. Within the next few years, the availability of therapeutic options for NASH will hopefully curb the rising trend of NASH-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26621502>Anti-inflammatory effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside on polyphosphate-mediated vascular inflammatory responses.</a></h2><p>Recent results indicate that polyphosphate (polyP) released by human endothelial cells can function as a pro-inflammatory mediator. Cyclopia subternata is a medicinal plant commonly used in traditional medicine to relieve pain in biological processes. This study was undertaken to investigate whether two structurally related active compounds found in C. subternata, namely vicenin-2 and scolymoside, can modulate polyP-mediated inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in mice.The anti-inflammatory activities of vicenin-2 and scolymoside were determined by measuring permeability, leukocytes adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in polyP-activated HUVECs and mice. In addition, the beneficial effects of vicenin-2 and scolymoside on survival rate in polyP-injected mice were determined.We found that vicenin-2 and scolymoside inhibits polyP-mediated barrier disruption, the expressions of cell adhesion molecules, and leukocyte to HUVEC adhesion/migration. Interestingly, polyP-induced NF-κB activation and the productions of TNF-α and IL-6 were inhibited by vicenin-2 and scolymoside in HUVECs. These anti-inflammatory functions of vicenin-2 and scolymoside were confirmed in polyP-injected mice.These results suggest that vicenin-2 and scolymoside have therapeutic potential for various systemic inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26652711>Responses in whole-body amino  kinetics to an acute, sub-clinical endotoxin challenge in lambs.</a></h2><p>Some effects of parasitism,  or sepsis can be mitigated by provision of extra protein. Supplemented protein may encompass a metabolic requirement for specific amino  (AA). The current study investigates a method to identify and quantify the amounts of AA required during inflammation induced by an endotoxin challenge. One of each pair of six twin sheep was infused in the jugular vein for 20 h with either saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 ng/kg body weight per min) from Escherichia coli. Between 12 and 20 h a mixture of stable isotope-labelled AA was infused to measure irreversible loss rates. From 16 to 20 h all sheep were supplemented with a mixture of unlabelled AA infused intravenously. Blood samples were taken before the start of infusions, and then continuously over intervals between 14 and 20 h. At 20 h the sheep were euthanised, and liver and kidney samples were taken for measurement of serine-threonine dehydratase (SDH) activity. LPS infusion decreased plasma concentrations of most AA (P<0·05; P<0·10 for leucine and tryptophan), except for phenylalanine (which increased P=0·022) and tyrosine. On the basis of the incremental response to the supplemental AA, arginine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, lysine (tendency only), glycine, methionine, proline, serine and threonine were important in the metabolic response to the . The AA infusion between 16 and 20 h restored the plasma concentrations in the LPS-treated sheep for the majority of AA, except for glutamine, isoleucine, methionine, serine and valine. LPS treatment increased (P<0·02) SDH activity in both liver and kidney. The approach allows quantification of key AA required during challenge situations.</p></html>
