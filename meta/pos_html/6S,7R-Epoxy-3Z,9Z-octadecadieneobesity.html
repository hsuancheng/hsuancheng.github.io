Finnish adults aged 30-75 years from a sub-sample of population-based Health 2011 Study used a hip-worn tri-axial accelerometer (Hookie AM20, Traxmeet, Ltd, Espoo, Finland) for seven days. Those 1405 participants (57% women) who used accelerometer at least four days, minimum of 10 hours/day, were included. SB and standing were analysed in  epochs using validated algorithm. Daily total time, daily number and accumulated time from bouts (30s-5min,30s-10min,30s-15min,30s 30min,>5min,>10min,>15min, >30min) as well as daily number of sit-to-stand transitions were determined. Waist circumference (cm) was measured in standardized way. Participants' mean age was 52 years (SD 12.2). Mean waist circumference was 97cm (SD 12.3) in men and 87cm (SD 12.7) in women. According to multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, sit-to-stand transitions [standardised regression coefficient (β)= -0.14, 95%CI -0.20 to -0.09], standing bouts of 30s-5min (β= -0.21, 95%CI -0.26 to -0.15) and number of 30s-30min SB bouts (β=0.12, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.17) were most strongly associated with waist circumference. Besides assessing total SB time, future studies should assess also different bout lengths of SB and sit-to-stand transitions and standing times should be assessed separately.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711144>A dimeric urea of the bisabolene sesquiterpene from the Okinawan marine sponge Axinyssa sp. inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells.</a></h1><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays an important role as a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin signaling pathways. Therefore, this enzyme is regarded as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and . Our screening program for PTP1B inhibitors led to the isolation of four sesquiterpenes and sterol: N,N'-bis[(6R,7S)-7-amino-7,8-dihydro-α-bisabolen-7-yl]urea (1), (6R,7S)-7-amino-7,8-dihydro-α-bisabolene (2), (1R,,7S,10S)-10-isothiocyanato-4-amorphene (3), axinisothiocyanate J (4), and axinysterol (5) from the marine sponge Axinyssa sp. collected at Iriomote Island. Of these, compound 1 was the most potent inhibitor of PTP1B activity (IC50=1.9μM) without cytotoxicity at 50μM in two human cancer cell lines, hepatoma Huh-7 and bladder carcinoma EJ-1 cells. Compound 1 also moderately enhanced the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation levels of Akt in Huh-7 cells. Therefore, compound 1 has potential as a new type of anti-diabetic drug candidate possessing PTP1B inhibitory activity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Acid exposure time, number of refluxes, baseline impedance, post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and both automated and manual bolus clearance time were calculated. Patients were sub-grouped into pH/impedance positive (abnormal acid exposure and/or number of refluxes) and pH/impedance negative (normal acid exposure and number of refluxes), the former further subdivided on the basis of abnormal/normal acid exposure time (pH+/-) and abnormal/normal number of refluxes (impedance+/-).Poor correlation (r=0.35) between automated and manual bolus clearance time was found. Manual bolus clearance time progressively decreased from pH+/impedance+ (42.), pH+/impedance- (27.1s), pH-/impedance+ (17.8s) to pH-/impedance- (10.8s). There was an inverse correlation between manual bolus clearance time and both baseline impedance and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index, and a direct correlation between manual bolus clearance and acid exposure time. A manual bolus clearance time value of 14.8s had an accuracy of 93% to differentiate pH/impedance positive from pH/impedance negative patients.When manually measured, bolus clearance time reflects reflux severity, confirming the pathophysiological relevance of oesophageal clearance in reflux disease.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

We recently reported novel pyridine-2(1H)-ones as aliphatic amine-free MCHR1 antagonists that structurally featured an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based bicyclic motif. To investigate imidazopyridine variants with lower basicity and less potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), we designed pyridine-2(1H)-ones bearing various less basic bicyclic motifs. Among these, a lead compound 6a bearing a 1H-benzimidazole motif showed comparable binding affinity to MCHR1 to the corresponding imidazopyridine derivative 1. Optimization of 6a afforded a series of potent thiophene derivatives (6q-u); however, most of these were found to cause time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP3A4. As bioactivation of thiophenes to form sulfoxide or epoxide species was considered to be a major cause of CYP3A4 TDI, we introduced electron withdrawing groups on the thiophene and found that a CF3 group on the ring or a Cl adjacent to the sulfur atom helped prevent CYP3A4 TDI. Consequently, 4-[(5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)methoxy]-1-(2-cyclopropyl-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-6-yl)pyridin-2(1H)-one () was identified as a potent MCHR1 antagonist without the risk of CYP3A4 TDI, which exhibited a promising safety profile including low CYP3A4 inhibition and exerted significant antiobesity effects in diet-induced obese F344 rats.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients underwent complete blinded evaluation before and after the rehabilitation program, including testing for cardiopulmonary exercise, maximal isometric voluntary contraction, endothelial function and body composition.After 4 weeks of training (16 sessions), the groups did not differ in body composition, anthropometric characteristics, or endothelial function. With HML, peak power output (P=0.035), maximal heart rate (P<0.01) and gain of force measured in the chest press position (P<0.02) were greater after versus before training.Both protocols appeared to be well tolerated, safe and feasible for these CHD patients. A training protocol involving  phases of isometric contractions with 10s of passive recovery on an HML device could be safely implemented in rehabilitation programs for patients with CHD and improve functional outcomes.Copyright © 2016.

The main symptoms of CHF were edema in 54.5% of cases, dyspnea in 77% of cases, ascites was detected in only 2 patients, an enlarged liver in 7 patients. Abdominal  was detected in 53 patients. Quality of life was assessed by the SF‑36 questionnaire, the level of salt intake was assessed by the Charlton: SaltScreener questionnaire. Results. On average, the time of occurrence of the bendopnea was 22.5±9.3 seconds, the minimum was 5 seconds. The absence of the eﬀect of abdominal  on the risk of bendopnea (relative risk 1.18 [0.76; 1.83]) was revealed. According to the SF‑36 questionnaire, a decrease in physical health indicators (median 31.3 points [20.7; 42.3]) and psychological health (average score 43.2±21.7) was found. In patients with bendopnea, QOL was reduced due to both physical and mental health, unlike patients without bendopnea: physical functioning (Physical Functioning - PF) 24.8±16.1 against 47±28.9 points, p=0.001 ; role‑based functioning due to physical condition (Role‑Physical Functioning - RP), 0 [0; 25] vs. 37.5 [0; 100] points, p=0.008; general health (General Health - GH) 29.9±15.8 against 50±14.2 points, p=0.0005, social functioning (Social Functioning - SF) 56 ± 38 against 78.9 ± 17.8 points ; p = 0.004. Multidimensional regression analysis revealed the relationship between the time of occurrence of the symptom bendopnea and the level of salt intake, physical and psychological activity (r2=0.25; p&lt;0.009). The time of onset of the symptom of bendopnea in patients with CHF decompensation was significantly longer (18.9±8.7 vs. 26.2±8.5 seconds, p=0.003). The presence of diseases such as hypertension, COPD, IHD, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease did not significantly aﬀect QOL (p&gt; 0.05), while the presence of bronchial asthma or chronic kidney disease significantly reduced QOL of patients (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion. The presence of the symptom bendopnea significantly reduces the quality of life of patients with CHF with preserved LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29227756>Erratum.</a></h1><p>Vall EA, Kibbe DL, Greene C, Smith KS, O'Connor JC.

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores, range of motion (ROM), and complications were assessed. Forty-nine patients were classified into the following groups: normal (BMI <24.9 kg/m), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m), class I obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2), class II obese (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m), and class III morbid obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m).A total of 245 patients (134 women, 111 men; average age, 64 ± 8 years) were evaluated at an average follow-up of 48 ± 18 months. TSA was performed in 122 patients (50%), RTSA was performed in 103 (42%), and HA was performed in 20 (8%). No significant difference was found among the 5 BMI groups in arthroplasty type (P = .108) or in complications, including reoperations (P = .27). All groups had significant postoperative improvements in PROs and ROM (P < .001 for both). There were no significant differences among the BMI groups in postoperative ROM or PROs.This study demonstrates that patients undergoing TSA, RTSA, and HA can expect good functional outcomes, with improvements in pain, function and outcome scores, irrespective of BMI.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 169 Kuwaiti female adolescents attending both private and public schools spanning the six governorates in the State of Kuwait in order to explore female adolescents' self-image, body dissatisfaction, type of school (private versus public), TV viewing, and computer games and their relationship to body mass index.  Approximately half the students classified as obese perceived their body image to lie in the normal range. Females in the obese category were the most dissatisfied with their body image, followed by those in the overweight category. Eating behavior, level of physical activity, school type, television viewing, computer/video usage, and desired BMI were not significantly associated with level of .

Plasma FFA levels were determined at rest, immediately after a 10 min warm-up, and immediately at the end of SCE. The anaerobic and aerobic contributions (%) were measured via repeated SCE bouts. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index.The FFA concentrations measured immediately after SCE were higher in the OB group than in the OW and NW (p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively) groups. Moreover, the anaerobic contributions to SCE were significantly lower in obese adolescents (p<0.01) and decreased significantly during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th repetitions. The FFA levels were significantly associated with the HOMA-IR index and aerobic contribution among adolescent boys (r=0.83 and r=0.91, respectively, p<0.01).In contrast to the NW and OW groups, there is an increase in lipid mobilization and sift to aerobic energy metabolism during SCE in the OB group.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27679341> and the Likelihood of a Minimally Invasive Procedure Among Surgeons With and Without Advanced Surgical Training.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166345>Prepectoral Immediate Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction with Anterior AlloDerm Coverage.</a></h1><p>Staged subpectoral expander-implant breast reconstruction is widely performed. Disruption of the pectoralis major origin and the frequent occurrence of animation deformity and functional discomfort associated with subpectoral reconstruction remain ongoing concerns. Prepectoral single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction resolves many of these issues. In this study, the authors explored the rationale for prepectoral single-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with anterior AlloDerm coverage as an alternative to the staged approach.Seventy-three breasts in 50 patients were reconstructed using a single-stage direct-to-implant prepectoral approach with total anterior AlloDerm coverage during a 24-month period. The decision to proceed with single-stage reconstruction was predicated upon the adequacy of mastectomy skin flap blood flow based on indocyanine green fluorescence perfusion assessment. The patients were followed up for a maximum of 32 months.Ninety-seven percent of patients achieved complete healing within 8 weeks. There were 2 implant losses (2.7%) due to infection. Major seroma rate requiring repeated aspiration and drain insertion was 1.2%. There were no full-thickness skin losses. Capsular contracture was 0% in nonradiated patients. There were no cases of animation deformity. The authors were unable to establish significant correlation between complications and any of the usually stated risk factors, such as smoking, , and large mastectomy weights, presumably due to the rigorous application of intraoperative skin perfusion assessment.Single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction using a prepectoral approach appears to be a safe and effective means of breast reconstruction in many patients, assuming adequate skin perfusion is present.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29166343>Prepectoral Breast Reconstruction in Challenging Patients.</a></h1><p>Implant-based reconstructions continue to remain on the forefront of breast reconstruction as the prepectoral approach gains popularity.
