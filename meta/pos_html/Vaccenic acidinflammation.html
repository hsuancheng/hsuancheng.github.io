Differences in the DI among various phenotypes of abnormal adiposity have not been studied. Abnormal accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue occurs in rare adipose disorders (RADs) including Dercum's disease (DD), multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), and familial multiple lipomatosis (FML). Examining the DI in subcutaneous fat of people with DD, MSL and FML may provide information on adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism in these disorders. The aims of this pilot study were: 1) to determine if differences in adipose tissue DIs are present among RADs, and 2) to determine if the DIs correlate to clinical or biochemical parameters.Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from human participants with DD (n = 6), MSL (n = 5), FML (n = 8) and obese Controls (n = 6). Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The DIs (palmitoleic/palmitic, oleic/stearic, vaccenic/stearic ratios) were calculated from the gas chromatogram peak intensities. SCD1 gene expression was determined. Spearman's correlations between the DIs and available clinical or biochemical data were performed.In DD subjects, the vaccenic/stearic index was lower (p < 0.05) in comparison to Controls. Percent of total of the saturated fatty acid myristic acid was higher in DD compared with Controls and FML. Percent of monounsaturated  in DD trended lower when compared with Controls, and was decreased in comparison to FML. In MSL, total percent of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower than in the Control group (p < 0.05). In the total cohort of subjects, the palmitoleic/palmitic and oleic/stearic DIs positively correlated with age, BMI, and percent body fat.The positive associations between the DIs and measures of adiposity (BMI and percent body fat) support increased desaturase activity in obesity. The lower vaccenic/stearic DI in DD SAT compared with Controls suggests presence of other factors involved in fat accumulation in addition to lifestyle. Other mechanisms driving fat accumulation in DD such as inflammation or lymphatic dysfunction should be investigated.© 2012 Yee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18275620>Cis-9, trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid but not its precursor trans- attenuate inflammatory markers in the human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2.</a></h1><p>Trans- (TVA) is a natural trans fatty acid found in ruminant food produce. It is converted to the cis-9, trans-11 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid (c9, t11-CLA) by the action of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in tissue. c9, t11-CLA has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects and also affects lipid metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine if TVA is bioconverted to c9, t11-CLA in intestinal epithelial cells and to ascertain whether TVA has effects similar to c9, t11-CLA on markers of inflammation relevant to inflammatory bowel disease. The present study demonstrated that TVA treatment led to significant bioconversion into c9, t11-CLA in Caco-2 cells. Treatment with both TVA and c9, t11-CLA resulted in alteration of cellular fatty acid profile and SCD activity in the Caco-2 cell line. However, CLA, but not TVA, significantly modulated transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6 and production of IL-12 by these cells. Thus the present study established that TVA treatment can alter SCD desaturation indices and induce compositional changes in the fatty acid profile of the Caco-2 cell model of the human intestinal epithelium but this is not associated with functional effects on markers of the inflammatory response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18005183>Bovine milk fat enriched in conjugated linoleic and vaccenic acids attenuates allergic airway disease in mice.</a></h1><p>It has been argued that a reduction in the Western diet of anti-inflammatory unsaturated lipids, such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, has contributed to the increase in the frequency and severity of allergic diseases.We investigated whether feeding milk fat enriched in conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acids (VAs) ('enriched' milk fat), produced by supplementing the diet of pasture-fed cows with fish and sunflower oil, will prevent development of allergic airway responses.C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet containing soybean oil and diets supplemented with milk lipids. They were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) on days 14 and 28, and challenged intranasally with OVA on day 42. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissues and serum samples were collected 6 days after the intranasal challenge.Feeding of enriched milk fat led to marked suppression of airway  as evidenced by reductions in eosinophilia and lymphocytosis in the airways, compared with feeding of normal milk fat and control diet. Enriched milk fat significantly reduced circulating allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 levels, together with reductions in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of IL-5 and CCL11. Treatment significantly inhibited changes in the airway including airway epithelial cell hypertrophy, goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. The two major components of enriched milk fat, cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid and VA, inhibited airway  when fed together to mice, whereas alone they were not effective.Milk fat enriched in conjugated linoleic and VAs suppresses  and changes to the airways in an animal model of allergic airway disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500463>Association between plasma trans fatty acids concentrations and leucocyte telomere length in US adults.</a></h1><p>To assess the relationship between plasma trans-fatty acids (TFAs) levels and leucocyte telomere length (TL) in a US adult population sample.National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database was used for this study. Gas chromatography was used to separate derivatised fatty acids (Four major TFAs [palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), trans  (C18:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t,9t)]) which were then quatified using negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Data analyses used multivariable linear regressions, while accounting for the survey design.A total of 5446 eligible participants, with 46.8% (n = 2550) being men, were included. Their average age was 47.1 years for the total sample, and 47.8 and 46.5 years in men and women respectively (p = 0.085 for men vs. women difference). Concentrations of palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid decreased with increasing length of the telomere (p < 0.05). Univariable linear regressions revealed a significant negative association between levels of the palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid, , and linolelaidic acid with TL. However when models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, sub-clinical , body mass index, and smoking, only palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid remained significant (p < 0.05).TFAs levels and particularly palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acids, are likely negatively associated with telomere lenght. Future studies should explore the potential implications of these associations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243517>Inhibitory effect of the gut microbial linoleic acid metabolites, 10-oxo-trans- and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, on BV-2 microglial cell activation.</a></h1><p>10-oxo-trans- (KetoC) and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA) are long-chain fatty acids generated from linoleic acid by the gut lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. These fatty acids have been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity in the intestine. However, little is known about their effects in the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of these fatty acids on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes in mouse microglial cells (BV-2 cells). KetoC and HYA inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase in BV-2 cells. NO changes in these inhibitory effects were observed with AH7614, a G-protein coupled receptor 120 antagonist, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors antagonists, GW6471 and GW9662. In addition, KetoC and HYA did not inhibit translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-κB, or IκB degradation. Similarly, no effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation was observed. However, KetoC and HYA were found to inhibit ERK phosphorylation induced by LPS, suggesting that these fatty acids may exert their anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of ERK activation in microglial cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Data indicate that levels of FAs and their composition may influence myocardial function and inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether total levels and composition of FAs and FFAs in plasma are altered in clinical heart failure (HF) and whether any alterations in these parameters are correlated with the severity of HF.Plasma from 183 patients with stable HF was compared with plasma from 44 healthy control subjects.Our main findings are as follows: (i) patients with HF had decreased levels of several lipid parameters and increased levels of FFAs in plasma, compared with controls, which were significantly correlated with clinical disease severity. (ii) Patients with HF also had a decreased proportion in the plasma of several n-3 polyunsaturated FAs, an increased proportion of several monounsaturated FAs, and a decreased proportion of some readily oxidized long-chain saturated FAs. (iii) These changes in FA composition were significantly associated with functional class, impaired cardiac function (i.e., decreased cardiac index and increased plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels) and enhanced systemic inflammation (i.e., increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels). (iv) Low levels of C20:4n-3 (eicosatetraenoic acid) and in particular high levels of C18:1n-7 () were significantly associated with total mortality in this HF population.Our data demonstrate that patients with HF are characterized by a certain FA phenotype and may support a link between disturbed FA composition and the progression of HF.© 2011 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830448>Significant decrease of saturation index in erythrocytes membrane from subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</a></h1><p>The lipidomic profiling of erythrocyte membranes is expected to provide a peculiar scenario at molecular level of metabolic and nutritional pathways which may influence the lipid balance and the adaptation and homeostasis of the organism. Considering that lipid accumulation in the cell is important in promoting tissue , the purpose of this study is to analyze the fatty acid profile in red blood cell membranes of patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), in order to identify and validate membrane profiles possibly associated with the degree of hepatic damage.This work presents data obtained at baseline from 101 subjects that participated to a nutritional trial (registration number: ) enrolling consecutive subjects with NAFLD. Diagnosis of liver steatosis was performed by using vibration-controlled elastography implemented on FibroScan. Fatty acids, extracted from phospholipids of erythrocyte membranes, were quantified by gas chromatography method.The subjects with severe NAFLD showed a significant decrease of the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid (saturation index, SI) compared to controls, 1.281 ± 0.31 vs 1.5 ± 0.29, respectively. Low levels of SI in red blood cell membranes, inversely associated with degree of liver damage, suggest that an impairment of circulating cell membrane structure can reflect modifications that take place in the liver. Subjects with severe NAFLDalso showed higher levels of elongase 5 enzymatic activity, evaluated as  to palmitoleic acid ratio.Starting from these evidences, our findings show the importance of lipidomic approach in the diagnosis and the staging of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914200>Dietary supplementation of trans-11- reduces adipocyte size but neither aggravates nor attenuates obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities in fa/fa Zucker rats.</a></h1><p>Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) present in dairy and ruminant fat has beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome characteristics in humans and some rodent models. Production practices to increase the milk content of CLA are also substantially elevating trans-11- (VA). Questions are being raised whether VA has the same beneficial actions as CLA or has adverse biological effects similar to industrially produced trans-fatty acids. The present study examined the effects of dietary supplementation of either 0 or 1·5 % (w/w) VA for 8 weeks on lipidaemia, glycaemia, blood pressure, hepatic steatosis, adipocyte size and molecular markers of inflammation and insulin signalling in fa/fa Zucker rats. Dietary supplementation of VA did not alter feed intake, weight gain, blood pressure or organ:body weight (BW) ratios, except the epididymal fat:BW ratio which was lower in the VA group compared with the control group. The total liver lipid concentration as an indicator of hepatic steatosis was not different between the groups. Likewise, there were no changes in fasting lipidaemia, glycaemia or oral glucose tolerance. Although there were no physiological differences observed between the groups, animals supplemented with VA had smaller adipocytes (approximately 7 % smaller than the controls). The VA group also had higher adipophilin and IL-10 protein levels in epididymal adipose tissue (1·7- and 1·4-fold higher than the controls, respectively); however, there were no changes observed in critical nodes of insulin signalling. The present study provides evidence that supplementation with VA, a naturally produced trans-fat, has some positive effects on adipose tissue and did not exacerbate obesity-mediated metabolic abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065037>Plasma phospholipid concentration of cis-palmitoleic acid and risk of heart failure.</a></h1><p>Although plasma palmitoleic acid has been positively associated with blood pressure, inflammation, and insulin resistance, its association with heart failure has not been investigated. We assessed whether plasma phospholipid cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with heart failure risk.This ancillary study of the Physicians' Health Study used a risk set sampling method to select 788 matched pairs. For each case of incident heart failure, we randomly selected a control among subjects that were free of heart failure and alive at the time of index case diagnosis and matched on age, year of birth, race, and time of blood collection. Plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography. Heart failure was ascertained using annual follow-up questionnaire and validated in a subsample. In a multivariable conditional logistic regression, odds ratios (95% CI) for heart failure were 1.0 (ref), 1.06 (0.75-1.48), 1.20 (0.85-1.68), and 1.58 (1.11-2.25) across consecutive quartiles of cis-palmitoleic acid (P for trend 0.009). Each SD increase in plasma cis-palmitoleic acid was associated with 17% higher odds of heart failure (95% CI: 2% to 33%) in a multivariable model. In a secondary analysis, each SD increase of log-stearoyl-coA desaturase activity (16:1n-7/16:0 ratio) was positively associated with the risk of heart failure (odds ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.00 to 1.29]), whereas oleic acid and cis- concentrations were not related to heart failure risk.Our data showed a positive association between plasma phospholipid cis- palmitoleic acid and heart failure risk in male physicians.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21320382>Ruminant and industrial sources of trans-fat and cardiovascular and diabetic diseases.</a></h1><p>The various positional isomers of oleic acid (18 : 1Δ9c or 9c-18 : 1) may have distinct biological effects. Detrimental effects of consumption of industrial trans-fatty acids (TFA) (elaidic acid; 18 : 1Δ9t) from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on CVD risk factors are well documented. In addition, epidemiological data suggest that chronic consumption of industrial sources of TFA could alter insulin sensitivity and predispose for type 2 . However, intervention studies on this issue have remained inconclusive. Moreover, very little information is available on the effect of natural sources of TFA (; 18 : 1Δ11t) coming from dairy products and ruminant meat on the development of CVD and type 2 .

The effects of single trans-fatty acid isomers are largely unexplored. The present study examined the effects of a 6-week supplementation with two trans-18 : 1 isomers (trans-11 and trans-12) in human subjects on immune cells, several inflammatory and immunological biomarkers (for example, IL, TNFalpha, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, prostacyclin, phagocytic process). Following a 2-week adaptation period without supplements, the test group (n 12) received  (trans-11-18:1) and trans-12-18 : 1 in equal amounts (6.0 g/d) for 6 weeks. The control group (n 12) consumed an oil without trans-fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Samples were collected at the end of both periods. Trans-11- and trans-12-18 : 1 were significantly increased in cellular lipids. The endogenous synthesis of cis-9, trans-11-CLA from trans-11-18 : 1 was demonstrated via increased CLA in cellular lipids of the test group. Generally, trans-isomer supplementation did not affect either inflammatory biomarkers (for example, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha) or immune function (for example, phagocytosis) during the present study. The dietary supplementation of trans-11- and trans-12-18 : 1 (6 g/d) and their accumulation in leucocytes had no effects on biomarkers of  and immune function. However, because of the limited data on the safety of trans-fatty acid intake and effects of individual trans isomers on human health (for example, trans-9-18 : 1, trans-10-18 : 1) at present, it is prudent to reduce trans-fat intake in general.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360100>-Fatty acids promote proinflammatory signaling and cell death by stimulating the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 pathway.</a></h1><p>Food-borne -fatty acids (TFAs) are mainly produced as byproducts during food manufacture. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, including atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms in this disease etiology are largely unknown. Here we have shown that TFAs potentiate activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) induced by extracellular ATP, a damage-associated molecular pattern leaked from injured cells. Major food-associated TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), linoelaidic acid, and -, but not their corresponding  isomers, dramatically enhanced extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis, accompanied by elevated activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway in a macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7. Moreover, knocking out the ASK1-encoding gene abolished EA-mediated enhancement of apoptosis. We have reported previously that extracellular ATP induces apoptosis through the ASK1-p38 pathway activated by reactive oxygen species generated downstream of the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X). However, here we show that EA did not increase ATP-induced reactive oxygen species generation but, rather, augmented the effects of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-dependent ASK1 activation. These results demonstrate that TFAs promote extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis by targeting ASK1 and indicate novel TFA-associated pathways leading to inflammatory signal transduction and cell death that underlie the pathogenesis and progression of TFA-induced atherosclerosis. Our study thus provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of and proposes potential therapeutic targets for these TFA-related disorders.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518914>Elovl6 regulates mechanical damage-induced keratinocyte death and skin .</a></h1><p>Mechanical damage on the skin not only affects barrier function but also induces various immune responses, which trigger or exacerbate skin .

A detailed molecular characterisation of VLDL triacylglycerols (TAG) was also performed using the novel ozone-induced dissociation method, which allowed us to distinguish  (C18:1 n-7) from oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) in specific TAG species.Lipid class composition was very similar in VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic type 2 diabetic and control participants. By contrast, dyslipidaemia was associated with significant changes in both lipid classes (e.g. increased diacylglycerols) and lipid species (e.g. increased C16:1 and C20:3 in phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester and increased C16:0 [palmitic acid] and  in TAG). Levels of palmitic acid in VLDL and LDL TAG correlated with insulin resistance, and VLDL TAG enriched in palmitic acid promoted increased secretion of proinflammatory mediators from human smooth muscle cells.We showed that dyslipidaemia is associated with major changes in both lipid class and lipid species composition in VLDL and LDL from women with type 2 . In addition, we identified specific molecular lipid species that both correlate with clinical variables and are proinflammatory.

Industrial TFA elaidic acid (EA) was also investigated and compared with rTFA. Inflammatory prostaglandins (PG) and F-isoprostanes (F-isoP) isomers, markers of oxidative stress, were assessed in cell supernatants by LC-MS/MS. Both tVA and tPA, as well as whey protein hydrolysate, decreased TNFα-induced PG excretion. Combinations of rTFA and dairy protein compounds decreased  to a similar extent than rTFA alone. EA increased class VI F-isoP isomers, whereas tVA mostly raised class III isomers. In summary, rTFA decreased inflammatory markers and increased oxidative stress markers in endothelial cells.

Recently, we reported that this metabolite suppressed the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory genes in murine macrophages by disrupting mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt pathways. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of 13-HOA on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation in ears and skin, as well as tumor promotion in female ICR mice. Pretreatment with 13-HOA (1600 nmol) inhibited ear edema formation by 95% (P < 0.05) in an inflammation test and reduced tumor incidence and the number of tumors per mouse by 40 and 64% (P < 0.05 each), respectively, in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis model. Histological examinations revealed that it decreased epidermal thickness, the number of infiltrated leukocytes and cell proliferation index. Furthermore, 13-HOA (8-40 muM) suppressed TPA-induced anchorage-independent growth of JB6 mouse epidermal cells by 70-100%, whereas LA was virtually inactive. 13-HOA (40 muM) inhibited TPA-induced activator protein-1 transactivation but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 activation. Interestingly, 13-HOA (40 muM and 1600 nmol in JB6 cells and mouse skin, respectively) induced expression of programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a novel tumor suppressor protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a food factor that is able to induce Pdcd4 expression. Collectively, our results indicate that 13-HOA may be a novel anti-inflammatory and antitumor chemopreventive agent with a unique mode of action.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891736> suppresses intestinal inflammation by increasing anandamide and related N-acylethanolamines in the JCR:LA-cp rat.</a></h1><p> (VA), the predominant ruminant-derivedtransfat in the food chain, ameliorates hyperlipidemia, yet mechanisms remain elusive. We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354893>Long-Chain Fatty Acids and Inflammatory Markers Coaccumulate in the Skeletal Muscle of Sarcopenic Old Rats.</a></h1><p>Obesity and  are reportedly associated with the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, which is characterized by age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass. Intramuscular fat deposits have been found to compromise muscle integrity; however, the relevant fat compounds and their roles as mediators of muscular  are not known. The aim of this study was to identify potential correlations between  markers and lipid compounds that accumulate in the quadriceps muscle of previously described Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model for high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced muscle loss. Six-month-old SD rats were continuously fed a control (CD) or HFD until the age of 21 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a significant decline in muscle cross-sectional area in male SD rats as a result of HFD, but not in female rats. Here, we developed a new procedure to quantitatively identify and classify the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in rats' quadriceps muscles from our former study using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fatty acid analysis revealed accumulation of octadecadienoic (linoleic acid), octadecanoic (stearic acid), and octadecenoic () acids exclusively in the quadriceps muscles of male rats. The designated fatty acids were mainly incorporated into triacylglycerols (TAGs) or free fatty acids (FFAs), and their proportions were significantly elevated by consumption of a HFD. Furthermore, the number of resident immune cells and the levels of the chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-2 were significantly increased in quadriceps muscle tissue of HFD-fed male, but not female rats. Together, HFD-induced muscle loss in aged male SD rats is associated with greater deposits of long-chain fatty acid esters and increased levels of the inflammatory markers RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-2 in skeletal muscle tissue. This trend is further reinforced by long-term consumption of a HFD, which may provoke synergistic crosstalk between long-chain fatty acids and inflammatory pathways in sarcopenic muscle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22254015>Vaccenic and elaidic acid modify plasma and splenocyte membrane phospholipids and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production in obese insulin resistant JCR: LA-cp rats.</a></h1><p>This study assessed the long-term effects of dietary  (VA) and elaidic acid (EA) on plasma and splenocyte phospholipid (PL) composition and related changes in inflammation and splenocyte phenotypes and cytokine responses in obese/insulin resistant JCR:LA-cp rats. Relative to lean control (Ctl), obese Ctl rats had higher serum haptoglobin and impaired T-cell-stimulated cytokine responses. VA and EA diets improved T-cell-stimulated cytokine production; but, only VA normalized serum haptoglobin. However, EA- and VA-fed rats had enhanced LPS-stimulated cytokine responses. The changes elicited by VA were likely due changes in essential fatty acid composition in PL; whereas EA-induced changes may due to direct incorporation into membrane PL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30263268>Physiological concentrations of -11 18:1  suppress pro-inflammatory markers under acute inflammation in isolated ICR mice splenocytes.</a></h1><p>Direct influences of dietary -11 18:1  (TVA) at physiological concentrations of 50-200 μM were evaluated for cell growth, cytotoxic activity, and cytokine production in leukocytes isolated from the mouse spleen. TVA supplementation for 24 h induced growth of splenocytes at concentrations of 50-200 μM, except for 100 μM. The cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-10 of splenocytes were stimulated by 100 μM TVA.

Accordingly, the objective of this paper was to determine the in vitro effects of TFA on inflammatory gene expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated for 24 h with either trans- (tVA), trans-palmitoleic acid (tPA) or elaidic acid (EA) at concentrations of 5-150 µM, or with a mixture of tVA and tPA (150/50 µM). All TFA were highly incorporated into cell membranes, as determined by gas chromatography, representing 15-20% of total fatty acids in HUVEC and 3-8% in HepG2 cells. Incorporation of EA, a common industrial TFA, increased the ratio of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), a key enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism. Ruminant TFA, including tVA, tPA and the mixture of tVA and tPA, significantly reduced the TNF-α-induced gene expression of TNF, VCAM-1 and SOD2 in HUVEC, as well as TNF and IL-8 in HepG2 cells. EA also decreased inflammatory gene expression in HUVEC, but not in HepG2 cells. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ did not influence the effects of TFA on gene expression. Overall, physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of TFA, especially tVA and tPA, prevented inflammatory gene expression in vitro. This effect is independent of PPAR-γ activation and may be due to an alteration of fatty acid metabolism in cell membranes caused by the high incorporation of TFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527759>Prospective association of fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of type 2 diabetes: the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h1><p>Experimental evidence suggests that hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) affects insulin homeostasis via synthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Few prospective studies have used fatty acid biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic acid (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty acid biomarkers [myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic acid showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic acid (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic acid (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic acid was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses,  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty acid biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were associated with higher diabetes risk, and  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

Despite VA being the predominant trans monoene in ruminant-derived lipids, very little is known about its nutritional bioactivity, particularly in conditions of chronic metabolic disorders, including obesity, , and/or dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of VA to improve dyslipidemia,  sensitivity, or inflammatory status in obese and -resistant JCR:LA-cp rats. The obese rats and age-matched lean littermates were fed a control diet or a control diet supplemented with 1.5% (wt:wt) VA for a period of 3 wk. The incorporation of VA and subsequent conversion to CLA in triglyceride was measured in adipose tissue. Glucose and  metabolism were assessed via a conscious adapted meal tolerance test procedure. Plasma lipids as well as serum inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured by commercially available assays. VA supplementation did not result in any observable adverse health effects in either lean or obese JCR:LA-cp rats. After 3 wk of feeding, body weight, food intake, and glucose/ metabolism did not differ between VA-supplemented and control groups. The incorporation of VA and CLA into adipose triglycerides in obese rats fed VA increased by 1.5-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively, compared with obese rats fed the control diet. The most striking effect was a 40% decrease (P < 0.05) in fasting triglyceride concentrations in VA-treated obese rats relative to obese controls. Serum Il-10 concentration was decreased by VA, regardless of genotype (P < 0.05). In conclusion, short-term dietary supplementation of 1.5% VA did not result in any detrimental metabolic effects in JCR:LA-cp rats. In contrast, dietary VA had substantial hypo-triglyceridemic effects, suggesting a new bioactivity of this fatty acid that is typically found in ruminant-derived food products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687443>The anti-inflammatory effect of 10-oxo-trans- (KetoC) on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>There is rapidly developing interest into the role of several anti-inflammatory agents to resolve inflammation in periodontal disease. A bioactive polyunsaturated fatty acid, 10-oxo-trans- (KetoC), is known to have various beneficial physiological effects; however, the effect of KetoC on inflammation remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of KetoC on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, and explored the intracellular mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with or without KetoC, and then stimulated with or without P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific antagonists for G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)40 and GPR120 were used to clarify the receptor for KetoC. The intracellular mechanism was investigated using western blotting analysis to separate nuclear and cytosolic NF-κB p65 protein.KetoC (5 μmol/L) was not toxic to RAW 264.7 cells, and significantly reduced the expression of TNFα and IL-6 mRNA and protein, and IL-1β mRNA. No protein production of IL-1β was observed. Additionally, when bound to GPR120, KetoC trended to downregulate nuclear NF-κB p65 protein levels. However, the antagonist for GPR40 failed to diminish the action of KetoC.KetoC suppressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β via NF-κB p65, by binding to its receptor GPR120. KetoC is a promising candidate in future studies as a bioactive anti-inflammatory agent in treating periodontal disease.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, trans fatty acids are not a homogeneous group of molecules, and less is known about the health effects of consuming diets containing  (VA), a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid, the predominant trans isomer in ruminant fats. The presence of VA in industrial trans fats has raised the question of whether VA produces the same adverse health effects as industrially produced trans fats. VA is also the major trans fat in ruminant fats, and questions have arisen as to whether consuming this trans fat has the same effects on health risk. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the published studies in humans, animals, and cell lines. Epidemiological, but not rodent, studies suggest that VA intake or serum concentrations may be associated with increased cancer risk. However, epidemiological, clinical, and rodent studies to date have not demonstrated a relationship with heart or cardiovascular disease, , or inflammation. VA is the only known dietary precursor of c9,t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), but recent data suggest that consumption of this trans fat may impart health benefits beyond those associated with CLA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367652>9c11tCLA modulates 11t18:1 and 9t18:1 induced inflammations differently in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Endothelial  is recognized as the initial stage of a multistep process leading to coronary heart disease (CHD). Recently, the different effects of industrial trans fatty acids (elaidic acid, 9t18:1) and ruminant trans fatty acids (, 11t18:1) on CHD have been reported in epidemiological and animal studies, however, the mechanism was not fully studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism by which 9t18:1 and 11t18:1 affect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) . We found that 9c11t-CLA modulated the  of HUVECs induced by 9t18:1 and 11t18:1. Fatty acid composition, pro-inflammatory factors, phosphorylation of MAPKs, and the TLR4 level in HUVECs altered by 11t18:1 induction, collectively suggest that the bio-conversion of 11t18:1 to 9c11tCLA might be the cause why 11t18:1 and 9t18:1 have distinct influences on endothelial injuries. It was concluded that it is biosynthesis of 9c11t CLA from11t18:1, and the modulation of TLR4-MAPK pathway by 9c11t CLA, which at least partially account for the slight effect of 11t18:1 on endothelial .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22750019>-mediated reduction in cytokine production is independent of c9,t11-CLA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</a></h1><p>The ruminant trans fatty acid  (tVA) favorably alters markers of inflammation. However, it is not yet clear whether these effects are attributed to its endogenous partial conversion to c9,t11-CLA, which is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We compared the cytokine reducing potential of tVA to c9,t11-CLA in human T-helper (Th) cells as a main source of cytokine production during inflammation. Secondly, we assessed whether a bioconversion of tVA to c9,t11-CLA via stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) encoded activity takes place in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to relate the outcomes of intracellular cytokine measurement to the degree of conversion. TVA reduced the percentage of both IL-2 and TNF-α expressing Th cells significantly, but to a lesser extent compared to c9,t11-CLA, as determined by flow cytometry after alloreactive stimulation of PBMC. Pre-treatment with the selective PPARγ antagonist T0070907 largely re-established the IL-2 and TNF-α positive Th cell population in both tVA and c9,t11-CLA treated cultures. Interestingly, while the portion of tVA dose-dependently increased within the cellular lipid fraction, the initially marginal amount of c9,t11-CLA remained unaltered. However, SCD mRNA although abundantly expressed in PBMC was not regulated by tVA. Conclusively, these results suggest that the cytokine reducing effect of tVA in human T cells is independent of c9,t11-CLA, since no bioconversion occurred. Moreover, the data provide evidence that tVA mechanistically acts in a manner similar to c9,t11-CLA.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This ancillary study of the Physicians' Health Study was designed to examine whether red blood cell (RBC) membrane cis-palmitoleic acid and cis--2 fatty acids that can be synthesized endogenously-are associated with CHD risk. We used a risk set sampling method to prospectively select 1,000 incident CHD events and 1,000 matched controls. RBC membrane fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography. The CHD cases were ascertained using an annual follow-up questionnaire and validated by an End Point Committee through a review of the medical records. In a conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for demographics, anthropometric, lifestyle factors, and co-morbidity, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CHD were 1.0 (referent), 1.29 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.75), 1.08 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.51), 1.25 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.75), and 1.48 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.14) across consecutive quintiles of RBC membrane cis-palmitoleic acid (p for trend = 0.041). The odds ratio associated with each SD higher RBC membrane cis-palmitoleic acid level was 1.19 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.35) in a multivariate-adjusted model. Finally, RBC membrane cis- was inversely associated with CHD risk (odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91, per SD increase). In conclusion, our data showed a positive association between RBC membrane cis-palmitoleic acid and CHD risk in male physicians.

The sum of n-6 EMFAs, without linoleic acid (LA), was positively associated with concentrations of CRP and IL-1Ra (r partial=0.139 and r partial=0.115, P<0.001). These associations were especially strong among lean men (waist circumference <94 cm; r partial=0.156 and r partial=0.189, P<0.001).

Palmitoleic acid (POA) has been described as an anti-inflammatory FA. However, its effects on ECs are underexplored. This study compares the effects of POA with those of palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) on EC inflammatory responses.EAHy926 cells (EC lineage) are exposed to PA, OA, or POA, and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Associated with the FA's own incorporation, PA induces a twofold increase in arachidonic acid, while POA increases the amount of cis-. PA, but not OA, enhances the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to TNF-α. In contrast, POA decreases production of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 compared to PA. TNF-α increases surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression previously decreased by POA. TNF-α stimulation increases the expression of NFκB, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, MCP-1, and IL-6 genes and reduces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α gene. PA enhances the expression of MCP-1, IL-6, and COX-2 genes, while POA downregulates these genes, decreases expression of NFκB, and upregulates PPAR-α gene expression.POA has anti-inflammatory effects on ECs stimulated with TNF-α and may counter endothelial dysfunction.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Cereals, including corn and rice, have biological potentials to synthesize self-protective chemicals in order to repel the invasion of microorganisms and insects. We examined the suppressive effects of several fatty acids, including a new class of lipoxygenase metabolites of linoleic acid (LA) found in cereals, namely (+/-)-9-hydroxy-trans,cis-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HOA from rice), (+/-)-13-hydroxy-10-oxo-trans- (13-HOA from corn), and (+/-)-10-oxo-trans-11-octadecen-13-olide (10-ODO from corn), on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Each metabolite exhibited a suppressive activity toward nitrite production than LA, octadeca-9Z,11E-dienoic acid (a conjugated LA), and 13S-hydroxyoctadeca-9Z,11E-dienoic acid. LPS-up-regulated mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukin-6, and toll-like receptor-2, -4, and -9 was also markedly attenuated without affecting the expression levels of several constitutive genes, including COX-1, as detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions. In addition, Western blot and luciferase reporter assay results showed that 13-HOA suppressed the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinasel/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinasel/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase), and Akt (Ser473), and also attenuated degradation of inhibitor kappaB, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), and the transcriptional activities of NFkappaB and activator protein-1, both of which have essential roles in the transcription of numerous proinflammatory and oncogenic genes. In contrast, 13-HOA did not serve as a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. Based on our findings, we propose that 13-HOA, a functionally novel LA-derivative, is a promising agent for anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive strategies with reasonable molecular mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h1><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether  induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of  did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of  and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p></html>
