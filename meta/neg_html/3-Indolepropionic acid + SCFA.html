Another fragment,  (1F1-N), predicted by AutoDock calculations and confirmed in a novel inhibition of nucleation crystallization assay, exploits the same interactions in the flap site in two crystal structures. Both 1F1 and 1F1-N bind to the closed form of apo-PR and to pepstatin:PR. In solution, 1F1 and 1F1-N raise the Tm of apo-PR by 3.5-5 °C as assayed by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and show equivalent low-micromolar binding constants to both apo-PR and pepstatin:PR, assayed by backscattering interferometry (BSI). The observed signal intensities in BSI are greater for each fragment upon binding to apo-PR than to pepstatin-bound PR, consistent with greater conformational change in the former binding event. Together, these data indicate that fragment binding in the flap site favors a closed conformation of HIV PR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9485457>Analysis of the pH- and ligand-induced spectral transitions of tryptophanase: activation of the coenzyme at the early steps of the catalytic cycle.</a></h2><p>Tryptophanase has an absorption maximum at 338 nm at high pH and 422 nm at low pH. The 422-nm absorption species has been considered to be the catalytically competent ketoenamine form of the Schiff base of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with a lysine residue. The 338-nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence band at 390 nm and not around 500 nm, indicating that the 338-nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than an enolimine form of the Schiff base which has been suggested previously. To explore the mechanism of the enzyme that can exert its catalytic ability at high pH where most of its coenzyme exists as the catalytically incompetent aldamine structure, the reaction of tryptophanase with 3-indolepropionate, a substrate analogue that stops the reaction at the step of the Michaelis complex, was studied at various pH values and analogue concentrations. Kinetic analysis was done based on a scheme involving eight forms of the enzyme, i.e., the liganded and unliganded forms of the ketoenamine, the substituted aldamine structures, and their protonated and deprotonated forms. Kinetic parameters were obtained for each interconversion step. The results showed that the binding of 3-indolepropionate to tryptophanase shifts the equilibrium from the substituted aldamine to the ketoenamine structure over the entire pH region studied. This implies that in the reaction of tryptophanase with tryptophan at high pH, where the enzyme shows maximum activity, the binding of the substrate to the enzyme converts the inactive aldamine form of the coenzyme to the active ketoenamine form. Mechanisms for the activation process, in which a nucleophile is expelled from the aldamine either by steric hindrance of the nucleophile with the ligand or by the negative charge of the ligand alpha-carboxylate group that stabilizes the aldimine structure, were discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17217290>Multicomponent synthesis of 3-indolepropionic .</a></h2><p>A three-component one-pot procedure (3-MC) was developed to assemble 3-indolepropionic  from commercially available materials.

Lipid peroxidation is involved in DNA damage, thus indirectly participating in the early steps of tumor initiation. Melatonin and structurally related indoles are effective in protecting against oxidative stress. The aim of the study was to compare the relative efficacies of melatonin, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and 5-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid (5HIAA) in altering basal and iron-induced lipid peroxidation in homogenates of hamster testes. To determine the effect of the indoles on the autoxidation of lipids, homogenates were incubated in the presence of each agent in concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mM. To study their effects on induced lipid peroxidation, homogenates were incubated with FeSO(4) (30 microM + H(2)O(2) (0.1 mM) + each of the indoles in the same concentrations as above. The degree of lipid peroxidation was expressed as concentrations of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals (MDA + 4-HDA) per mg protein. The indoles decreased both basal and iron-related lipid peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Melatonin reduced basal MDA + 4-HDA levels when used at the concentrations of 0.25 mM or higher, and prevented iron-induced lipid peroxidation at concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mM. The lowest effective concentrations of NAS required to lower basal and iron-related lipid peroxidation were 0.05 mM and 0.25 mM, respectively. IPA, only when used in the highest concentrations of 2.5 mM or 5 mM inhibited basal lipid peroxidation levels and it was ineffective on the levels of MDA + 4-HDA due to iron damage. 5HIAA reduced basal lipid peroxidation when used at concentrations of 0.25 mM or higher, and it prevented iron-induced lipid peroxidation only at the highest applied concentration (5 mM). In conclusion, melatonin and related indoles at pharmacological concentrations protect against both the autoxidation of lipids as well as induced peroxidation of lipids in testes. In doing so, these agents would be expected to reduce testicular cancer that is initiated by products of lipid peroxidation.Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26840773>A Structure-Guided Switch in the Regioselectivity of a Tryptophan Halogenase.</a></h2><p>Flavin-dependent halogenases are potentially useful biocatalysts for the regioselective halogenation of aromatic compounds. Haloaromatic compounds can be utilised in the synthesis and biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of a tryptophan 6-halogenase (SttH), which enabled key residues that contribute to the regioselectivity in tryptophan halogenases to be identified. Structure-guided mutagenesis resulted in a triple mutant (L460F/P461E/P462T) that exhibited a complete switch in regioselectivity; with the substrate 3-indolepropionate 75 % 5-chlorination was observed with the mutant in comparison to 90 % 6-chlorination for the wild-type SttH. This is the first clear example of how regiocomplementary halogenases can be created from a single parent enzyme. The biocatalytic repertoire of SttH was also expanded to include a range of indolic and non-indolic substrates.© 2016 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, compounds that inhibit or even reverse Abeta aggregation might be useful for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. To identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a mass spectrometry-based screening assay was developed to identify and rank order compounds that inhibit the aggregation of Abeta. To carry out this assay, Abeta was incubated with a test compound at 37 degrees C for 20 h followed by ultrafiltration to separate the monomeric Abeta from its aggregates. Aliquots of the ultrafiltrate were analyzed for monomeric Abeta using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry based on the abundance the quadruply protonated molecule of Abeta at m/z 1083. The calibration curve for Abeta was linear with a correlation coefficient (r2) of >0.99 over the range of at least 11-110 microM. The limit of detection was 0.224 ng (5.18 nM, 10-microL injection), and the limit of quantitation was 0.747 ng (17.2 nM, 10-microL injection). Based on previous reports of compounds that either bind to Abeta or are useful in treating Alzheimer's disease, melatonin, methysticin, , and daunomycin were assayed and ranked in order of inhibition of Abeta aggregation. The most effective inhibitor of aggregation of Abeta protein was daunomycin followed in descending order by , melatonin, and then methysticin. These data suggest that this ultrafiltration LC-MS screening assay may be used to identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on the prevention of Abeta aggregation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389651>The role of water bridges in directing the conformational preferences of 3-indole-propionic acid and tryptamine.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17536782>Analytical method for beta-amyloid fibrils using CE-laser induced fluorescence and its application to screening for inhibitors of beta-amyloid protein aggregation.</a></h2><p>More than 20 million people are suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and the number of patients will dramatically increase with the arrival of an aging society unless preventive or curative medications are discovered. A fast and sensitive analytical method for beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates was developed by the combination of CE-laser induced fluorescence and the fluorescence reagent, thioflavine T. The developed method separates two different fibrils within 5 min. The first peak, which migrated at approximately 4 min, was supposed to be derived from a precursor of a fibril that migrated at approximately 3.5 min. The developed method was also applicable to the high-throughput screening of the Abeta aggregation inhibitors, which was expected to be an effective therapeutic agent candidate of Alzheimer's disease. Three compounds (daunomycin,  (3-IPA), melatonin) were used for the assay. The order of the antiaggregation activity of these compounds was daunomycin > 3-IPA > melatonin, which was the same as that of the reported one. These results suggest that this analytical method may be used to analyze the Abeta fibrils and identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18939870>Syntheses of IAA- and IPA-amino acid conjugates.</a></h2><p>Amino acid derivatives of IAA and IPA are prepared conveniently and efficiently by coupling of readily available 2a-b with diverse free amino  3a-g and (3c+3c') to give compounds 4a-j, (4c+4c') and (4h+4h') in 38-70% yields.

Plasma from Wistar rats at 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 weeks old were analyzed using GC/TOFMS. Multivariate data analysis was then used to process the metabonomic data which indicated excellent separation between different weeks and showed that the metabolic profiles of the samples changed with age, enabling age-related metabolic trajectories to be visualized. Decreased concentrations of citric acid, cis-aconitic acid, 9-(z)-hexadecenoic acid along with increased levels of hexanedioic acid, alpha-tocopherol, 3-indole propionic acid, etc contributed to the separation. Several major metabolic pathways were identified to be involved in metabolic regulation. This suggests that GC/TOFMS-based metabonomics is a powerful alternative approach to identifying potential biomarkers and investigating the physiological developments of aging and it is important to employ suitable age-match control group in metabonomic study of physiological monitoring, drug safety assessment, and disease diagnosis, etc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8654432>NMR studies of the mode of binding of corepressors and inducers to Escherichia coli trp repressor.</a></h2><p>The binding of the corepressors tryptophan and 5-methyltryptophan and of the inducers 3-indolepropionate, 3-indoleacrylate and 5-methylindole to the Escherichia coli trp repressor have been studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Identification of the resonances of the protons of bound ligands and their NOEs to protons of the protein (measured as transferred NOE) was greatly facilitated by the use of samples of the protein in which the hydrogens of all residues except alanine, isoleucine and threonine was replaced by deuterium. Chemical-shift changes of protein-backbone resonances and side-chain-amide resonances on ligand binding were measured with generally or selectively 15N-labelled protein. The patterns of changes in the chemical shifts of protein resonances and, particularly, ligand resonances distinguish the corepressors from the inducers, indicating, in agreement with earlier work, that corepressors and inducers bind to the protein in different ways. The NOEs observed for the bond ligands have been used to determine the position of the ligands in the crystallographically determined binding site, by means of a simulated-annealing molecular-dynamics protocol. The structures obtained show that the orientation in the binding site of the indole rings of tryptophan and 5-methyltryptophan and of 3-indolepropionate and 3-indoleacrylate differ by approximately 180 degrees in solution (in agreement with the crystallographic data for complexes of the trp repressor with tryptophan or with 3-indolepropionate). The value and limitations of calculating ligand positions based on transferred NOE are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21355879>Melatonin treatment restores mitochondrial function in Alzheimer's mice: a mitochondrial protective role of melatonin membrane receptor signaling.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is observed in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse models of familial AD. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, can prevent toxic aggregation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and, when taken long term, can protect against cognitive deficits in APP transgenic mice. To study the effects of melatonin on brain mitochondrial function in an AD model, APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated for 1 month with melatonin. Analysis of isolated brain mitochondria from mice indicated that melatonin treatment decreased mitochondrial Aβ levels by two- to fourfold in different brain regions. This was accompanied by a near complete restoration of mitochondrial respiratory rates, membrane potential, and ATP levels in isolated mitochondria from the hippocampus, cortex, or striatum. When isolated mitochondria from untreated young mice were given melatonin, a slight increase in respiratory rate was observed. No such effect was observed in mitochondria from aged mice. In APP-expressing neuroblastoma cells in culture, mitochondrial function was restored by melatonin or by the structurally related compounds indole-3-propionic acid or N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine. This restoration was partially blocked by melatonin receptor antagonists indicating melatonin receptor signaling is required for the full effect. Therefore, treatments that stimulate melatonin receptor signaling may be beneficial for restoring mitochondrial function in AD, and preservation of mitochondrial function may an important mechanism by which long term melatonin treatment delays cognitive dysfunction in AD mice.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16633585>On the energy landscapes of 3-indole acetic acid and 3-indole propionic acid.

Blood glucose, metabolic hormones and the white blood cell (WBC) composition were analysed.IPA (mean intake 27.3 mg/kg/day) significantly lowered fasting blood glucose level by 0.42 mM (95% CI 0.11-0.73).

This study evaluates a series of indoleamine analogs as alternate substrates of AANAT. 3-Indolepropylamine and 3-indolebutylamine were chemically synthesized and found to be processed by AANAT, although 20- and 60-fold less efficiently compared with the natural substrate serotonin, respectively. Racemic alpha-methyltryptamine and Nomega-methyltryptamine were also shown to be substrates for AANAT, again with reduced kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin. The enzyme did exhibit approximately 9:1 stereoselectivity for the R-enantiomer of alpha-methyltryptamine versus the S-enantiomer. By measuring the enzymatic rates versus increasing buffer microviscosity, it was demonstrated that diffusional release of product is most likely the principal rate-determining step for the enzymatic transformation of tryptamine (which has similar kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin). Analysis of kcat and kcat/Km versus pH for the poor substrate Nomega-methyltryptamine showed that an ionizable group on the enzyme with pKa approximately 7, required to be in its deprotonated form, may be important in catalysis. The alpha-methyltryptamine analog alpha-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by the enzyme, but served as a modest competitive inhibitor. Taken together with the pH-rate analysis, these results favor a model in which the serotonin substrate binds to the enzyme as the positively charged ammonium salt, and nucleophilicity of the amine is important in enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7661871>[Interaction of derivatives of 3-(indol-3-yl)propionic, nicotinic, and 1-nitroanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid with pyrimidine nucleosides and their 5'-amino-5'-deoxy analogs].</a></h2><p>The reaction of 5'-amino-2',5'-dideoxyuridine and 5'-amino-5'-deoxy-2',3'-O-ethoxymethyliden-6- azauridine with 3-(3-indolyl)propionic or 1-nitroanthraquinon-2-carboxylic  in THF in the presence of 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) resulted in the corresponding amide derivatives.
