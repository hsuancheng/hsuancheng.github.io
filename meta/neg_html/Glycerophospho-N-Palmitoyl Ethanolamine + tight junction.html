The fluid secretion rate is reduced upon replacement of Na+ in the bathing medium by Li+, K+ or choline. The inhibition depends on the nature of the substituting cation, and is largest with choline. Upon replacement, the substituent cation appears in the secreted fluid, and the Na+ concentration in the secreted fluid is decreased in a mirror-like fashion. When Na+ is replaced by Li+ or choline, the secretory Na+ concentration is decreased, although less than in the bathing medium, and the K+ concentration is increased. When Na+ is replaced by K+, the Na+ and the K+ concentration in the secreted fluid are approximately equal to their bathing medium concentrations. In the Li+ and choline medium, stimulation of the pancreas by carbachol or CCK-8 increases the fluid secretion rate. In addition, it increases the Li+ or choline concentration, and decreases the Na+ and K+ concentrations in the secreted fluid. In normal and K+ medium, stimulation causes only a slight increase in fluid secretion rate, with no change in the secretory Na+ concentration. In normal medium, stimulation leads to a decrease in the secretory K+ concentration. The effects of replacing Na+ appear to be the result of a direct inhibition of the active HCO3- transport underlying secretion, and an indirect inhibition related to the permeability of the pancreas for the various cations. The stimulants are likely to act by increasing the permeability of the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7535855>Role of F-actin in the activation of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport by forskolin and vasopressin in mouse kidney cultured thick ascending limb cells.</a></h2><p>The influence of microtubules and F-actin on Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport was investigated in cultured cells derived from outer-medullary thick ascending limb tubules microdissected from the mouse kidney. The cultured cells contained Tamm-Horsfall protein, produced cAMP in response to dD-arginine vasopressin (dD-AVP), isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2 and forskolin (FK), and exhibited an ouabain-resistant furosemide-sensitive (Or-Fs) component of 86Rb+ influx mediated by the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransporter. Both FK and dD-AVP stimulated the Or-Fs component of Rb+ influx. Neither agent altered the tubulin and cytokeratin networks nor the shape of the  using a specific anti-ZO-1 antibody. In contrast, they did induce a marked redistribution of F-actin to the periphery of the cells delineating the . Preincubation of the cells with nocodazole, to disrupt microtubules, did not alter the FK- or dD-AVP-elicited Or-Fs Rb+ influx. In contrast, phalloidin and NBD-phallicidin, which stabilize F-actin, markedly impaired the stimulation of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport by FK or dD-AVP, without affecting the Na(+)-K+ ATPase pumps and the rate constant of 36Cl- and 86Rb+ efflux. These results strongly suggested that cAMP-stimulated Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport is linked to F-actin in renal TAL cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358124>A2E-associated cell death and inflammation in retinal pigmented epithelial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is observed in retinal degenerative diseases including Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. Bis-retinoid N-retinyl-N-retinylidene  (A2E) is a major component of lipofuscin. A2E has been implicated in RPE atrophy and retinal inflammation; however, mice with A2E accumulation display only a mild retinal phenotype. In the current study, human iPSC-RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cells were generated from healthy individuals to examine effects of A2E in human RPE cells. hiPSC-RPE cells displayed RPE-specific features, which include expression of RPE-specific genes,  formation and ability to carry out phagocytosis. hiPSC-RPE cells demonstrated cell death and increased VEGF-A production in a time-dependent manner when they were cocultured with 10μM of A2E. PCR array analyses revealed upregulation of 26 and 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines upon A2E and HO exposure respectively, indicating that A2E and HO can cause inflammation in human retinas. Notably, identified gene profiles were different between A2E- and HO- treated hiPSC-RPE cells. A2E caused inflammatory changes observed in retinal degenerative diseases more closely as compared to HO. Collectively, these data obtained with hiPSC-RPE cells provide evidence that A2E plays an important role in pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

By confocal microscopy, perfusion of lucifer yellow through an arterial catheter, revealed a bright fluorescence in the basolateral spaces of acini, but not in the intercellular canaliculi. However, addition of isoproterenol on carbachol stimulation, induced lucifer yellow fluorescence in intercellular canaliculi. This finding indicates that isoproterenol is capable of opening the paracellular route. The  strands surrounding intercellular canaliculi were visualized using freeze replicas. Fixation was carried out both by vascular perfusion with Karnovsky's solution and by metal contact rapid freezing with liquid helium. In the chemically-fixed specimens, the strand particles of  formed 2-5 lines at the P-face along most of the apical portion at rest. With carbachol/isoproterenol stimulation, the strand particles rearranged with free ends and terminal loops. In the rapidly frozen specimens, the strand particles were arranged more irregularly even in the resting state. The meshwork of strands became more disheveled and interrupted during carbachol/ isoproterenol stimulation. The present findings led us to conclude that: 1) the beta-adrenergic agent, isoproterenol, can open the paracellular transport. 2) in the rapidly frozen specimen, the  strand particles are arranged roughly and become disheveled and interrupted during stimulation by carbachol/isoproterenol. These findings may be related to rearrangement of subcellular structures, especially of the actin filament network.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11484764>Alpha2-adrenoceptors inhibit antidiuretic hormone-stimulated Na+ absorption across  epithelia (Rana esculenta).</a></h2><p>In the present study we examined the effect of alpha-adrenergic regulation of active transepithelial Na+ absorption across the isolated frog skin epithelium. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation was achieved by addition of the adrenergic agonist noradrenaline in the presence of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation inhibited basal as well as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-stimulated Na+ transport. The ADH-induced increase in Na+ transport was accompanied by a membrane depolarisation due to an increase in the apical Na+ permeability. The subsequent application of noradrenaline inhibited the Na+ transport and repolarised the membrane potential, suggesting that alpha-adrenergic stimulation had reduced the apical Na+ permeability. The inhibition was abolished by the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine whereas it was insensitive to the alpha1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation had no effect on the cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). Incubation of the epithelium in the presence of ADH increased the cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) content, an increase which was abolished by alpha-adrenergic activation. The effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on cAMP production was abolished by the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. We conclude that the noradrenaline-induced inhibition of the ADH-stimulated Na+ absorption and cAMP content is mediated by activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors. The data further indicate that the principal cells of the epithelium do not express alpha1-adrenoceptors. The noradrenaline-induced inhibition of the ADH-stimulated Na+ transport was concentration dependent, with 0.24+/-0.03 microM eliciting a half-maximal response. This alpha2-adrenergic-mediated down-regulation of Na+ absorption is achieved at a concentration of noradrenaline which begins to activate the NaCl secretion via the skin glands. The alpha2-adrenoceptors therefore appear to have considerable physiological importance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2458860>In vivo microscopy of the cerebral microcirculation using neonatal allografts in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Studies were performed to characterize the morphology and vascular reactivity of the allografted cerebral microcirculation. Cerebral cortical tissue was allografted into the cheek pouch of the hamster so that cerebral parenchymal vessels could be studied. The vascular morphology was characterized by a large number of looping vessels. The ultrastructural examination indicated viable cerebral tissue containing typical vessels, that is, "" , not like those of the cheek pouch. Also, the microvasculature was impermeable to 150, 70, and 20 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans. Angiotensin II and norepinephrine caused constriction of the cerebral vessels whereas adenosine caused dilation.

Here we demonstrate that both mucosal and systemic immune responses can be elicited against a model HIV-1 CN54gp140 antigen when cation-complexed plasmid DNA vaccines are applied topically to the murine pulmonary mucosa as an immune priming strategy. Furthermore, using an influenza challenge model we show that a plasmid DNA vaccine complexed to a less toxic form of PEI called dPEI (a nearly fully hydrolysed linear PEI with 11% additional free protonatable nitrogen atoms) can provide significant protection against a respiratory challenge infection in mice. Furthermore, we show that dPEI polyplexes have the potential to transfect not only mucosal epithelium, but also to enter deeper into tissues through the modulation of  integrity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that less toxic forms of PEI can be effective delivery vehicles for plasmid DNAs to elicit cellular and humoral protective responses in vivo. Moreover, our observations suggest that these less toxic derivatives of PEI could be utilised for topical plasmid DNA vaccine delivery to human mucosal tissue surfaces, and that this application may permit dissemination of the immune responses through the linked mucosal network thus providing protective immunity at distal portals of pathogen entry.Copyright © 2013 The Authors.

Sprague-Dawley adult rats anesthetized with ketamine were given an intravenous bolus of either epinephrine (10 micrograms/kg), phenylephrine (100 micrograms/kg), isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg), or D,L-amphetamine (2 mg/kg). Tracers were injected simultaneously with test agents, and the animals killed 10 min later. Epinephrine raised MABP by 57 mm Hg, to a peak pressure of 160 mm Hg; and it increased the volume of distribution (Vd) of urea, mannitol, and 125I-bovine serum albumin in CSF by 1.5-, 2.7-, and 30-fold, respectively. There was enhanced uptake by lateral and fourth ventricle choroid plexuses, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla, and thalamus. Phenylephrine also elevated MABP to 160 mm Hg, but it increased permeation of tracers into CSF (and several brain regions) to a lesser extent than epinephrine, attributable to protective vasoconstriction associated with alpha-agonist activity. Ratio analysis of Vd data provides evidence that augmented permeation of nonelectrolyte tracers in acute hypertension occurs predominantly by diffusion rather than vesicular transport. It is postulated that elevated MABP distends the central cores of choroid plexus villi and cerebral capillaries, with resultant stretching and opening of  in both barrier systems; with less hindrance to diffusion, urea and mannitol are cleared at rates closer to free diffusion. Neither isoproterenol (decreased MABP by 40 mm Hg) nor amphetamine (did not alter MABP) significantly opened the choroid plexus or blood-brain barrier to tracers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572792>Supplemental feeding of phospholipid-enriched alkyl phospholipid from krill relieves spontaneous atopic dermatitis and strengthens skin intercellular lipid barriers in NC/Nga mice.</a></h2><p>Plasmalogen (Pls) is a glycerophospholipid derived from alkyl phospholipid (Alk) with antioxidant functions in vivo. The present study investigated the effects of ether phospholipids, such as Pls and Alk, on intercellular lipid barriers in the skin of NC/Nga mice, a model of atopic dermatitis (AD). NC/Nga mice fed Alk showed increased plasma levels of Alk and Pls. The AD-related changes in ceramide composition in the skin were abrogated by oral administration of Alk.

Up to 1.5 X 10(8) cells were obtained per trachea and showed up to 95% viability, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. When grown in culture, the cells formed monolayers after approximately 4 days. Electron microscopy of the monolayers revealed a polarized structure.

Monolayers grown on nucleopore filters showed resistances of 44-1,800 omega. cm2 and transepithelial potential differences of 0.1-7.6 mV. Short-circuit current (Isc) was increased by isoproterenol, prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha, and bradykinin. The loop diuretic, bumetanide, reduced Isc when added to the basolateral (serosal) side but had no effect from the apical (mucosal) side of the monolayers. Furosemide and MK-196 also inhibited Isc. Mucosal amiloride inhibited Isc. Serosal amiloride or mucosal ouabain had no effect on Isc.

Our previous studies have clearly demonstrated that these alterations can be restored to normal by supplementation with ferrous sulfate; however, neither brain nonheme iron level nor dopamine D2 receptor Bmax can be increased beyond control values even after long-term iron therapy. The possibility that iron deficiency can induce the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was examined. A 70 and 100% increase in brain uptake index (BUI) for L-glucose and insulin, respectively, were noted in iron-deficient rats. However, the BUI for valine was decreased by 40%, and those for L-norepinephrine and glycine were unchanged. In addition, it was demonstrated that in normal rats insulin is transported into the brain. The data show that iron deficiency selectively affects the integrity of the BBB for insulin, glucose, and valine transport. Whether the effect of iron deficiency on the BBB is at the level of the capillary endothelial cell  is not yet known. However, this study has shown that an important nutritional disorder (iron-deficiency anemia) has a profound effect on the BBB and brain function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20224237>Morphological evidence of paracellular transport in perfused rat submandibular glands.</a></h2><p>The morphological change of the paracellular route for fluid secretion is still a long-standing question. The purpose of this study was to visualize alterations in the cytoskeleton structure of  caused by carbachol (CCh) and isoproterenol (IPR) treatment of perfused rat submandibular glands (SMGs), using freeze-fracture (FF) replicas of rapidly frozen tissues. Isolated SMGs from male Wistar rats were perfused and stimulated with 1 microM CCh and IPR. Specimens were immediately rapidly frozen with liquid helium by metal contact. After cutting and deep etching, FF replicas were obtained by rotary shadowing and were examined by transmission electron microscopy. After CCh/IPR stimulation, the strand particles of TJs rearranged with free ends and terminal loops. In the vertical fracture surface, cytoskeletal filaments beneath the plasma membrane were arranged in a thicker layer than those of the gland without stimulation. Contraction of the submembranous actin cytoskeleton during exocytosis elicited by CCh/IPR may cause rearrangement of TJ strands due to direct interactions between the TJ membrane particles and actin filaments via the tiny bridging structures. The rearrangement and movement of TJ membrane particles involves reconstruction of the subluminal membranous actin filament network through the intermediary of interstitial molecules and may modulate increased paracellular permeability after CCh/IPR stimulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988287>Dietary choline regulates antibacterial activity, inflammatory response and barrier function in the gills of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).</a></h2><p>An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to determine the effects of graded levels of choline (197-1795 mg/kg) on antibacterial properties, inflammatory status and barrier function in the gills of grass carp. The results showed that optimal dietary choline supplementation significantly improved lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities, complement component 3 (C3) content, and the liver expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 and Hepcidin mRNA levels in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). In addition, appropriate dietary choline significantly decreased the oxidative damage, which might be partly due to increase copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and increased glutathione content in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Moreover, appropriate dietary choline significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor β1, Zonula occludens 1, Occludin, Claudin-b, c, 3 and 12, inhibitor of κBα, target of rapamycin, Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GR, GPx, GST and NF-E2-related factor 2 in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). Conversely, appropriate dietary choline significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 8, interferon γ, interleukin 1β, and related signaling factors, nuclear factor kappa B p65, IκB kinase β, IκB kinase γ, myosin light chain kinase and Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a) in the gills of fish (P < 0.05). However, choline did not have a significant effect on the mRNA levels of IκB kinase α, Claudin-15 and Keap1b in the gills of fish. Collectively, appropriate dietary choline levels improved gill antibacterial properties and relative gene expression levels of  proteins, and decreased inflammatory status, as well as up-regulated the mRNA levels of related signaling molecules in the gills of fish. Based on gill C3 content and AHR activity, the dietary choline requirements for young grass carp (266.5-787.1 g) were estimated to be 1191.0 and 1555.0 mg/kg diet, respectively.Copyright © 2016.

PAF has been reported to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via incompletely characterized mechanisms. We investigated the effect of PAF on rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC), a critical component of the BBB. PAF produced a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca concentration; the effect was prevented by the PAF receptor antagonist, WEB2086. The effect of PAF on cytosolic Ca was abolished in Ca-free saline or in the presence of L-type voltage-gated Ca channel inhibitor, nifedipine, indicating that Ca influx is critical for PAF-induced increase in cytosolic Ca. PAF produced RBMVEC depolarization; the effect was inhibited by WEB2086. In cells loaded with [(4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluoro-fluorescein)diacetate] (DAF-FM), a nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive fluorescent dye, PAF increased the NO level; the effect was prevented by WEB2086, nifedipine or by l-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Immunocytochemistry studies indicate that PAF reduced the immunostaining of ZO-1, a -associated protein, increased F-actin fibers, and produced intercellular gaps. PAF produced a decrease in RBMVEC monolayer electrical resistance assessed with Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS), indicative of a disruption of endothelial barrier function. In vivo studies indicate that PAF increased the BBB permeability, assessed with sodium fluorescein and Evans Blue methods, via PAF receptor-dependent mechanisms, consequent to Ca influx and increased NO levels. Our studies reveal that PAF alters the BBB permeability by multiple mechanisms, which may be relevant for central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2018 IBRO.

The neonatal luminal membrane is amplified with irregular folds, a possible adaptation to reduced cerebral blood flow rates. By 21 days the capillaries have resolved to a smooth-surfaced, adult-like appearance. Developmental alterations in the basement membrane, , capillary seams, Golgi, pinocytotic vesicles, and cytoplasmic thickness are observed. Two studies have addressed developmental modulations in BBB polarity; both indicate that brain-to-blood transport mechanisms that were inoperative in the early neonatal rat become functional in weanlings. Six of the seven major independent BBB nutrient transport systems that regulate plasma-to-brain uptake have been kinetically characterized in the newborn rabbit, and comparisons have been made in the weanling (28-day-old) rabbit. All of these saturable transport systems are operative at birth, which suggests that the immature rabbit has a mature BBB with respect to regulation of nutrients. Purine base permeability, affinity, and uptake velocities are virtually unchanged during postnatal development. Subtle alterations in amino acid and amine transport were suggested by the lower-affinity (high-capacity) transport mechanisms characterized in the newborn as compared to the 28-day-old BBB. Under conditions of elevated plasma levels (typical of the neonate), these higher-capacity mechanisms would facilitate a relative increase in metabolite influx to the developing brain. Significant differences in kinetics were also observed for the monocarboxylic acid and hexose transport systems in the absence of developmental changes in permeability times surface area products. A low-affinity, high-capacity monocarboxylic acid transport system operates at birth. It supplies the developing brain with increased quantities of ketone bodies, but is seen as a high-affinity, low-capacity mechanism in the 28-day-old rabbit. Concomitantly, the higher-affinity glucose carrier defined in newborn rabbits modulates, and by 28 days becomes a lower-affinity, high-capacity mechanism capable of delivering about 2 mumol X min-1 X g-1 of glucose to the (anesthetized) brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10591624>Analysis of  during neutrophil transendothelial migration.</a></h2><p>Intercellular  have long been considered the main sites through which adherent neutrophils (PMNs) penetrate the endothelium.  (TJs; zonula occludens) are the most apical component of the intercellular cleft and they form circumferential belt-like regions of intimate contact between adjacent endothelial cells. Whether PMN transmigration involves disruption of the TJ complex is unknown. We report here that endothelial TJs appear to remain intact during PMN adhesion and transmigration. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers, a commonly used model for studying leukocyte trafficking, were cultured in astrocyte-conditioned medium to enhance TJ expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis showed that activated PMN adhesion to resting monolayers or PMN migration across interleukin-1-treated monolayers does not result in widespread proteolytic loss of TJ proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and occludin) from endothelial borders. Ultrastructurally, TJs appear intact during and immediately following PMN transendothelial migration. Similarly, transendothelial electrical resistance is unaffected by PMN adhesion and migration. Previously, we showed that TJs are inherently discontinuous at tricellular corners where the borders of three endothelial cells meet and PMNs migrate preferentially at tricellular corners. Collectively, these results suggest that PMN migration at tricellular corners preserves the barrier properties of the endothelium and does not involve widespread disruption of endothelial TJs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1928346>Effects of vasopressor hormones and modulators of protein kinase C on glutathione efflux from perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>Vasopressor hormones alter efflux of glutathione (GSH) and increase permeability of  in perfused rat liver. Infusions of 10 nM angiotensin II, 10 microM phenylephrine, and 10 nM vasopressin significantly increased efflux of GSH into perfusate by 32-41% and decreased biliary efflux by 31-57%. Direct modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by 600 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), 5 microM 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), 5 microM sphingosine, or 10 nM staurosporine altered the pattern of efflux of GSH but not biliary oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG)-GSH ratios. Phorbol dibutyrate mimicked the vasopressor-mediated effects, increasing perfusate efflux by 31% and decreasing biliary efflux by 45%. Inhibitors of PKC caused qualitatively opposite responses, changing perfusate GSH by -37 to 18% and increasing biliary efflux by 22-161%. Whereas vasopressin increased penetration of [14C]sucrose into bile, modulation of PKC activity by PDB and H-7 did not affect the permeability of  to [14C]sucrose. Although pretreatment with H-7 blocked vasopressin-mediated changes in efflux of GSH, it did not prevent the increase in [14C]sucrose penetrance. We conclude that alterations in sinusoidal and biliary efflux of GSH can occur independent of changes in permeability of hepatocellular .

We have investigated the protective effect of salmeterol, a long-acting beta(2)-adrenergic agonist, on Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced alteration of the epithelial junctional barrier. We demonstrate in human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) that salmeterol induces a time-dependent increase in ZO-1 protein, although no significant change in ZO-1 transcripts was observed. When HAEC cultures were exposed to P. aeruginosa (PAO1) supernatants, apical expression of ZO-1 protein was maintained in salmeterol-pretreated HAEC cultures, whereas it disappeared after PAO1 exposure in cultures not pretreated with salmeterol. Western blot experiments showed that the 220-kD ZO-1 protein was decreased after PAO1 incubation but was still present in salmeterol-pretreated HAEC extracts. The functional activity of ZO-1 protein was monitored by measuring transepithelial resistance and analyzing the diffusion of a low molecular weight tracer through the intercellular spaces. After PAO1 incubation, the epithelial integrity of HAEC was impaired, as shown by a decrease in transepithelial resistance and increased paracellular permeability, but was not significantly altered after salmeterol preincubation. These results demonstrate that salmeterol may contribute to the protection of the airway epithelium barrier against bacterial virulence factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6117025>Somatostatin: regulation of secretion.</a></h2><p>Somatostatin is released in the blood, in synaptic clefts, and in the intercellular space in response to a variety of stimuli. In view of its multiple functions, various sites of synthesis and release, and rapid inactivation, as well as extremely low levels of somatostatin in the peripheral blood, somatostatin can hardly be considered to be a hormone whose target is reached via the general circulation. The target organs of cells may be located near the somatostatin-producing cells and can be reached via local circulation such as the hypophyseal portal system and the microportal circulation in the gut mucous membrane. Somatostatin released from the neurons acts as a hypophyseotropic hormone and a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. Furthermore, somatostatin may also act in a paracrine fashion by being released into the intercellular space. This space may sometimes be compartmentalized by  so that the action of the peptide is limited only to the adjacent cells. In this fashion, the pancreatic islet somatostatin influences nearby A- and B- cell activities. Gut D cells, prototypes of APUD or paraneuron cells, show considerable similarity to neurosecretory cells not only in biochemical processes but also morphologically. While the somatostatin neurons in the brain respond to dopaminergic and catecholaminergic agonists, D cells in the gut respond to chemical stimuli in the lumen by sensing them with microvilli. They release somatostatin into the blood stream, into the intercellular space, and into the gastric and intestinal lumen. Luminal somatostatin may affect other endocrine and nonendocrine cells in the mucous membrane of the gut.

Choline deficiency decreased intestinal lysozyme activity, C3 and IgM contents, increased acid phosphatase activity, downregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides [liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin], cytokines [interleukin (IL) 6a, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon γ2b (IFN-γ2b), IL-6b and transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) only in proximal intestine, IL-10 in mid and distal intestine], immune-related signaling molecules [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5)],  proteins (claudin 3b, claudin 3c, claudin 11 and occludin), and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 (p38) in proximal and distal intestine of juvenile Jian carp after A. hydrophila challenge. In contrast, choline deficiency upregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (LEAP-2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin), cytokines (IL-6b, IFN-γ2b and TGF-β2), immune-related signaling molecules (TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IκB, JAK3, STAT4 in three intestinal segments, and STAT6), claudin 11, and p38 in mid intestine of fish.

However, when isolating secreted product from conditioned medium (CM), after cell exposure to a trigger, it is better to remove FCS in the culture medium for identification of secreted products of interest. However, it is unknown whether defined medium adversely affects active efflux protein expression and  formation.Using different gastrointestinal cell lines chosen with different levels of efflux transporter expression, fully defined components, such as using transferrin, insulin, selenium and  without FCS or with a reduced percentage of FCS (2%) were tested as an optimal choice for cell growth. In addition to morphological characteristics, the expression of the ABC efflux transporters, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), ABCC2 (multidrug resistance associated protein 2), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and occludin was determined.The cells required a minimum of 2% FCS for expression of transporters. Fully defined medium with no serum adversely affected the expression of transporters, especially P-gp. An important characteristic of Caco-2 cells is its ability to form . Caco-2 did not form adequate  without 10% FCS added in the medium, as evidenced by low TEER values and reduced occluding immunohistochemistry.FCS is required for efflux protein expression and  generation. Nevertheless, it is possible to use 5 fold less FCS which assists with low molecular weight secretion isolation. Passage number also contributes significantly to the presence of these transporters.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

By using confocal microscopy and the fluid-phase fluorescent tracer technique, we visualized water secretion and estimated the routes of water transport across the acinar epithelia in rat parotid and submandibular glands. Confocal microscopy of whole glands perfused arterially with Lucifer yellow revealed a bright fluorescence at the basolateral space of acini. Luminal space was devoid of fluorescence, but revealed it after isoproterenol pretreatment, ductal infusion of fluorescent dextrans into the lumen, or tissue dissociation by collagenase. Under these conditions, stimulation of fluid secretion with carbachol caused a rapid decline of the luminal fluorescence intensity, indicating that the secreted water washed out the fluorescent probes in the acinar lumen. In the stimulated dissociated acini, the luminal fluorescence disappeared by 15 sec, but reappeared at 30-45 sec to maintain a low plateau level. By assuming that the  was 'paralyzed' by the collagenase digestion and that the paracellular fluid transport could not influence the dilution of Lucifer yellow, we estimated that the initial water secretion by CCh occurs via the transcellular pathway, while later than 30-45 sec the additional water permeates through the paracellular pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3476597>Morphological changes of intercellular  in the rat submandibular gland treated by long-term repeated administration of isoproterenol.</a></h2><p>Long-term repeated administration of isoproterenol (IPR) 2 mg/100 g bw, once daily for ten days, resulted in morphological changes in the intercellular  of rat submandibular glands, which were investigated by means of the freeze-fracture technique. A significantly increased number of -junctional strands was present. These junctional strands extended much deeper toward the basal membrane than those in normal acinar cells. The basal frontier strands that branched from the networks of  were elongated and had either free-endings or terminal loops, which were more frequently observed in the IPR-treated acinar cells than in untreated acinar cells. Some of the strands of  were connected to small gap . The diameters of gap  were not significantly different from those of control acinar cells. However, smooth areas devoid of particles were found intermingling with the usual packed particles in irregularly shaped small gap . There was no significant difference between the desmosomes of IPR-treated and untreated acinar cells, in terms of either morphology or distribution. These changes in junctional morphology in the IPR-treated acinar cells resemble those seen in salivary glands during development, and in some experimental conditions including tumorous changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9841516>Microvascular permeability and number of  are modulated by cAMP.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that increased endothelial cell adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) decreases microvascular permeability in vivo. The effects of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase type IV inhibition and adenylate cyclase activation on microvascular hydraulic conductivity (Lp) were investigated in intact individual capillaries and postcapillary venules in mesentery of pithed frogs (Rana pipiens). Treatment with rolipram (10 microM) and forskolin (5 microM) for 25 min decreased Lp to 37% of control. Rolipram alone also significantly decreased Lp. Isoproterenol (10 microM) decreased Lp to 27% of control within 20 min. A subgroup of eight vessels treated with rolipram and forskolin, in which mean Lp fell to 25% of control, was examined with transmission electron microscopy. The mean number of  in the treated vessels was 2.2 per cleft (303 clefts), significantly higher than in a matched control group (192 clefts), which was 1.7 per cleft. The results indicate that microvascular Lp can be modulated by intracellular cAMP and that one of the structural end points of stimulated cAMP levels is an increase in the mean number of  strands between endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6379009>Regulation of  junctional permeability in the rat parotid gland by autonomic agonists.</a></h2><p>The permeability of  in the rat parotid gland to the ultrastructural tracer myoglobin (m.w. 17,800) was investigated after in vivo stimulation by autonomic drugs. At various times after administration of beta-adrenergic (isoproterenol), alpha-adrenergic (methoxamine), or cholinergic (methacholine) agonists, the parotid duct was cannulated, and a solution of myoglobin was allowed to flow by gravity (16 mm Hg) into the gland for one hr. In resting glands, cytochemical reaction product for myoglobin was localized in the luminal space of acini and ducts. The tracer was also localized to the luminal space after stimulation with methacholine and methoxamine. In contrast, one to four hr after isoproterenol stimulation, reaction product was present in the intercellular and interstitial spaces of the gland. At later times after stimulation (from six to 24 hr), the tracer was again restricted to the luminal space of the acini and ducts. These results indicate that isoproterenol stimulation causes a transient increase in  junctional permeability, whereas stimulation with methoxamine or methacholine does not change junctional permeability to myoglobin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282332>PITX2c is expressed in the adult left atrium, and reducing Pitx2c expression promotes atrial fibrillation inducibility and complex changes in gene expression.</a></h2><p>Intergenic variations on chromosome 4q25, close to the PITX2 transcription factor gene, are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). We therefore tested whether adult hearts express PITX2 and whether variation in expression affects cardiac .mRNA for PITX2 isoform c was expressed in left atria of human and mouse, with levels in right atrium and left and right ventricles being 100-fold lower. In mice heterozygous for Pitx2c (Pitx2c(+/-)), left atrial Pitx2c expression was 60% of wild-type and cardiac morphology and  were not altered, except for slightly elevated pulmonary flow velocity. Isolated Pitx2c(+/-) hearts were susceptible to AF during programmed stimulation. At short paced cycle lengths, atrial action potential durations were shorter in Pitx2c(+/-) than in wild-type. Perfusion with the β-receptor agonist orciprenaline abolished inducibility of AF and reduced the effect on action potential duration. Spontaneous heart rates, atrial conduction velocities, and activation patterns were not affected in Pitx2c(+/-) hearts, suggesting that action potential duration shortening caused wave length reduction and inducibility of AF. Expression array analyses comparing Pitx2c(+/-) with wild-type, for left atrial and right atrial tissue separately, identified genes related to calcium ion binding, gap and tight junctions, ion channels, and melanogenesis as being affected by the reduced expression of Pitx2c.These findings demonstrate a physiological role for PITX2 in the adult heart and support the hypothesis that dysregulation of PITX2 expression can be responsible for susceptibility to AF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3005347>Acinar structure and membrane regionalization as a prerequisite for exocrine secretion in the rat submandibular gland.</a></h2><p>The significance of glandular organization in exocrine secretion was examined by analysing the functional and morphological features of the dissociated rat submandibular gland with special reference to the acinar structure and luminal specialization. The digestion of the gland with collagenase (C preparation) produced relatively large cellular masses having well-preserved acinar structures. When EGTA and the proteolytic enzyme Dispase were added to the C preparation (CED preparation), the gland was dissociated into small cellular aggregates in which the acinar structure disintegrated. Upon stimulation with either isoproterenol or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a large amount of peroxidase, one of the secretory products of the rat submandibular gland, was released from C-treated cells, while discharged peroxidase was greatly reduced after the CED preparation was used. Measurements of dye exclusion, oxygen consumption, protein synthetic activity and receptor binding, as well as ultrastructural features and the absence of inhibitory effects of EGTA and Dispase, suggested that the reduced secretory response of CED-treated cells was not attributable to cellular death, denaturation of receptors or the inhibitory effects of EGTA and Dispase. When the localization of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV was surveyed by both enzyme histochemistry and immuno-histochemistry, the luminal plasma membrane was the exclusive site for the reaction in C-treated cells as well as intact acini, whereas the entire cell surface was reaction-positive in CED-treated cells. In addition, the luminal microfilament system and , as revealed by nitrobenz-oxadiazole-phallacidin staining and freeze-replica studies, respectively, were well-preserved in the C-treated cells, but considerably disorganized in the CED-treated cells. All these results strongly suggest that: (1) luminal specialization plays an important role in exocrine secretion; and (2) normal acinar arrangement provides the luminal specialization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8840262>Characteristics of a rat cortical collecting duct cell line that maintains high transepithelial resistance.</a></h2><p>This study describes the establishment of a rat kidney cortical collecting duct (CCD) clonal cell line (RCCD1 cells) that maintains high transepithelial resistance and specific hormonal sensitivities. Immortalized cells were obtained by infection of primary cultured CCD cells with the wild-type simian virus 40. Grown on Petri dishes, RCCD1 cells are organized as monolayers of cuboid cells separated by  and form domes. Grown on permeable filters, confluent RCCD1 cells exhibit high transepithelial resistance (Rt: 2390 +/- 140 omega. cm2), transepithelial potential difference (PD) of -10.5 +/- 1.2 mV lumen negative, an associated short-circuit current (Isc) of 4.3 +/- 0.5 microA/cm2, and generated significant Na+, K+, H+ and HCO3- gradients, reflecting Na+ and H+ reabsorption and K+ and HCO3- secretion. RCCD1 cells exhibit features of both principal (PC) and intercalated (IC) cells. Consistent with PC phenotype, about 50% of the cells were positively stained by a PC-specific agglutinin. In situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of alpha, beta and gamma subunit mRNAs of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel and alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Moreover, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was immunolocalized at the basolateral side of the cells. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) induced a significant increase in both cellular cAMP content and Isc. Amiloride decreased in a dose-dependent manner Isc from untreated and AVP-treated RCCD1 cells. In addition, a barium-sensitive K+ conductance was evidenced in the apical side of the cells. Consistent with IC phenotype, isoproterenol (ISO) provoked a large increase in cellular cAMP and stimulated Isc. The effect of ISO on Isc was blocked by 5 x 10(-3) M DPC, a chloride channel blocker. Finally, AVP plus ISO had additive effect on Isc. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the RCCD1 cell line has maintained many of the original properties of rat CCD from which they were derived.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17185353>Norepinephrine increases the pathogenic potential of Campylobacter jejuni.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni can cause a spectrum of diseases in humans, ranging from enteritis and diarrhoea to severe inflammation, profuse bloody diarrhoea and chronic relapsing infection. Norepinephrine (NE) levels in the intestine increase under conditions of stress and trauma, and are thought to result in spill over of NE into the intestinal lumen. NE is known to stimulate the growth of a range of bacterial species, and to increase the pathogenicity of Escherichia coli.To determine the effects of NE on the pathogenic potential of C jejuni in a model system.C jejuni was grown in iron-replete and iron-limited media in the presence and absence of 100 microM NE. Several virulence-associated characteristics, including motility and cell invasion, were measured.When C jejuni was grown in iron-limited media in the presence of NE, growth rate, motility and invasion of cultured epithelial cells were increased compared with cultures grown in the absence of NE. Bacteria exposed to NE during growth also caused greater subsequent disruption of cultured epithelial cell monolayers, inducing widespread breakdown of tight junctions.Exposure to NE causes an increase in the virulence-associated properties of Campylobacter. Stress and concomitant infection could therefore be contributory factors to the variable presentation of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/842474>Stability of the intra-epithelial component of the blood-testis barrier in epinephrine-induced testicular degeneration in Syrian hamsters.</a></h2><p>Adult male Syrian hamsters were given daily intraperitoneal injections of epinephrine (1.0 mg/kg) and papaverine, a vasodilator, (60 mg/kg) for a period of ten days. After the treatment period, lanthanum and horseradish peroxidase tracer studies were used to examine the intra-epithelial component of the blood-testis barrier. Degenerating tubules often exhibited only Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, or Sertoli cells alone. Sertoli cell processes in the degenerating tubules often arched out from the main cell body to make contact with other Sertoli cell processes, forming a series of vacuole-like spaces in the germinal epithelium, adluminal to the Sertoli-Sertoli . At the site of contact between these arching Sertoli cell processes one to eight  had formed with hexagonal arrays of Sertoli cell cytoplasmic filaments located immediately adjacent to these . Cisternae of the Sertoli cell endoplasmic reticulum lay deep to the layer of cytoplasmic filaments. It appeared that these  had originated after the expulsion of the germinal elements of the seminiferous epithelium. Penetration of the tracers in the degenerating seminiferous tubules was prevented by what appeared to be normal Sertoli-Sertoli  located between apposed Sertoli cells, adluminal to the remaining spermatogonia when these resisted degeneration, or just adluminal to the basal lamina in those tubules in which spermatogonia were absent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9512>Na+ transport by rabbit urinary bladder, a  epithelium.</a></h2><p>By in vitro experiments on rabbit bladder, we reassessed the traditional view that mammalian urinary bladder lacks ion transport mechanisms. Since the ratio of actual-to-nominal membrane area in folded epithelia is variable and hard to estimate, we normalized membrane properties to apical membrane capacitance rather than to nominal area (probably 1 muF approximately 1 cm2 actual area). A new mounting technique that virtually eliminates edge damage yielded resistances up to 78,000 omega muF for rabbit bladder, and resistances for amphibian skin and bladder much higher than those usually reported. This technique made it possible to observe a transport-related conductance pathway, and a close correlation between transepithelial conductance (G) and short-circuit current (Isc) in these  epithelia. G and Isc were increased by mucosal (Na+) [Isc approximately 0 when (Na+) approximately 0], aldosterone, serosal (HCO-3) and high mucosal (H+); were decreased by amiloride, mucosal (Ca++), ouabain, metabolic inhibitors and serosal (H+); and were unaffected by (Cl-) and little affected by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Physiological variation in the rabbits' dietary Na+ intake caused variations in bladder G and Isc similar to those caused by the expected in vivo changes in aldosterone levels. The relation between G and Isc was the same whether defined by diet changes, natural variation among individual rabbits, or most of the above agents. A method was developed for separately resolving conductances of , basolateral cell membrane, and apical cell membrane from this G--Isc relation. Net Na+ flux equalled Isc. Net Cl- flux was zero on short circuit and equalled only 25% of net Na+ flux in open circuit. Bladder membrane fragments contained a Na+-K+-activated, ouabain-inhibited ATPase. The physiological significance of Na+ absorption against steep gradients in rabbit bladder may be to maintain kidney-generated ion gradients during bladder storage of urine, especially when the animal is Na+-depleted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22162907>Albuterol modulates its own transepithelial flux via changes in paracellular permeability.</a></h2><p>Although inhaled bronchodilators are commonly used in the treatment of airway disease to dilate airway smooth muscle, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate albuterol movement across the epithelium to reach its target, the airway smooth muscle. Because the rate of onset depends on the transepithelial transport of albuterol, to determine the mechanisms that regulate the transepithelial movement of albuterol is essential. Human bronchial epithelial cells, fully redifferentiated in culture at the air-liquid interface, were used to study the cellular uptake and total transepithelial flux of (3)H-albuterol from the apical to the basolateral surfaces. (3)H-mannitol and transepithelial electrical resistance were used to quantify changes in paracellular permeability. The majority of albuterol flux across the epithelium occurred via the paracellular route. The cellular uptake of albuterol was found to be saturable, whereas transepithelial flux was not. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by the amino acids lysine and histidine, with no effect on net transepithelial flux. Transepithelial flux was altered by maneuvers that collapsed or disrupted intercellular . Acidification, usually seen in exacerbations of airway disease, decreased albuterol flux. In addition, albuterol increased its own paracellular permeability. The ability of albuterol to modulate paracellular permeability was blocked by the β(2)-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonist ICI 118551. Albuterol mainly crosses the epithelium via the paracellular pathway, but has the ability to modulate its own permeability through changes in the leakiness of , which is modulated through the signaling of the β(2)-adrenergic receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23115643>Influenza infects lung microvascular endothelium leading to microvascular leak: role of apoptosis and claudin-5.</a></h2><p>Severe influenza infections are complicated by acute lung injury, a syndrome of pulmonary microvascular leak. The pathogenesis of this complication is unclear. We hypothesized that human influenza could directly infect the lung microvascular endothelium, leading to loss of endothelial barrier function. We infected human lung microvascular endothelium with both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza. Permeability of endothelial monolayers was assessed by spectrofluorimetry and by measurement of the transendothelial electrical resistance. We determined the molecular mechanisms of flu-induced endothelial permeability and developed a mouse model of severe influenza. We found that both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza can infect and replicate in human pulmonary microvascular endothelium, leading to a marked increase in permeability. This was caused by apoptosis of the lung endothelium, since inhibition of caspases greatly attenuated influenza-induced endothelial leak. Remarkably, replication-deficient virus also caused a significant degree of endothelial permeability, despite displaying no cytotoxic effects to the endothelium. Instead, replication-deficient virus induced degradation of the  protein claudin-5; the adherens  protein VE-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton were unaffected. Over-expression of claudin-5 was sufficient to prevent replication-deficient virus-induced permeability. The barrier-protective agent formoterol was able to markedly attenuate flu-induced leak in association with dose-dependent induction of claudin-5. Finally, mice infected with human influenza developed pulmonary edema that was abrogated by parenteral treatment with formoterol. Thus, we describe two distinct mechanisms by which human influenza can induce pulmonary microvascular leak. Our findings have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury from severe influenza.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11814018>Neurotransmitter-stimulated ion transport across cultured bovine mammary epithelial cell monolayers.</a></h2><p>Bovine mammary epithelial (BME-UV) and myoepithelial (BMM-UV) cell lines were acquired with the goal of developing an in vitro model of mammary epithelia for the study of ion transport. The bovine mammary cell lines were successfully cultured on commercially available permeable supports, and results suggest that mammary epithelial cells, but not myoepithelial cells, form  necessary to perform a barrier function. Electrogenic ion transport was not observed in basal conditions. Acute exposure to norepinephrine or forskolin caused prototypic increases in short circuit current accompanied by a reduction in transmural resistance indicative of anion secretion through a conductive pathway. Bumetanide and N-(4-methyphenylsulfonyl)-N'-(4-trifluoro-methylphenyl)urea, inhibitors of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance anion channels, respectively, reduced forskolin-stimulated ion transport. Amiloride, an inhibitor of epithelial sodium channels, had no effect on basal or forskolin-stimulated ion transport. However, naturally occurring and synthetic corticosteroids induced the expression of amiloride sensitive current indicative of sodium absorption. Chronic exposure to increased apical ionic strength and/or reduced carbohydrate concentration were associated with reduced transepithelial resistance although forskolin-stimulated ion transport was unaffected. These results demonstrate that neurotransmitters and steroid hormones act directly on bovine mammary epithelial cells to acutely and chronically modulate the volume and composition of their secretions. The in vitro system that we describe can be further exploited to characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with mammary function in health and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3515014>Transport and metabolic functions in cultured renal tubule cells.</a></h2><p>The study tool of cultured tubule epithelia has been applied to new areas in nephron cell biology, such as the evolution of epithelial membrane asymmetry. Studies utilizing monoclonal antibodies against plasma membrane glycoproteins in MDCK revealed that the development of surface cell polarity is a continuous process requiring intact  and their electrical resistor function [101]. The role of the junctional complex to establish and maintain distinct membrane protein domains had been suggested earlier from work utilizing the apical aminopeptidase [102] and fluorescent membrane probes [103]. Cultured tubule epithelia lend themselves for the evaluation of cell-specific membrane protein synthesis [104] and antigenic determinants [105]. Human renal epithelia, from normal [106, 107] and defined abnormal kidney [108], have been maintained functional in primary and passage culture [106]. Pathophysiological mechanisms may be examined in cultured tubule epithelia, as shown first [109] by studies on the recovery from ischemic failure, where anoxia and substrate deprivation resulted in cell swelling which was prevented in culture by an oncotic agent. This article has not attempted to give an exhaustive account of the studies in which cultured tubule cells have served as a tool.

The randomized crossover HDTBR design by the European Space Agency included 12 healthy, nonheadache male subjects. Before, during, and after confined HDTBR periods, epinephrine (urine), cortisol (saliva), hematological, endothelium markers, and fluid distribution parameters were measured. Headaches were assessed with a validated headache questionnaire. Compared with baseline, HDTBR in all subjects was associated with higher hematocrit, hemoglobin, and epinephrine levels, higher erythrocyte counts, and lower relative plasma volumes (all P < 0.05). In total, 26 headache episodes occurred. In subjects with headaches during HDTBR, epinephrine levels were exaggerated (vs headache-free subjects; HDTBR day 3; 5.1 ± 1.7 vs 3.4 ± 2.4; P = 0.023), cortisol levels were decreased (vs headache-free subjects; HDTBR day 1; 0.37 ± 0.16 vs 0.50 ± 0.20; P < 0.001) and the  marker zonulin was elevated (vs headache-free subjects in HDTBR days 1, 3, 5; P < 0.05).

Jian) with graded levels of dietary choline (165-1820 mg/kg diet) for 65 days. The results firstly showed that choline deficiency induced inflammatory infiltration in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) of fish. Meanwhile, compared with the optimal choline group, choline deficiency decreased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, contents of complement 3 and IgM in the intestine, downregulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A and defensin-3 in the PI and MI, LEAP-2B and hepcidin in the PI, MI and DI), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor β2 in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecule IκB in the PI, MI and DI; while upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6a and tumor necrosis factor α in the MI and DI, interferon γ2b in the PI and MI, IL-1β and IL-6b in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecules (Toll-like receptor 4 in the MI, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 in the PI and MI, Janus kinase 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 in the MI and DI, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4 and STAT5 in the PI, MI and DI) of juvenile Jian carp, further indicating that choline deficiency caused inflammation and immunity depression in the intestine of fish. But choline deficiency decreased the PI IL-6a mRNA level, and increased the DI LEAP-2A and defensin-3 mRNA levels with unknown reasons. Furthermore, dietary choline deficiency downregulated mRNA levels of  (TJ) proteins (claudin 3c in the PI and MI, claudin 7, claudin 11 and occludin in the PI, MI and DI) and signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 in the PI, MI and DI of juvenile Jian carp, whereas upregulated the mRNA levels of claudin 3b in the MI and DI, and claudin 3c in the DI. Moreover, the excessive choline exhibited negative effects on intestinal immunity and TJ proteins that were similar to the choline deficiency. In summary, dietary choline deficiency or excess caused the depression of intestinal mucosal immune by inducing inflammation and dysfunction of the intestinal physical barrier, and regulating related signaling molecules of fish.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Much effort has been directed towards finding an effective in vivo inhibitor of PAF signaling. Here, we report that a small, highly stable, lysosomal lipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) is able to inhibit the inflammatory processes otherwise initiated by PAF in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on behavioral observations, gross anatomical observations at necropsy, histopathology and immunocytochemistry, the administration of recombinant GM2AP inhibits the devastating gastrointestinal necrosis resulting from the injection of rats with LPS and PAF. Recombinant GM2AP treatment not only markedly decrease tissue destruction, but also helped to maintain  integrity at the gastrointestinal level as judged by contiguous Zonula Occludens-1 staining of the epithelial layer lining the crypts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193877>Palmitoylethanolamide counteracts autistic-like behaviours in BTBR T+tf/J mice: Contribution of central and peripheral mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impaired social interaction, and repetitive stereotyped behaviours. Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating gut-brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level. The analysis of gut permeability and the expression of colonic  showed a reduction of leaky gut in PEA-treated BTBR mice. This finding together with PEA effect on gut microbiota composition suggests an involvement of microbiota-gut-brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

The cells formed confluent monolayers and retained most of the morphologic characteristics of the intact epithelium, including apical microvilli, apical , and a moderately interdigitated lateral intercellular space. The cells also retained the functional properties of the epithelium. The monolayer responded to addition of isoproterenol with the characteristic changes in cellular electrical properties expected for stimulation of C1 secretion: isoproterenol increased transepithelial voltage, depolarized apical membrane voltage, and decreased both transepithelial resistance and the ratio of apical-to-basolateral membrane resistance. Examination of the cellular response to ion substitutions and inhibitors of C1 secretion indicate that the cultured monolayers retain the same cellular mechanisms of ion transport as the intact epithelium. Thus, primary cultures of tracheal epithelium may provide a useful preparation for future studies of the mechanism and regulation of C1 secretion by airway epithelia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2845804>Hormonal regulation of hepatocyte  junctional permeability.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the effects of hormones on the permeability of the hepatocyte  to two probes, [14C]sucrose and horseradish peroxidase, using one-pass perfused rat livers. Using a single injection of horseradish peroxidase we have demonstrated that this probe can enter bile by two pathways that are kinetically distinct, a fast pathway, which corresponds to the passage of the probe through the hepatocyte , and a slow pathway, which corresponds to the transcytotic entry into bile. The passage of horseradish peroxidase through the hepatocyte  was confirmed by electron microscopic histochemistry. Vasopressin, epinephrine, and angiotensin II, hormones that act in the hepatocyte through the intracellular mediators calcium, the inositol polyphosphates, and diacylglycerol, increased the bile-to-perfusion fluid ratio of [14C]sucrose and the rapid entry of horseradish peroxidase into bile, indicating that the permeability of the  to these probes was increased. The effect of these hormones was dose dependent and in the cases of angiotensin II and epinephrine was inhibited by the specific inhibitors [Sar1, Thr8]angiotensin II and prazosin, respectively. Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate did not affect the [14C]sucrose bile-to-perfusion fluid ratio or the fast entry of horseradish peroxidase into bile. These results suggest that the hepatocyte  can no longer be considered a static system of pores separating blood from bile. It is rather a dynamic barrier potentially capable of influencing the composition of the bile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1683665>Immortalization of brain capillary endothelial cells with maintenance of structural characteristics of the blood-brain barrier endothelium.</a></h2><p>Early passage bovine brain capillary endothelial cells were immortalized by transfection with the plasmid pSV3 neo. Cells from one clone, SV-BEC, expressed nuclear SV 40 large T antigen, displayed a contact-inhibited and anchorage-dependent proliferation, and a high sensitivity to the addition of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor. SV-BEC cells are morphologically unaltered and express typical markers of endothelial cells: Factor VIII-related antigen, angiotensin-converting enzyme and Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin binding site.

The study of these channels has been facilitated by the transformation of human airway epithelial cells. Clonal populations of SV40 large T-antigen transformed airway epithelial cells from both normal and cystic fibrosis individuals have been established. A limitation in the use of these cell lines has been the loss of the ability to form  after multiple subcultures. In particular, this loss appears to be associated with cell "crisis". A selection protocol that involves growing cells in medium that is high in Ca2+ and supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) has been employed to facilitate progression through crisis. One cell line (1HAEo-) that has a normal phenotype and retains  post-crisis has been produced using this protocol. Immunofluorescent staining with a monoclonal antibody to the E-cadherin adhesion molecule shows a characteristic pericellular localization, indicating the presence of the junctional complex. The presence of  has been confirmed by electron microscopy. These cells produce elevated (greater than 30 fold) levels of cAMP in response to exposure to isoproterenol or forskolin. Chloride ion transport, as measured by 36Cl- efflux, is stimulated greater than 2 fold by these agents. Three post-crisis CF cell lines which grow in serum-containing medium have been established. These do not exhibit . Elevated (greater than 25 fold) levels of cAMP are detected in these cells after addition of isoproterenol or forskolin, but this increase in cAMP is not accompanied by an increase in 36Cl-efflux. Both normal (1HAEo-) and CF cells show increased 36Cl-efflux following addition of the calcium ionophore A23187.

Toxin A has been reported to disrupt epithelial , attract neutrophils, and cause striking intestinal inflammation and secretion. Having demonstrated that phospholipase A2 inhibitors block the secretory effects of toxin A, we next wished to examine whether platelet activating factor (PAF) was involved in either the direct epithelial or secretory effects of toxin A. The effects of toxin A on net secretion in ligated rabbit ileal segments were significantly inhibited by the PAF antagonists 10(-4)-10(-5) M BN 52021, 10(-5) M WEB 2170, or 10(-5) M SR 27417 by 59-102%. SR 27417 also inhibited secretion induced by toxin A in loops adjacent to the drug (by 58%). Furthermore, the striking inflammation and epithelial disruption seen at 6 h and ligated ileal segments with toxin A was largely prevented by simultaneous treatment with the PAF antagonist SR 27417. In addition, we noted a significant synergistic effect of 10(-8) M PAF with 10 micrograms/ml toxin A in the ligated rabbit ileal segments. To examine direct effects of PAF antagonists on toxin A in T-84 epithelial cell monolayers, rhodamine-labeled phalloidin stained F-actin demonstrated significant disruption of F-actin by toxin A that was reduced by the PAF antagonist BN 52021 or WEB 2170. However, the PAF antagonists (10(-4) M WEB, 10(-5) M BN or 10(-4) M SR) failed to alter the disruption of T-84 cell tissue resistance by C. difficile toxin A (0.03 micrograms/ml). We conclude that PAF may be involved in the secretory effects of C. difficile toxin A, and that PAF antagonists deserve further study in C. difficile diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2221039>A factor in serum lowers resistance and opens  of MDCK cells.</a></h2><p>During an inflammatory reaction, factors in blood affect the permeability of endothelium and possibly organ epithelium. In this study we partially characterized a factor in human and canine blood that lowered the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) and examined whether vascular permeability factors [complement component C3a and C5a and platelet-activating factor (PAF)] were responsible for this reaction. C3a and C5a caused a small (10-13%) dose-related decrease in the TER (alpha = 0.05), whereas PAF had no effect. In contrast, the factor found in both serum and plasma caused a large (60-83%) dose-dependent decrease (saturated at 30%) in the TER that was reversible within 60 min. The blood factor, which does not appear to be albumin, was heat stable and has an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa. It preferentially decreased the TER of the epithelium when it came in contact with its basolateral surface and significantly lowered the resistance within 60 min by opening the zonula occludentes. These findings suggest that C3a, C5a, and a factor in blood can directly modulate the permeability of renal epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21452036>Protective effect of intestinal trefoil factor on injury of intestinal epithelial  induced by platelet activating factor.</a></h2><p>Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To evaluate the effect of intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) on increased intestinal permeability and its association with  proteins, an in vitro intestinal epithelia barrier model was established with Caco-2 cells and treated with platelet-activating factor (PAF). We found that exposing cells to 0.3 M ITF (30 min before or 30 min after PAF treatment) attenuated the PAF-induced changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux. A quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that ITF suppressed PAF-induced downregulation of  proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 expression; furthermore, an abnormal localization and distribution of these proteins was inhibited, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining. These results suggest that ITF decreases mucosal permeability and shows potential as a therapy for treating IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17876892>Exogenous sphingomyelinase causes impaired intestinal epithelial  .</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide changes the composition of tight junctions (TJs) with increasing permeability of the intestinal epithelium.Monolayers of Caco-2 cells were used as an in vitro model for the intestinal . Permeability was determined by quantification of transepithelial flux and transepithelial resistance. Sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains were isolated by a discontinuous sucrose gradient and characterized by Western-blot. Lipid content of microdomains was analysed by tandem mass spectrometry. Ceramide was subcellularly localized by immunofluorescent staining.Exogenous sphingomyelinase increased transepithelial permeability and decreased transepithelial resistance at concentrations as low as 0.01 U/mL. Lipid analysis showed rapid accumulation of ceramide in the membrane fractions containing occludin and claudin-4, representing TJs. In these fractions we observed a concomitant decrease of sphingomyelin and cholesterol with increasing concentrations of ceramide. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed clustering of ceramide at the sites of cell-cell contacts. Neutralization of surface ceramide prevented the permeability-increase induced by platelet activating factor.Our findings indicate that changes in lipid composition of TJs impair epithelial  functions. Generation of ceramide by sphingomyelinases might contribute to disturbed   seen in diseases such as inflammatory, infectious, toxic or radiogenic bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10832681>The resiliency of the corneal endothelium to refractive and intraocular surgery.</a></h2><p>To describe stress factors (phenylephrine and contact lenses) from the corneal epithelium that can affect the corneal endothelium, and to describe the effects of refractive and intraocular surgery on the corneal endothelial structure and function.Significant clinical and experimental publications are reviewed and recent experiments conducted in the author's laboratory to describe the corneal endothelial stresses.The corneal epithelium serves as a barrier to topical phenylephrine (2.5-10%). In a compromised epithelium, topical phenylephrine will cause drug-induced stromal edema and endothelial vacuolization. Contact lenses are capable of stimulating the epithelial arachidonic acid cascade to release 12(R)hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(R)HETE) and 8(R)hydroxy-hexadecatrienoic acid (8(R)HHDTrE) to cause endothelial Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-inhibition and polymegethism. Specular microscopy of the corneal endothelial cells after refractive surgery (photorefractive keratectomy [PRK], laser in situ keratomileusis [LASIK], intrastromal rings [INTACs]) has shown that there is minimal effect. However, laser ablation of the stroma within 200 microm of the corneal endothelium will result in endothelial cell structural changes and the formation of the amorphous substance deposited onto Descemet's membrane. Phacoemulsification with a high flow of the irrigation solution can alter the endothelial surface glycoprotein layer. Lidocaine hydrochloride (1%) used as intracameral anesthesia readily diffuses through the corneal endothelium, resulting in stromal uptake and endothelial cell swelling. With phacoemulsification, however, the washout of lidocaine from the cornea (T1/2, 5 minutes) and iris (T1/2, 9 minutes) occurs quickly. Corneal endothelial wound healing after keratoplasty occurs in the following sequence: migration of endothelial cells, development of , and the formation of Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites.Corneal endothelial resiliency is due to the increased peripheral endothelial cell number for migration, the ability of endothelial cells to form  to maintain the endothelial barrier, the increase in endothelial Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites under stress, and the ability of the corneal endothelial cells to shift their metabolism of glucose to the hexose monophosphate shunt for the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and membrane repair. All of these factors are important, along with the aqueous humor sodium concentration, which establishes the osmotic gradient for corneal deturgescence and transparency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1709172>Activation of the simian virus 40 (SV40) genome abrogates sensitivity to AVP in a rabbit collecting tubule cell line by repressing membrane expression of AVP receptors.</a></h2><p>To analyze the role of SV40 genome in the phenotypic alterations previously observed in SV40-transformed cell lines, we infected rabbit renal cortical cells with a temperature-sensitive SV40 mutant strain (tsA58) and compared the cell phenotypes at temperatures permissive (33 degrees C) and restrictive (39.5 degrees C) for SV40 genome expression. At both temperatures, the resulting cell line (RC.SVtsA58) expresses cytokeratin and uvomorulin, but epithelial differentiation is more elaborate at 39.5 degrees C as shown by the formation of a well-organized cuboidal monolayer with numerous  and desmosomes. Functional characteristics are also markedly influenced by the culture temperature: cells grown at 33 degrees C respond only to isoproterenol (ISO, 10(-6) M) by a sevenfold increase in cAMP cell content above basal values; in contrast, when transferred to 39.5 degrees C, they exhibit increased sensitivity to ISO (ISO/basal: 19.1) and a dramatic response to 10(-7) M dDarginine vasopressin (dDAVP/basal: 18.2, apparent Ka: 5 X 10(-9) M) which peaks 48 h after the temperature shift. The latter is associated with membrane expression of V2-type AVP receptors (approximately 50 fmol/10(6) cells) which are undetectable when SV40 genome is activated (33 degrees C). Clonal analysis, additivity studies, and desensitization experiments argue for the presence of a single cell type responsive to both AVP and ISO. The characteristics of the RC. SVtsA58 cell line at 39.5 degrees C (effector-stimulated cAMP profile, lack of expression of brush-border hydrolases and Tamm-Horsfall protein) suggest that it originates from the cortical collecting tubule, and probably from principal cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17138763>Molecular and pharmacological properties of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be coaxed to differentiate into specific cell types, including cardiomyocyte-like cells. These cells express cardiac-specific markers and display functional similarities to their adult counterparts. Based on these properties, hESC-derived cardiomyocytes have the potential to be extremely useful in various in vitro applications and to provide the opportunity for cardiac cell replacement therapies. However, before this can become a reality, the molecular and functional characteristics of these cells need to be investigated in more detail. In the present study we differentiate hESCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells via embryoid bodies (EBs). The fraction of spontaneously beating clusters obtained from the EBs averaged approximately 30% of the total number of EBs used. These cell clusters were isolated, dissociated into single-cell suspensions, and frozen for long-term storage. The cryopreserved cells could be successfully thawed and subcultured. Using electron microscopy, we observed Z discs and  in the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes, and by immunohistochemical analysis we detected expression of cardiac-specific markers (cTnI and cMHC). Notably, using BrdU labeling we also could demonstrate that some of the hESC-derived cardiomyocytes retain a proliferative capacity. Furthermore, pharmacological stimulation of the cells resulted in responses indicative of functional adrenergic and muscarinic receptor coupling systems. Taken together, these results lend support to the notion that hESCs can be used as a source for the procurement of cardiomyocytes for in vitro and in vivo applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186619>Labetalol Prevents Intestinal Dysfunction Induced by Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h2><p>Beta-adrenergic blockade has been hypothesized to have a protective effect on intestinal dysfunction and increased intestinal permeability associated with the epinephrine surge after traumatic brain injury (TBI).Wister rats were subjected to either a weight drop TBI, and intraperitoneally injected or not with labetalol, or a sham procedure (18 rats per group). After 3, 6, or 12h (6 rats per subgroup), intestinal permeability to 4.4 kDa FITC-Dextran and plasma epinephrine levels were measured as was intestinal  protein ZO-1 expression at 12h. Terminal ileum was harvested to measure levels of intestinal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and to evaluate histopathology.In TBI group vs. sham group, intestinal permeability (P<0.01) was significantly higher at all time-points, and intestinal ZO-1 expression was lower at 12h. In TBI with vs. without labetalol group, 1) intestinal permeability was significantly lower at 6 and 12h (94.31±7.64 vs. 102.16±6.40 μg/mL; 110.21±7.52 vs. 118.95±7.11 μg/mL, respectively); 2) levels of plasma epinephrine and intestinal TNF-α were significantly lower at 3, 6 and 12h; and 3) intestinal ZO-1 expression was higher at 3, 6 and 12h (p=0.018). Histopathological evaluation showed that labetalol use preserved intestinal architecture throughout.In a rat model of TBI, labetalol reduced TBI-induced sympathetic hyperactivity, and prevented histopathological intestinal injury accompanied by changes in gut permeability and gut TNF-α expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6725402>Alteration of  junctional permeability in the rat parotid gland after isoproterenol stimulation.</a></h2><p>The permeability of junctional complexes to ultrastructural tracers of different molecular weight and the freeze-fracture appearance of junctional structure were investigated in the resting and stimulated rat parotid gland. Tracers were administered retrogradely via the main excretory duct, and allowed to flow by gravity (16 mmHg) into the gland for 15-60 min. Secretion was induced in some animals by intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol. In resting glands, the tracers microperoxidase , cytochrome c, myoglobin, tyrosinase (subunits), and hemoglobin were restricted to the luminal space of the acini and ducts. In glands stimulated 1-4 h before tracer administration, reaction product for microperoxidase , cytochrome c, myoglobin, and tyrosinase was found in the intercellular and interstitial spaces, whereas hemoglobin was usually retained in the lumina. In contrast, horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase appeared to penetrate the  and reaction product was localized in the extracellular spaces in both resting and stimulated glands. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase was frequently observed in acinar and duct cells. The distribution of horseradish peroxidase was similar in both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Furth rats, and at concentrations of 0.1-10 mg/ml in the tracer solution. Freeze-fracture replicas of stimulated acinar cells revealed an increased irregularity of the  meshwork, but no obvious gaps or discontinuities were observed. These findings indicate that (a)  in the resting rat parotid gland are impermeable to tracers of molecular weight greater than or equal to 1,900; (b) stimulation with isoproterenol results in a transient increase in junctional permeability allowing passage of tracers of molecular weight less than or equal to 34,500; (c) junctional permeability cannot be directly correlated with junctional structure; and (d) the behavior of horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in the rat parotid gland is inconsistent with their molecular weights. Cell membrane damage due to the enzymatic activity or binding of these two tracers may account for the observed distribution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5768873>Dynamic changes in the ultrastructure of the acinar cell of the rat parotid gland during the secretory cycle.</a></h2><p>Synchronization of the secretory cycle in vivo was obtained by injecting isoprenaline as an inducer of secretion. A quantitative correlation between enzyme release, its subsequent reaccumulation, and the sequence of ultrastructural changes was found. At the ultrastructural level secretion was paralleled by depletion of zymogen granules through fusion of the granule membrane with the lumen membrane and discharge of the content. Each zymogen granule membrane, once connected with the lumen, acted as a lumen membrane. Fusion was thus sequential and resulted in a dramatic enlargement of the lumen space. During the entire process the passage between the lumen and the intercellular space remained blocked by the , as shown by their impenetrability to ferritin. Reduction of the lumen size following enzyme discharge seemed to be achieved by withdrawal of lumen membrane in the form of small smooth vesicles which appeared mostly in the apical part of the cell. At the same time, the cell retracted towards the lumen, the whole process being completed within 2 hr from onset of secretion. Disappearance of the smooth vesicle followed, concomitant with formation of many condensing vacuoles and appearance of mature zymogen granules. The fate of the zymogen granule membrane, including its fusion with the lumen membrane, resorption in the form of small smooth vesicles, and its eventual reutilization mediated by the Golgi system, is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3269642>[An experimental study on permeability, cell coupling and intercellular  in acinar cells during secretion.

In the acini of normal glands, fluorescence was detected in the basolateral space but not in the luminal space up to 30 min. However, when secretion was induced by isoproterenol or carbachol, fluorescence appeared in the luminal space within 2 to 5 min. This did not involve the disruptive changes in  ultrastructure, nor was it irreversible; the luminal fluorescence disappeared again when the secretagogues were removed. Tracers up to MW 40 K for isoproterenol and MW 10 K for carbachol revealed the luminal fluorescence in parotid acini, with little indications of the charge preference characteristics. The luminal fluorescence also appeared by anoxia, enzymatic cell dissociation and the cytochalasin D treatment. It was suggested that the  in salivary acini dynamically alter their permeability and modulate the passage of large molecules through the paracellular pathway. Oxygen supply, extracellular matrices and cytoskeletons were suggested to influence these regulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9367609>Cultured lung epithelium: A cellular model for lung preservation.</a></h2><p>Cellular models have helped with the development of conditions needed for hypothermic preservation of kidney, liver, and heart. Recently, highly differentiated cultured lung epithelial cell lines grown with basolateral side feeding technique have become available that can mimic airspace, epithelium, and interstitium of lung parenchyma. Cultured lung epithelium coupled with Ussing's short-circuit current technique was used as a cellular model system for lung preservation. A parametric study was conducted to correlate the effects of luminal fluid composition (University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and phosphate-buffered saline) and storage gas (air vs nitrogen) at 4 degrees C for 24 h on postischemic electrogenic properties (transepithelial ion transport and resistance). The results showed that cells were better preserved with the UW solution on both sides as measured by their transepithelial resistance, an indicator of  integrity (Rte approximately 65% of control values approximately 135 Omega cm2). In addition, they responded better to mediators that stimulate chloride secretion than cells preserved with other conditions. Cells preserved with no additional fluid on the apical side had substantially lowered Rte (<20%) than those preserved with an additional thin layer of fluid ( approximately 35-65%). This cellular model system is a realistic representation of lung epithelium and can provide an accurate assessment of preservation quality through the measurements of  integrity and active ion transport.Copyright 1997 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12421536>The route of passive chloride movement across amphibian skin: localization and regulatory mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Transepithelial Cl(-) conductance (G(Cl)) in amphibian skin can be activated in several species by serosa positive potentials. Mitochondria-rich cells (MRC) or  (TJ) between the epithelial cells are possible sites for this pathway. The properties and the techniques used to investigate this pathway are reviewed in the present paper. In situ techniques are preferable, since specific properties of the MRC are apparently not maintained in isolated cells. Volume measurements and electronprobe microanalysis of intracellular ions suggest the localization of voltage-activated G(Cl) to MRC. G(Cl) correlates poorly with the density of MRC. The vibrating voltage probe allows quantitative correlation of the local Cl(-) current through morphologically identified structures and the transepithelial Cl(-) current. Our analysis shows that 80% of the voltage-activated Cl(-) current is accounted for by current through MRC or their immediate vicinity. The activation patterns of this current and the inhibition by the alpha(1)-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, conform to those of the transepithelial current. However, less than 20% of the MRC are active at a certain moment and the activity is spontaneously variable with time. The molecular nature of this pathway, physiological control mechanisms and their relation to the temporal activity of MRC remain to be studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17229089>Degeneration of noradrenergic fibres from the locus coeruleus causes tight-junction disorganisation in the rat brain.</a></h2><p>Although functional studies demonstrate that noradrenaline controls the permeability of the blood-brain , it has never been determined whether this neurotransmitter regulates the tight junction (TJ) assembly that confers the  property to brain microvessels. We thus tested in rats the effect of pharmacological depletion of noradrenaline with the noradrenergic toxin DSP4 (5 mg/kg) on the expression of the TJ proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO1) and occludin. The effectiveness of the lesion was confirmed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which showed noradrenergic fibre reduction accompanied by debris and swollen fibres in DSP4-treated brains. Noradrenergic fibre degeneration caused: (i) gliosis; (ii) disappearance of TJ proteins in vascular cell-to-cell contacts (49.9 and 38.3% reductions for occludin and ZO1, respectively); (iii) a 49.2% decrease in total ZO1 protein, measured by Western blot analysis, parallel to a 39.5% decrease in ZO1 mRNA, measured by real-time PCR; and (iv) a relative increase in the beta occludin isoform (62.9%), with no change in total occludin protein or mRNA. The expression of endothelial brain antigen, a marker of a functionally competent brain endothelium, was also reduced. We conclude that damage to the ascending fibres from the locus coeruleus caused TJ disruption and gliosis, a sign of inflammation. These results imply that the locus coeruleus degeneration reported in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may contribute to these disorders by causing blood-brain  dysfunction. Whether the vascular damage is the result of impaired noradrenergic transmission or secondary to the inflammatory reaction remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5653881>Some properties of the smooth muscle of rabbit portal vein.</a></h2><p>1. The morphology of the smooth muscle of the rabbit portal vein and its innervation were studied with fluorescence and electron microscopy. Two layers of smooth muscle were observed in the tunica media: an inner layer of circularly arranged muscle cells and an outer layer consisting of bundles of smooth muscle cells arranged in a near longitudinal direction. The membranes of neighbouring smooth muscle cells were occasionally fused to form ;'.2. Bundles of non-myelinated nerve fibres were observed in the adventitia, and between bundles and layers of smooth muscle cells in the media. Studies on longitudinal sections with fluorescence microscopy revealed a network of varicose noradrenergic axons.3. Electrical and mechanical activity was recorded from longitudinal strips of smooth muscle from the media of the vein with a sucrose-gap apparatus.4. The preparation was spontaneously active under minimal resting tension (less than 150 mg) and at temperatures above 28 degrees C. Slow depolarizations led to a burst of spikes (multi-spike complexes), which corresponded to rhythmic contractions. In 10% of preparations, the interval between multi-spike complexes showed a slower depolarization, suggesting the record was from a pace-maker region.5. The frequency of spontaneous activity (3-27 beats/min) was very sensitive to changes in temperature and tension.6. Noradrenaline in low doses (0.01 mug) caused an increase in frequency of the multi-spike complexes. Higher doses (0.1-0.3 mug) initiated continuous high-frequency spiking, while very high doses (0.6-2.0 mug) caused maintained depolarization.7. Responses to repetitive electrical stimulation of the vein were qualitatively similar to those in response to exogenous noradrenaline. The relation between the mechanical response and the various parameters of stimulation was consistent with the stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibres in the wall of the vein.8. The actions of isoprenaline, phentolamine and propranolol indicated the presence of alpha ;excitatory' and beta ;inhibitory' adrenotrophic receptors on the smooth muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6293641>Choline and PAH transport across blood-CSF barriers: the effect of lithium.</a></h2><p>The components of the blood-CSF barrier responsible for the transport of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and choline from CSF to blood were identified using in vitro preparations of frog choroid plexus and arachnoid membranes. Choline was transported out of CSF across the arachnoid, while PAH was transported out across the choroid plexus. Probenecid and ouabain blocked both processes. The effect of Li on these transport processes was tested by the addition of 5 mM LiCl to the incubation media. Li increased, by a factor of two, choline transport across the arachnoid, but there was no effect of Li on PAH transport across the plexus. Lithium was passively transported across the choroid plexus, and we suggest that the major transport pathway is through the . The steady-state distribution of Li between the choroidal epithelium and the incubation medium was only half that expected for passive distribution. This suggests the existence of sodium/lithium countertransport in these epithelial cell membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646838>Platelet activating factor contributes to vascular leak in acute dengue infection.</a></h2><p>Although plasma leakage is the hallmark of severe dengue infections, the factors that cause increased vascular permeability have not been identified. As platelet activating factor (PAF) is associated with an increase in vascular permeability in other diseases, we set out to investigate its role in acute dengue infection.PAF levels were initially assessed in 25 patients with acute dengue infection to determine if they were increased in acute dengue. For investigation of the kinetics of PAF, serial PAF values were assessed in 36 patients. The effect of dengue serum on  protein ZO-1 was determined by using human endothelial cell lines (HUVECs). The effect of dengue serum on and trans-endothelial resistance (TEER) was also measured on HUVECs.PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with acute dengue (n = 25; p = 0.001) when compared to healthy individuals (n = 12). In further investigation of the kinetics of PAF in serial blood samples of patients (n = 36), PAF levels rose just before the onset of the critical phase. PAF levels were significantly higher in patients with evidence of vascular leak throughout the course of the illness when compared to those with milder disease. Serum from patients with dengue significantly down-regulated expression of  protein, ZO-1 (p = 0.004), HUVECs. This was significantly inhibited (p = 0.004) by use of a PAF receptor (PAFR) blocker. Serum from dengue patients also significantly reduced TEER and this reduction was also significantly (p = 0.02) inhibited by prior incubation with the PAFR blocker.Our results suggest the PAF is likely to be playing a significant role in inducing vascular leak in acute dengue infection which offers a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6864779>Cellular and paracellular pathway resistances in the "" Cl- -secreting epithelium of rabbit cornea.</a></h2><p>The high transverse resistance of the isolated rabbit cornea (6-12 l omega . cm2) is associated with the corneal epithelium, a Cl- -secreting tissue which is modulated by beta-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. Three methods were employed to determine the resistances for the apical membrane, basolateral membrane, and paracellular conductive pathways in the epithelium. In the first method, the specific resistance of the apical membrane was selectively and reversibly changed. Epinephrine was used to increase apical cation permeability. The second method utilized a direct measure of the spontaneous cellular ionic current. The third method obtained estimates of shunt resistance using transepithelial electrophysiological responses to changes in apical membrane resistance. The results of the first method were largely independent of the agent used. In addition, the three methods were in general agreement, and the ranges of mean values for apical membrane, basolateral membrane, and shunt resistances were 23-33, 3-4, and 12-16 k omega . cm2, respectively, for the normal cornea. The apical membrane was the major, physiologically-modulated barrier to ion permeation. The shunt resistance of the corneal epithelium was comparable to that found previously for other "" epithelia. Experiments using Ag+ in tissues that were bathed in Cl- and HCO3-free solutions indicated that under resting conditions the apical membrane is anion-selective.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3184177>Regeneration of resistance and ion transport in rabbit corneal epithelium after induced surface cell exfoliation.</a></h2><p>Exposure of the rabbit corneal surface to a 20-microM digitonin-0.9% NaCl solution leads to permeabilization of the most superficial cells of the stratified epithelium. The devitalized cells exfoliate spontaneously from the corneal surface. Detergent exposure limited to 4-8 min leads to permeabilization and rapid exfoliation of a monolayer of surface cells. Consistent with the presence of the epithelial paracellular permeability barrier in this cell layer, their permeabilization results in complete loss of transepithelial resistance (Rt). Within minutes after detergent removal an initial recovery of Rt can be noticed indicating generation of a new paracellular permeability barrier by the viable sub-surface cells. This recovery proceeds rapidly and Rt reaches within 70 min a maximum equal to greater than 90% of the preexfoliation values (= 2.43 k omega.cm2, n = 22). The Rt recovery is fully blocked in a reversible manner by 10 microM dihydrocytochalasin B. The recovery is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis with 5 microM cycloheximide. When the ocular surface is treated again with digitonin the permeabilization and exfoliation of a monolayer of cells and loss of Rt are repeated. After the second detergent exposure an initial recovery of Rt occurs as before within minutes. However, the pace of Rt recovery is much slower: 4-5 hr are required to reach a stable maximal Rt values amounting to about 73% of initial control. This recovery can be fully blocked by 5 microM cycloheximide indicating that protein synthesis is required for generation of  by the second subcellular layer. With only a fraction of Rt recovered, short-circuit currents amounting to, at least, 50% of control values and attributable in part to cell-to-tear movement of Cl- through the apical surface can be measured. This suggests that apical-type Cl- channels are either present in the apically facing membrane of subsurface cells or that they are rapidly inserted in it from preexisting intracellular pools immediately following the devitalization of the surface cells by digitonin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8383464>VIP, serotonin, and epinephrine modulate the ion selectivity of  of goldfish intestine.</a></h2><p>Bidirectional fluxes of Cl- across isolated and stripped goldfish intestinal epithelium mounted in Ussing-type chambers increased after addition of 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), suggesting an increase of the paracellular permeability for Cl-. Confirming this, the addition of 8-Br-cAMP to the stripped intestine reduced the diffusion potential generated by isosmotic serosal or mucosal replacement of part of the NaCl by mannitol. The addition of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was without effect on the Cl- permeability. The cAMP-specific reduction of the diffusion potential was used to screen the epithelium for the presence of receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The results indicate the presence of a serotonin (5-HT) receptor, positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase but insensitive to 5-HT1-, 5-HT2-, 5-HT3-, and nonclassical 5-HT4-receptor antagonists. Addition of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) also reduced the diffusion potential in a dose-dependent way. Epinephrine restored the diffusion potential after its reduction by 5-HT or VIP. This effect could be mimicked by the partial alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine and blocked by the alpha 2-antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan. The Rp diastereoisomer of cAMP, (Rp)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate [(Rp)cAMPS], counteracted the effect of VIP. The results indicate that in goldfish enterocytes VIP and 5-HT reduce the ion selectivity of the  through elevation of cAMP and that activation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors antagonize these effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1457617>Free epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine in saliva and plasma of healthy adults.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether salivary catecholamine levels reflect short term changes of sympathoadrenal activity, we simultaneously measured plasma and saliva epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations at rest, during bicycle ergometry and during epinephrine infusion in 12 healthy adults, using a radioenzymatic method. Whereas all plasma catecholamines significantly increased during bicycle ergometry and epinephrine infusion, no changes were observed in the salivary catecholamine concentrations and the salivary catecholamine flow rate after stimulation by rhythmic chewing. Moreover, salivary catecholamine concentrations were related neither to heart rate nor to blood pressure. Obviously, free catecholamines are rapidly inactivated by enzymatic degradation, neuronal reuptake or extraneuronal uptake in tissues before they diffuse through the  into the saliva. Therefore, stimulated saliva catecholamine levels do not reflect short term changes in the activity of the sympathoadrenal nervous system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21380808>Disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton and monolayer  integrity induced by PAF and the protective effect of ITF on intestinal epithelium.</a></h2><p>To explore whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) can disrupt the intestinal epithelial  directly and is associated with structural alterations of the F-actin-based cytoskeleton, and to observe the protective effect of intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), we establish an intestinal epithelia  model using Caco-2 cells in vitro. Transepithelial electrical resistance and unidirectional flux of lucifer yellow were measured to evaluate  permeability; immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry were applied to observe morphological alterations and to quantify proteins of the F-actin cytoskeleton: the tight junction marker ZO-1 and Claudin-1 were observed using immunofluorescent staining. PAF significantly increased paracellular permeability, at the same time, F-actin and tight junction proteins were disrupted. It was thought that ITF could reverse the high permeability by restoring normal F-actin, ZO-1 and Claudin-1 structures. These results collectively demonstrated that PAF plays an important role in the regulation of mucosal permeability and the effects of PAF are correlated with structural alterations of the F-actin-based cytoskeleton and of tight junctions. ITF can protect intestinal epithelium against PAF-induced disruption by restricting the rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton and of tight junctions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26607470>Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduces retinal inflammation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Although the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is still insufficiently understood, new evidences indicate 'retinal inflammation' as an important player in the pathogenesis of the complication. Accordingly, common sets of upregulated inflammatory cytokines are found in serum, vitreous and aqueous samples obtained from subjects with DR, and these cytokines can have multiple interactions to impact the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, based on previously published data, we investigated the effects of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid amide that belongs to the N-acyl- family, on DR in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. PEA (10mg/kg) was administered orally daily starting 3 days after the iv administration of STZ. The rats were killed 15 and 60day later and eyes were enucleated to evaluate, through immunohistochemical analysis, the key inflammatory events involved in the breakdown of blood retinal barrier (BRB). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of VEGF, ICAM-1, nitrotyrosine (a marker of peroxynitrite), and  in the retina of STZ-treated rats. Of interest, the extent of injury was significantly reduced after treatment with PEA. Altogether, this study provides the first evidence that PEA attenuates the degree of inflammation while preserving the blood-retinal barrier in rats with experimental DR.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In vitro ciliary activity was not affected in the presence of 3.3 mg/ml of RMX, but was enhanced in the presence of 6.7 mg/ml of RXM. Oral administration of 10 and 100 mg of RXM for 14 days enhanced both ciliary activity and mucociliary transport velocity in the trachea. Epithelial permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextrans (FD-70s; molecular weight: 70,000 daltons) was not affected by oral administration of 10 mg of RXM for 14 days, but was significantly reduced by oral administration of 100 mg of RXM for 14 days. Inhalation of platelet activating factor (PAF) compromised the function of the mucociliary system and the  barrier. However, pretreatment with 20 mg of RXM significantly alleviated the PAF-induced decrease in mucociliary function and the increase in epithelial permeability to FD-70s. In conclusion, such reinforcement of the epithelial defence functions is likely to be involved in the pharmacological action underlying the clinical efficacy of RXM for chronic airway inflammatory disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406450>Salbutamol sulfate absorption across Calu-3 bronchial epithelia cell monolayer is inhibited in the presence of common anionic NSAIDs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the permeability kinetics of salbutamol sulfate, a commonly used β2-agonist in the treatment of asthma exacerbation, across Calu-3 respiratory epithelial cell monolayers in the presence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as they have been implicated to be able to modulate organic cation transporters (OCTs).Calu-3 cell monolayers were grown in a liquid covered culture (LCC) configuration on 0.33 cm(2) Transwell polyester cell culture supports. Monolayers, cultured between 11 and 14 days were evaluated for epithelial resistance,  integrity, and expression of OCT using Western blot analysis. The transport of salbutamol across the monolayer was studied as a function of concentration. Directional transport was investigated by assessing apical-basal (a-b) and basal-apical (b-a) directions. The influence of a non-specific OCT inhibitor (tetraethylammonium, TEA) and three NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin) on the uptake of salbutamol was studied.The flux of salbutamol sulfate increased with increasing concentration before reaching a plateau, suggesting the involvement of a transport-mediated uptake mechanism. Western blot analysis detected the presence of OCT1-3 and N1 and N2 sub-types, suggesting the presence of functioning transporters. The apparent permeability (P(app)) of 0.1 mM salbutamol across the epithelial monolayer displayed directional transport in the a-b direction which was inhibited by ˜70% in the presence of TEA, suggesting OCT-mediated uptake. Likewise, the uptake of 0.1 mM salbutamol was decreased in the presence of all the three NSAIDs, supporting a mechanism whereby NSAIDs inhibit absorption of salbutamol across the bronchial epithelium via effects on the OCT transporters.This study demonstrates that NSAIDs influence the uptake kinetics of salbutamol in an in vitro Calu-3 cell system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7515578>Calu-3: a human airway epithelial cell line that shows cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion.</a></h2><p>Of 12 cell lines derived from human lung cancers, only Calu-3 cells showed high transepithelial resistance (Rte) and increases in short-circuit current (Isc) in response to mediators. Calu-3 cells formed polarized monolayers with  and Rte of approximately 100 omega.cm2. Baseline Isc was approximately 35 microA/cm2 and was increased by approximately 75 microA/cm2 on elevation of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) by isoproterenol. Flux studies showed that the increase in Isc was due to Cl- secretion. Forskolin and permeant analogues of cAMP also increased Isc. Consistent with the presence of cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion, immunoprecipitation demonstrated the presence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Bradykinin, methacholine, trypsin, and histamine all transiently (15-30 s) elevated Isc, probably by increasing intracellular Ca concentration. Experiments in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with nystatin indicated that CFTR was substantially activated under baseline conditions and that Ca-activated Cl- channels were absent from the apical membrane. We anticipate that Calu-3 cells will prove useful in the study of Cl- secretion and other functions of human airway epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7515579>CFTR in Calu-3 human airway cells: channel properties and role in cAMP-activated Cl- conductance.</a></h2><p>Calu-3, a cell line derived from a lung adenocarcinoma, forms , expresses cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and secretes Cl- in response to adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents. Anion conductance of Calu-3 cells was assessed with isotopic flux and patch-clamp methods at 22 degrees C. Iodide efflux was increased by cAMP-elevating agents and brief trypsin treatment. A 7.1 +/- 0.4-pS voltage-independent Cl- channel with linear current-voltage relation was the most common channel observed in cell-attached recordings and was identified as CFTR on the basis of shared features with recombinant CFTR. In unstimulated cells, the mean minimum number of active CFTR channels per patch was 1 +/- 1 (n = 12), increasing to 6 +/- 8 (n = 40) after stimulation with cAMP-elevating agents or after brief trypsin treatment. Channel closure after excision was biexponential with tau 1 approximately 4 s and tau 2 approximately 79 s; typically channels were open continuously until closing permanently. In 11 of 12 excised patches, channels were reactivated by exposure to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) plus ATP. Efficacy of reactivation was inversely related to the duration from excision to addition of PKA. Channels were blocked by 20-40 microM 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate on cytosolic but not external side. Active CFTR channels were recorded in 83% of total patches. Other types of Cl- channels were observed in 5 of 52 (10%) cell-attached patches and in 17 of 34 (50%) excised patches, including an outwardly rectifying channel in 2 patches. CFTR channels are the predominant pathway for cAMP-stimulated Cl- conductance in Calu-3 cells; the long open times in the absence of ATP are not explained by present models of CFTR activation.</p></html>
