This includes: transparency, perfect built to obtain appropriate refractive power, protective  from microbial invaders. Moreso, the cornea also endures extreme external physical conditions (temperature, high and low humidity, winds and alike). All these functions are maintained while preserving a constant state of homogenous wetting. Toward that end the cornea is equipped with an elaborated network of sensory neural network. While enabling the blinking reflex and maintaining the physiological steady state of wetting, this neural network also makes the cornea prone to the discomfort that with or without associated changes seen on medical examination. ISOPT Clinical 2018 discussion touched upon this hypercomplex situation, addressing the role of inflammation and its resulting discomfort in dry eye conditions. The discussion also engulfed the emerging neuropathic pain syndrome that is recently gaining more attention. Another related topic was the utilization of autologous serum tears and its ability to provide amelioration to desperate patients. Finally, the panel discussed the issue of treating corneal infection, including when and how to utilize steroids in the course of therapy. We assume the reader will find interest in this discussion that directly addresses issues seen day in and day out in our busy clinics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651369>Discovering myeloid cell heterogeneity in the lung by means of next generation sequencing.</a></h2><p>The lung plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, as it is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes. Myeloid cells of the innate immune system and epithelial cells form a critical  in the lung. Recently developed unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed cell heterogeneity in the lung with respect to  and pathology and has reshaped our knowledge. New phenotypes and distinct gene signatures have been identified, and these new findings enhance the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. Here, we present a review of the new NGS findings on myeloid cells in lung development, homeostasis, and lung diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659669>"It Sometimes Doesn't Even Work": Patient Opioid Assessments as Clues to Therapeutic Flexibility in Primary Care.</a></h2><p>Physicians' fear of difficult patient interactions is an important  to discontinuing long-term opioid therapy.To identify patient statements about opioids that indicate potential openness to tapering opioids or trying non-opioid pain treatments DESIGN: This is an observational study of regularly scheduled primary care visits involving discussion of chronic pain management. A coding system to characterize patient assessments about opioids, physician responses to assessments, and patient-endorsed opioid side effects was developed and applied to transcripts of video-recorded visits. All visits were independently coded by 2 authors.Eighty-six established adult patients taking opioids for chronic pain; 49 physicians in 2 academic primary care clinics MAIN MEASURES: Frequency and topic of patients' opioid assessments; proportion of opioid assessments classified as clues (assessments indicating potential willingness to consider non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses); physician responses to patient clues; frequency and type of patient-endorsed side effects KEY RESULTS: Patients made a mean of 3.2 opioid assessments (median 2) per visit. The most common assessment topics were pain relief (51%), effect on  (21%), and opioid safety (14%). Forty-seven percent of opioid assessments (mean 1.5 per visit) were classified as clues. Fifty-three percent of visits included ≥ 1 clue; 21% of visits contained ≥ 3 clues. Physicians responded to patient clues with no/minimal response 43% of the time, sympathetic/empathetic statements 14% of the time, and further explored clues 43% of the time. Fifty-eight percent of patients endorsed ≥ 1 opioid-related side effect; 10% endorsed ≥ 3 side effects. The most commonly endorsed side effects were constipation (15% of patients), sedation (15%), withdrawal symptoms (13%), and nausea (12%).Patient statements suggesting openness to non-opioid pain treatments or lower opioid doses are common during routine primary care visits. Listening for and exploring these clues may be a patient-centered strategy for broaching difficult topics with patients on long-term opioid therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630422>NLRP Inflammasomes and Induced Skin Inflammation,  Recovery and Extended Skin Hydration.</a></h2><p>In vitro assays were designed to examine the release of active Caspase-1 (ACasp-1) from NLRP inflammasome-activated Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK) employing a bioluminescent assay specific for measuring inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression.Four anticipated exogenous activators of the NLRP inflammasome including: UVB, ATP, Nigericin and Urban Dust were examined. Follow-up studies examined the influence of extracellular application of three different natural blends of known anti-inflammatories, one a polysaccharide blend, and the other two antioxidant blends, one oil-soluble the other water-soluble, to examine ACasp-1 inhibition. Clinical work using the same blend of polysaccharides employed at 3% in a moisturizing formulation was examined for skin  recovery, measured with TEWL over a 60 hour time frame after tape stripping on 10 individuals, and extended moisturization, measured using corneometer conductance after a single product application out through a 48-hour regression on 10 individuals.In vitro results indicated that two exogenous activators, 60 mJ/cm UVB and 5 mM ATP, worked to upregulate expression of ACasp-1 within a 20 hour timeframe. Additional studies were conducted to examine the influence of three xtracellularly applied active ingredient blends. A blend of polysaccharides demonstrated potential to inhibit ACasp-1 expression in both UVB- and ATP-activated skin cells. Oil-soluble and water-soluble antioxidant blends inhibited ACasp-1 expression in UVB-activated keratinocytes but not ATP-activated keratinocytes.  disruption studies indicated that 3% of the polysaccharide blend accelerated  recovery in a 60 hour time frame as measured by TEWL. Skin hydration studies showed an ability for the polysaccharide blend to show significant improvements in skin hydration out to 48 hours after a single application versus a moisturizing placebo.The role of the skin's innate immune response, controlled by NLRP inflammasomes, is beginning to be linked to numerous skin conditions including inflammaging. In this work it was found that: 1) an in vitro assay could activate NHEKs to express NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, 2) Ingredient blends inhibited UVB and ATP-induced NLRP inflammasome-induced ACasp-1 expression, and 3) skin  disruption improvements and extended skin hydration could be achieved with 3% of the polysaccharide blend.© 2019 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652502>Neutrophil-Derived Microvesicle Induced Dysfunction of Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells In Vitro.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) that are tightly linked by tight junction (TJ) proteins, restricts the movement of molecules between the periphery and the central nervous system. Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB , but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the integrity of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and  in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their integrity. We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional Integrity of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h2><p> There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow (BM) cells on the gut microbiome and gut  .  We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the microbiome and gut  .  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut  integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted  was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut  integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut  dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty acid binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut   and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612457>Nuclear Mechanics and Cancer Cell Migration.</a></h2><p>As a cancer cell invades adjacent tissue, penetrates a basement membrane , or squeezes into a blood capillary, its nucleus can be greatly constricted. Here, we examine: (1) the passive and active deformation of the nucleus during 3D migration; (2) the nuclear structures-namely, the lamina and chromatin-that govern nuclear deformability; (3) the effect of large nuclear deformation on DNA and nuclear factors; and (4) the downstream consequences of mechanically stressing the nucleus. We focus especially on recent studies showing that constricted migration causes nuclear envelope rupture and excess DNA damage, leading to cell cycle suppression, possibly cell death, and ultimately it seems to heritable genomic variation. We first review the latest understanding of nuclear dynamics during cell migration, and then explore the functional effects of nuclear deformation, especially in relation to genome integrity and potentially cancerous mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609077>Efficacy of anti-inflammatory moisturizer vs hydrophilic cream in elderly patients with moderate to severe xerosis: A split site, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Xerosis is a common problem among the elderly, characterized by dry-scaling erythema, fissuring, or pruritus, which could be treated by anti-inflammatory moisturizers without side effects of steroids.We aimed to investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory moisturizer (MAS062D lotion) vs hydrophilic cream for the improvement of dry and   skin in xerosis patients.A split site, triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in the elderly with moderate to severe xerosis, who received the 28-day twice daily application of MAS062D lotion and hydrophilic cream on the assigned shins. The evaluations on day 0, 14, and 28 were performed using clinical assessment, skin hydration by corneometer, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and biometric assessment.There were 24 Thai elderly patients, of whom 87.5% were female (mean age = 58.04 years and mean xerosis severity scale (XSS) = 4.83). Both treatments revealed similar statistically significant improvement in XSS (P < .001). Interestingly, MAS062D lotion-treated side remarkably showed improvement of skin hydration compared with hydrophilic-treated side for 26.86 ± 7.94 vs 25.84 ± 5.1, 41.24 ± 6.92 vs 20.96 ± 6.8, 50.49 ± 8.2 vs 21.75 ± 8.29 at baseline, day 14, and 28, respectively (P-value < .001). Moreover, MAS062D lotion significantly yielded greater decrease in TEWL measurement and more erythema improvement than hydrophilic cream (P-value < .001). No serious adverse effects were observed with either treatment.The MAS062D lotion could potentially be an efficacious treatment for improvement of xerosis in the elderly, which is also safe and refrains from steroid side effects.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601371>Long-Term Dabigatran Treatment Delays Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis in the TgCRND8 Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with important vascular and hemostatic alterations that should be taken into account during diagnosis and treatment.This study evaluates whether anticoagulation with dabigatran, a clinically approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor with a low risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, ameliorates AD pathogenesis in a transgenic mouse model of AD.TgCRND8 AD mice and their wild-type littermates were treated for 1 year with dabigatran etexilate or placebo. Cognition was evaluated using the Barnes maze, and cerebral perfusion was examined by arterial spin labeling. At the molecular level, Western blot and histochemical analyses were performed to analyze fibrin content, amyloid burden, neuroinflammatory activity, and blood-brain  (BBB) integrity.Anticoagulation with dabigatran prevented memory decline, cerebral hypoperfusion, and toxic fibrin deposition in the AD mouse brain. In addition, long-term dabigatran treatment significantly reduced the extent of amyloid plaques, oligomers, phagocytic microglia, and infiltrated T cells by 23.7%, 51.8%, 31.3%, and 32.2%, respectively. Dabigatran anticoagulation also prevented AD-related astrogliosis and pericyte alterations, and maintained expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 at astrocytic perivascular endfeet of the BBB.Long-term anticoagulation with dabigatran inhibited thrombin and the formation of occlusive thrombi in AD; preserved cognition, cerebral perfusion, and BBB ; and ameliorated neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition in AD mice. Our results open a field for future investigation on whether the use of direct oral anticoagulants might be of therapeutic value in AD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Vitreous samples were collected from 28 eyes of patients with PDR and 4 eyes with vitreous floaters, which served as controls. For quantitative proteomics, vitreous samples were combined and proteins extracted and labeled with iTRAQ peptide-tagging reagents. Samples were fractionated by liquid chromatography (LC), analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses performed on differentially expressed proteins identified in the PDR samples.  In the PDR vitreous, 26 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed when compared to the controls. Of these, 7 showed a significant increase (0.05) and 19 a significant decrease (0.05)in expression in PDR patients. These included some high abundance proteins including Retinoic acid receptor reactive protein 2 (PDR 1=85.0, PDR 2=83.0, Control 1=119.6, Control 2=120.2, FC=0.710, 0.001), Semaphorin-4B(PDR 1=64.4, PDR 2=68.8, Control 1=135.4, Control 2=146.0, FC=0.473, 0.023), Apolipoprotein B (PDR 1=104.4, PDR 2=106.6, Control 1=89.0, Control 2=85.3, FC=1.211, 0.024), and Heat shock protein 70 (PDR 1=69.3, PDR 2=75.0, Control 1=137.7, Control 2=138.3, FC=0.523, 0.026), which are closely related to the pathological mechanism of PDR. GO analysis clustered the differentially expressed genes into three major functional domains: Biological Processes, Molecular  and Cellular Component. Differential gene expression was found in the categories of cellular metabolism, organonitrogen compound and carbohydrate derivative metabolic processes, transferase activity and transmembrane signaling receptor activity. KEGG Pathway analysis indicate that Chemerin signaling through Akt, Sema4B signaling via PI3K, and HIF-1α signal pathways were all altered in the PDR samples.  In this study we identified variations in expression of genes extensively involved in key biological processes in the retina including neovascularization, cellular metabolism and transmembrane signaling, which provide new insights into the pathophysiology of PDR. Extracellular matrix was degraded and endothelial cell migration was induced by Chemerin, in addition, the destruction of blood-retinal  and neuronal apoptosis were induced by ApoB. Chemerin and ApoB accelerated the development of PDR. Sema 4B participated in vascular protection, HSP70 conducted anti-apoptosis. These two cytokines protected the retinal neurovascular in PDR patients. Therefore, Chemerin, Sema 4B, ApoB and HSP70 may be the treatment target for PDR. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626902>In vitro effects of glyphosate and Roundup on Sertoli cell .</a></h2><p>Roundup (R), a formulation that contains glyphosate (G) as the active ingredient, is a commonly used nonselective herbicide that has been proposed to affect male fertility. It is well known that an adequate Sertoli cell  is essential to maintain germ cell development. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis  (BTB) integrity. Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty acid oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction . However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important  of Sertoli cell such as BTB integrity and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2018.

Irrespective of the type, all these disorders are generally produced by mutations in genes involved in a variety of cellular functions in the skin. These mutations lead to disruption of the stratum corneum and impairment of the skin , producing clinical features such as hyperkeratosis, skin scaling, erythema, fissures, pruritus, inflammation, and skin pain. Despite advances in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of ichthyoses, there is, to our knowledge, no definitive cure for skin manifestations, and current treatments consist of moisturizers, emollients, and keratolytic agents. In this respect, the development of new formulations based on nanotechnology could be useful to enhance their therapeutic effectiveness. In this article, we provide a comprehensive description of pharmacological treatments for cutaneous manifestations in patients with inherited ichthyosis and discuss novel approaches with therapeutic potential for this purpose.

Adenosine receptor activation in brain capillaries can modulate blood-brain  permeability by decreasing the protein levels and  of efflux transporters. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether the activation of adenosine receptors improves convulsions outcome in carbamazepine (CBZ) resistant animals and modulates the protein levels of efflux transporters (P-GP, MRP1, MRP2) in brain capillaries. We employed the window-pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling model to develop CBZ resistant rats by CBZ administration during the post-kindling phase, and tested if these animals displayed subsequent resistance to other antiepileptic drugs. Crucially, we investigated if the administration of a broad-spectrum adenosine agonist (NECA) improves convulsions control in CBZ resistant rats. Of potential therapeutic relevance, in CBZ resistant rats NECA restored the anticonvulsant effect of CBZ. We also evaluated how the resistance to CBZ and the activation of adenosine receptors with NECA affect protein levels of efflux transporters in brain capillaries, as quantified by western blot. While CBZ resistance was associated with the up-regulation of both P-GP/MRP2 in brain capillaries, with the administration of NECA in CBZ resistant rats, we observed a decrease of P-GP and an increase of MRP2 levels, in brain capillaries. Since the activation of adenosine receptors improves the outcome of convulsions probably through the modulation of the efflux transporters protein levels in brain capillaries, adenosine agonists could be useful as an adjunct therapy for the control of Drug Resistant Epilepsy.Copyright © 2019.

High glucose per se, as well as glucose by-products, induce endothelial dysfunction in both large vessels and the microvasculature. Toxic glucose by-products include advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a group of modified proteins and/or lipids that become glycated after exposure to sugars, and glucose metabolites produced via the polyol pathway. These glucose-related endothelio-toxins notably induce an alteration of the glomerular filtration  by increasing the permeability of glomerular endothelial cells, altering endothelial glycocalyx, and finally, inducing endothelial cell apoptosis. The glomerular endothelial dysfunction results in albuminuria. In addition, high glucose and by-products impair the endothelial repair capacities by reducing the number and  of endothelial progenitor cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of renal endothelial toxicity of high glucose/glucose by-products, which encompass changes in synthesis of growth factors like TGF-β and VEGF, induction of oxidative stress and inflammation, and reduction of NO bioavailability.

In this article, in vitro and in vivo studies of argan (Argania spinosa), avocado (Persea americana), black cumin (Nigella sativa), calophyllum (Calophyllum inophyllum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), grape (Vitis vinifera), green coffee (Coffea arabica), lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), lucuma (Pouteria lucuma), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), pomegranate (Punica granatum), pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), rapeseed (Brassica napus), sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oils were reviewed. In many cases, vegetable oils proved to be more effective than synthetic wound-healing compounds used as controls. The fatty-acid components of vegetable oils are assumed to play a major role in the wound-healing process, in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid. Evidence shows that oils with a higher linoleic to oleic acid ratio are more effective for lipid  repair.

Changes in the passage of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) across the blood-brain  (BBB) with an increased cerebral influx of aromatic amino acids into the brain may concurrently be present and also contribute to encephalopathy, but it has not been established whether hypoxaemia  may trigger such changes. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 11 healthy men using the Kety-Schmidt technique and obtained paired arterial and jugular-venous blood samples for the determination of LNAAs by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and after 9 hours of poikilocapnic normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Transcerebral net exchange was determined by the Fick principle, and transport of LNAAs across the BBB was determined mathematically. Hypoxia increased both the systemic and corresponding cerebral delivery of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, and the branched-chain amino acids leucine and isoleucine. Despite this, the transcerebral net exchange values and mathematically derived brain extracellular concentrations for all LNAAs were unaffected. In conclusion, the observed changes in circulating LNAAs triggered by hypoxaemia do not affect the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs to such an extent that their brain extracellular concentrations are affected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593118>Age-specific reference values for cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations in children in southern China.</a></h2><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein values decline over the first few months of life as the infant's blood-CSF  matures. However, published studies have not reported CSF protein reference values of Chinese infants and differ in the reported rate, timing, and magnitude of this decline. The objective of this study was to determine reference intervals for CSF protein using available data of children in southern China. This retrospective study included infants who had a lumbar puncture (LP) performed in the Department of Pediatrics of Southern Medical University Affiliated Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Foshan of an urban tertiary care children's hospital between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2018. Infants with conditions suspected or known to cause elevated CSF protein concentrations were excluded. Of 3712 infants undergoing LP, 1043 (28.1%) met inclusion criteria. Results showed that there is an age-related decline in CSF protein concentration. The median CSF protein value was 62 mg/dL [interquartile range (IQR): 47-81 mg/dL] in infants aged 0 to 56 days (group 1). The 95th percentile values were 116 mg/dL for infants 0 to 28 days and 80 mg/dL for infants 29 to 56 days. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages 0 to 14 days, 117 mg/dL; ages 15 to 28 days, 107 mg/dL; ages 29 to 42 days, 96 mg/dL; and ages 43 to 56 days, 74 mg/dL. The median CSF protein value was 21 mg/dL (IQR: 16-31 mg/dL) in infants aged 2 months to <3 years (group 2). The 95th percentile values were 57 mg/dL for infants 2 to <6 months and 34 mg/dL for infants 6 to ≤24 months. The 95th percentile values by age category were as follows: ages 2 to <3 months, 66 mg/dL; ages 3 to <4 months, 52 mg/dL; ages 4 to <5 months, 53 mg/dL; and ages 5 to <6 months, 42 mg/dL. We quantify the age-related decline in CSF protein concentrations among infants 2 years of age and younger and provide age-specific reference values.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal  in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal   is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of microbiota composition and , intestinal  integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

We found that Hsd11b2 is highly expressed in endometrial stromal cells on days 3 and 4 of pregnancy and mainly upregulated by progesterone (P4). In both ovariectomized mice and cultured stromal cells, P4 significantly stimulates Hsd11b2 expression. P4 stimulation of Hsd11b2 is mainly mediated by the Ihh pathway. The uterine level of Corticosterone (Cort) is regulated by Hsd11b2 during preimplantation. Embryo development and the number of inner cell mass cells are suppressed by Cort treatment. These results indicate that P4 should provide a low Cort environment for the development of preimplantation mouse embryos by promoting the expression of uterine Hsd11b2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590613>Heterogeneous Cellular Contributions to Elastic Laminae Formation in Arterial Wall Development.</a></h2><p> Elastin is an important extracellular matrix protein in large and small arteries. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) produce the layered elastic laminae found in elastic arteries but synthesize little elastin in muscular arteries. However, muscular arteries have a well-defined internal elastic lamina (IEL) that separates endothelial cells (ECs) from SMCs. The extent to which endothelial cells (ECs) contribute elastin to the IEL is unknown.  To use targeted elastin knockout mice to explore the relative contributions of SMCs and ECs to elastic laminae formation in different arteries.  We used SMC- and EC-specific Cre recombinase transgenes with a novel floxed Eln allele to focus gene inactivation in mice. Inactivation of Eln in SMCs using Sm22aCre resulted in depletion of elastic laminae in the arterial wall with the exception of the IEL and SMC clusters in the outer media near the adventitia. Inactivation of elastin in ECs using Tie2Cre or Cdh5Cre resulted in normal medial elastin as well as a typical IEL in elastic arteries. In contrast, the IEL was absent or severely disrupted in muscular arteries. Interruptions in the IEL resulted in neointimal formation in the ascending aorta but not in muscular arteries.  Combined with lineage-specific fate mapping systems, our knockout results document an unexpected heterogeneity in vascular cells that produce the elastic laminae. SMCs and ECs can independently form an IEL in most elastic arteries, whereas ECs are the major source of elastin for the IEL in muscular and resistance arteries. Neointimal formation at IEL disruptions in the ascending aorta confirms that the IEL is a critical physical  between SMCs and ECs in the large, elastic arteries. Our studies provide new information about how SMCs and ECs contribute elastin to the arterial wall and how local elastic laminae defects may contribute to cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654819>Integrated electrochemical measurement of endothelial permeability in a 3D hydrogel-based microfluidic vascular model.</a></h2><p>Mimicking the physiological or pathophysiological   of endothelial and epithelial cells is an essential consideration in organ-on-a-chip models of numerous tissues including the vascular system, lungs, gut and blood-brain . Recent models have furthermore incorporated 3D extracellular matrix hydrogels to recapitulate the composition and cell-matrix interactions found in the native microenvironment. Assessment of   in these 3D organ-on-a-chip models, however, is typically limited to diffusive permeability measurements that are exclusively fluorescence-based. In this work, an on-chip electrochemical method to measure endothelial permeability in a 3D hydrogel-based vascular model was developed that replaces the ubiquitous fluorescent tracer with an electroactive one. Unlike the traditional fluorescent-based method, this electrochemical method eliminates the need for bulky, costly and complex optical instrumentation that require measurements to be performed outside of the incubator. A 3D extracellular matrix gel-based microfluidic model was first developed that incorporates capillary pressure  microstructures. Micromilling of thermoplastics was used to fabricate these microstructures in a rapid, moldless fashion. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the permeability of endothelial cells cultured on hydrogels was electrochemically measured after being subject to perfusion conditions, and following exposure to known permeability mediators. In summary, the electrochemical permeability assay possesses both the benefits of on-chip integration and robustness of the traditional fluorescence-based assay while also enabling the measurement of   in an organ-on-a-chip incorporating 3D culture conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) are molecular oxygen sensors that control adaptive gene expression through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Emerging evidence supports PHDs as being therapeutic targets in intestinal inflammation. However, pharmacological inhibition of PHDs has not been validated as a treatment strategy in pouchitis.PHD1-3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed in mucosal pouch and prepouch ileal patient biopsies. After establishment of a preclinical IPAA model in rats, the impact of the pan-PHD small-molecule inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced pouchitis was studied. Clinical and molecular parameters were investigated.PHD1, but not PHD2 or PHD3, was overexpressed in pouchitis in biopsies of patients with IPAA for UC but not FAP. In addition, PHD1 expression correlated with disease activity. DMOG treatment profoundly mitigated DSS-induced pouchitis in a rodent IPAA model. Mechanistically, DMOG restored intestinal epithelial   by induction of tight junction proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1 and alleviation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, thus attenuating pouch inflammation.Together, these results establish a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting PHD1 with small-molecule inhibitors in pouchitis after IPAA for UC.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Such infants may continue to grow slowly after birth, regardless of birth weight (BW), due to morbidities related to their immature organs. Severe GR increases the susceptibility to infections, but it is not clear if this is a consequence of impaired systemic immunity or other factors, such as prolonged hospital stay or poor mucosal  . Using preterm pigs as models for preterm infants, we hypothesized that moderate GR, exerting limited clinical effects, does not influence systemic immune development.  Preterm pigs were delivered by cesarean section and fed bovine milk diets until 19 d. Piglets with fetal growth restriction (F-GR, the lowest 25% of BW,  = 27, excluding those with BW <350 g) and postnatal growth restriction (P-GR, the lowest 25% of postnatal growth rate,  = 24) were compared with their corresponding controls (F-CON,  = 92, and P-CON,  = 85, respectively). Organ weights were determined and blood collected for assessment of clinical status (blood chemistry and hematology). For a subgroup ( = 58), in depth analyses of neutrophil , T cell counts, plasma cytokine levels, and leucocyte gene expression were performed.  For F-GR pigs, adrenal gland weight was increased and bone mineral content decreased at 19 d. Total leucocyte levels were lower at birth and interleukin-10 levels increased at d 8-10. In P-GR pigs, total leucocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts along with helper T cell fractions were elevated at 8-19 d of age, while the fraction of neutrophils with phagocytic capacity was reduced. Diarrhea and all remaining organ weights, blood chemistry, and immune variables were not affected by F-GR or P-GR.  Moderate GR before and after preterm birth has limited effect on systemic immune development in preterm pigs, despite marginal effects on immune cell populations, adrenocortical , and body composition. Similar responses may be observed for preterm infants with moderate fetal and postnatal growth restriction.Copyright © 2019 Bæk, Sangild, Thymann and Nguyen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589828>The Roles of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 13 in Spinal Cord Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>Spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) remains an unresolved complication and its underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we studied the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) in a rat model of SCII. We examined the time course and cellular distribution of CXCL13 protein in rats after SCII. The effects of siRNA targeting CXCL13 or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) in SCII were also investigated. Neurological , histological assessment, and disruption of the blood-spinal cord  (BSCB) were evaluated. The expression levels of CXCL13, CXCR5, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), caspase-3, interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and IL-1β were determined. We found that SCII resulted in impaired hind limb  and increased the expression of CXCL13. In addition, CXCL13 expression demonstrated the most pronounced effect at 24 h after SCII. We reveal that CXCL13 protein was co-expressed with the mature neuron marker NeuN and the microglial marker IBA-1 in spinal cord tissues of model rats. SCII also increased the expression of CXCR5, p-ERK, caspase-3, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β at 24 h after SCII. Pre-treatment with CXCL13 siRNA protected the rats against SCII and decreased the expression of signalling pathway proteins and proinflammatory cytokines mentioned above. CXCR5 siRNA also showed similar protective effects. These findings indicate that CXCL13 is involved in SCII. The CXCL13/CXCR5 axis promotes the development of SCII, possibly via ERK-mediated pathways. Targeting the mechanism of CXCL13 involved in the development of SCII might be a potential approach for the treatment of this condition.Copyright © 2019.

While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut  dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636247>An Autopsy Case of Pulmonary Capillary Hemangiomatosis with an Electron Microscopy Study.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) are rare diseases that share clinical, X-ray, and histological features. Most patients have poor prognosis due to severe respiratory impairment. Recently, EIF2AK4 mutations were found in some patients with PCH and PVOD, but the role of this mutation is still unknown. We report an autopsy case of PCH and discuss a mechanism of respiratory dysfunction based on an electron microscopy study. CASE REPORT The patient was a Japanese man in his sixties. He suffered from acute exacerbation of dyspnea during treatment of COPD. Respiratory  testing revealed DLCO' 32.1% and DLCO'/VA 23.6%. Echocardiography demonstrated findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension. A CT scan showed mild emphysema and small ground-glass opacity in the lungs. However, we could not find the exact cause of his respiratory failure and he died 28 days after admission. At autopsy, the histology showed multilayering capillary proliferation within the alveolar walls. Electron microscopy examination revealed prominent widening of the air-blood , scarce fusion of the epithelial and capillary basement membranes, and frequent narrowing of the capillary lumen. CONCLUSIONS We reported an autopsy case with PCH with no histological findings of PVOD. Whether PCH and PVOD are 2 different histological patterns of the same disease remains to be verified. The changes in the air-blood  detected by electron microscopy may explain the respiratory impairment and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581253>Obesity-associated insulin resistance adversely affects skin .</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to identify changes in skin  associated with obesity and the mechanisms underlying these changes. Functional changes and gene expression in skin were investigated in C57BL/6J mice fed either a control or high-fat diet (HFD). The insulin responsiveness of the skin and skeletal muscle was also evaluated. The effects of inhibiting insulin signaling and altered glucose concentration on skin -associated molecules and   were analyzed in keratinocytes. HFD-fed mice were not only severely obese, but also exhibited impaired skin   and diminished levels of glycerol transporter aquaporin-3, keratins, and desmosomal proteins involved in maintaining skin structure. Moreover, the expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules was altered. Insulin signaling was attenuated in the skin and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. In keratinocytes, inhibition of insulin signaling leads to decreased keratin expression and diminished  , and higher glucose concentrations increased the expression of CDK inhibitor 1A and 1C, which are associated with cell-cycle arrest. Obesity-associated impairment of skin  can be attributed to structural fragility, abnormal glycerol transport, and dysregulated proliferation of epidermal cells. These alterations are at least partly due to cutaneous insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586306>The mechanobiology of tight junctions.</a></h2><p>Tight junctions (TJ) play a central role in the homeostasis of epithelial and endothelial tissues, by providing a semipermeable  to ions and solutes, by contributing to the maintenance of cell polarity, and by functioning as signaling platforms.

To noninvasively analyze the physiological properties of the skin  functionin vivo, it is important to determine the SC thickness. Confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) is widely used for this task. In the present in vivo study, a new method based on the determination of the DNA concentration profile using CRM is introduced for determining the SC thickness. The obtained SC thickness values are compared with those obtained using other CRM-based methods determining the water and lipid depth profiles. The obtained results show almost no significant differences in SC thickness for the utilized methods. Therefore, the results indicate that it is possible to calculate the SC thickness by using the DNA profile in the fingerprint region, which is comparable with the SC thickness calculated by the water depth profiles (ANOVA test p = 0.77) and the lipid depth profile (ANOVA test p = 0.74). This provides the possibility to measure the SC thickness by using the DNA profile, in case the water or lipid profile analyses are influenced by a topically applied formulation. The increase in DNA concentration in the superficial SC (0-2 µm) is related to the DNA presence in the microbiome of the skin, which was not present in the SC depth below 4 µm.© 2019 S.

The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a  structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the  effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the integrity of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model.

Metformin is reported to have an antioxidant effect; however, the precise role of metformin in obesity-induced male infertility remains unknown. The current study is aimed at exploring the effects of metformin and characterizing its underlying mechanism in the fertility of obese males.An obese male mouse model was generated by feeding mice with a high-fat diet; then, the mice were administered metformin in water for 8 weeks. Reproductive ability, metabolic parameters, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were assessed by cohabitation, enzymatic methods, and ELISA, respectively. Damage to the integrity of the blood-testis  (BTB), which ensures spermatogenesis, was assessed by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence with a biotin tracer. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were employed for the assessments of oxidative stress. BTB-related proteins were measured by immunoblotting. Nuclear factor B (NF-B) was assessed by immunofluorescence.High-fat-diet-fed mice presented evident lipid metabolic disturbances, disrupted BTB integrity, and decreased reproductive . Metformin alleviated the decrease in male fertility, decreased ectopic lipid deposition in the testis, and increased serum FSH levels. A further mechanistic analysis revealed that metformin ameliorated the high-fat-diet-induced injury to the BTB structure and permeability and restored the disordered BTB-related proteins, which might be associated with an improvement in oxidative stress and a recovery of NF-B activity in Sertoli cells (SCs).Metformin improves obese male fertility by alleviating oxidative stress-induced BTB damage. These findings provide new insights into the effect of metformin on various diseases and suggest future possibilities in the treatment of male infertility.Copyright © 2019 Jifeng Ye et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617312>Emerging links between cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases-a special role for pericytes.</a></h2><p>Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases cause considerable human suffering, and therapy options for these two disease categories are limited or non-existing.

To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 and reactive oxygen species, and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides at the vascular endothelium.

The major histocompatibility complex MHC, named the Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system in humans, represents a vital  structure in the organism by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells as the main initial step of the adaptive immune response. The huge level of polymorphism observed in HLA genes definitely reflects selection, favouring heterozygosity at the individual or population level, in a pathogen-rich environment, although many are located in introns or in exons that do not code for the antigen-biding site of the HLA. Over the past three decades, the extent of allelic diversity at HLA loci has been well characterized using high-resolution HLA-DNA typing and the number of new HLA alleles, produced through next-generation sequencing methods, is even more rapidly increasing. The level of the HLA system polymorphism represents an obstacle to the search of potential compatible donors for patients affected by haematological disease proposed for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Data reported in literature clearly show that antigenic and/or allelic mismatches between related or unrelated donors and patients influences the successful HSCT outcome. However, the recent development of the new transplant strategy based on the choice of haploidentical donors for HSCT is questioning the role of HLA compatibility, since the great HLA disparities present do not worsen the overall clinical outcome. Nowadays, NGS has contributed to define at allelic levels the HLA polymorphism and solve potential ambiguities. However, HLA functions and tissue typing probably need to be further investigated in the next future, to understand the reasons why in haploidentical transplants the presence of a whole mismatch haplotype between donors and recipients, both the survival rate and the incidence of acute GvHD or graft rejection are similar to those reported for unrelated HSCTs.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601835>Bioassay for Endothelial Damage Mediators Retrieved by Hemoadsorption.</a></h2><p>Hemoadsorption devices are used to treat septic shock by adsorbing inflammatory cytokines and as yet incompletely defined danger and pathogen associated molecular patterns. In an ideal case, hemoadsorption results in immediate recovery of microvascular endothelial cells' (mEC)  and rapid recovery from catecholamine-dependency and septic shock. We here tested a single device, which consists of polystyrene-divinylbenzene core particles of 450 μm diameter with a high affinity for hydrophobic compounds. The current study aimed at the proof of concept that endothelial-specific damage mediators are adsorbed and can be recovered from hemoadsorption devices. Because of excellent clinical experience, we tested protein fractions released from a hemoadsorber in a novel endothelial bioassay. Video-based, long-term imaging of mEC proliferation and cell death were evaluated and combined with apoptosis and ATP measurements. Out of a total of 39 fractions recovered from column fractionation, we identified 3 fractions that caused i) inhibition of mEC proliferation, ii) increased cell death and iii) induction of apoptosis in mEC. When adding these 3 fractions to mEC, their ATP contents were reduced. These fractions contained proteins of approximately 15 kDa, and high amounts of nucleic acid, which was at least in part oxidized. The efficacy for endothelial cell damage prevention by hemoadsorption can be addressed by a novel endothelial bioassay and long-term video observation procedures. Protein fractionation of the hemoadsorption devices used is feasible to study and define endothelial damage ligands on a molecular level. The results suggest a significant effect by circulating nucleic acids - bound to an as yet undefined protein, which may constitute a major danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in the exacerbation of inflammation when patients experience septic shock.

Proteomic dysregulation is considered the key factor for neurodegeneration. Mechanisms involving deregulated processing of proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomerization; tau hyperphosphorylation, prion misfolding; α-synuclein accumulation/lewy body formation, chaperone deregulation, acetylcholine depletion, adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor hyperactivation, secretase deregulation, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation and mitochondrial proteinopathies have deeper implications in neurodegenerative disorders. Better understanding of such pathological mechanisms is pivotal for exploring crucial drug targets. Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook about the diverse proteomic irregularities in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). We explicate the role of key neuroproteomic drug targets notably Aβ, tau, alpha synuclein, prions, secretases, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), LRRK2, molecular chaperones, A2A receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) and mitochondrial/oxidative stress-related proteins for combating neurodegeneration and associated cognitive and motor impairment. Cross talk between amyloidopathy, synucleinopathy, tauopathy and several other proteinopathies pinpoints the need to develop safe therapeutics with ability to strike multiple targets in the aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Therapeutics like microtubule stabilisers, chaperones, kinase inhibitors, anti-aggregation agents and antibodies could serve promising regimens for treating neurodegeneration.

The questionnaire included demographic data, such as nationality, the practitioner's affiliated specialist category and their respective qualifications. Other data included their main sources of education pertaining to implant dentistry, the most commonly used implant systems, common clinical complications, and barriers to implant therapy. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data was carried out.A significant majority of non-Saudi dental practitioners were employed in the private sector (p = 0.001), whereas a significant majority of Saudi dental practitioners were employed in the state sector (p = 0.001). The largest group of practitioners performing implants were general dentists (48.1%). The 3iTM implant system was the most widely utilized (35.4%). Failed osseointegration (12.6%) and peri-implantitis (12%) were the most common clinical complications. The biggest  to placing implants was the cost of implants to patients (59.1%).Fundamental to implant practice is the clinical practitioner and patient selection. The utilization of implant systems should preferably be based on the chemical properties of implant surfaces which promote early osseointegration.

In the case of nonpassivated MoS TFTs, increase of off-current is observed with NO gas, which has been modeled with the modulation of the effective Schottky  height for holes because of the generation of in-gap states near the valence band as NO gases interact with the MoS channel. The nonpassivated MoS TFTs are simulated based on nonequilibrium Green's  method, and the simulation results do confirm this sensing mechanism. On the other hand, MoS TFTs with the AlO passivation layer have been modeled with a pseudo-double gate structure as NO gases on the capping layer can act like the secondary gate inducing the positive charge state. Our quantum transport simulation shows that the significant threshold voltage shift can be achieved with NO gas, which matches the experimental observation, thereby exhibiting a completely different sensing mechanism of the passivated device from the nonpassivated counterpart. In addition, we also discuss competing device parameters for the passivated MoS TFTs by varying the main and the secondary gate dielectric, suggesting co-optimization to realize high sensitivity and low power consumption simultaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619276>Disruption of gut integrity and permeability contributes to enteritis in a fish-parasite model: a story told from serum metabolomics.</a></h2><p>In the animal production sector, enteritis is responsible for serious economic losses, and intestinal parasitism is a major stress factor leading to malnutrition and lowered performance and animal production efficiency. The effect of enteric parasites on the gut  of teleost fish, which represent the most ancient bony vertebrates, is far from being understood. The intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum leei dwells between gut epithelial cells and causes severe enteritis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), anorexia, cachexia, growth impairment, reduced marketability and increased mortality.This study aimed to outline the gut failure in this fish-parasite model using a multifaceted approach and to find and validate non-lethal serum markers of gut  dysfunction. Intestinal integrity was studied in parasitized and non-parasitized fish by immunohistochemistry with specific markers for cellular adhesion (E-cadherin) and tight junctions (Tjp1 and Cldn3) and by functional studies of permeability (oral administration of FITC-dextran) and electrophysiology (Ussing chambers). Serum samples from parasitized and non-parasitized fish were analyzed using non-targeted metabolomics and some significantly altered metabolites were selected to be validated using commercial kits.The immunodetection of Tjp1 and Cldn3 was significantly lower in the intestine of parasitized fish, while no strong differences were found in E-cadherin. Parasitized fish showed a significant increase in paracellular uptake measured by FITC-dextran detection in serum. Electrophysiology showed a decrease in transepithelial resistance in infected animals, which showed a diarrheic profile. Serum metabolomics revealed 3702 ions, from which the differential expression of 20 identified compounds significantly separated control from infected groups in multivariate analyses. Of these compounds, serum inosine (decreased) and creatine (increased) were identified as relevant and validated with commercial kits.The results demonstrate the disruption of tight junctions and the loss of gut  , a metabolomic profile of absorption dysfunction and anorexia, which further outline the pathophysiological effects of E. leei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646766>Transcriptomic and  responses of human airway epithelial cells exposed to cannabis smoke.</a></h2><p>Globally, many jurisdictions are legalizing or decriminalizing cannabis, creating a potential public health issue that would benefit from experimental evidence to inform policy, government regulations, and user practices. Tobacco smoke exposure science has created a body of knowledge that demonstrates the conclusive negative impacts on respiratory health; similar knowledge remains to be established for cannabis. To address this unmet need, we performed in vitro functional and transcriptomic experiments with a human airway epithelial cell line (Calu-3) exposed to cannabis smoke, with tobacco smoke as a positive control. Demonstrating the validity of our in vitro model, tobacco smoke induced gene expression profiles that were significantly correlated with gene expression profiles from published tobacco exposure datasets from bronchial brushings and primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. Applying our model to cannabis smoke, we demonstrate that cannabis smoke induced functional and transcriptional responses that overlapped with tobacco smoke. Ontology and pathway analysis revealed that cannabis smoke induced DNA replication and oxidative stress responses. Functionally, cannabis smoke impaired epithelial cell  , antiviral responses, and increased inflammatory mediator production. Our study reveals striking similarities between cannabis and tobacco smoke exposure on impairing  , suppressing antiviral pathways, potentiating of pro-inflammatory mediators, and inducing oncogenic and oxidative stress gene expression signatures. Collectively our data suggest that cannabis smoke exposure is not innocuous and may possess many of the deleterious properties of tobacco smoke, warranting additional studies to support public policy, government regulations, and user practices.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the metabolite-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate colonic ILC3s remain poorly understood. We found that colonic ILC3s expressed Ffar2, a microbial metabolite-sensing receptor, and that Ffar2 agonism promoted ILC3 expansion and . Deficiency of Ffar2 in ILC3s decreased their in situ proliferation and ILC3-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) production. This led to impaired gut epithelial  characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to colonic injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22 CCR6 ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in colonic lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis. Our findings suggest that Ffar2 regulates colonic ILC3 proliferation and , and they identify an ILC3-receptor signaling pathway modulating gut homeostasis and pathogen defense.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We explored the effects of G-CSF on vascular endothelium and white matter (WM) injury in cerebral small vessel disease(CSVD) via the model of spontaneously hypertensive rat(SHR) so as to elucidate the mechanism of G-CSF on vascular cognitive impairment(VCI).24 week male SHRs were randomly divided into treatment group and model group , with the same age wistar as the control group. The novel object recognition test (NORT)and Morris water maze were conducted after 7 days' G-CSF(50ug/kg) or normal saline treatment to examine their non-spatial and spatial cognitive . After that, we use transmission electron microscope(TEM) and FLB staining to observe the vascular endothelial cell and WM damage. Furthermore, the expression of VEGF, MMP-9, Caspase-3 ,TUNEL and BrdU-Laminin in cortical area were detected by immunostaining methods.Our results showed that G-CSF promoted the expression of VEGF and BrdU+-Laminin+ endothelial cells,but down regulated the level of MMP-9, thus significantly repaired cerebral vascular endothelial cells and perivascular structure in SHR. The WM damage and the expression of caspase-3 and the apoptosis rate decreased after G-CSF treatment. Ultimately, G-CSF improved the non-spatial cognitive  in SHR rather than spatial cognitive .Therefore,our findings indicated that G-CSF may facilitate non-spatial cognitive  improvement in CSVD by repairing endothelial cells and alleviating WM damage.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583535>UK renal transplant outcomes in low and high BMI recipients: the need for a national policy.</a></h2><p>We assessed the effect of recipient body mass index (BMI) on the outcomes of renal transplantation and the management of obese patients with end-stage renal disease across the UK.We analyzed data of 25539 adult renal transplants (2007-2016) from the UK Transplant Registry.

Here we perform a comparative analysis of skin microbial communities coupled to global patterns of cutaneous gene expression in patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. The skin microbiota is analysed by 16S amplicon or whole genome sequencing and the skin transcriptome by microarrays, followed by integration of the data layers. We find that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis can be classified by distinct microbes, which differ from healthy volunteers microbiome composition. Atopic dermatitis is dominated by a single microbe (Staphylococcus aureus), and associated with a disease relevant host transcriptomic signature enriched for skin  , tryptophan metabolism and immune activation. In contrast, psoriasis is characterized by co-occurring communities of microbes with weak associations with disease related gene expression.

The response mechanisms of isolated cells to such stimuli have been investigated in great detail. By contrast, little is known about the emergent multicellular responses to environmental changes, such as antibiotic exposure, which may hold the key to understanding the structure and functions of the most common type of bacterial communities: biofilms. Here, by monitoring all individual cells in Vibrio cholerae biofilms during exposure to antibiotics that are commonly administered for cholera infections, we found that translational inhibitors cause strong effects on cell size and shape, as well as biofilm architectural properties. We identified that single-cell-level responses result from the metabolic consequences of inhibition of protein synthesis and that the community-level responses result from an interplay of matrix composition, matrix dissociation and mechanical interactions between cells. We further observed that the antibiotic-induced changes in biofilm architecture have substantial effects on biofilm population dynamics and community assembly by enabling invasion of biofilms by bacteriophages and intruder cells of different species. These mechanistic causes and ecological consequences of biofilm exposure to antibiotics are an important step towards understanding collective bacterial responses to environmental changes, with implications for the effects of antimicrobial therapy on the ecological succession of biofilm communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614181>Microglia in developing white matter and perinatal brain injury.</a></h2><p>Perinatal brain injury (PBI) to the developing white matter results in hypomyelination of axons and can cause long-term motor and cognitive deficits e.g. cerebral palsy.

Despite having in common the contact of the gastrointestinal mucosa with components of wheat and other cereals as a causative factor, these clinical entities have distinct pathophysiological pathways. In celiac disease, a T-cell mediate immune reaction triggered by gluten ingestion is central in the pathogenesis of the enteropathy, while wheat allergy develops as a rapid immunoglobulin E- or non-immunoglobulin E-mediated immune response. In non-celiac wheat sensitivity, classical adaptive immune responses are not involved. Instead, recent research has revealed that an innate immune response to a yet-to-be-defined antigen, as well as the gut microbiota, are pivotal in the development in this disorder. Although impairment of the epithelial  has been described in all three clinical conditions, its role as a potential pathogenetic co-factor, specifically in celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity, is still a matter of investigation. This article gives a short overview of the mucosal  of the small intestine, summarizes the aspects of  dysfunction observed in all three gluten-related disorders and reviews literature data in favor of a primary involvement of the epithelial  in the development of celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606552>The Candida albicans exotoxin Candidalysin promotes alcohol-associated liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alcohol-associated liver disease is a leading indication for liver transplantation and leading cause of mortality. Alterations of the gut microbiota contribute to pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased proportions of Candida spp. in the fecal mycobiome. However, little is known about the effect of intestinal Candida on alcohol-associated liver disease. Here we evaluated the contributions of Candida albicans and its exotoxin Candidalysin on alcoholic liver disease.C. albicans and ECE1 were analyzed in fecal samples from controls, patients with alcohol use disorder and alcoholic hepatitis. Mice colonized with different and genetically manipulated C. albicans strains were subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and incubated with Candidalysin.The percentages of subjects carrying ECE1 are 0%, 4.76% and 30.77% in non-alcoholic controls, alcohol use disorder patients and alcoholic hepatitis patients, respectively. Candidalysin exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease and is associated with increased mortality in mice. Candidalysin enhances ethanol-induced liver disease independent of the β-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone-marrow derived cells, and Candidalysin does not alter gut  . Candidalysin can damage primary hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and is associated with liver disease severity and mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.Candidalysin is associated with progression of ethanol-induced liver disease in preclinical models and worse clinical outcomes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.Candidalysin is a peptide toxin secreted by the commensal gut fungus Candida albicans. Candidalysin enhances alcohol-associated liver disease independent of the β-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone-marrow derived cells in mice without affecting intestinal permeability.

Previous reports showed that sleep loss decreased sperm viability and progressive fast mobility, which may be a consequence of altered blood-testis and blood-epididymis . Therefore, we quantified changes in blood-testis and blood-epididymis  after sleep loss and related them to male fertility. Adult male Wistar rats were sleep restricted using the multiple-platform technique in a protocol of 20 hr daily sleep deprivation plus 4 hr of sleep recovery in the home-cage. At the 10th day,  permeability assays were performed with Na-fluorescein, 10 kDa Cascade blue-dextrans and Evans blue, and the expression of tight junction proteins, actin and androgen receptor was quantified. At the 10th day of sleep restriction and after sleep recovery days 1-7, males were placed with sexually receptive females, sexual behaviour was tested, and the percentage of pregnancies was calculated. Sleep restriction increased the  permeability to low- and high-molecular-weight tracers, and decreased the expression of tight junction proteins, actin and androgen receptor. Concomitantly, sleep restriction reduced the percentage of ejaculating males and the number of pregnancies. Sleep recovery for 2-3 days progressively re-established fertility, as indicated by a higher percentage of ejaculating males and impregnated females. In conclusion, chronic sleep loss alters fertility concomitantly with the disruption of the blood-tissue barriers at the reproductive tract, the mechanism involves androgen signalling.© 2019 European Sleep Research Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599433>Akkermansia muciniphila: key player in metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota has a key role in host metabolic regulation and immune response, and its dysbiosis represents one of the main causes of gastrointestinal diseases. In this scenario, Akkermansia muciniphila is a crucial player in keeping the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract.This review focuses on the correlation between gut microbiota and intestinal homeostasis, primarily exploring A. muciniphila and its involvement in the development of metabolic disorders and gastrointestinal diseases.Akkermansia muciniphila belongs to the Verrucomicrobia phylum, and it colonizes the mucus layer in the gastrointestinal tract, representing 1 to 4% of the fecal microbiota. It stimulates mucosal microbial networks, and it improves intestinal  , providing crucial host immunological responses. Several studies have demonstrated the possible involvement of A. muciniphila in the development of intestinal and metabolic disorders. Indeed, adipose and glucose metabolisms are influenced by A. muciniphila, and its levels inversely correlate to inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and diabetes. Conversely, its therapeutic administration decreases their development.A. muciniphila exerts a key role in the maintenance of intestinal health and in host metabolic modulation.

Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, are serious complications that can result in increased 1-year mortality when superimposed on dementia. Importantly, there are no disease-modifying therapeutic options for PND. Our lab developed the "broad spectrum" mixed-lineage kinase 3 inhibitor URMC-099 to inhibit pathological innate immune responses that underlie neuroinflammation-associated cognitive dysfunction. Here, we test the hypothesis that URMC-099 can prevent surgery-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.Orthopedic surgery was performed by fracturing the tibia of the left hindlimb with intramedullary fixation under general anesthesia and analgesia. In a pilot experiment, 9-month-old mice were treated five times with URMC-099 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), spaced 12 h apart, with three doses prior to surgery and two doses following surgery. In this experiment, microgliosis was evaluated using unbiased stereology and blood-brain  (BBB) permeability was assessed using immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunostaining. In follow-up experiments, 3-month-old mice were treated only three times with URMC-099 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), spaced 12 h apart, prior to orthopedic surgery. Two-photon scanning laser microscopy and CLARITY with light-sheet microscopy were used to define surgery-induced changes in microglial dynamics and morphology, respectively. Surgery-induced memory impairment was assessed using the "What-Where-When" and Memory Load Object Discrimination tasks. The acute peripheral immune response to surgery was assessed by cytokine/chemokine profiling and flow cytometry. Finally, long-term fracture healing was assessed in fracture callouses using micro-computerized tomography (microCT) and histomorphometry analyses.Orthopedic surgery induced BBB disruption and microglial activation, but had no effect on microglial process motility. Surgically treated mice exhibited impaired object place and identity discrimination in the "What-Where-When" and Memory Load Object Discrimination tasks. Both URMC-099 dosing paradigms prevented the neuroinflammatory sequelae that accompanied orthopedic surgery. URMC-099 prophylaxis had no effect on the mobilization of the peripheral innate immune response and fracture healing.These findings show that prophylactic URMC-099 treatment is sufficient to prevent surgery-induced microgliosis and cognitive impairment without affecting fracture healing. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence for the advancement of URMC-099 as a therapeutic option for PND.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603990>Cystatin C Improves Blood-Brain  Integrity After Ischemic Brain Injury in Mice.</a></h2><p>Cystatin C, a well-established biomarker of renal , has been associated with a protective effect against stroke. However, the potential neuroprotective mechanism of cystatin C in ischemic brain injury remains unclear. Our study hypothesized that cystatin C can ameliorate blood-brain  (BBB) disruption by upregulating caveolin-1 expression, thereby improving neurological outcomes in cerebral ischemic injury. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, and immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate target proteins. Evans Blue and gelatin zymography were used to examine the effect of cystatin C on BBB disruption. Plasmid and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was used to observe alterations in caveolin-1 and occludin expression induced by changes in cystatin C expression. Intriguingly, our study showed that the expression of both cystatin C and caveolin-1 was increased in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-injured mice, and pretreatment with exogenous cystatin C significantly increased caveolin-1 expression, reduced Evans Blue leakage in the injured brain region, and decreased the enzymatic activity of matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9). Meanwhile, our study also showed that the overexpression of cystatin C greatly enhanced caveolin-1 expression, which later increased occludin expression in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-exposed brain microvascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells. On the other hand, the knockdown of cystatin C induced the opposite outcomes. These experimental results indicate a positive role for cystatin C in the regulation of caveolin-1 and occludin expression in cerebral ischemic injury. Taken together, these data unveil a new mechanism of the regulation of caveolin-1 expression by cystatin C in the maintenance of BBB integrity after ischemic brain injury and provide new clues for the identification of potential therapeutic strategies for stroke.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602443>Altered short chain fatty acid profiles induced by dietary fiber intervention regulate AMPK levels and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on intestinal microbiota-mediated change in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile and intestinal homeostasis.

Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the microbiota composition of cecal digesta, microbiota-mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of microbiota- and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU).

Here, we apply noninvasive Xenon MR imaging and spectroscopy to identify patterns of regional gas transfer impairment and hemodynamics that are uniquely associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), left heart failure (LHF), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).Healthy volunteers (n=23) and patients with COPD (n=8), IPF (n=12), LHF (n=6), and PAH (n=10) underwent Xe gas transfer imaging and dynamic spectroscopy. For each patient, 3D maps were generated to depict ventilation,  uptake (Xe dissolved in interstitial tissue), and red blood cell (RBC) transfer (Xe dissolved in RBCs). Dynamic Xe spectroscopy was used to quantify cardiogenic oscillations in the RBC signal amplitude and frequency shift.Compared to healthy volunteers, all patient groups exhibited decreased ventilation and RBC transfer (p≤0.01, p≤0.01). Patients with COPD demonstrated more ventilation and  defects compared to all other groups (p≤0.02, p≤0.02). In contrast, IPF patients demonstrated elevated  uptake compared to all other groups (p≤0.007) and increased RBC amplitude and shift oscillations compared to healthy volunteers (p=0.007, p≤0.01). Patients with COPD and PAH both exhibited decreased RBC amplitude oscillations (p=0.02, p=0.005) compared to healthy volunteers. LHF was distinguishable from PAH by enhanced RBC amplitude oscillations (p=0.01).COPD, IPF, LHF, and PAH each exhibit unique Xe MR imaging and dynamic spectroscopy signatures.

For instance, its early diagnosis to identify individuals at risk has not been successful so far. AD animal models cannot be created without genetic pre-disposition or surgical manipulation. Single gene/protein delivery has so far failed to achieve significant clinical improvements in multifactorial AD. We hypothesize that the blood-brain  (BBB) penetration issues are the major obstacle in the development of current Alzheimer's causative, diagnostic, and multi-targeted therapeutic probes, and partly the cause of the failure of more than 99% of intervention trials. To overcome this problem, shuttle peptides or monoclonal antibodies for receptors on BBB can act as molecular Trojan horses to transport the fused novel classes of re-engineered AD causative agents, diagnostic probes, or multiple  neurovascular medicines across the BBB via receptor-mediated transport to cause, diagnose, or improve the AD phenotype, respectively. Here, we propose the design of such Trojan horses, comprising three essential components that could (i) reverse Aβ amyloidosis, (ii) clear liberated Aβ, and (iii) improve angiogenesis or endothelial metabolic dysfunction, besides alleviating the inflammation, to eventually enhance neuronal health, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive . Such Trojan horses can aid in AD research by diagnosing Aβ-oligomers at earlier stages, creating improved animal models by exposing transgenic animals to amyloid-inducing agents, and allowing treatment by novel neurovascular medicines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Inflammation and remodeling lead to esophageal rigidity, strictures, and dysphagia. TGFβ1 drives esophageal remodeling including epithelial  dysfunction and subepithelial fibrosis. A functional SNP in the TGFβ1 gene that increases its transcription (C-509T) is associated with elevated numbers of esophageal TGFβ1-expressing cells. We utilized esophageal biopsies and fibroblasts from TT-genotype EoE children to understand if TGFβ1 influenced fibroblast and epithelial cell  in vivo. Genotype TT EoE esophageal fibroblasts had higher baseline TGFβ1, collagen1α1, periostin, and MMP2 (p < 0.05) gene expression and distinct contractile properties compared with CC genotype (n = 6 subjects per genotype). In vitro TGFβ1 exposure caused greater induction of target gene expression in genotype CC fibroblasts (p < 0.05). Esophageal biopsies from TT-genotype subjects had significantly less epithelial membrane-bound E-cadherin (p < 0.01) and wider cluster distribution at nanometer resolution. TGFβ1 treatment of stratified primary human esophageal epithelial cells and spheroids disrupted transepithelial resistance (p < 0.001) and E-cadherin localization (p < 0.0001). A TGFβ1-receptor-I inhibitor improved TGFβ1-mediated E-cadherin mislocalization. These data suggest that EoE severity can depend on genotypic differences that increase in vivo exposure to TGFβ1.

Vepoloxamer is a nonionic surfactant that exerts potent hemorheologic and antithrombotic properties in various thrombotic diseases. The current study investigated the effect of vepoloxamer on tPA treatment in a rat model of embolic stroke. Methods- Male Wistar rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion were treated with the combination of vepoloxamer and tPA, vepoloxamer alone, tPA alone, or saline initiated 4 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Results- Monotherapy with tPA did not reduce infarct volume, and adversely potentiated microvascular thrombosis and vascular leakage compared with the saline treatment. Vepoloxamer monotherapy reduced infarct volume by 25% and improved brain perfusion. However, the combination treatment with vepoloxamer and tPA significantly reduced infarct volume by 32% and improved neurological , without increasing the incidence of gross hemorrhage. Compared with vepoloxamer alone, the combination treatment with vepoloxamer and tPA robustly reduced secondary thrombosis and tPA-augmented microvascular leakage and further improved brain perfusion, which was associated with substantial reductions of serum active PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) level and tPA-upregulated PAI-1 in the ischemic brain. Mechanistically, exosomes derived from platelets of ischemic rats treated with tPA-augmented cerebral endothelial  permeability and elevated protein levels of PAI-1 and TF (tissue factor) in the endothelial cells, whereas exosomes derived from platelets of rats subjected to the combination treatment with vepoloxamer and tPA diminished endothelial permeability augmented by tPA and fibrin and reduced PAI-1 and TF levels in the endothelial cells. Conclusions- The combination treatment with vepoloxamer and tPA exerts potent thrombolytic effects in rats subjected to acute ischemic stroke.

OLFM4 null mice had a significant 7-d survival benefit and less intestinal  dysfunction compared with WT. Early after IR, WT mice had worse mucosal damage on histologic examination. Experiments involving adoptive transfer of bone marrow demonstrated that the mortality phenotype associated with OLFM4-positive neutrophils was transferrable to OLFM4 null mice. After IR injury, WT mice also had increased intestinal tissue activation of NFκB and expression of iNOS, 2 signaling pathways previously demonstrated to be involved in intestinal IR injury. In combination, these experiments show that OLFM4-positive neutrophils are centrally involved in the pathologic pathway leading to intestinal damage and mortality after IR injury.

There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and  dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660049>Skin   in patients under radiation therapy due to the head and neck cancers - Preliminary study.</a></h2><p>To present the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of the skin after radiotherapy in regards of epidermal  .Radiodermatitis constitutes 95% of all side effects in patients after radiotherapy. The proper assessment of the severity of radiodermatitis can be determined using semi-quantitative clinical scores [Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE)].The most accepted way to analyze the epidermal   is to determine Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL).In prospective study, we included 16 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy or concomitant chemoradiation in whom we performed non-invasive assessments of the skin  , including TEWL measurement. The final analysis included 6 patients (4 treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, 2 with radical chemoradiation). Clinical assessment of irradiated skin was based on target lesion score (TLS) and CTCAE v 4.0.The mean TLS score in the middle of irradiation was 1.6 points, after last irradiation it was 2.3 points; 3 months later the mean TLS score was: 0. CTCAE v 4.0 criteria: 2 patients had grade 0, 3 patients - grade 1; 1 patient - grade 2. There were statistically significant differences in TEWL related to irradiated skin in the following time intervals: before vs. in the middle; before vs. day after; in the middle vs. day after; in the middle vs. 3 months after; day after vs. 3 months after.The study showed that radiotherapy causes skin  dysfunction in all patients independently of clinical radiodermatitis. The biophysical features of this dysfunction can precede clinical symptoms and they can be assessed by non-invasive and objective methods.© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Greater Poland Cancer Centre.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578523>The RIPK4-IRF6 signalling axis safeguards epidermal differentiation and  .</a></h2><p>The integrity of the mammalian epidermis depends on a balance of proliferation and differentiation in the resident population of stem cells. The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of tight junctions. Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the  of the epidermal .

When intestinal epithelial  integrity is compromised, commensal bacteria are likely to translocate from the gut lumen into the lamina propria. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria impact the  of gut Group 1 ILCs, especially ILC1s. Utilizing an  human colonic lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) model, we evaluated Group 1 ILC cytokine and cytolytic protein production in response to a panel of enteric Gram-positive and Gram-negative commensal and pathogenic bacteria. IFNγ-production by NK cells and ILC1s was significantly increased after LPMC exposure to Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria, but not after exposure to the Gram-positive bacteria commensals tested. Stimulation of IFNγ production from Group 1 ILCs was not through direct recognition of bacteria by NK cells or ILC1s, but rather required accessory cells within the LPMC population. Myeloid dendritic cells generated IL-12p70, IL-18, and IL-1β upon exposure to enteric bacteria and these cytokines contributed to Group 1 ILC production of IFNγ. Furthermore, Gram-negative commensal or pathogenic bacteria induced significant expression of Granzyme B in NK cells and ILC1s. Overall, these data demonstrate that some enteric commensal bacteria indirectly induce inflammatory cytokine production and cytolytic protein expression from human colonic Group 1 ILCs, a process which could contribute to inflammation in the setting of microbial translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645181>Effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation on immunity, antioxidative capacity and intestinal   in weaning piglets.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate effects of dietary supplementation of resveratrol on immunity, antioxidative capacity, intestinal   in weaning piglets.

The outer membrane is the major permeability  for many drug-like molecules, and the chemical properties that enable efficient uptake into mammalian cells fail to predict bacterial uptake. We have developed a computational method for accurate prospective prediction of outer membrane uptake of drug-like molecules, which we combine with a new medium-throughput experimental assay of outer membrane vesicle swelling. Parallel molecular dynamics simulations of compound uptake through  () OmpF are used to successfully and quantitatively predict experimental permeabilities measured via either outer membrane swelling or prior liposome-swelling measurements. These simulations are analyzed using an inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model to yield predictions of permeability. For most polar molecules we test, outer membrane permeability also correlates well with whole-cell uptake. The ability to accurately predict and measure outer membrane uptake of a wide variety of small molecules will enable simpler determination of which molecular scaffolds and which derivatives are most promising prior to extensive chemical synthesis. It will also assist in formulating a more systematic understanding of the chemical determinants of outer membrane permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657630>Intestinal epithelial deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 alters expression of inflammatory mediators and  .</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective  . We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

In a typical unfolding experiment at constant force, the total extension jumps between two values that correspond to the folded and unfolded states of the molecule. For several biomolecular systems, the committor, which is the probability to fold starting from a given extension, has been used to extract the molecular activation  (a technique known as "committor inversion"). In this work, we study the influence of the force probe, which is much larger than the molecule being measured, on the activation  obtained by committor inversion. We use a two-dimensional framework in which the diffusion coefficient of the molecule and of the pulling device can differ. We systematically study the free energy profile along the total extension obtained from the committor by numerically solving the Onsager equation and using Brownian dynamics simulations. We analyze the dependence of the extracted  on the linker stiffness, molecular  height, and diffusion anisotropy and, thus, establish the range of validity of committor inversion.

Drosophila is a common insect model, used to study  disruption related to aging, traumatic injury, or environmental stress. Net leak of a non-toxic dye (Brilliant blue FCF) from the gut lumen to the hemolymph is often used to identify  failure under these conditions, but Drosophila are capable of actively transporting structurally-similar compounds. Here, we examined whether cold stress (like other stresses) causes Brilliant blue FCF (BB-FCF) to appear in the hemolymph of flies fed the dye, and if so whether Drosophila are capable of clearing this dye from their body following chilling. Using in situ midgut leak and transport assays as well as Ramsay assays of Malpighian tubule transport, we tested whether these ionoregulatory epithelia can actively transport BB-FCF. In doing so, we found that the Drosophila midgut and Malpighian tubules can mobilize BB-FCF via an active transcellular pathway, suggesting that elevated concentrations of the dye in the hemolymph may occur from increased paracellular permeability, reduced transcellular clearance, or both.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining stem cell homeostasis and survival. However, the role of autophagy in mediating ADSC paracrine effects has not been thoroughly elucidated. We examined whether ADSCs participate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC)  damage in a paracrine manner and illuminated the role of autophagy in regulating ADSC paracrine effects. PMVECs and ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were cocultured without intercellular contact, and the microvascular   was assessed after LPS treatment. ADSC paracrine  was evaluated by detecting essential growth factors for endothelial cells. For in vivo experiments, ADSCs with or without autophagy inhibition were transplanted into LPS-induced lung-injury mice, and lung injury was assessed. ADSCs significantly alleviated LPS-induced microvascular  injury. In addition, ADSC paracrine levels of VEGF, FGF, and EGF were induced by LPS treatment, especially in the coculture condition. Inhibiting autophagy weakened the paracrine  and the protective effects of ADSCs on microvascular  injury. Moreover, ADSC transplantation alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, and inhibiting autophagy markedly weakened the therapeutic effect of ADSCs on lung injury. Together, these findings show that ADSC paracrine effects play a vital protective role in LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular  injury. Autophagy is a positive mediating factor in the paracrine process. These results are helpful for illuminating the role and mechanism of ADSC paracrine effects and developing effective therapies in acute lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588572>Chromogranin A and its fragments in cardiovascular, immunometabolic, and cancer regulation.</a></h2><p>Chromogranin A (CgA)-the index member of the chromogranin/secretogranin secretory protein family-is ubiquitously distributed in endocrine, neuroendocrine, and immune cells. Elevated levels of CgA-related polypeptides, consisting of full-length molecules and fragments, are detected in the blood of patients suffering from neuroendocrine tumors, heart failure, renal failure, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Full-length CgA and various CgA-derived peptides, including vasostatin-1, pancreastatin, catestatin, and serpinin, are expressed at different relative levels in normal and pathological conditions and exert diverse, and sometime opposite, biological functions. For example, CgA is overexpressed in genetic hypertension, whereas catestatin is diminished. In rodents, the administration of catestatin decreases hypertension, cardiac contractility, obesity, atherosclerosis, and inflammation, and it improves insulin sensitivity. By contrast, pancreastatin is elevated in diabetic patients, and the administration of this peptide to obese mice decreases insulin sensitivity and increases inflammation. CgA and the N-terminal fragment of vasostatin-1 can enhance the endothelial  , exert antiangiogenic effects, and inhibit tumor growth in animal models, whereas CgA fragments lacking the CgA C-terminal region promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. Overall, the CgA system, consisting of full-length CgA and its fragments, is emerging as an important and complex player in cardiovascular, immunometabolic, and cancer regulation.© 2019 The Authors.

Either single or repetitive doses are commonly used for analgesic and antipyretic reasons and to prevent heart attacks, stroke, and blood clot formation. Recent studies show that it can also be used chronically to dramatically reduce the risk of a variety of cancers. However, prolonged usage of aspirin can cause severe damage to the mucosal , increasing the risk of ulcer formation and GI-bleeding events. In the present study, we show the effects of acute low-dose aspirin exposure as an active secretagogue-inducing gastric acid secretion. Studies were carried out with isolated gastric glands using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM to assess acid secretion. The non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME (30 μM), or the specific inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) was applied while monitoring intracellular pH. The effects of basolateral exposure to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) caused activation of gastric acid secretion  the H, K-ATPase. Our data suggest that aspirin increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which in turn activates acid secretion. Exposure of gastric glands to either the non-selective NOS inhibitor L-NAME, and the highly selective, soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) effectively inhibited aspirin-dependent gastric acid secretion. Aspirin can be considered as a novel secretagogue, in the way that it activates the H, K-ATPase. With increased daily aspirin consumption, our findings have important implications for all individuals consuming aspirin even in low doses and the potential risks for increased acid secretion.Copyright © 2019 Kitay, Ferstl, Link and Geibel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654502>Circular RNA USP1 regulates the permeability of blood-tumour  via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate circular RNAs are related to dysregulation of vascular endothelial cell , yet the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour  (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the  integrity, increased its permeability as well as reduced tight junction-related protein claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells.

Adiponectin exerts its role through combination with its receptors and activates downstream molecular pathways. In the retinas, the expression of adiponectin can be detected and adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) locate in different retinal cells. Adiponectin is mainly produced by adipose tissue, enters the circulation and passes through blood-brain  (BBB) without injury. It can also be produced locally in the brains as well as in the retinas. Therefore, it is possible that adiponectin from blood as well as that produced locally in the retinas take part in defense of different eye diseases. Here we have summarized the published data about the protective effects of adiponectin in eye diseases. Because exercise can increase the production of adiponectin systemically in the whole body and locally in the brain although no evidence has shown that exercise can increase the production of adiponectin in the eyes until now, we hypothesize that exercise will have a potential protective effect for the eyes via increasing the levels of adiponectin which needs further investigation.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We applied dynamic proteomics to profile protein half-lives and report that INM and ER residents turn over at similar rates, indicating that the INM's unique topology is not a  to turnover. Using a microscopy approach, we observed that the proteasome can degrade INM proteins in situ. However, we also uncovered evidence for selective, vesicular transport-mediated turnover of a single INM protein, emerin, that is potentiated by ER stress.

In conclusion, citronellyl 6-(dimethylamino)hexanoate is an outstanding enhancer with an advantageous combination of properties, which may improve the delivery of drugs that have a limited ability to cross biological barriers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes Tight Junction Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell junctions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. We generated Caco-2 cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α2 (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of tight junctions following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the integrity of the epithelial  by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in tight junction reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of tight junctions, improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial   following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624591>Low-protein diets supplemented with casein hydrolysate favor the microbiota and enhance the mucosal humoral immunity in the colon of pigs.</a></h2><p>High-protein diets can increase the colonic health risks. A moderate reduction of dietary crude-protein (CP) level can improve the colonic bacterial community and mucosal immunity of pigs. However, greatly reducing the dietary CP level, even supplemented with all amino acids (AAs), detrimentally affects the colonic health, which may be due to the lack of protein-derived peptides. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of supplementation of casein hydrolysate (peptide source) in low-protein (LP) diets, in comparison with AAs supplementation, on the colonic microbiota, microbial metabolites and mucosal immunity in pigs, aiming to determine whether a supplementation of casein hydrolysate can improve colonic health under very LP level. Twenty-one pigs (initial BW 19.90 ± 1.00 kg, 63 ± 1 days of age) were assigned to three groups and fed with control diet (16% CP), LP diets (13% CP) supplemented with free AAs (LPA) or casein hydrolysate (LPC) for 4 weeks.Compared with control diet, LPA and LPC diet decreased the relative abundance of  and , and LPC diet further decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. LPC diet also increased the relative abundance of . Both LP diets decreased concentrations of ammonia and cadaverine, and LPC diet also reduced concentrations of putrescine, phenol and indole. Moreover, LPC diet increased total short-chain fatty acid concentration. In comparison with control diet, both LP diets decreased protein expressions of Toll-like receptor-4, nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and LPC diet further decreased protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein-1 and interferon-γ. LPC diet also increased protein expressions of G-protein coupled receptor-43, interleukin-4, transforming growth factor-β, immunoglobulin A and mucin-4, which are indicators for mucosal defense activity.The results showed that supplementing casein hydrolysate showed beneficial effects on the colonic microbiota and mucosal immunity and   in comparison with supplementing free AAs in LP diets. These findings may provide new framework for future nutritional interventions for colon health in pigs.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616251>The Evolving Concept of the Blood Brain  (BBB): From a Single Static  to a Heterogeneous and Dynamic Relay Center.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) helps maintain a tightly regulated microenvironment for optimal central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and facilitates communications with the peripheral circulation. The brain endothelial cells, lining the brain's vasculature, maintain close interactions with surrounding brain cells, e.g., astrocytes, pericytes and perivascular macrophages. This  facilitates critical intercellular crosstalk, giving rise to the concept of the neurovascular unit (NVU). The steady and appropriate communication between all components of the NVU is essential for normal CNS homeostasis and , and dysregulation of one of its constituents can result in disease. Among the different brain regions, and along the vascular tree, the cellular composition of the NVU varies. Therefore, differential cues from the immediate vascular environment can affect BBB phenotype. To support the fluctuating metabolic and functional needs of the underlying neuropil, a specialized vascular heterogeneity is required. This is achieved by variances in  , expression of transporters, receptors, and adhesion molecules. This mini-review will take you on a journey through evolving concepts surrounding the BBB, the NVU and beyond. Exploring classical experiments leading to new approaches will allow us to understand that the BBB is not merely a static separation between the brain and periphery but a closely regulated and interactive entity. We will discuss shifting paradigms, and ultimately aim to address the importance of BBB endothelial heterogeneity with regard to the  of the BBB within the NVU, and touch on its implications for different neuropathologies.Copyright © 2019 Villabona-Rueda, Erice, Pardo and Stins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582649>Organ/Tissue-Specific Vascular Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>The vascular system forms the largest surface in our body, serving as a critical interface between blood circulation and our diverse organ/tissue environments. Thus, the vascular system performs a gatekeeper  for organ/tissue homeostasis and the body's adjustment to pathological challenges. The endothelium, as the most inner layer of the vasculature, regulates the tissue microenvironment, which is critical for development, hemostatic balance, inflammation, and angiogenesis, with a role as well in tumor malignancy and metastasis. These multitudinous functions are primarily mediated by organ/tissue-specifically differentiated endothelial cells, in which heterogeneity has long been recognized at the molecular and histological level. Based on these general principles of vascular-bed heterogeneity and characterization, this review largely covers landmark discoveries regarding organ/tissue microenvironment-governed endothelial cell phenotypic changes. These involve the physical features of continuous, discontinuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal endothelial cells, in addition to the more specialized endothelial cell layers of the lymphatic system, glomerulus, tumors, and the blood brain  (BBB). Major signal pathways of endothelial specification are outlined, including Notch as a key factor of tip/stalk- and arterial-endothelial cell differentiation. We also denote the shear stress sensing machinery used to convey blood flow-mediated biophysical forces that are indispensable to maintaining inert and mature endothelial phenotypes. Since our circulatory system is among the most fundamental and emergent targets of study in pharmacology from the viewpoint of drug metabolism and delivery, a better molecular understanding of organ vasculature-bed heterogeneity may lead to better strategies for novel vascular-targeted treatments to fight against hitherto intractable diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602797>A modification for the calculation of water depth profiles in oil-treated skin by in vivo confocal Raman microscopy.</a></h2><p>In this study, an extended calculation method for the determination of the water profiles in oil-treated skin is proposed, which is based on the calculation of the ratio between the Raman band intensities of water (3350-3550 cm ) and keratin Amide I at 1650 cm . The proposed method is compared with the conventional method based on the ratio of the Raman band intensities of water (3350-3550 cm ) and keratin at 2930 cm . The conventional method creates artifacts in the depth-profiles of the water concentration in oil-treated skin, showing a lower amount of water in the upper and intermediate layers of the stratum corneum, which is due to the superposition of oil- and keratin-related Raman bands at 2930 cm . The proposed extended method shows no artifacts and has the potential to determine the water depth profiles after topical application of formulations on the skin.

Intracellular [Ca] signaling is essential for vasoactive agonist-induced stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs), typically including Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is known that interactions of Ca and cAMP as ubiquitous messengers are involved in this process, the individual contribution of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases (ACs), including the only soluble AC (sAC; ADCY10), remains less clear. Using life-cell microscopy and plate reader-based [Ca] measurements, we found that human immortalized ECs, primary aortic and cardiac microvascular ECs, and primary vascular smooth muscle cells treated with sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or anti-sAC-small interfering RNA did not show endogenous or exogenous ATP-induced [Ca] elevation. Of note, a transmembrane AC (tmAC) inhibitor did not prevent ATP-induced [Ca] elevation in ECs. Moreover, l-phenylephrine-dependent constriction of  mouse aortic ring segments was also reduced by KH7. Analysis of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) pathway revealed reduced IP receptor phosphorylation after KH7 application, which also prevented [Ca] elevation induced by IP receptor agonist adenophostin A. Our results suggest that sAC rather than tmAC controls the agonist-induced ER-dependent Ca response in ECs and may represent a treatment target in arterial hypertension and heart failure.-Mewes, M., Lenders, M., Stappers, F., Scharnetzki, D., Nedele, J., Fels, J., Wedlich-Söldner, R., Brand, S.-M., Schmitz, B., Brand, E.

However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal . This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal  integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal  defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Li, Tang, Sun, Chen, Wang, Liu, Yu, Yu, Liu and Ma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut   to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We aim to investigate the effects of vitamin D on intestinal injury in intestinal epithelial cells and organoids.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) and organoids, and the effect of vitamin D was assessed. Cell viability was measured and inflammation cytokines TNFα and IL-8 were quantified. FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability was measured using Transwell while tight junction markers were assessed by immunofluorescence staining in IEC-18 and intestinal organoids. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.IEC-18 viability was decreased by LPS treatment, but was prevented by vitamin D. The upregulation of inflammation was inhibited by vitamin D, which also decreased epithelium permeability. Vitamin D restored tight junction ZO-1 and claudin 2. In addition, vitamin D decreased TNFα expression and prevented the disruption of ZO-1 in injured organoids.Vitamin D rescued epithelial   by improving permeability and restoring tight junctions, leading to decrease inflammation.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an increasingly considered intervention, but the safety and long-term outcomes are uncertain. We reviewed prospectively collected data on patients with ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing SG from 2011 to 2018. 198 patients with ESRD and 45 patients with CKD (stages 1-4) met NIH guidelines for bariatric surgery and underwent SG. 72% and 48% achieved a BMI ≤40 and ≤35, respectively. The mean percentages of total weight loss and excess weight loss were 18.9±10.8% and 38.2±20.3%, respectively. SG reduced hypertension (HTN) (85.8% vs. 52.1%), decreased anti-hypertensive medications (1.6 vs. 1.0) (p<0.01 each), and reduced diabetes (59.6% vs. 32.5%, p<0.01). 45 of the 71 patients with ESRD that achieved a BMI ≤40 were waitlisted and received KT, while ten remain on the waitlist.

The drug readily crosses the blood brain  and may exert direct immunomodulatory effects within the brain. Microglia are the main innate immune cells of the brain, thus critically involved in the initiation and development of inflammatory processes at this level. However, there are conflicting data from rodent studies about the pharmacological effects of rapamycin on microglial inflammatory responses. Considering that rodent microglia display relevant biochemical and pharmacological differences compared to human microglia, in the present study we studied the effects of rapamycin in an experimental model of human microglia, the human microglial clone 3 (HMC3) cell line. Rapamycin was tested in the nM range both under basal conditions and in cells activated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail, consisting in a mixture of interferon-γ and interleukin-1β (II). The drug significantly increased II stimulatory effect on interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and release in the HMC3 cells, while reducing the production of free oxygen radicals (ROS) both under basal conditions and in cells activated with II. Consistently with its known molecular mechanism of action, rapamycin reduced the extent of activation of the so-called 'mechanistic' target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase and the total amount of intracellular proteins. In contrast to rodent cells, rapamycin did not alter human microglial cell viability nor inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, rapamycin did not exert any significant effect on the morphology of the HMC3 cells. All together these data suggest that the inhibition of mTORC1 in human microglia by rapamycin results in complex immunomodulatory effects, including a significant increase in the expression and release of the pro-inflammatory IL-6.Copyright © 2019 Cappoli et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653054>Suppression of the Peripheral Immune System Limits the Central Immune Response Following Cuprizone-Feeding: Relevance to Modelling Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Cuprizone (CPZ) preferentially affects oligodendrocytes (OLG), resulting in demyelination.

Conversely, 0.1% CPZ(±PT) produced a similar oligodendrocytosis, demyelination and gliosis but a smaller reduction in splenic CD4 (11%) and CD8 (14%) levels and  splenic atrophy. Long-term feeding of 0.1% CPZ(±PT) for 12 weeks produced similar reductions in CD4 (27%) and CD8 (43%), as well as splenic atrophy (33%), as seen with 0.2% CPZ(±PT) for 5 weeks. Collectively, these results suggest that 0.1% CPZ for 5 weeks may be a more promising model to study the 'inside-out' theory of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, neither CD4 nor CD8 were detected in the brain in CPZ±PT groups, indicating that CPZ-mediated suppression of peripheral immune organs is a major impediment to studying the 'inside-out' role of the adaptive immune system in this model over long time periods.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific  of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells. Tight junction scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and . Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens tight junction complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2.

Recently, histone lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) was identified as a new form of histone acylation that connects starvation-responsive metabolism to epigenetic regulation. Sirtuins are a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases. Through systematic profiling studies, we show that human SIRT3 displays class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylase activities with preference for H3 K4, K9, K18, K23, K27, and H4K16, but not for H4 K5, K8, K12, which distinguishes it from the Zn-dependent HDACs. Structural studies revealed a hydrogen bond-lined hydrophobic pocket favored for the S-form Kbhb recognition and catalysis. β-backbone but not side chain-mediated interactions around Kbhb dominate sequence motif recognition, explaining the broad site-specificity of SIRT3. The observed class-selectivity of SIRT3 is due to an entropically unfavorable  associated with the glycine-flanking motif that the histone Kbhb resides in. Collectively, we reveal the molecular basis for class-selective histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylation by SIRT3, shedding lights on the  of sirtuins in Kbhb biology through hierarchical deacylation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597859>[Implications of HLA in allogeneic stem cell transplantation].</a></h2><p>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major  to successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, the identification of an alternative donor with a lower risk of GVHD is important for patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling donor. To date, HLA studies of large cohorts of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (UR-HSCT) have provided important and helpful information for donor selection. In UR-HSCT through Japan Marrow Donor Program, patient and donor HLA-A, -B, and -C, and HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 double mismatches are significant risk factors for severe GVHD and mortality. HLA-DPB1 mismatch does not affect survival; however, it reduces the chances of leukemia relapse. In the analysis of a specific allele effect on transplant outcomes, HLA-C14:02 was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe acute GVHD. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled full-length HLA allele typing. Evolutionary analysis of the entire HLA-DPB1 revealed that a highly conserved region from exon 3 to 3'UTR provoked acute GVHD that was different from a T-cell epitope mismatching algorithm, reflecting exon 2 polymorphisms. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated the importance of full-length NGS HLA typing on UR-HSCT outcomes. The usage of NGS may provide important information on the implications of the HLA genes in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650038>Differential modulation of transendothelial electrical resistance by TRPV4 agonists is mediated by apoptosis and/or necrosis.</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) has been implicated in many disease conditions also in the lung.

SAR405838 is a novel molecularly-targeted agent that is in clinical trials for various solid tumors. Its application for tumors in the brain has not yet been examined, even though the target, the MDM2-p53 interaction, is attractive for tumors that could occur in the brain, including glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that SAR405838 is an avid substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp mediated active efflux at the blood-brain  plays a dominant role in limiting SAR405838 brain distribution. Even though the absence of P-gp significantly increases the drug exposure in the brain; the systemic exposure, including absorption and clearance processes, were unaffected by P-gp deletion. Model-based parameters of SAR405838 distribution across the BBB indicate the CLout of the brain was approximately 40-fold greater than the CLin. The free fraction of SAR405838 in plasma and brain were found to be low, and subsequent Kp,uu values were less than unity, even in P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice. These results indicate additional efflux transporters other than P-gp and Bcrp may be limiting distribution of SAR405838 to the brain. Concomitant administration of elacridar significantly increased brain exposure, also without affecting the systemic exposure. This study characterized the brain distributional kinetics of SAR405838, a novel MDM2 inhibitor, to evaluate its potential in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paper examined the brain distributional kinetics of a novel MDM2-p53 targeted agent, SAR405838, to see its possible application for brain tumors by using in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches. SAR405838 is found to be an exclusive substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which limits its distribution to the brain. Based on the findings in the paper, manipulating of the  of P-gp can significantly increase the brain exposure of SAR405838, which may give an insight on its potential in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain cancer.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638637>Physical mechanism for the synapse behaviour of WTiO-based memristors.</a></h2><p>Tungsten-based memristors possess many advantages as candidates for memristive devices, including gradual changes in resistance states and memorization and learning functions. However, most previous reports mainly focus on studying synaptic learning rules instead of analysing the internal mechanism that results in the exterior learning rules. Herein, we discuss stacked Au/WTiOx/Au and Ti/WTiOx/Au devices in which the  of the resistance switch is realized by the externally induced local migration of oxygen ions. The consecutively adjustable multilevel resistance of the Au/WTiOx/Au device may be due to the variation in the  width and height in high oxygen vacancy concentrations. Additionally, the high and low resistance states of Ti/WTiOx/Au devices are considered as a result of the connection and rupture of the conductive filaments at low concentrations of oxygen vacancies. The physical mechanism construction and state-full synapse development through the control of ion migration provide insight into the applications of oxide-based memristors in neuromorphic computation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582652>Role of Aquaporin-3 in Intestinal Injury Induced by Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is expressed in various parts of the intestine, where it regulates the proliferation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells and the transport of glycerol and hydrogen peroxide. Our study aimed to investigate the effect on the expression of AQP3 of intestinal injury in septic mice and whether oral administration of glycerol can reduce intestinal epithelial injury and  disorder by acting as a partial substitute for the  of AQP3. We established a sepsis model by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) in mice. Sepsis induced intestinal injury, as demonstrated by the disordered destruction of the morphology of the intestinal mucosa, time-dependent increases in Chiu's score (p < 0.05), significantly increased (p < 0.05) plasma concentrations of determination of the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), and time-dependent downregulation of the expression of AQP3 and occluding (p < 0.05). While the administration of oral glycerol partially ameliorated the sepsis-induced injury of the intestinal mucosa, as shown by the partial recovery of the morphological structure, with decreased Chiu's score, decreased plasma concentrations of DAO and intestinal-type FABP2, upregulated expression of occludin and decreased mortality rate (Sepsis vs. Sepsis + Glycerol, p < 0.05). The results showed that the expression levels of AQP3 and occludin were downregulated after septic intestinal injury, while treatment with glycerol, which acts as a substitute for AQP3, partly ameliorated intestinal injury and improved the survival rate. This preliminary experiment suggests that AQP3 may protect the intestinal tract against the effects of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594805>An intrinsic compartmentalization code for peripheral membrane proteins in photoreceptor neurons.</a></h2><p>In neurons, peripheral membrane proteins are enriched in subcellular compartments, where they play key roles, including transducing and transmitting information. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying their compartmentalization. To explore the roles of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, we engineered probes consisting of lipidation motifs attached to fluorescent proteins by variously charged linkers and expressed them in  rod photoreceptors. Quantitative live cell imaging showed dramatic differences in distributions and dynamics of the probes, including presynapse and ciliary OS enrichment, depending on lipid moiety and protein surface charge. Opposing extant models of ciliary enrichment, most probes were weakly membrane bound and diffused through the connecting cilium without lipid binding chaperone protein interactions. A diffusion-binding-transport model showed that ciliary enrichment of a rhodopsin kinase probe occurs via recycling as it perpetually leaks out of the ciliary OS. The model accounts for weak membrane binding of peripheral membrane proteins and a leaky connecting cilium diffusion .© 2019 Maza et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595918>Conformational preference determined by inequivalent n-pairs: rotational studies on acetophenone and its monohydrate.</a></h2><p>Acetophenone and its complex with water have been investigated by using pulsed jet Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations. Rotational spectra of the acetophenone monomer comprising nine isotopologues were measured and assigned, enabling the accurate structural description of the carbon skeleton. The most stable isomer of the monohydrate of acetophenone was detected in the supersonic jet expansion. Water serves as a proton donor and acceptor forming an O-HO[double bond, length as m-dash]C hydrogen bond and a secondary C-HO-H weak hydrogen bond with acetophenone through a six-membered ring.

The aim of this work was to investigate the protection of isorhamnetin against esophageal mucosal injury in rats with chronic reflux esophagitis (RE). Chronic RE model was established through fundus ligation and partial obstruction of the pylorus in rats. Then, the rats were treated with isorhamnetin (5 mg/kg) daily for a period of 14 days. Through histological and gross assessment, it was found that administration of isorhamnetin alleviated esophageal mucosal injury in RE rats. Treatment of RE rats with isorhamnetin improved esophageal  , through upregulating proteins expression of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and downregulating proteins expression of matrix matalloproteinases-3 (MMP3) and -9. Administration of isorhamnetin decreased CD68-positive cells and mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the esophagus of RE rats. Administration of isorhamnetin downregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression and decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and 3-nitrotyrosin in the esophagus of RE rats. Administration of isorhamnetin enhanced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activities and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in esophagus of RE rats. Additionally, treatment with isorhamnetin inhibited p38 MAPK and NFκB activation in RE esophagus. In conclusion, isorhamnetin attenuated esophageal mucosal injury in rats with chronic RE, possibly by suppressing formation of cytokines and infiltration of inflammatory cells, inhibiting p38 and NFκB pathways, and enhancing HO-1 activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the impact of proteins derived from chicken and soy on the gut microbiota and host gut  in C57BL/6 mice is investigated.Specific-pathogen-free and germ-free mice are assigned to either a chicken- or a soy protein-based diet for 4 weeks. Compared with a chicken-protein-based diet, intake of a soy-protein-based diet reduces the abundance of A. muciniphila and the number of goblet cells, lowers the level of Muc2 mRNA, and decreases the thickness of the mucus layer in the colon of specific-pathogen-free mice. In germ-free mice, colonization with A. muciniphila combined with intake of a chicken-protein-based diet results in a higher expression of the Muc2 mRNA in colon, and surprisingly, an increased potential for oxidative phosphorylation in A. muciniphila compared with colonized mice fed a soy-protein-based diet.These findings suggest possible mutually beneficial interactions between the growth and  of A. muciniphila and host mucus  in response to intake of a chicken-protein-based diet contrasting the intake of a soy-protein-based diet.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, some patients respond poorly to diuretic management. The PubMed database was searched to identify experimental studies on pulmonary edema in animals, experimental studies on surfactant , including patients with pulmonary edema, and clinical studies reporting  dysfunction and/or injury in patients with acute pulmonary edema. Studies with animal models demonstrate that high capillary pressures can cause  disruption in alveolar capillary units which increases permeability and the transfer of fluid and protein into lung parenchyma. Fluid in alveolar spaces alters surfactant  which increases fluid flux out of capillaries into the lung parenchyma secondary to larger transcapillary hydrostatic gradients. Patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema have increased levels of surfactant protein B in their plasma which reflect  disruption and increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha which reflect acute tissue injury. Increased surfactant protein B plasma levels are associated with abnormal gas exchange in patients with chronic heart failure. Patients with exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction have increased levels of surfactant protein B after short periods of exercise. Pathology studies in patients with chronic heart failure have found increased connective tissue in alveolar capillary units and increased numbers of type II alveolar cells, and these changes represent an adaptive response in these patients. Clinicians need to consider the possibility of  dysfunction and disruption in patients with both acute and chronic pulmonary edema and understand that diuresis may have a limited effect on symptoms in some patients.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Resveratrol induces ameliorative effects in the treatment of certain human diseases by regulating different signaling pathways. The present study assessed the therapeutic effects of resveratrol and its potential mechanism of action in the neurons from rats with ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral hemorrhage. The rat model of cerebral hemorrhage was established and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays were subsequently performed to assess the therapeutic effects of resveratrol. The results demonstrated that treatment with resveratrol (10 mg/kg/day) decreased cerebral water content, hippocampal cell apoptosis and cerebral infarct volume compared with the PBS-treated group. Resveratrol treatment also increased neuronal cell viability, improved neurological  and blood brain  disruption compared with the PBS group following 21 days of treatment. The administration of resveratrol was demonstrated to decrease the levels of certain inflammatory factors, including ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 and myeloperoxidase, in rats with cerebral hemorrhage. The results revealed that treatment with resveratrol regulated neuronal apoptosis by downregulating the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results indicate that resveratrol decreases ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis by downregulating the TGF-β-mediated ERK pathway in a rat model of cerebral hemorrhage and may serve as a potential agent for the treatment of cerebral hemorrhage.Copyright: © Zhao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609619>Calculation of Chemical Reaction  Heights by Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory with Correlated Participating Orbitals.</a></h2><p>The accurate description of reaction  heights is challenging for quantum mechanical methods due to the need for a balanced treatment of dynamic and static correlation energies because their importance varies during the course of a chemical reaction. While some regions of potential energy surfaces are well-described by a single-reference wave  or by Kohn-Sham density functional theory, in other cases a multireference treatment is needed. For systems with many active electrons, most accurate multireference methods have prohibitive computational scalings with system size. Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory, MC-PDFT, is a more affordable multireference approach that computes the total electron correlation energy in a single step by using the multiconfiguration kinetic energy, density, and on-top pair density and an on-top density functional. In this work, we apply MC-PDFT to a benchmark database (DBH24/18) of 24 diverse reaction  heights. We explore the role of active space and basis set selection on the performance of MC-PDFT. We find that MC-PDFT is able to calculate reaction  heights with a similar accuracy to complete active space second order perturbation theory, CASPT2, but at a lower computational cost, and we find that MC-PDFT is less dependent on basis set selection than CASPT2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657765>The effect of temporal adaptation to different temperatures and osmolarities on heat response of TRPV4 in cultured cells.</a></h2><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel is a polymodal receptor activated by moderate heat and hypoosmolarity. TRPV4 expressed in the skin area contributes to several skin functions as a  to maintain internal body  and a transporter of external stimuli. The skin condition such as skin temperature and osmolarity varies with internal and external changes, and may influence the activity of TRPV4 contributing to skin , thermal sensation, and thermoregulation. However, the combination effect of skin conditions such as temperature and osmolarity on the activity of TRPV4 has not been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of temporal adaptation (5-10 min) to different temperature (25-35 °C) and osmolarity (250-350 mOsm) conditions on the heat response (until 40 °C) of human TRPV4 in cultured cells using Ca imaging. The temperature to activate TRPV4 increased with elevation of the adaptation temperature, and decreased with the adaptation to hypoosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. In addition, the heat response was inhibited with the adaptation to hyperosmolarity in the range of 25-35 °C. Thus, we demonstrated that the activation temperature of TRPV4 varied with the temporal sensory adaptation to different temperature and osmolarity conditions. These findings may contribute to gaining better understanding of the variation in several TRPV4-mediated skin functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To meet this need, hyaluronic acid (HA)/ibuprofen (IBU) (HAI) NFMs were prepared by electrospinning, followed by dual ionic crosslinking with FeCl (HAIF NFMs) and covalent crosslinking with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to produce HAIFB NFMs. It is expected that the multi-functional NFMs will act as a physical  to prevent fibroblast penetration, HA will reduce fibroblast attachment and impart a lubrication effect for tendon gliding, while IBU will  as an anti-inflammation drug. For this purpose, we successfully fabricated HAIFB NFMs containing 20% (HAI20FB), 30% (HAI30FB), and 40% (HAI40FB) IBU and characterized their physico-chemical properties by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and mechanical testing. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that all NFMs except HAI40FB possessed excellent effects in preventing fibroblast attachment and penetration while preserving high biocompatibility without influencing cell proliferation. Although showing significant improvement in mechanical properties over other NFMs, the HAI40FB NFM exhibited cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts due to the higher percentage and concentration of IBU released form the membrane.

TBI tends to be associated with more severe cerebral edema and worse neurological functional recovery if it occurs in high-altitude areas than in low-altitude areas. However, the underlying mechanism of this difference is unknown. Thus, we used cobra venom factor (CVF) to deplete complement C3 in simulated high-altitude areas to explore whether the differences in outcome at different altitudes are related to secondary injury caused by complement C3.The weight-drop model was adopted to induce TBI in rats. Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: sham +saline (sham), high altitude +TBI +saline (HAT), high altitude +TBI + CVF (H-CVF), low altitude + TBI + saline (LAT), and low altitude +TBI +CVF (L-CVF). Brain contusion and edema volumes, brain water content, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) expression, interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) expression, mortality rate, neurological , and complement component 3 (C3) mRNA expression were measured by techniques such as Evans blue fluorescence, Perls staining, TUNEL staining, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to evaluate correlations between complement activation and secondary injury.The activation of complement after TBI was significantly higher at high altitude than at low altitude. High-altitude TBI resulted in a leakier blood-brain , more severe cerebral edema and higher mortality than low-altitude TBI did. In addition, high-altitude TBI tended to be associated with more MBP degradation, ferric iron deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammatory factor deposition than low-altitude TBI. All of these effects of TBI were partially reversed by inhibiting complement activation using CVF.Our study provided evidence that TBI at high altitude leads to severe edema and high mortality and disability rates.

This development is especially problematic in gram-negative bacteria due to the outer membrane (OM) permeability  and multidrug efflux pumps. Therefore, we screened for compounds that target essential, nonredundant, surface-exposed processes in gram-negative bacteria. We identified a compound, MRL-494, that inhibits assembly of OM proteins (OMPs) by the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM complex). The BAM complex contains one essential surface-exposed protein, BamA. We constructed a  mutagenesis library, screened for resistance to MRL-494, and identified the mutation   BamA restores OMP biogenesis in the presence of MRL-494. The mutant protein has both altered conformation and activity, suggesting it could either inhibit MRL-494 binding or allow BamA to  in the presence of MRL-494. By cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we determined that MRL-494 stabilizes BamA and BamA from thermally induced aggregation, indicating direct or proximal binding to both BamA and BamA Thus, it is the altered activity of BamA responsible for resistance to MRL-494. Strikingly, MRL-494 possesses a second mechanism of action that kills gram-positive organisms. In microbes lacking an OM, MRL-494 lethally disrupts the cytoplasmic membrane. We suggest that the compound cannot disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane of gram-negative bacteria because it cannot penetrate the OM. Instead, MRL-494 inhibits OMP biogenesis from outside the OM by targeting BamA.

This study evaluated the effects of a chemically characterized OLE in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, describing the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects, with special attention to vascular dysfunction and gut microbiota composition.C57BL/6 J mice were distributed in different groups: control, control-treated, obese and obese-treated with OLE (1, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day). Control mice received a standard diet, whereas obese mice were fed HFD. The treatment was followed for 5 weeks, and animal body weight periodically assessed. At the end of the treatment, metabolic plasma analysis (including lipid profile) as well as glucose and insulin levels were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status was studied in liver and fat, by determining the RNA expression of different inflammatory mediators by qPCR; also, different markers of intestinal epithelial   were determined in colonic tissue by qPCR. Additionally, flow cytometry of immune cells from adipose tissue, endothelial dysfunction in aortic rings as well as gut microbiota composition were evaluated. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to antibiotic-treated mice fed with HFD was performed.OLE administration reduced body weight gain, basal glycaemia and insulin resistance, and showed improvement in plasma lipid profile when compared with HFD-fed mice. The extract significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced altered expression of key adipogenic genes, like PPARs, adiponectin and leptin receptor, in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the extract reduced the RNA expression of Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 in liver and adipose tissue, thus improving the tissue inflammatory status associated to obesity. The flow cytometry analysis in adipose tissue corroborated these observations. Additionally, the characterization of the colonic microbiota by sequencing showed that OLE administration was able to counteract the dysbiosis associated to obesity. The extract reversed the endothelial dysfunction observed in the aortic rings of obese mice. FMT from donors HFD-OLE to recipient mice fed an HFD prevented the development of obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction.OLE exerts beneficial effects in HFD-induced obesity in mice, which was associated to an improvement in plasma and tissue metabolic profile, inflammatory status, gut microbiota composition and vascular dysfunction.Copyright © 2019.

The expression of GFAP gene is regulated by many transcription factors (TFs), mainly Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 cascade and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling. GFAP expression is also modulated by protein kinase and other signaling molecules that are elicited by neuronal activity and hormones. Abnormal expression of GFAP proteins occurs in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, brain edema-eliciting diseases, traumatic brain injury, psychiatric disorders and others. GFAP, mainly in α-isoform, is the major component of cytoskeleton and the scaffold of astrocytes, which is essential for the maintenance of astrocytic structure and shape. GFAP also has highly morphological plasticity because of its quick changes in assembling and polymerizing states in response to environmental challenges. This plasticity and its corresponding cellular morphological changes endow astrocytes the functions of physical  between adjacent neurons and stabilizer of extracellular environment. Moreover, GFAP colocalizes and even molecularly associates with many functional molecules. This feature allows GFAP to  as a platform for direct interactions between different molecules. Last, GFAP involves transportation and localization of other functional proteins and thus serves as a protein transport guide in astrocytes. This guiding role of GFAP involves an elastic retraction and extension cytoskeletal network that couples with GFAP reassembling, transporting, and membrane protein recycling machinery. This paper reviews our current understanding of the expression and functions of GFAP as well as their regulation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610615>Hypertonic saline and seawater solutions damage sinonasal epithelial cell air-liquid interface cultures.</a></h2><p>Nasal irrigation (NI) is commonly used to treat several sinonasal diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP); however, the effects of NI on the sinonasal epithelium are not fully known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of commonly used NI solutions on epithelial mucociliary and  functionality in primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs).HNECs from control subjects and patients with CRSwNP were established as air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Differentiated cultures were treated with different NI solutions, including isotonic 0.9% and hypertonic 3.0% saline, isotonic and hypertonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solution. The changes in ciliary beat frequency (CBF), numbers of ciliated and goblet cells, and cytotoxicity were measured. Epithelial  functionality was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electric resistance (TER), paracellular flux, and expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin.Isotonic saline, isotonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solutions did not affect epithelial mucociliary and   in either control or CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures; however, hypertonic saline induced a significant disruption of these cell functions in both cultures. Hypertonic seawater caused a transient decrease of CBF and TER in CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, in contrast to inducing an obvious mucociliary and  dysfunction and cytotoxicity in control ALI cultures.Although isotonic NI solutions appear to not affect epithelial mucociliary and   in control and CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, hypertonic saline and seawater solutions damaged sinonasal epithelial cells in ALI cultures.

Impaired intestinal  functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated obesity, but the regulation of BCRP during obesity and its role in maintaining the intestinal   during CLGI-associated obesity are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during obesity are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human obesity or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and  functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and  functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated obesity both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611906>Exosomal Circular RNA as a Biomarker Platform for the Early Diagnosis of Immune-Mediated Demyelinating Disease.</a></h2><p>Exosomes can pass through the blood-brain  and are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The components in exosomes, such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipids, change greatly and are closely related to disease progression. Circular RNA (circRNA) is stable in structure and has a long half-life in exosomes without degradation. Therefore, circRNA is considered an ideal biomarker and can be used to monitor a variety of central nervous system diseases. This study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of exosomal circRNA (exo-circRNA) in CSF from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases to identify suitable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. circRNA expression levels in exosomes obtained from five CSF samples from immune-mediated demyelinating disease patients and five paired CSF control samples were analyzed using a hybridization array. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that 5,095 exo-circRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases and paired control samples. Of these exo-circRNAs, 26 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in CSF exosomes from patients with immune-mediated demyelinating diseases (FC ≥1.5 and p ≤ 0.05). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that the upregulation or activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) and RAD23 homolog B, nucleotide excision repair protein (RAD23B) may be associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed and centered on the most upregulated/downregulated exo-circRNAs to predict their  in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction results stating that hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 were validated in an independent cohort of subjects. Canonical correlation analysis results indicated a potential connection between exosomal hsa_circ_0012077 expression level and immunoglobulin G levels in CSF. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that when hsa_circ_0087862 or hsa_circ_0012077 was employed alone for diagnosing immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, the diagnostic accuracy was 100%. In conclusion, based on this study, exosomal hsa_circ_0087862 and hsa_circ_0012077 in CSF could be used as suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of immune-mediated demyelinating disease based on their expression levels. Moreover, the upregulation or activation of PTPRF and RAD23B was potentially associated with the occurrence and development of immune-mediated demyelinating diseases.Copyright © 2019 He, Ren, Li, Yang, Wang and Yang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594750>Gut microbiota from colorectal cancer patients enhances the progression of intestinal adenoma in Apc mice.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence points to a close relationship between gut dysbiosis and colorectal cancer (CRC).

Composed of multiple cell types arranged in stratified layers with highly specialized appendages, it serves sensory and immune surveillance roles in addition to its primary mechanical . Several complex in vitro models of skin (i.e. microphysiological systems (MPS) including but not limited to 3D tissues, organ-on-a-chip, organoids), have been developed and assays validated for regulatory purposes. As such, skin is arguably the most advanced organ with respect to model development and adoption across industries including chemical, cosmetic, and to a somewhat lesser extent, pharmaceutical. Early adoption of complex skin models and associated assays for assessment of irritation and corrosion spurred research into other areas such as sensitization, absorption, phototoxicity, and genotoxicity. Despite such considerable advancements, opportunities remain for immune capabilities, inclusion of appendages such as hair follicles, fluidics, and innervation, among others. Herein, we provide an overview of current complex skin model capabilities and limitations within the drug development scheme, and recommendations for future model development and assay qualification and/or validation with the intent to facilitate wider adoption of use within the pharmaceutical industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578868>Implications of Immune Checkpoint Expression during Aging for HIV-infected People on ART.</a></h2><p>Immune checkpoint molecules regulate T cell responses. In chronic viral infections and cancer, where antigens can persistently stimulate the immune system, immune checkpoint molecules can serve as a  to effective immune responses. The role of immune checkpoint molecules in the setting of systemic low grade inflammatory such as Aging and ART-suppressed HIV infection is not known. In this study, we made use of stored samples from the FLORAH cohort of HIV-infected, ART suppressed adults (age range 19-77 yrs.) and age-matched HIV uninfected controls. We measured the expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules: PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, and 2B4 on resting CD4 and CD8 T cells and maturation subsets. To determine how expression of these molecules can affect T cell , we stimulated PBMC with HIV Gag or p09/H1N1 antigen and performed intracellular cytokine staining by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Immune checkpoint molecules were expressed at higher levels in CD8 compared to CD4. PD-1 was the only molecule that remained significantly higher in HIV-individuals compared to controls. LAG-3 expression increased with age in CD4 and CD8 T cells. 2B4 expression on CD8 T cells was negatively associated with IL-2 production but showed no effect on CD4 T cell . TIM-3 expression was negatively associated with IL-21 production in CD4 and CD8 T cells and also negatively correlated with flu vaccine responses in HIV negative individuals. Taken altogether, this study demonstrates the marked variation in immune checkpoint molecule expression in T cells among adults and sheds light on the biology of these molecules and their effects on antigen-specific T cell functions. Overall, our results point to TIM-3 as a potential biomarker for immune  in HIV+ individuals on ART.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627318>Exploring the Binding Mechanism and Dynamics of EndoMS/NucS to Mismatched dsDNA.</a></h2><p>The well-known mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, MutS/MutL, is absent in numerous  and some . Recent studies have shown that EndoMS/NucS has the ability to cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing a mismatched base pair, which suggests a novel mismatch repair process. However, the recognition mechanism and the binding process of EndoMS/NucS in the MMR pathway remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the binding dynamics of EndoMS/NucS to mismatched dsDNA and its energy as a  of the angle between the two C-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS, through molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is found that there exists a half-open transition state corresponding to an energy  (at an activation angle of approximately 80 ∘ ) between the open state and the closed state, according to the energy curve. When the angle is larger than the activation angle, the C-terminal domains can move freely and tend to change to the open state (local energy minimum). Otherwise, the C-terminal domains will interact with the mismatched dsDNA directly and converge to the closed state at the global energy minimum. As such, this two-state system enables the exposed N-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS to recognize mismatched dsDNA during the open state and then stabilize the binding of the C-terminal domains of EndoMS/NucS to the mismatched dsDNA during the closed state. We also investigate how the EndoMS/NucS recognizes and binds to mismatched dsDNA, as well as the effects of K + ions. The results provide insights into the recognition and binding mechanisms of EndoMS/NucS to mismatched dsDNA in the MMR pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643113>Piezotronic Tunneling Junction Gated by Mechanical Stimuli.</a></h2><p>Tunneling junction is used in many devices such as high-frequency oscillators, nonvolatile memories, and magnetic field sensors. In these devices, modulation on the  width and/or height is usually realized by electric field or magnetic field. Here, a new piezotronic tunneling junction (PTJ) principle, in which the quantum tunneling is controlled/tuned by externally applied mechanical stimuli, is proposed. In these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs, such as Pt/Al O /p-GaN, the height and the width of the tunneling barriers can be mechanically modulated via the piezotronic effect. The tunneling current characteristics of PTJs exhibit critical behavior as a  of external mechanical stimuli, which results in high sensitivity (≈5.59 mV MPa ), giant switching (>10 ), and fast response (≈4.38 ms). Moreover, the mechanical controlling of tunneling transport in PTJs with various thickness of Al O is systematically investigated. The high performance observed with these metal/insulator/piezoelectric semiconductor PTJs suggest their great potential in electromechanical technology. This study not only demonstrates dynamic mechanical controlling of quantum tunneling, but also paves a way for adaptive interaction between quantum tunneling and mechanical stimuli, with potential applications in the field of ultrasensitive press sensor, human-machine interface, and artificial intelligence.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

LY294002 and imatinib were used to inhibit the activity of PI3K/Akt and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) β. IQ-GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) siRNA was used to knockdown endogenous IQGAP1, which was used to verify the role of the PDGFRβ/PI3K/Akt/IQGAP1 pathway in SV/SV-NPs-mediated  protection in HUVECs injured by LPS. The results show that SV/SV-NPs promoted the migration and decreased the permeability of HUVECs treated with LPS, and the efficacy of the SV-NPs exceeded that of SV significantly. LY294002, imatinib and IQGAP1 siRNA all suppressed the  protection of SV/SV-NPs.

The cellular component analysis revealed that most of the proteins with altered expression associated with cell part, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, membrane part, organelle or organelle part. The molecular  showed that these proteins were critical in molecular transducer activity.

Thus, the ceramide-containing moisturizer can be a novel promising treatment for senile xerosis.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636638>Heparanase-Dependent Remodeling of Initial Lymphatic Glycocalyx Regulates Tissue-Fluid Drainage During Acute Inflammation .</a></h2><p>The glycocalyx is a dense layer of carbohydrate chains involved in numerous and fundamental biological processes, such as cellular and tissue homeostasis, inflammation and disease development. Composed of membrane-bound glycoproteins, sulfated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycan side-chains, this structure is particularly essential for blood vascular  functions and leukocyte diapedesis. Interestingly, whilst the glycocalyx of blood vascular endothelium has been extensively studied, little is known about the composition and  of this glycan layer present on tissue-associated lymphatic vessels (LVs). Here, we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the composition of endothelial glycocalyx of initial lymphatic capillaries in murine cremaster muscles during homeostatic and inflamed conditions using an anti-heparan sulfate (HS) antibody and a panel of lectins recognizing different glycan moieties of the glycocalyx. Our data show the presence of HS, α-D-galactosyl moieties, α2,3-linked sialic acids and, to a lesser extent, N-Acetylglucosamine moieties. A similar expression profile was also observed for LVs of mouse and human skins. Interestingly, inflammation of mouse cremaster tissues or ear skin as induced by TNF-stimulation induced a rapid (within 16 h) remodeling of the LV glycocalyx, as observed by reduced expression of HS and galactosyl moieties, whilst levels of α2,3-linked sialic acids remains unchanged. Furthermore, whilst this response was associated with neutrophil recruitment from the blood circulation and their migration into tissue-associated LVs, specific neutrophil depletion did not impact LV glycocalyx remodeling. Mechanistically, treatment with a non-anticoagulant heparanase inhibitor suppressed LV HS degradation without impacting neutrophil migration into LVs. Interestingly however, inhibition of glycocalyx degradation reduced the capacity of initial LVs to drain interstitial fluid during acute inflammation. Collectively, our data suggest that rapid remodeling of endothelial glycocalyx of tissue-associated LVs supports drainage of fluid and macromolecules but has no role in regulating neutrophil trafficking out of inflamed tissues via initial LVs.Copyright © 2019 Arokiasamy, King, Boulaghrasse, Poston, Nourshargh, Wang and Voisin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594235>Cerebrospinal Fluid Changes in the Renin-Angiotensin System in Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Observations in autopsied brain tissue indicate that overactivation of the classical renin-angiotensin system (cRAS) and underactivity within regulatory RAS pathways (rRAS) are associated with pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of RAS are altered in AD in relation to established CSF markers of disease pathology (lower Aβ42 and elevated tau) and CSF markers of capillary dysfunction. We studied 40 controls and 40 AD cases grouped according to a biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau>400 pg/mL, pTau >60 pg/mL, and Aβ42 <550 pg/mL). Angiotensin-II converting enyme-1 (ACE1) and ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates; sPDGFRβ and albumin level by sandwich ELISA and angiotensin-I (Ang-I), Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) by direct ELISA. CSF Aβ42, total, and phosphorylated tau levels were previously measured by INNOTEST sandwich ELISA. CSF ACE1 activity was significantly elevated in AD (p = 0.008) and positively correlated with ACE2 in AD (r = 0.420, p = 0.007). CSF ACE1 weakly correlated with t-tau (r = 0.294, p = 0.066) and p-tau (r = 0.329, p = 0.038) but not with Aβ42 in the controls but not in AD. ACE1 correlated positively with sPDGFRβ (r = 0.426, p = 0.007), a marker of pericyte injury, and ACE2 correlated positively with albumin (r = 0.422, p = 0.008), a marker of blood-brain  integrity. CSF Ang-I, Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) levels were unchanged in AD. This cross-sectional CSF study indicates RAS dysfunction in relation to capillary damage in AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615975>Oxidative stress-mediated TXNIP loss causes RPE dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), for example, through oxidative damage, is a common factor underlying age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Aberrant autophagy also contributes to AMD pathology, as autophagy maintains RPE homeostasis to ensure blood-retinal  (BRB) integrity and protect photoreceptors. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) promotes cellular oxidative stress by inhibiting thioredoxin reducing capacity and is in turn inversely regulated by reactive oxygen species levels; however, its role in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell dysfunction and the mechanistic link between TXNIP and autophagy are largely unknown. Here, we observed that TXNIP expression was rapidly downregulated in RPE cells under oxidative stress and that RPE cell proliferation was decreased. TXNIP knockdown demonstrated that the suppression of proliferation resulted from TXNIP depletion-induced autophagic flux, causing increased p53 activation via nuclear localization, which in turn enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, TXNIP downregulation further negatively impacted BRB integrity by disrupting RPE cell tight junctions and enhancing cell motility by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, Src kinase. Finally, we also revealed that TXNIP knockdown upregulated HIF-1α, leading to the enhanced secretion of VEGF from RPE cells and the stimulation of angiogenesis in cocultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the exposure of RPE cells to sustained oxidative stress may promote choroidal neovascularization, another AMD pathology. Together, these findings reveal three distinct mechanisms by which TXNIP downregulation disrupts RPE cell  and thereby exacerbates AMD pathogenesis. Accordingly, reinforcing or restoring BRB integrity by targeting TXNIP may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing or attenuating photoreceptor damage in AMD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622101>Machine learning configuration interaction for  potential energy curves.</a></h2><p>The concept of machine learning configuration interaction (MLCI) [ , , 5739], where an artificial neural network (ANN) learns on the fly to select important configurations, is further developed so that accurate  potential energy curves can be efficiently calculated. This development includes employing the artificial neural network also as a hash  for the efficient deletion of duplicates on the fly so that the singles and doubles space does not need to be stored and this  to scalability is removed. In addition configuration state functions are introduced into the approach so that pure spin states are guaranteed, and the transferability of data between geometries is exploited. This improved approach is demonstrated on potential energy curves for the nitrogen molecule, water, and carbon monoxide. The results are compared with full configuration interaction values, when available, and different transfer protocols are investigated. It is shown that, for all of the considered systems, accurate potential energy curves can now be efficiently computed with MLCI. For the potential curves of N and CO, MLCI can achieve lower errors than stochastically selecting configurations while also using substantially less processor hours.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584756>Two-dimensional sandwich-like α-zirconium phosphate/polypyrrole: moderate catalysis  and efficient true-sulfur-confinement for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.</a></h2><p>Although lithium-sulfur battery is a promising energy storage device with high energy density, environmental friendliness and low cost, many obstacles such as poor conductivity, volume expansion and "shuttle effect" still limit their large-scale commercialization. In this work, a two-dimensional (2D) sandwich-like α-ZrP/polypyrrole (α-ZrP/PPy) material with a nanosheet structure is designed for the sulfur hosting. It is found that such a material can provide unique ion transfer channels for the rapid Li + ions transfer and thusly catalytically promote the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. Moreover, the α-ZrP nanosheet provides a true-chemical anchor for sulfur species while the PPy helps to build a physical  and form a conductive network for accelerating the electron transport and finally promoting the electrochemical performance. In addition, the moderate catalysis  and efficient true-sulfur-confinement effect of α-ZrP are confirmed by experiments as well as theoretical computations. As a result, α-ZrP/PPy@S cathode exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 727.2 mA·h·g -1 even at a high current density of 5 C, offering a novel cathode material for the high performance Li-S batteries.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular tight-junctions (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut  on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut   and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut  integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut  causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597925>A Two Dimensional Tunneling Resistance Transmission Line Model for Nanoscale Parallel Electrical Contacts.</a></h2><p>Contact resistance and current crowding are important to nanoscale electrical contacts. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model to characterize partially overlapped parallel contacts with varying specific contact resistivity along the contact length. For parallel tunneling contacts formed between contacting members separated by a thin insulating gap, we examine the local voltage-dependent variation of potential  height and tunneling current along the contact length, by solving the lumped circuit transmission line model (TLM) equations coupled with the tunneling current self consistently. The current and voltage distribution along the parallel tunneling contacts and their overall contact resistance are analyzed in detail, for various input voltage, electrical contact dimension, and material properties (i.e. work , sheet resistance of the contact members, and permittivity of the insulating layer). It is found the existing one-dimensional (1D) tunneling junction models become less reliable when the tunneling layer thickness becomes smaller or the applied voltage becomes larger. In these regimes, the proposed self-consistent model may provide a more accurate evaluation of the parallel tunneling contacts. For the special case of constant ohmic specific contact resistivity along the contact length, our theory has been spot-checked with finite element method (FEM) based numerical simulations. This work provides insights on the design, and potential engineering, of nanoscale electrical contacts with controlled current distribution and contact resistance via engineered spatially varying contact layer properties and geometry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584781>A Global Review on the Risk Factors and Management of Early Atopic Dermatitis in Children Ages 0 to 2 Years Old</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease starting typically in atopic-prone children between 3–6 months of age, with most children having developed AD by the age of 5 years. Intense itching leads to sleep disturbance, especially in younger children and toddlers. This review explores early intervention in infants and young children with AD by controlling skin   and inflammation at the earliest time point using a moisturizer and a proactive treatment.A working group of experienced clinicians managing pediatric populations with AD convened for a meeting. The panel reviewed the literature surrounding early intervention in infants and young children with AD and developed and discussed clinical questions aimed at optimizing clinical outcomes.Complex gene/immune system/environment interactions are involved in AD development. Epidermal  defects play a central role in the condition, with various studies showing impairment of skin   at birth may precede clinical AD. Dynamic changes take place in the amounts of skin lipids during infancy. Studies confirm that daily use of a moisturizer from birth onwards may offer benefits in improving skin   and possibly prevention of AD, especially in high-risk, atopic prone newborns. Plant-based moisturizers were shown to be safe and effective when applied in pediatric patients with AD and may provide a TCS-sparing effect while improving skin condition.Dry skin conditions during infancy may predict the subsequent development of AD. Consequently, emollient therapy from birth represents a feasible, safe, and effective approach for AD prevention. Therefore, parental education and the application of moisturizers are recommended as an integral part of AD prevention, treatment, and maintenance.

Biological replicate sets of organoids were assessed using histological, functional and biochemical measurements.   knockdown leads to subtle changes in histology and ultrastructure including a reduction in thickness of the stratum corneum and smaller, less numerous keratohyalin granules. Immature organoids showed evidence of  impairment with  knockdown, but the mature organoids showed no difference in transepidermal water loss, water content or dye penetration. There was no difference in epidermal ceramide content. Mass spectrometry proteomic analysis detected >8000 proteins per sample.

Previous work has suggested that emotion-related impulsivity is tied to an impaired  of the serotonergic system. Central serotonin synthesis relies on the intake of the essential amino acid, tryptophan and its ability to pass through the blood brain .  The aim of this study was to determine the association between emotion-related impulsivity and tryptophan intake.  Undergraduate participants (N = 25, 16 women, 9 men) completed a self-rated measure of impulsivity (Three Factor Impulsivity Index, TFI) and daily logs of their food intake and exercise. These data were coded using the software NutriNote to evaluate intakes of tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, vitamins B6/B12, and exercise.  Correlational analyses indicated that higher tryptophan intake was associated with significantly lower scores on two out of three subscales of the TFI, Pervasive Influence of Feelings scores  =  < . and (lack-of) Follow-Through scores,  =  < . Findings provide further evidence that emotion-related impulsivity is correlated to serotonergic indices, even when considering only food habits.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis also known as Lyell's syndrome was first described by Lyell in 1956. Drugs are by far the most common cause of toxic epidermal necrolysis, in which large sheets of skin are lost from the body surface making redundant the   of the skin, with its resultant complications. Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions to various precipitating agents that predominantly involve the skin and mucous membranes. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is rare but considered medical emergencies as they are potentially fatal. Drugs are the most common cause accounting for about 65%-80% of the cases. The most common offending agents are sulfonamides, NSAIDs, butazones and hydrantoins. An immune mechanism is implicated in the pathogenesis, but its nature is still unclear. There is a prodormal phase in which there is burning sensation all over the skin and conjunctivae, along with skin tenderness, fever, malaise and arthralgias. Early sites of cutaneous involvement are the presternal region of the trunk and the face, but also the palms and soles, rapidly spread to their maximum extent, the oral mucosa and conjunctiva being affected. Initial lesions are macular, followed by desquamateion, or may be from atypical targets with purpuriccenters that coalesce, from bullae, then slough. The earlier a causative agent is withdrawn the better is the prognosis. Several treatment modalities given in addition to supportive care are reported in the literature, such as systemicsteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, ciclosporin, TNF antagonists. Recovery is slow over a period of 14-28 days and relapses are frequent. Mortality is 25%-50% and half the deaths occur due to secondary infection. Here we report a 50-year-old female of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. She was admitted to the dermatology ward with extensive peeling of skin over the trunk and limbs.

However, individual cellular and mechanistic contributions to tumor heterogeneity are controversial. We examined potential mechanisms of FOXA1 and PTEN inactivation in bladder cancer and their contribution to tumor heterogeneity. These analyses were complemented with inactivation of FOXA1 and PTEN in intermediate and luminal mouse urothelium. We show inactivation and reduced expression of FOXA1 and PTEN is prevalent in human disease, where PTEN and FOXA1 are downregulated by allelic loss and site-specific DNA hypermethylation, respectively. Conditional inactivation of both Foxa1 and Pten in intermediate/luminal cells in mice results in development of bladder cancer exhibiting squamous features as well as enhanced sensitivity to a bladder-specific carcinogen. In addition, FOXA1 is hypermethylated in basal bladder cancer cell lines, and this is reversed by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. By integrating human correlative and in vivo studies, we define a critical role for PTEN loss and epigenetic silencing of FOXA1 in heterogeneous human disease and show genetic targeting of luminal/intermediate cells in mice drives squamous differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593773>Laminin-driven Epac/Rap1 regulation of epithelial barriers on decellularized matrix.</a></h2><p>Decellularized tissues offer a unique tool for developing regenerative biomaterials or in vitro platforms for the study of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. One main challenge associated with decellularized lung tissue is that ECM components can be stripped away or altered by the detergents used to remove cellular debris. Without characterizing the composition of lung decellularized ECM (dECM) and the cellular response caused by the altered composition, it is difficult to utilize dECM for regeneration and specifically, engineering the complexities of the alveolar-capillary . This study takes steps towards uncovering if dECM must be enhanced with lost ECM proteins to achieve proper epithelial  formation. To achieve this, the epithelial   was assessed on dECM coatings with and without the systematic addition of several key basement membrane proteins. After comparing   on collagen I, fibronectin, laminin, and dECM in varying combinations as an in vitro coating, the alveolar epithelium exhibited superior   when dECM was supplemented with laminin as evidenced by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability assays. Increased  resistance with laminin addition was associated with upregulation of Claudin-18, E-cadherin, and junction adhesion molecule (JAM)-A, and stabilization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 at junction complexes. The Epac/Rap1 pathway was observed to play a role in the ECM-mediated   determined by protein expression and Epac inhibition. These findings revealed potential ECM coatings and molecular therapeutic targets for improved regeneration with decellularized scaffolds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Efforts to produce a transplantable organ-scale biomaterial for lung regeneration has not been entirely successful to date, due to incomplete cell-cell junction formation, ultimately leading to severe edema in vivo. To fully understand the process of alveolar junction formation on ECM-derived biomaterials, this research has characterized and tailored decellularized ECM (dECM) to mitigate reductions in  strength or cell attachment caused by abnormal ECM compositions or detergent damage to dECM. These results indicate that laminin-driven Epac signaling plays a vital role in the stabilization of the alveolar . Addition of laminin or Epac agonists during alveolar regeneration can reduce epithelial permeability within bioengineered lungs.Copyright © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although the mechanism is still unknown, some studies have shown that cigarette exposure affects the intestinal  of the small bowel. Among the factors that may be involved in this process are Paneth cells. These specialized epithelial cells are located into the small intestine, and they are able to secrete antimicrobial peptides, having an essential role in the control of the growth of microorganisms. Alterations in its  are associated with inflammatory processes, such as CD. To study how cigarette components impact ileum homeostasis and Paneth cells integrity, we used intragastric administration of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) in mice. Our results showed that inflammation was triggered after mucosal exposure of CSC, which induced particular alterations in Paneth cells granules, antimicrobial peptide production, and a reduction of bactericidal capacity. In fact, exposure to CSC generated an imbalance in the fecal bacterial population and increased the susceptibility of mice to develop ileal damage in response to bacterial infection. Moreover, our results obtained in mice unable to produce interleukin 10 (IL-10 mice) suggest that CSC treatment can induce a symptomatic enterocolitis with a pathological inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals.Copyright © 2019 Berkowitz, Pardo-Roa, Salazar, Salazar-Echegarai, Miranda, Ramírez, Chávez, Kalergis, Bueno and Álvarez-Lobos.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629733>Pharmacological and toxicological in vitro and in vivo effect of higher doses of oxime reactivators.</a></h2><p>The major  of compounds with an oxime moiety attached to a quarternary nitrogen pyridinium ring is to reactivate acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphorus agent (OP). However, other oxime mechanisms (e.g. modulation of cholinergic or glutamatergic receptor) may be involved in the recovery. The main disadvantage of positively charged reactivators is their low ability to penetrate into the brain although crossing the blood brain  could be supported via increasing the dose of administered oxime. Thus, this study presents maximal tolerated doses (MTD) for marketed oximes (TMB-4, MMB-4, LüH-6, HI-6, 2-PAM) and the most promising K-oximes (K027, K048, K203) which can be used in OP therapy in the future. No signs of sarin intoxication were observed in mice treated with 100% MTD of HI-6 in contrast to those treated with atropine and only 5% LD of HI-6. 100% MTD of HI-6 resulted in levels of 500 μM and 12 μM in plasma and brain, respectively. This concentration is by a far margin safe with respect to direct effects on neuronal cell viability and, on the other hand, does not have any effects on central NMDA receptors or central nACh receptors. However, a weak antimuscarinic activity in case of LüH-6 and a weak peripheral antinicotinic action in case of TMB-4 and 2-PAM could be observed at their respective 100% MTD dose. These high doses, represented by MTD, are, however, irrelevant to clinical practice since they led to mild to moderate toxic side effects. Therefore, we conclude that clinically used doses of marketed oxime reactivators have no significant direct pharmacological effect on the tested receptors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Current understanding of drug permeability at placental and blood-brain barriers during development is poor. In adults, ABC transporters limit many drugs from entering the brain; however, little is known about their  during development. : The transfer of clinically relevant doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen), digoxin and cimetidine into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was estimated using radiolabelled drugs in Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental stages: E19, P4 and adult. Drugs were applied intraperitoneally either acutely or following chronic exposure (for five days). Entry into brain, CSF and transfer across the placenta was measured and compared to three markers (L-glucose, sucrose, glycerol) that cross barriers by "passive diffusion". The expression of ABC transporters in the brain, choroid plexus and placenta was estimated using RT-qPCR. : All three drugs entered the developing brain and CSF in higher amounts than the adult brain and CSF. Comparisons with "passive" permeability markers suggested that this might be due to age-related differences in the functional capacity of ABC-efflux mechanisms. In adult animals, chronic treatment reduced digoxin (12% to 5%, p<0.01) and paracetamol (30% to 21%, p<0.05) entry compared to acute treatment, with the decrease in digoxin entry correlating with up-regulation of efflux transporter  (PGP). In fetal and newborn animals, no gene up-regulation or transfer decreases were observed. Instead, chronic paracetamol treatment resulted in increased transfer into the fetal brain (66% to 104%, p<0.001). : These results suggest that the developing brain may be more at risk from acute drug exposure than the adult brain due to reduced efflux capacity and at greater risk from chronic treatment due to a lack of efflux mechanism regulatory capacity.Copyright: © 2019 Koehn L et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660977>NDP-MSH binding melanocortin-1 receptor ameliorates neuroinflammation and BBB disruption through CREB/Nr4a1/NF-κB pathway after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.</a></h2><p>Neuroinflammation and blood-brain  (BBB) disruption are two vital mechanisms of secondary brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Recently, melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) activation by Nle4-D-Phe7-α-MSH (NDP-MSH) was shown to play a neuroprotective role in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. This study aimed to investigate whether NDP-MSH could alleviate neuroinflammation and BBB disruption after experimental ICH, as well as the potential mechanisms of its neuroprotective roles.Two hundred and eighteen male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to autologous blood-injection ICH model. NDP-MSH, an agonist of Mc1r, was administered intraperitoneally injected at 1 h after ICH insult. To further explore the related protective mechanisms, Mc1r small interfering RNA (Mc1r siRNA) and nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1) siRNA were administered via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection before ICH induction. Neurological test, BBB permeability, brain water content, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis were implemented.The Expression of Mc1r was significantly increased after ICH. Mc1r was mainly expressed in microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells following ICH. Treatment with NDP-MSH remarkably improved neurological  and reduced BBB disruption, brain water content, and the number of microglia in the peri-hematoma tissue after ICH. Meanwhile, the administration of NDP-MSH significantly reduced the expression of p-NF-κB p65, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-9 and increased the expression of p-CREB, Nr4a1, ZO-1, occludin, and Lama5. Inversely, the knockdown of Mc1r or Nr4a1 abolished the neuroprotective effects of NDP-MSH.Taken together, NDP-MSH binding Mc1r attenuated neuroinflammation and BBB disruption and improved neurological deficits, at least in part through CREB/Nr4a1/NF-κB pathway after ICH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618600>Contributions of Aging to Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.</a></h2><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is characterized by changes in the pial and parenchymal microcirculations. SVD produces reductions in cerebral blood flow and impaired blood-brain  , which are leading contributors to age-related reductions in brain health. End-organ effects are diverse, resulting in both cognitive and noncognitive deficits. Underlying phenotypes and mechanisms are multifactorial, with no specific treatments at this time. Despite consequences that are already considerable, the impact of SVD is predicted to increase substantially with the growing aging population. In the face of this health challenge, the basic biology, pathogenesis, and determinants of SVD are poorly defined. This review summarizes recent progress and concepts in this area, highlighting key findings and some major unanswered questions. We focus on phenotypes and mechanisms that underlie microvascular aging, the greatest risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and its subsequent effects.

Renovascular hypertension represents the most common cause of secondary hypertension, and its progress is associated with overactivation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), causing systemic and local changes. Aliskiren is a renin-inhibiting drug that optimizes RAAS suppression. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the left kidney in Wistar rats with renovascular hypertension after treatment with Aliskiren. Parameters such as systolic blood pressure, urinary creatinine and protein excretion, renal cortex structure and ultrastructure, fibrosis and tissue inflammation were analyzed. Our results showed that the hypertensive animals treated with Aliskiren presented a reestablishment of blood pressure, expression of renin, and renal , as well as a remodeling of morphological alterations through the reduction of fibrosis. The treatment regulated the laminin expression and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring the integrity of the glomerular filtration . Therefore, our findings suggest that Aliskiren has a renoprotective effect acting on the improvement of the morphology,  and pathology of the renal cortex of animals with renovascular hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628933>Glutathione alleviates acute intracerebral hemorrhage injury via reversing mitochondrial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Glutathione (GSH) has been studied for its neuroprotection value in several diseases, but the effect of GSH on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. In this study, we examined the protective effects of GSH in an experimentally induced ICH model and investigated the relative mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6j mice were randomized into Sham, ICH and GSH treatment groups. GSH was injected with the dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg / kg once per day for 3 days, starting immediately after operation. The results revealed a GSH-mediated improvement of neurological deficits score (NDS), motor and sensory functions impairment in a dose-dependent manner three days post ICH (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 12; ICH, n=9; GSH 50, n=10; GSH 100, n=10; GSH 200, n=11) in addition to significantly reduced mortality rate (p =0.2632, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group) and damage volume (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. n = 12 per group). GSH treatment also attenuated injury measured by decreased brain edema (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), blood-brain  disruption (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 10; ICH, n=10; GSH 200, n=12), and histopathological damage (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) 72 h after ICH. In addition, GSH treatment also decreased cell apoptosis (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8) and resulted in up-regulated protein expression of complex I (p < 0.01, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 6; ICH, n= 6; GSH 200, n=8), which was consistent with an overall up-regulation of complex I  in mitochondria using Oxygraph-2K high resolution respirometry (p < 0.05, GSH 200 vs ICH. Sham, n= 4; ICH, n= 5; GSH 200, n=6). In conclusion, GSH effectively improved the prognosis of ICH mice by attenuating neurological impairment, decreasing neural damage, and inhibiting apoptosis. The neuroprotection by GSH resulted from the up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative respiration . The results of our study suggest that GSH can be a potential therapeutic agent for ICH.Copyright © 2019.

HPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS/MS) analyses of individual phenolic compounds revealed that the petal and stamen contained higher levels of flavonoid glycosides than other organs ( < 0.05). Kaempferol-3,7-di--glucoside was the dominant flavonoid in these two organs, however, the calyx and ovary contained higher contents of gallic acid derivatives than other organs ( < 0.05). Hexa--galloyl-glucose was the dominant species in the calyx and ovary. At the same concentration of total phenolic extract (TPE), the stamen had the highest protection effect on Caco-2 cell oxidative damage induced by HO. The antioxidant effect was attributed to potent antioxidant capability; restored redox state due to the increased expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); and improved   of Caco-2 cell owing to increased zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), CLDN3 (Claudin 3), and occludin mRNA expression.

Patients with severe cerebrovascular stenosis often undergo cerebrovascular bypass surgery. However, the sharply increased fluid shear stress (FSS) after cerebrovascular bypass disrupts the physiological  of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) at the lesion site, damaging BBB and inducing intracerebral hemorrhage eventually.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and  of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1  leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut   by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The protective role of ubiquitin E3 ligase A20 (A20) in colitis needs to be further elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether A20 exogenous administration restored impaired intestinal permeability and inhibited T helper (Th)2 response in mice with colitis.The effect of A20 overexpression in colonic mucosa on epithelial   and T cell differentiation was evaluated in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis.A20 rectal treatment alleviated DSS-induced chronic colitis and restored impaired intestinal permeability.

However, molecular mechanisms are not fully understood yet. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood retinal  (oBRB) and supplies glucose, oxygen and nutrients from the fenestrated choriocapillaris to photoreceptors for visual . Therefore, RPE dysfunction leads to photoreceptor injury/death and progression of blinding eye diseases. This study aims to understand the role of the thioredoxin (Trx) and its reductase (TrxR) redox signaling in human RPE dysfunction and cell death mechanism(s) in an  system.A human RPE cell line (APRE-19) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and treated with auranofin (AF - 4 μM, an inhibitor of TrxR) for 4 and 24 h. Mitochondrial and lysosomal , cellular oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activity were measured using cell assays, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for blocking AF effects on RPE damage. Cell death mechanisms (LDH release to culture media) were determined using necroptosis, ferroptosis and pyroptosis inhibitors.  < 0.05 was considered significant in statistical analysis.Auranofin causes mitochondrial dysfunction (Δψm↓ and ATP↓), oxidative stress (HO↑) and mitophagic flux to lysosomes. Furthermore, the lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin L) activity is reduced while that of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 (NLRP3 inflammasome) is enhanced in ARPE-19. These effects of AF on ARPE-19 are inhibited by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (5 mM, NAC) and significantly by a combination of SS31 (mitochondrial antioxidant) and anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox and tranilast). AF also causes cell death as measured by cytosolic LDH release/leakage, which is not inhibited by either ferrostatin-1 or necrostatin-1 (ferroptosis and necroptosis inhibitors, respectively). Conversely, AF-induced LDH release is significantly reduced by MCC950 and Ac-YVAD-cmk (NLRP3 and Caspase-1 inhibitors, respectively), suggesting a pro-inflammatory cell death by pyroptosis.The Trx/TrxR redox system is critical for RPE  and viability. We previously showed that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is strongly induced in DR inhibiting the Trx/TrxR system and RPE dysfunction. Therefore, our results suggest that the TXNIP-Trx-TrxR redox pathway may participate in RPE dysfunction in DR and other retinal neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Yumnamcha, Devi and Singh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636846>Alleviation of Ultraviolet B-Induced Photoaging by 7-MEGA 500 in Hairless Mouse Skin.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 7-MEGA™ 500 on the improvement of skin aging in an UVB-induced photo-aging model of hairless mice.

Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1àVEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC  integrity revealed that VEGF induces   disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification on the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603194>Endothelial SIRT6 blunts stroke size and neurological deficit by preserving blood-brain  integrity: a translational study.</a></h2><p>Aging is an established risk factor for stroke; genes regulating longevity are implicated in the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke where to date, therapeutic options remain limited. The blood-brain  (BBB) is crucially involved in ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury thus representing an attractive target for developing novel therapeutic agents. Given the role of endothelial cells in the BBB, we hypothesized that the endothelial-specific expression of the recently described longevity gene SIRT6 may exhibit protective properties in stroke.SIRT6 endothelial expression was reduced following stroke. Endothelial-specific Sirt6 knockout (eSirt6-/-) mice, as well as animals in which Sirt6 overexpression was post-ischaemically induced, underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). eSirt6-/- animals displayed increased infarct volumes, mortality, and neurological deficit after tMCAO, as compared to control littermates. Conversely, post-ischaemic Sirt6 overexpression decreased infarct size and neurological deficit. Analysis of ischaemic brain sections revealed increased BBB damage and endothelial expression of cleaved caspase-3 in eSIRT6-/- mice as compared to controls. In primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs), hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) reduced SIRT6 expression and SIRT6 silencing impaired the   (transendothelial resistance) similar to what was observed in mice exposed to I/R. Further, SIRT6-silenced HBMVECs exposed to H/R showed reduced viability, increased cleaved caspase-3 expression and reduced activation of the survival pathway Akt. In ischaemic stroke patients, SIRT6 expression was higher in those with short-term neurological improvement as assessed by NIHSS scale and correlated with stroke outcome.Endothelial SIRT6 exerts a protective role in ischaemic stroke by blunting I/R-mediated BBB damage and thus, it may represent an interesting novel therapeutic target to be explored in future clinical investigation.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The failure to demonstrate drug efficacy has been the major reason that drug development does not progress beyond phase II and III clinical trials. The combination of two-dimensional (2D) cellular in vitro and animal models has been the gold standard for basic science research and preclinical drug development studies. However, most findings from these systems fail to translate into human trials because these models only partly recapitulate human  and pathology. The lack of a dynamic three-dimensional microenvironment in 2D cellular models reduces the physiological relevance, and for these reasons, 3D and microfluidic model systems are now being developed as more native-like biological assay platforms. 3D cellular in vitro systems, microfluidics, self-organized organoids, and 3D biofabrication are the most promising technologies to mimic human  because they provide mechanical cues and a 3D microenvironment to the multicellular components. With the advent of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, the 3D dynamic in vitro systems further enable extensive access to human-like tissue models. As increasingly complex 3D cellular systems are produced, the use of current visualization technologies is limited due to the thickness and opaqueness of 3D tissues. Tissue-clearing techniques improve light penetration deep into tissues by matching refractive indices among the 3D components. 3D segmentation enables quantitative measurements based on 3D tissue images. Using these state-of-the-art technologies, high-throughput screening (HTS) of thousands of drug compounds in 3D tissue models is slowly becoming a reality. In order to screen thousands of compounds, machine learning will need to be applied to help maximize outcomes from the use of cheminformatics and phenotypic approaches to drug screening.

The EP4 receptor is known to mediate the protective effect of prostaglandin (PG) E in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the exact role of epithelial EP4 in intestinal pathophysiology remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of epithelial EP4 in maintaining colonic homeostasis by characterizing the intestinal epithelial cell-specific EP4 knockout (EP4 cKO) mice. Mice harboring the epithelial EP4 deletion showed significantly lower colonic crypt depth and lower numbers of secretory cell lineages, as well as impaired epithelial cells in the colon. Interestingly, EP4-deficient colon epithelia showed a higher number of apoptotic cells. Consistent with the defect in mucosal   of colonic epithelia and secretory cell lineages, EP4 cKO colon stroma showed enhanced immune cell infiltration, which was accompanied by increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, EP4-deficient colons were susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Our study is the first to demonstrate that epithelial EP4 loss resulted in potential "inflammatory" status under physiological conditions.

Endothelial cells respond to laminar and disturbed flow by structural and functional adaption, which involves reprogramming gene expression, cell proliferation and migration, senescence, autophagy and cell death, as well as synthesizing signal molecules (nitric oxide and prostanoids, etc) that act in manners of autocrine, paracrine, or juxtacrine. Inflammation occurs after infection or tissue injury. Dysregulated inflammatory response participates in pathogenesis of many diseases. Endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli from the circulation or the microenvironment exhibit impaired vascular tone, increased permeability, elevated procoagulant activity, and dysregulated vascular formation, collectively contributing to the development of vascular diseases.

Instead of fulfilling the  of a protective , tissues damaged by high temperature create a niche that serves as an environment and source of nourishment for pathogens. An accepted practice is to use antibiotics to inhibit development of pathogens. Taking into consideration the characteristics of the burn wound and increasing antibiotic resistance, the search for new substances that have both antimicrobial and regenerative effects seems justified. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of lauric acid on bacteria-colonizing tissue samples taken during surgical treatment of burns.Lauric acid was combined with 5 different ointment bases: Anhydrous Eucerin DAB, Anhydrous Eucerin II, Hydrophilic Vaseline, White Vaseline, and Lekobaza. The content of lauric acid in the ointment bases was 10% to 20% w/w. The preparations were applied onto samples of burnt skin collected during surgery. The samples were subsequently subjected to a microbiological test with the use of model strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.With one exception (White Vaseline), lauric acid showed a more pronounced effect on bacteria in 20% w/w concentration. In a 10% lauric acid concentration, no effect on bacteria was observed on the Hydrophilic Vaseline ointment base. Lauric acid had the strongest inhibiting effect on microbial growth of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Satisfactory zones of inhibition were also observed in the case of Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed only when pure lauric acid was used.Due to its aseptic and regenerative effect on chemically damaged tissues, lauric acid can be a promising modifier of the burn healing process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633322>On-Demand Visible-Light Sensing with Optical Memory Capability based on an Electrical Breakdown Triggered Negative Photoconductivity Effect in the Ubiquitous Transparent Hafnia.</a></h2><p>A transparent visible light sensor may sound like an oxymoron. Indeed, this scenario is often deemed challenging in conventional photosensitive semiconducting materials due to the complementary relationship between absorbance (which determines photosensitivity) and transmittance (which determines transparency). Past studies have relied on photo-induced ionization of vacancy defect states within a wide bandgap oxide to modulate the flow of current or charge storage in specific device structures such as nanorods, hetero oxide junctions or thin film transistors. Here, we demonstrate visible-light sensing and optical memory functions in a thin, optically transparent wide-bandgap oxide such as the ubiquitous hafnium dioxide, following a soft electrical breakdown. The physical mechanism is distinguished by a persistent current decrease that spans several orders of magnitude, indicating that the breakdown oxide is restored by the visible light. Physical characterization by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles simulation study based on the DFT provide a strong support for the proposed light-assisted recombination of electrically induced Frenkel-pair defects as the underlying mechanism for the observed negative photoconductance response and optical memory effect. By harnessing this alternative mechanism, this work demonstrates a different approach of overcoming the traditional  in realizing both transparency and on-demand visible-light sensing with optical memory  all in a single device.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576759>Sodium Tanshinone IIA Silate Alleviates High Glucose Induced  Impairment of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium through the Reduction of NF-κB Activation via the AMPK/p300 Pathway.</a></h2><p> The disruption of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)  may perform a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR).

The   of RPE cells were measured by Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability. The interaction of NF-κB p65 and p300 were tested using immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assay. Protein levels were assayed using Western blot.  We found STS promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at T172 in RPE cells, and STS treatment thus inhibited ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability under HG condition, similar to the permeability under normal glucose (5.5 mmol glucose, NG). Moreover, we found that STS obviously prevented the colocalization of NF-κB and p300, and significantly inhibited their binding, subsequent decreased ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability. Notably, Compound C (CC), a specific inhibitor of AMPK, blocked STS-mediated inhibition of ARPE-19 cell monolayer permeability.  STS inhibited HG-induced RPE permeability possibly through the reduction of NF-κB activation via the AMPK/p300 pathway. The protective effects of STS were attained through the suppression of p300-mediated NF-κB acetylation and STS might be utilized for treatment of DR, in terms of preventing inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592352>The cuticle inward  in  is shaped by mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes and a sex-specific effect of diet.</a></h2><p>An important role of the insect cuticle is to prevent wetting (i.e., permeation of water) and also to prevent penetration of potentially harmful substances. This   mainly depends on the hydrophobic cuticle surface composed of lipids including cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). We investigated to what extent the cuticle inward   depends on the genotype, comprising mitochondrial and nuclear genes in the fruit fly  and investigated the contribution of interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genotypes (mito-nuclear interactions) on this . In addition, we assessed the effects of nutrition and sex on the cuticle  . Based on a dye penetration assay, we find that cuticle   varies across three fly lines that were captured from geographically separated regions in three continents. Testing different combinations of mito-nuclear genotypes, we show that the inward  efficiency is modulated by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes independently. We also find an interaction between diet and sex. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of cuticle inward   in nature.©2019 Dong et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661276>Temperature and Pressure Dependent Kinetics of QOOH Decomposition and Reaction with O: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of QOOH Radicals Derived from Cl + (CH)COOH.</a></h2><p>QOOH radicals are key species in autoignition, produced by internal isomerisations of RO radicals, and are central to chain branching reactions in low temperature combustion. The kinetics of QOOH radical decomposition and reaction with O have been determined as a  of temperature and pressure, using observations of OH radical production and decay following H-atom abstraction from tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide ((CH)COOH) by Cl atoms to produce QOOH (CH(CH)COOH) radicals. The kinetics of QOOH decomposition have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 298 K), and pressure (10 to 350 Torr), in helium and nitrogen bath gases, and those of the reaction between QOOH and O have been investigated as a  of temperature (251 to 304 K), and pressure (10 to 100 Torr) in He and N. Decomposition of the QOOH radicals was observed to display temperature and pressure dependence, with a  height for decomposition of (44.7 ± 4.0) kJ mol determined by master equation fitting to the experimental data. The rate coefficient for the reaction between QOOH and O was determined to be (5.6 ± 1.7) × 10 cm s at 298 K, with no significant dependence on pressure, and can be described by the Arrhenius parameters  = (7.3 ± 6.8) × 10 cm s and  = -(5.4 ± 2.1) kJ mol in the temperature range 251 to 304 K.

All main elements of the RAS are active in the retina: renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzymes. The functional role of the intraretinal RAS is not fully understood. So far, histological and functional analysis point to a regulation of ganglion cell activity and maybe also of bipolar cell activity, but it is not clear how RAS contributes to retinal signal processing. In contrast to local RAS in other organs, the retinal RAS is clearly separated from the systemic RAS. The angiotensin-2 (AngII)/AngI ratio in the retina is different to that in the plasma. However, it appears that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), that forms the outer blood/retina , is a major regulator of the retinal RAS by producing renin. Interestingly, comparable to the kidney, the renin production in the RPE is under control of the angiotensin-2 receptor type-1 (AT1). AT1 localizes to the basolateral membrane of the RPE and faces the blood side of the blood/retina . Increases in systemic AngII reduce renin production in the RPE and therefore decrease the intraretinal RAS activity. The relevance of the local RAS for retinal  remains unclear. Nevertheless, it is of fundamental significance to understand the pathology of systemically induced retinal diseases such as hypertension or diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We employed brain microvascular endothelial cells; to investigate the effects of P53 towards the lipid oxidation of the BBB. P53 reduction by LPS, siRNA for P53 and Pifithrin increased the expression levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, P53 suppression impaired the permeability of the BBB monolayers. In contrast, P53 induction by Nutlin and Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 enhanced the BBB . In conclusion, P53 supports BBB integrity, at least in part, by reducing lipid peroxidation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

They are released by a variety of cell types, are heterogeneous, and can roughly be divided into microvesicles and exosomes according to their occurrence and . Of course, exosomes do not just play a role in cell-to-cell communication. In the nervous system, exosomes can participate in intercellular communication, maintain the myelin sheath, and eliminate waste. Similarly, exosomes in the brain can play a role in central nervous system diseases, such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with both positive and negative effects (such as the transfer of misfolded proteins). Exosomes contain a variety of key bioactive substances and can therefore be considered as a snapshot of the intracellular environment. Studies have shown that exosomes from the central nervous system can be found in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral body fluids, and that their contents will change with disease occurrence. Because exosomes can penetrate the blood brain  (BBB) and are highly stable in peripheral circulation, they can protect disease-related molecules well and therefore, using exosomes as a biomarker of central nervous system diseases is an attractive prospect as they can be used to monitor disease development and enable early diagnosis and treatment optimization. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of exosomes, and introduce their pathophysiological roles in different diseases of the central nervous system as well as their roles and applications as a viable pathological biomarker.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Bai, Zhang, Huang, Xu and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628277>A novel model of cerebral hyperperfusion with blood-brain  breakdown, white matter injury, and cognitive dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Cerebral hyperperfusion (CHP) is associated with considerable morbidity. Its pathophysiology involves disruption of the blood-brain  (BBB) with subsequent events such as vasogenic brain edema and ischemic and/or hemorrhagic complications. Researchers are trying to mimic the condition of CHP; however, a proper animal model is still lacking. In this paper the authors report a novel surgically induced CHP model that mimics the reported pathophysiology of clinical CHP including BBB breakdown, white matter (WM) injury, inflammation, and cognitive impairment.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and contralateral CCA stenosis. Three days after the initial surgery, the stenosis of CCA was released to induce CHP. Cortical regional cerebral blood flow was measured using laser speckle flowmetry. BBB breakdown was assessed by Evans blue dye extravasation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels. WM injury was investigated with Luxol fast blue staining. Cognitive  was assessed using the Barnes circular maze. Other changes pertaining to inflammation were also assessed. Sham-operated animals were prepared and used as controls.Cerebral blood flow was significantly raised in the cerebral cortex after CHP induction. CHP induced BBB breakdown evident by Evans blue dye extravasation, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was identified as a possible culprit. WM degeneration was evident in the corpus callosum and corpus striatum. Immunohistochemistry revealed macrophage activation and glial cell upregulation as an inflammatory response to CHP in the striatum and cerebral cortex. CHP also caused significant impairments in spatial learning and memory compared with the sham-operated animals.The authors report a novel CHP model in rats that represents the pathophysiology of CHP observed in various clinical scenarios. This model was produced without the use of pharmacological agents; therefore, it is ideal to study the pathology of CHP as well as to perform preclinical drug trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608212>Efficacy and Safety of All-oral, 12-week Ravidasvir Plus Ritonavir-boosted Danoprevir and Ribavirin in Treatment-naïve Noncirrhotic HCV Genotype 1 Patients: Results from a Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial in China.</a></h2><p> Ravidasvir (RDV) is a new generation pangenotypic hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor, with high  to baseline resistance-associated species. This is the first phase 2/3 study conducted in Mainland China confirming the efficacy and safety of RDV + ritonavir-boosted danoprevir + ribavirin for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve noncirrhotic patients with genotype 1 infection in a large population.  In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial (), we enrolled 424 treatment-naïve, noncirrhotic adult HCV genotype 1 patients. All patients were randomized at 3:1 ratio to receive a combination of RDV 200mg once daily plus ritonavir-boosted danoprevir 100mg/100mg twice daily and oral ribavirin 1000/1200mg/day (body weight <75/≥75 kg) ( = 318) or placebo ( = 106) for 12 weeks. The primary end-point was the rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment, and the safety was evaluated and compared between treatment and placebo groups.  The overall rate of sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment is 99% (306/309, 95%, CI: 97%-100%) under per protocol set analysis. All patients harboring baseline NS5A resistance-associated species in the treatment group (76/76, per protocol set) achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Laboratory abnormalities showed mild or moderate severity (grade 1 and grade 2) in liver  tests.  In treatment-naïve, noncirrhotic HCV Chinese patients infected with HCV genotype 1, all-oral regimen of RDV + ritonavir-boosted danoprevir + ribavirin for 12 weeks was highly efficacious, safe, and well tolerated.© 2019 Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639971>Dynamic susceptibility of a concentrated ferrofluid: The role of interparticle interactions.</a></h2><p>The dynamic susceptibility of concentrated ferrofluids of magnetite-kerosene type is studied experimentally to clarify the effect of interparticle interactions on the magnetization reversal dynamics and the ferrofluid relaxation time spectrum. We synthesize six ferrofluid samples, four of which have the same wide particle size distribution with a high (more than 2kT) average energy of magnetic dipole interactions. These samples differ in particle concentration and dynamic viscosity. The two remaining samples have a lower content of large particles and a moderate energy of magnetic dipole interactions. For all samples, we measure the dynamic susceptibility in the weak probing field at frequencies up to 160 kHz and the field amplitude dependence of the susceptibility at a frequency of 27 kHz. The results show that the susceptibility dispersion at frequencies up to 10 kHz is due to the rotational diffusion of colloidal particles and aggregates. Steric and hydrodynamic interparticle interactions are the main reason for the strong concentration dependence of the viscosity and so they also strongly influence the frequency dependence of the susceptibility. The influence of van der Waals and magnetic dipole interactions on the susceptibility is manifested indirectly, through the formation of multiparticle clusters. The contribution of clusters to the low-frequency susceptibility reaches 80%. Their large sizes (about 100 nm) shift the dispersion region to frequencies of 1-100 Hz, depending on the temperature and particle concentration. Experiments at 27 kHz demonstrate the increase in the dynamic susceptibility with increasing field amplitude. This growth is unexpected since all spectral amplitudes in the Debye  expansion of the dynamic susceptibility decrease monotonically with increasing field. To clarify the situation, the auxiliary problem of the magnetodynamics of a uniaxial particle in the alternating field is solved numerically. The Fokker-Planck-Brown rotational diffusion equation is used. It is shown that an increase in the field amplitude reduces the anisotropy  and the Néel relaxation time of particles and increases the dynamic susceptibility by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the weak-field limit. The calculation results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data and allow us to propose a consistent interpretation of these data. We find that the increase in dynamic susceptibility with increasing amplitude is observed when two necessary conditions are met: (i) The suspension viscosity and the field frequency are high enough to cause the blocking of the rotational degrees of freedom of particles and aggregates and (ii) particles with a large magnetic anisotropy are present in the ferrofluid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590226>Sub-Inhibitory Clindamycin and Azithromycin reduce  Exoprotein Induced Toxicity, Inflammation,  Disruption and Invasion.</a></h2><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as a chronic inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinus mucosa associated with relapsing infections-particularly with S. aureus.

Because both neurotrophins can cross the brain-blood  (BBB), their blood levels indirectly reflect their production in the CNS. Moreover, both neuropeptides are involved in modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic system . Because limited information is available on the effects of exercise to volition exhaustion and acute hypoxia on CNS, BDNF and GDNF formation, the aims of the present study were to verify whether 1) acute exercise to exhaustion in addition to neurons also activates glial cells and 2) additional exposure to acute normobaric moderate hypoxia affects their . In this feasibility study we measured blood concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, and neuropeptides considered as biomarkers of brain damage (bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP) in seven sedentary healthy young men who performed a graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer under normoxic (N) and hypoxic conditions: 2,000 m (H2; FiO2 = 16.6%) and 3,000 m altitude (H3; FiO2 = 14.7%). In all conditions serum concentrations of both BDNF and GDNF increased immediately after cessation of exercise (p<0.01). There was no effect of condition or interaction (condition x time of measurement) and exercise on any of the brain damage biomarkers: bFGF, NGF, S100B, GFAP. Moreover, in N (0<0.01) and H3 (p<0.05) exercise caused elevated serum 5-HT concentration. The results suggest that a graded effort to volitional exhaustion in normoxia, as well as hypoxia, simultaneously activates both neurons and astrocytes. Considering that s100B, GFAP, bFGF, and NGF (produced mainly by astrocytes) are markers of brain damage, it can be assumed that a maximum effort in both conditions is safe for the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650247>Tricellular tight junction protein LSR/angulin-1 contributes to the epithelial  and malignancy in human pancreatic cancer cell line.</a></h2><p>Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR)/angulin-1 is a crucial molecule of tricellular contacts in the epithelial  of normal cells and the malignancy of cancer cells.

Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain  permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63;  < 0.001;  = 171 animals) and improved blood-brain  integrity (standardized mean difference: -2.02; 95% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77;  = 0.002;  = 129 animals).

Decades of research have yielded thorough descriptions of these outcomes; however, less is known about the molecular processes that drive them. The aim of this study was to further describe the cellular and molecular responses to O3 exposure in murine airways, with a particular focus on transcriptional responses in two critical compartments: conducting airways (CA) and airway macrophages (AM). After exposing adult, female C57BL/6J mice to filtered air, 1 or 2 ppm O3, we assessed hallmark responses including airway inflammation (cell counts and cytokine secretion) and injury (epithelial permeability), followed by gene expression profiling of CA and AM by RNA-seq. As expected, we observed concentration-dependent increases in airway inflammation and injury. CA and AM both exhibited changes in gene expression to both 1 and 2 ppm O3 that were largely compartment-specific. In CA, genes associated with epithelial  , detoxification processes, and cellular proliferation were altered, while O3 affected genes involved in innate immune signaling, cytokine production, and extracellular matrix remodeling in AM. Further, CA and AM also exhibited notable differences in concentration-response expression patterns for large numbers of genes. Overall, our study has described transcriptional responses to acute O3 exposure, revealing both shared and unique gene expression patterns across multiple concentrations of O3 and in two important O3-responsive tissues. These profiles provide broad mechanistic insight into pulmonary O3 toxicity, and reveal a variety of targets for focused follow-up studies.© The Author(s) 2019.

Not only are they important independent operators, providing a platform for both static and dynamic organization and communication within the cell, they also exert significant effects via the chemical modification of proteins. Addition of a lipid post-translational modification (PTM) alters protein hydrophobicity and behavior, with distinct consequences for subcellular trafficking, localization, intra- and intermolecular interactions, and stability. One of the most abundant and widespread protein lipidation events is S-acylation, installation of a long-chain lipid to the thiol of a cysteine side chain through a thioester linkage. S-Acylation is often referred to as -palmitoylation, due to the prevalence of palmitate as the lipid modification. Unlike many lipid PTMs, S-acylation is enzymatically reversible, enabling the cell to tune proteome-wide properties through dynamic alterations in protein lipidation status. While much has been uncovered about the molecular effects of S-acylation and its implications for , current biochemical and chemical methods only assess substrate lipidation levels or steady-state levels of enzyme activity. Yet, the writer protein acyl transferases (PATs) and eraser acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) are dynamically active, responsible for sometimes-rapid changes in -palmitoylation status of target proteins. Thus, to understand the full scope, significance, and subtlety of S-deacylation and its regulation in the cell, it is necessary to observe the timing and cellular geography of regulatory enzyme activities. In this Account, we review the chemical tools developed by our group to selectively visualize and perturb the activity of APTs in live cells, highlighting the biological insights gained from their application. To visualize APT activity, we masked fluorogenic molecules with thioacylated, peptide-based APT substrate mimetics; APT activity and thus thiol deprotection releases a fluorescent product in the turn-on depalmitoylation probes (DPPs), while in ratiometric depalmitoylation probes (RDPs) the emission of the parent fluorophore is altered. Application of these probes in live cells reveals that APT activity is sensitive to cell signaling events and metabolic disturbances. Additionally, as indicated above, the location of regulatory enzymes is critical in lipid signaling, and one organelle of particular interest, due to its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its legion of lipidated proteins, is the mitochondria. Therefore, we developed a class of spatially constrained mitoDPPs to visualize mitochondrial APT activity as well as a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial deacylation activity, mitoFP. With these tools, we identify two mitochondrial -depalmitoylases and connect mitochondrial -depalmitoylation to redox buffering capacity. Moreover, some of the changes in activity observed are specific to the mitochondria, confirming spatial as well as temporal regulation of eraser protein activity. Overall, this chemical toolkit for -depalmitoylase activity, imaging reagents and a targeted inhibitor, will continue to illuminate the regulatory mechanisms and roles of -depalmitoylation within the complex homeostatic networks of the cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601988>The blood-brain  and blood-tumour  in brain tumours and metastases.</a></h2><p>For a blood-borne cancer therapeutic agent to be effective, it must cross the blood vessel wall to reach cancer cells in adequate quantities, and it must overcome the resistance conferred by the local microenvironment around cancer cells.

We discuss the challenges posed by the BBB and BTB for drug delivery, how multiple cell types dictate BBB  and the role of the BTB in disease progression and treatment. Finally, we highlight emerging molecular, cellular and physical strategies to improve drug delivery across the BBB and BTB and discuss their impact on improving conventional as well as emerging treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and engineered T cells. A deeper understanding of the BBB and BTB through the application of single-cell sequencing and imaging techniques, and the development of biomarkers of BBB integrity along with systems biology approaches, should enable new personalized treatment strategies for primary brain malignancies and brain metastases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581301>A bioactive extract from Olea europaea protects newly weaned beef heifers against experimentally induced chronic inflammation1.</a></h2><p>Weaning is one of the most stressful periods in the life of a ruminant.

In addition, increasing highly fermentable carbohydrates in the diet at the expense of physically effective fiber after weaning predisposes the development of rumen acidosis and increases the concentration of endotoxin in rumen fluid and the permeability of the lower gut to luminal contents. Endotoxin translocation can elicit immune activation, shifting the metabolic priorities toward the immune system, which if sustained over time can hinder animal health and performance. Strategic supplementation of additives with anti-inflammatory capacity could represent a suitable approach to decrease systemic inflammation, restoring   to luminal contents. Bioactive extracts from Olea europaea have anti-inflammatory activity and have been shown to reduce systemic inflammation in other animal models. A generalized randomized block design was used to evaluate the impact of feeding an olive oil bioactive extract (OBE) to newly weaned heifers injected intravenously with sequentially increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 36 heifers, distributed across 3 experimental periods, were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments that consisted of intravenous injection of either saline (CTL-) or with 6 sequentially increasing doses of LPS (0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 µg/kg of BW) over a 10-d period (CTL+), and CTL+ plus dietary supplementation with a low (OBE-L; 0.04% of diet DM) or a high (OBE-H; 0.16% of diet DM) dose of OBE. Feeding OBE reduced some of the negative effects of prolonged immune activation with LPS, such as improved DMI and decreased intravaginal temperature in some, but not all of the days of LPS challenge (P < 0.05). In addition, feeding OBE reduced circulating concentration of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and haptoglobin (P < 0.05). Heifers supplemented with OBE had reduced cell surface expression of the cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) in monocyte cells (P < 0.01), a key receptor for LPS recognition, which was correlated with a faster recovery of immune cell counts in plasma. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with OBE was successful in mitigating the negative effects of sustained immune activation in newly weaned heifers.© The Author(s) 2019.

Inhaled noxious gases, including cigarette smoke, are the major risk factor for COPD. Inhaled smoke first encounters the epithelial lining of the lungs, causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether a mitochondrial defect may contribute to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, impaired epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid sensitivity as observed in COPD. We used wild-type alveolar epithelial cells A549 and mitochondrial DNA-depleted A549 cells (A549 Rho-0) and studied pro-inflammatory responses using (multiplex) ELISA as well as epithelial   and repair (real-time impedance measurements), in the presence and absence of the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide. We observed that A549 Rho-0 cells secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type A549 cells and display impaired repair upon wounding. Budesonide strongly suppressed the production of neutrophil attractant CXCL8, and promoted epithelial integrity in A549 wild-type cells, while A549 Rho-0 cells displayed reduced corticosteroid sensitivity compared to wild-type cells. The reduced corticosteroid responsiveness may be mediated by glycolytic reprogramming, specifically glycolysis-associated PI3K signaling, as PI3K inhibitor LY294002 restored the sensitivity of CXCL8 secretion to corticosteroids in A549 Rho-0 cells. In conclusion, mitochondrial defects may lead to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, reduced epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium, thus potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611796>Astrocytes: Role and Functions in Brain Pathologies.</a></h2><p>Astrocytes are a population of cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain. Postnatally, astrocyte progenitors migrate to reach their brain area and related properties. They have a regulatory role of brain functions that are implicated in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, controlling blood-brain  permeability and maintaining extracellular homeostasis. Mature astrocytes also express some genes enriched in cell progenitors, suggesting they can retain proliferative potential. Considering heterogeneity of cell population, it is not surprising that their disorders are related to a wide range of different neuro-pathologies. Brain diseases are characterized by the active inflammatory state of the astrocytes, which is usually described as up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In particular, the loss of astrocytes  as a result of cellular senescence could have implications for the neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, and for the aging brain. Astrocytes can also drive the induction and the progression of the inflammatory state due to their Ca signals and that it is strongly related to the disease severity/state. Moreover, they contribute to the altered neuronal activity in several frontal cortex pathologies such as ischemic stroke and epilepsy. There, we describe the current knowledge pertaining to astrocytes' role in brain pathologies and discuss the possibilities to target them as approach toward pharmacological therapies for neuro-pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Siracusa, Fusco and Cuzzocrea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589946>A crosslinked polymer skin  film for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: A pilot study in adults.</a></h2><p>Occlusive treatments are a mainstay in atopic dermatitis (AD) management, but may not be well tolerated or lack compliance. A comfortable, semi-occlusive, artificial skin  that is well tolerated, provides protection, and reduces water loss, is desired.To evaluate, in adults with AD, the potential tolerability and therapeutic benefits of a crosslinked polymer skin  film (XPL).A single center, open-label pilot study was conducted involving ten subjects with moderate to severe AD. Subjects applied XPL up to twice daily for 30 days on a selected treatment area. Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), clinical signs of eczema, and pruritus were assessed on days 1, 3, 5, 15, and 30. Film durability and subject satisfaction were also evaluated.IGA scores improved from moderate to severe at baseline to clear to almost clear in 8/9 subjects at day 30. Pruritus improved from trace-to-severe itching (baseline) to all subjects having trace-to-no itching at day 30. There was one adverse event of mild exudative dermatitis.The study was limited by small sample size, open-label design, and lack of control.XPL may be an effective adjuvant in AD treatment. A larger study with a control group is warranted.Copyright © 2019.

Col-ANM is fabricated by collagen gel coating process on an aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane, which is obtained by a simple electrospinning process adopting a parallel electrode collector. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Col-ANM exhibit remarkably enhanced endothelial   with high expression levels of intercellular junction proteins of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, a high TEER, and a cellular permeability compared with the artificial porous membranes in commercial cell culture well inserts. The enhanced endothelial   is conjectured to be attributed to the synergistic effects of topographical and biochemical cues provided by the aligned PCL nanofibers and collagen gel in the Col-ANM, respectively. Finally, the reactive oxygen species is applied to the HUVEC monolayer formed on the Col-ANM to destroy the tight junctions between HUVECs. The destruction of the tight junctions is demonstrated by the decreased TEER value over time. Results indicate the potential of Col-ANM in modeling endothelial  dysfunction-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641228>Polydatin protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial  disruption via SIRT3 activation.</a></h2><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated the role of polydatin (PD) in protecting against multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis. The aim of this study is to investigate whether PD protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial  disruption through SIRT3 activation and to disclose the underlying mechanisms. Wild-type mice were injected with LPS and Evans Blue assay was performed to evaluate vascular permeability. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with LPS. Endothelial permeability was evaluated by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran leakage. SIRT3 activity was determined by a Deacetylase Fluorometric kit, and protein expression level of SIRT3 was detected by western blotting. Mitochondrial  was evaluated by determination of ROS level, mitochondrial membrane potential and mPTP opening. In endotoxemic mice, PD pretreatment attenuated vascular leakage in multiple organs while SIRT3 inhibition with 3-TYP reversed the effects of PD. PD treatment in late sepsis also exhibited  protective effects. In HUVECs, PD alleviated LPS-induced F-actin rearrangement, cadherin-catenin complex dissociation and endothelial hyperpermeability, whereas 3-TYP or SIRT3 siRNA attenuated the protective effects of PD. PD enhanced SIRT3 deacetylase activity, and attenuated LPS-induced decrease in SIRT3 expression as well. Furthermore, gain-of- and loss-of- strategies also confirmed the role of SIRT3 in enhancing endothelial  integrity. It was further ascertained that PD enhanced SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of SOD2 and cyclophilin D (CypD), thus suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent endothelial  dysfunction. In addition, it was revealed that RAGE was involved in LPS-regulated SIRT3 signaling. Our results suggest that polydatin protects against LPS-induced endothelial  disruption dependent on SIRT3 and can be applied as a potential therapy for sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615863>Clinical Perspectives in Brain Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Brain metastases (BMs) are responsible for decline in neurological , reduction in overall quality of life, and mortality from recurrent or untreatable lesions. Advances in diagnostics and imaging have led to increased detection of central nervous system (CNS) metastases in patients with progressive cancers. Improved control of extracranial systemic disease, and the limited ability of current therapeutics to cross the blood-brain  (BBB) also contribute to the increase in incidence of brain metastases, as tumor cells seek refuge in the brain. Surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation (whole-brain radiation therapy and stereotactic radiation surgery [WBRT/SRS]) are a clinically established treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases. With the advent of genetic and molecular characterization of tumors and their immune microenvironment, clinical trials seek to include targeted drugs into the therapeutic regimen for eligible patients. Several challenges, like treatment of multiple CNS lesions, superior uptake of chemotherapy into the brain, and trials with multidisciplinary approaches, are now being clinically addressed.Copyright © 2019 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614770>The Effects and Mechanisms of Cyanidin-3-Glucoside and Its Phenolic Metabolites in Maintaining Intestinal Integrity.</a></h2><p>Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a well-known natural anthocyanin and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
