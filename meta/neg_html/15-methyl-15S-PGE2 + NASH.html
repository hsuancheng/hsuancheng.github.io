The proper and on time identification of at-risk HIV-positive individuals would be relevant in order to reduce the rate of progression from NAFLD into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The aim of this study was to explore visceral fat thickness (VFT) and anthropometric measurements associated with the development of NAFLD in patients mono-infected with HIV and on long-standing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).Eighty-eight ( = 88) HIV-positive male patients, average age 39.94 ± 9.91 years, and stable on cART, were included in this prospective study. VFT was measured using ultrasonography. Anthropometric measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/H), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist and hip circumference (WC, HC). Differences between variables were determined using the chi-square test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index were used to determine optimal cut-off values of VFT and hepatic steatosis. The area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals, sensitivity and specificity are reported for the complete sample. Significance was set at  < 0.05.Patients with steatosis had significantly higher values of BMI, HC, WC, W/H and WHtR. The VFT was higher in patients with steatosis ( < 0.001). Specifically, VFT values above 31.98 mm and age > 38.5 years correlated with steatosis in HIV-positive patients, namely sensitivity 89%, specificity 72%, AUC 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index = 0.61. The sensitivity of the age determinant above this cut-off point was 84%, specificity 73% and AUC 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92,  < 0.001), with the highest Youden index of 0.57.In the absence of more advanced radiographic and histological tools, simple anthropometric measurements and VFT could assist in the early identification of persons at risk of hepatic steatosis in low- and middle-income regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634532>Impact of Obeticholic Acid on the Lipoprotein Profile in Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA), increases total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). The present study evaluated the impact of OCA therapy on lipoprotein sub-particles.The study included 196 patients (99 OCA group and 97 placebo) who were enrolled in the FLINT trial and had samples available for lipid analysis and liver biopsies at enrollment and end-of-treatment (EOT) at 72 weeks. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were evaluated at baseline, 12 and 72 weeks after randomization, and 24 weeks following EOT.Baseline lipoprotein profiles were similar among OCA and placebo. OCA did not impact total VLDL particle concentrations, but OCA vs placebo treatment was associated with decreased large VLDL particle concentration at 12 weeks (baseline adjusted mean: 6.8 vs. 8.9 nmol/L; P=0.002), mirrored by an increase in less-atherogenic small VLDL particle concentration (33.9 vs. 28.0 nmol/L; P=0.02). After 12 weeks, total LDL particle concentration was higher among OCA vs. placebo (1667 vs. 1329 nmol/L; P<0.0001), characterized by corresponding increases in both less-atherogenic, large-buoyant LDL (475 vs. 308 nmol/L; P=<0.001) and more-atherogenic small-dense LDL particles (1015 vs. 872 nmol/L; P=0.002). The changes in LDL particle concentrations were similar between treatment groups (OCA and placebo) 24 weeks following EOT due to improvement in OCA cohort. Compared to placebo, a reduction in total HDL-particle concentration, particularly large and medium HDL-particles, was noted in the OCA treated patients but this resolved after drug discontinuation.OCA therapy is associated with increases at 12 weeks in small VLDL particles and large and small LDL particles and reduction in HDL particles which revert to baseline 24 weeks after drug discontinuation. Lay Summary: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease that is associated with increased risk of developing cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease. Recently, obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, improved liver disease but led to an increase in cholesterol, however, the impact of OCA on cholesterol is not well understood. In the present study, we present data showing that OCA therapy is associated with an increase in lipoprotein levels which improve after drug discontinuation.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

So far, evidence is most comprehensive in cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases; however, published studies are prone to many biases, enabling us to reach a definite conclusion. Available data in chronic liver disease is scarce and ambiguous. Obesity is traditionally associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatosis in viral hepatitis and as such one would not expect the obesity paradox to be a real possibility in liver disease. Yet, there seem to be new data indicating the opposite - the obesity paradox exists in severe and end-stage liver cirrhosis, which could be attributed to a better lean mass in patients with higher body mass index, meaning that sarcopenia, as one of the most important prognostic factors of survival, is less likely to be present. Nonetheless, the problem of various methodological problems addressing the association between body weight and mortality, which is present both in liver disease and other chronic diseases, are preventing us from attaining an unanimous conclusion. Still, we should be aware that the obesity paradox might be true, especially in severe and end-stage illness. This suggests focusing our efforts toward preserving or building up fat-free mass and decreasing inflammatory activity responsible for catabolism and sarcopenia, and implying that the underlaying cause should be treated.© 2019 Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622581>Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The most common causes of chronic liver disease in the developed world -nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () - are the hepatic manifestations of an insulin-resistant state that is linked to visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation. NAFLD and  lead to an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue and the release of proinflammatory adipocytokines that cause microcirculatory dysfunction and fibrosis of the adjoining myocardium, resulting in atrial fibrillation as well as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Inflammatory changes in the left atrium lead to electroanatomical remodeling; thus, NAFLD and  markedly increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Simultaneously, patients with NAFLD or  commonly show diastolic dysfunction or latent HFpEF. Interventions include (1) weight loss by caloric restriction, bariatric surgery or intensive exercise; and (2) drugs that ameliorate fat-mediated inflammation in both the liver and heart (e.g., statins, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and pioglitazone). Patients with NAFLD or  commonly have an inflammation-related atrial and ventricular myopathy, which may contribute to symptoms and long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019.

The etiology of this disease is known in 90% of the patients, and it is viral in most of the cases. According to recent predictions, nearly half of the world population will be suffering from obesity by 2030. Consequently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may play a growing role in HCC epidemiology. In this review we sought to explore the relationship between liver steatosis and HCC.  A narrative review was conducted using the PubMed MeSH search. The eligible papers were identified using a standard PubMed search with relevant key terms and various synonyms.  According to the results, patients with NAFLD-HCC tended to be older than those with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC, and they were more often obese and had concomitant diseases, such as diabetes. On the other hand, the synthetic liver function was better preserved in NAFLD-HCC patients, who also obtained lower scores on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP). However, it has to be noted that HCC in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () may develop without underlying cirrhosis. Although -HCC is usually smaller and well-differentiated compared to HCV-HCC, the prognosis is similar in both groups. Efficient HCC screening in  cirrhosis poses a challenge because it is difficult to perform ultrasound examination in obese patients and alfa-fetoprotein level is no longer considered reliable.  The constantly increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general population can contribute to a growing role of NAFLD/ in HCC epidemiology. Moreover, some particular challenges specific for patients with liver steatosis may impede proper HCC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610081>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis after Liver Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Currently, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is the second leading indication for liver transplant (LT), behind alcohol-related liver disease. After transplant, both recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are common, however, recurrence rates of  and advanced fibrosis are low. Identification of high-risk groups and optimizing treatment of metabolic co-morbidities both pre- and post-LT is paramount to maintaining a healthy allograft, especially with the additional consequences of long-term immunosuppression. In addition,  LT recipients are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and malignancy, and warrant a tailored approach to management. The optimal approach to  LT recipients including metabolic co-morbidities management, tailored immunosuppression, the role of bariatric surgery, and nutritional and pharmacotherapy of  are discussed in this review. Overall, aggressive management of metabolic syndrome post LT via medical and surgical modalities, and a minimalist approach to immunosuppression is advised.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538945>A Web-Based Study of HIV Prevention in the Era of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Among Vulnerable HIV-Negative Gay and Bisexual Men, Transmen, and Transwomen Who Have Sex With Men: Protocol for an Observational Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men continue to bear a large burden of the HIV epidemic in the United States and are among the only populations with increasing incidence in recent years.The Together 5000 (T5K) Study aimed to enroll a US-based, racially diverse sample of HIV-negative men, transmen, and transwomen who are not on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) into an observational cohort to inform the design, implementation, scale-up, and evaluation of HIV prevention programs.We used internet-based strategies to enroll a large, racially diverse national sample of HIV-negative men, transmen, and transwomen aged 16 to 49 years at high risk of HIV acquisition via sexual networking apps. Study participants are contacted every 6 months (in between annual surveys) for a brief survey on HIV testing, HIV diagnosis, and PrEP use (ie, attempts to access, PrEP initiation, and PrEP discontinuation). Participants complete annual self-administered at-home HIV testing and Web-based surveys. Using baseline serologic data and self-reported HIV testing history, we reconstructed a cohort of persons who were HIV negative at 12 months before baseline to estimate HIV incidence leading up to cohort enrollment.The study sample included 8777 participants from all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, and Guam; 50.91% (4468/8777) were persons of color and 25.30% (2221/8777) were young individuals aged 16 to 24 years. Per eligibility criteria, all T5K participants reported having sex with >2 male partners in the 90 days before enrollment, self-reported not having been diagnosed with HIV, and were not actively taking PrEP. In addition, 79.39% (6968/8777) reported >2 insertive condomless anal sex (CAS) acts, 61.02% (5356/8777) reported >1 receptive CAS acts in the past 90 days. Furthermore, most (7525/8777, 85.74%) reported never having taken PrEP. In total, 70.25% (6166/8777) were sent a self-administered at-home HIV test kit and 82.29% (5074/6166) of those sent a kit returned a sample for testing. The HIV incidence rate during the 12-month period leading up to enrollment was estimated to be 2.41 (95% CI 2.02-2.90) per 100 person-years.A large, national, and racially diverse fully Web-based cohort of HIV-negative men, transmen, and transwomen at high risk for HIV seroconversion has successfully been recruited into longitudinal follow-up. This cohort is at high risk for HIV acquisition and can provide important insights related to the real-world uptake, impact, and equity of HIV prevention interventions in the United States. Participants can be invited to participate in trials aimed at testing strategies to improve the uptake of and engagement in these interventions.RR1-10.2196/13715.©Denis , Matthew Stief, Caitlin MacCrate, Chloe Mirzayi, Viraj V Patel, Donald Hoover, David W Pantalone, Sarit Golub, Gregorio Millett, Alexa B D’Angelo, Drew Anne Westmoreland, Christian Grov.

This study aimed to define altered MS-metabolomic responses during high-fat (HF)-induced  that are restored by GTE utilizing livers from an earlier study in which GTE decreased endotoxin-TLR4-NFκB liver injury.Mice are fed a low-fat (LF) or HF diet for 12 weeks and then randomized to LF or HF diets containing 0% or 2% GTE for an additional 8 weeks. Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia insulin resistance, and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, B-vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκB inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκB-mediated liver injury in .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, in the progression from  to cirrhosis, hepatic fat is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic fat loss during  progression.Liver biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied 5 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty acid metabolism-related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty acid transport protein 5 (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty acid intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism-related proteins were comparable between  with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic fat loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic fat loss during  progression to cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556124>Clinical utility of an increase in magnetic resonance elastography in predicting fibrosis progression in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Cross-sectional studies have shown that magnetic-resonance-elastography (MRE) is accurate in non-invasive detection of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. However, there are limited data on the longitudinal association between an increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD. Therefore, utilizing a well-characterized prospective cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, we aimed to examine the longitudinal association between a 15% increase in liver-stiffness on MRE and fibrosis progression in NAFLD.This prospective cohort study including 102 patients (62.7% women) with biopsy-proven NAFLD who underwent contemporaneous MRE and liver biopsy at baseline followed by a repeat paired liver biopsy and MRE assessment. Primary outcome was odds of fibrosis progression by ≥ 1 stage as assessed by  CRN-Histologic-Scoring-System.The mean (±SD) of age and BMI were 52 (±14) years and 32.6 (±5.3) kg/m , respectively. The median time interval between the two paired assessment was 1.4 years (interquartile range: 2.15 years). The number of patients with fibrosis stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 27, 36, 12, 17, and 10, respectively. In unadjusted analysis, a 15% increase in MRE was associated with increased odds of histologic fibrosis progression (OR=3.56, 95% CI:1.17 - 10.76, p=0.0248). These findings remained clinically and statistically significant even after multivariable-adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted OR=3.36, 95% CI:1.10 - 10.31, p=0.0339). A 15% increase in MRE was the strongest predictor of progression to advanced fibrosis (OR=4.90, 95%CI:1.35-17.84, p=0.0159).A 15% increase in liver stiffness on MRE may be associated with histologic fibrosis progression and progression from early fibrosis to advanced fibrosis.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633048>Limited applicability of cathepsin D for the diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>To date, there are limited data on the applicability of cathepsin D for the diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().This study included patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosed between November 2012 and October 2015.

The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between  and non- patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and  was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58.

We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and genetic characteristics of non-obese NAFLD patients.The clinical, histological and genetic data of 84 NAFLD patients with biopsy for abnormal liver function test were reviewed. Both NAS-CRN and SAF scoring systems were applied for histopathological evaluation. PNPLA3 and TMS6F2 genotyping were also performed.All of the 84 patients were histologically diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), with 36 of them (42.9%) being non-obese (BMI < 25 kg/m). Compared with the obese group, non-obese group were predominantly females (88.9% vs 52.1%, p < 0.001), tended to have higher prevalence of diabetes (p = 0.068). More importantly non-obese patients had a significant higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) (58.3% vs 29.2%, p = 0.013), and a trend of higher degree of ballooning (p = 0.061). In addition, values of liver stiffness measurement were also significantly higher in non-obese group (12.1 kPa vs 8.1 kPa, p = 0.032). There was also a trend of higher prevalence of TM6SF2 T allele in non-obese group (p = 0.085), while the prevalence of PNPLA3 risk allele did not differ between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher fasting glucose (p = 0.038) and lower serum platelets (p = 0.040) were two independent predictors for advanced fibrosis in non-obese patients.Non-obese  patients have a female predominance and more advanced fibrosis.

It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through liver-specific morbidity and mortality, but perhaps more importantly, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is tightly associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and both of these conditions drive progressive disease towards the more advanced stages.

Some of the forces driving this deinstitutionalization have been scientific and patient-centered, such as better differentiation between acute and subacute risk, innovations in outpatient and crisis care (assertive community treatment programs, dialectical behavioral therapy, treatment-oriented psychiatric emergency services), gradually improving psychopharmacology, and an increased appreciation of the negative effect of coercive hospitalization, except when risk is very high. On the other hand, some of the forces have been less focused on patient needs: budget-driven cuts in public hospital beds divorced from population-based need; managed care's profit-driven impact on private psychiatric hospitals and outpatient services; and purported patient-centered approaches promoting non-hospital care that may under-recognize that some extremely ill patients need years of painstaking effort to make a community transition.The result has been a reconfiguration of the country's mental health system that, at times, leaves large numbers of people without adequate mental health and substance abuse services. Often their only option is to seek care in medical emergency departments (ED) that have not been designed for the needs of mentally ill patients. Increasingly, many of those individuals end up waiting in EDs for appropriate care and disposition for hours or days. This overflow phenomenon has become so prevalent that it has been given a name: "boarding." This practice is almost certainly detrimental to patients and staff, and it has spawned efforts on multiple fronts to understand and resolve it. When considering solutions, both ED-focused and systemwide considerations must be explored.

In this work, we provide compelling evidence that the pH dependent shift in the Hupd peak on Pt surfaces is driven by the structure of interfacial water rather than the specific adsorption of cations on the electrode surface. Combined cyclic voltammetric and surface enhanced spectroscopic investigations using an organic cation and crown-ether chelated alkali metal cations show that specific adsorption of metal and organic cations on the Pt surface at the conditions relevant to the HOR/HER is unlikely. The vibrational band corresponding to strongly bound water is monitored when the electrode potential is varied in the Hupd range in both acid and base. By varying the electrode potential on the absolute and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale simultaneously and only on the RHE scale while maintaining the absolute potential, we deconvolute the impact of two mechanisms through which the interfacial water structure is impacted: 1) hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed Hupd, and 2) electronic interaction with the electrode surface at different absolute potentials. While the hydrogen bonding between Hupd and interfacial water is identified as the primary mode of interaction, the direct water-electrode interaction, which depends on the absolute electrode potential, likely hold the key to understanding the pH induced Hupd peak shift on the Pt surface. Thus, engineering the interfacial water structure could be a fruitful direction in the design of HOR/HER catalysts operating in alkaline media.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Evidence for the prevalence, risk factors, and diagnostic methodologies of NAFLD in patients with HIV mono-infection is summarized here.Although limited, published studies suggest that the prevalence of NAFLD is higher (30-50%) and progresses at an increased rate in patients with HIV compared to the general population. Identifying those at risk for significant liver fibrosis is critical, preferably with non-invasive screening tests. While there is a paucity of evidence in this population, transient elastography (TE) appears to provide a sensitive, non-invasive screening modality. Identifying NAFLD early will allow for dietary and lifestyle interventions, as well as future drug therapies to decrease the risk of progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in the high-risk HIV population. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and consider using TE for NAFLD diagnosis and surveillance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634732>Relevance of the interpersonal theory of suicide in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient population.</a></h2><p>The interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) has been widely studied in adults, but not adolescent populations at acute risk for suicide. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate IPTS clinical utility in a high-risk sample of suicidal adolescent inpatients. We assessed whether constructs of the IPTS (1) are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) on admission to a psychiatric hospitalization, and (2) prospectively predict suicide attempt (SA) or psychiatric rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. On admission, adolescent patients self-reported recent STBs, perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness (TB), and depression. Parents reported their child's rehospitalization and suicide attempts 90 days after discharge. Generalized linear regression modelling was used to determine how key constructs of the IPTS are associated with STBs prior to admission and whether they prospectively predict SA or rehospitalization 90 days after discharge. IPTS constructs did not predict rehospitalization or SA within 90 days of discharge. Although PB and TB interacted to associate with prehospitalization SI frequency, and PB, TB and NSSI interacted to associate with prehospitalization SA, the nature of these interactions were not as the IPTS predicts. IPTS constructs are relevant proximal predictors of prehospitalization STB in adolescents, but may operate differently than in adults.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has been observed previously that the enamel on the labial surface of the teeth used for extraction is thicker relative to that on the lingual surface in taxa that extract gums, while enamel is more evenly distributed in the anterior teeth of taxa that do not regularly engage in extractive behaviors. This study presents a quantitative methodology for measuring the distribution of labial versus lingual enamel thickness among primate and marsupial taxa in the context of gummivory. Computed microtomography scans of 15 specimens representing 14 taxa were analyzed. Ten measurements were taken at 20% intervals starting from the base of the crown of the extractive tooth to the tip of the cutting edge across the lingual and labial enamel. A method for including worn or broken teeth is also presented. Mann-Whitney U tests, canonical variates analysis, and between-group principal components analysis were used to examine variation in enamel thickness across taxa. Our results suggest that the differential distribution of enamel thickness in the anterior dentition can serve as a signal for gouging behavior; this methodology distinguishes between gougers, scrapers, and nonextractive gummivores. Gouging taxa are characterized by significantly thicker labial enamel relative to the lingual enamel, particularly towards the crown tip. Examination of enamel thickness patterning in these taxa permits a better understanding of the adaptations for the extraction of gums in extant taxa and offers the potential to test hypotheses concerning the dietary adaptations of fossil taxa.© 2019 S.

The model was applied to the Sakaecho upland bare soil field (Tokyo, Japan) to predict runoff water, sediment concentration in runoff water, pesticide concentrations in runoff water, and runoff sediment (clothianidin and imidacloprid) under artificial rainfall conditions. The results showed that the simulated time to first runoff agreed very well with the observed data. The simulated cumulative runoff, sediment yield, and imidacloprid concentration in sediment agreed well with the observed data (-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)>0.75). The simulated runoff rate agreed reasonably well with the observed data (NSE >0.5). The predicted clothianidin concentrations in sediment and in runoff water had acceptable agreement with the observed data (NSE >0).

Perinatal anxiety (PNA) is at least as common as depression during the perinatal phase and can adversely impact on both mother and child. Despite this, research into anxiety has received less attention than depression. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on perinatal mental health has identified PNA as a research priority.To explore the perspectives and experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the identification and management of PNA.This was a qualitative study in primary and secondary care set in the West Midlands from February 2017 to December 2017.Semi-structured interviews ( = 23) with a range of HCPs. Iterative approach to data generation and analysis, using principles of constant comparison. Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) group was involved throughout the study.Twenty-three HCPs interviewed: 10 GPs, seven midwives, five health visitors, and one obstetrician. Four themes were uncovered: PNA as an 'unfamiliar concept'; reliance on clinical intuition and not clinical tools; fragmentation of care; and opportunities to improve care.Awareness and understanding of PNA among HCPs is variable, with debate over what is 'normal' anxiety in pregnancy. HCPs suggested that PNA can be challenging to identify, with mixed views on the use and value of case-finding tools. Opportunistic identification was noted to be significant to aid diagnosis. Care for women diagnosed with PNA was reported to be fragmented and interprofessional communication poor.

Dysregulated metabolism of sphingomyelin in the liver plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Ceramides are central molecules of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism and play an important role in insulin resistance, apoptosis, and inflammation. In addition, apoptosis is a main contributor to the development of NAFLD. This study detected whether the inhibition of ceramide synthesis ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in rats with NAFLD. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the NAFLD model. Here, we showed that hepatic ceramide, steatosis, and fibrosis increased in liver tissue from rats with NAFLD. Chronic treatment with myriocin inhibited ceramide and lipid accumulation and improved fibrosis in liver tissue samples of high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. In addition, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis were markedly ameliorated in HFD-fed rats treated with myriocin. Furthermore, myriocin treatment regulated the expression of pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis proteins by inactivating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in the liver of HFD-fed rats. Collectively, ceramide plays an important role in the pathogenesis of  and may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Jiang, Li, Liu, Wang and Lei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587343>Letter to the Editor: Impact of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis on liver-related outcomes in chronic hepatitis B.</a></h2><p>We read with great interest the article by Choi et al. reporting the impacts of concomitant non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () on the clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high-fat diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced , and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in  patients as compared to the controls and non- patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of .

By introducing a concentrated P source, fertilizers increase short-term P export potential soon after their application and longer-term export potential by increasing soil fertility (legacy P). The 4R concept was developed to help mitigate P exports from the fertilizers that sustain agricultural productivity. This review investigates the factors affecting P exports soon after the application of mineral fertilizers to pasture-based grazing systems and studies quantifying its potential impact in different systems, with an emphasis on Australasia. Initially, P fertilizers and reactions that might affect their short-term P export potential are reviewed, along with P transport pathways, the forms of P exported from grazing systems, factors affecting P mobilization into water, and studies demonstrating the possible short-term effects of fertilizer application on P exports. Using that foundation, we review studies quantifying the short-term impact of fertilizer application in different regions; they show that under poor management, recently applied fertilizer can contribute a considerable proportion (30-80%) of total farm P exports in drainage, but when fertilizer is well-managed, that figure is expected to be <10%. We then use three model systems of varying hydrology that are common to Australasia to demonstrate the principles for selecting fertilizers that are likely to minimize P exports soon after their application.© 2019 The Author(s).

Differences in developmental patterns between humans and mice include spatiotemporal expansion of both ventricular and rhombic lip primary progenitor zones to include subventricular zones containing basal progenitors. The human rhombic lip persists longer through cerebellar development than in the mouse and undergoes morphological changes to form a progenitor pool in the posterior lobule, which is not seen in other organisms, not even in the nonhuman primate the macaque. Disruptions in human rhombic lip development are associated with posterior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and Dandy-Walker malformation.

This may reflect an awareness of limited lifetime unique to humans, leading to a greater interest in maintaining social relationships at the expense of the non-social world in the face of limited cognitive and physical resources. Alternately, fundamental biological processes common to other primate species may direct preferential interest in social stimuli with increasing age. Inspired by a recent study that described a sustained interest in social stimuli but diminished interest in non-social stimuli in aged Barbary macaques, we carried out a conceptual replication to test whether old rhesus monkeys lost interest in non-social stimuli.

This is further encumbered  by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury.

Hepatic accumulation of free cholesterol induces activation of nonparenchymal cells, including Kupffer cells, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, which leads to persistent inflammation and fibrosis. The nuclear receptors liver X receptor α (LXRα) and LXRβ act as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism through the induction of hepatocyte cholesterol catabolism, excretion, and the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Additionally, LXRs exert an anti-inflammatory effect in immune cell types, such as macrophages. LXR activation suppresses acute hepatic inflammation that is mediated by Kupffer cells/macrophages. Acute liver injury, diet-induced steatohepatitis, and fibrosis are exacerbated by significant hepatic cholesterol accumulation and inflammation in LXR-deficient mice. Therefore, LXRs regulate hepatic lipid metabolism and immunity and they are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of hepatic inflammation that is associated with cholesterol accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564568>Dietary fat, cholesterol, and cholic acid affect the histopathologic severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Understanding of the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ()-associated fibrosis has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive and physiological small animal model of  with fibrosis.

Despite rare detection of EV RNA, pan-viral serology frequently identified high levels of CSF EV-specific antibodies in AFM compared with controls, providing further evidence for a causal role of non-polio EVs in AFM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618976>The Potential of the FSP1cre- Mouse Model for Studying Juvenile NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () characterized by liver inflammation, possibly leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe . Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, and fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their liver in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634046>Oral Administration of  Alleviates Insulin Resistance and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is recognized as a proinflammatory condition leading to hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

The primary objective was to evaluate whether IXE was superior to ADA at week 24 for simultaneous achievement of a ≥50% improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50) and a 100% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI100). Major secondary objectives, also at week 24, were to evaluate whether IXE was: (1) non-inferior to ADA for achievement of ACR50 and (2) superior to ADA for PASI100 response. Additional PsA, skin, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcome measures were assessed at week 24.The primary efficacy endpoint was met (IXE: 36%, ADA: 28%; p=0.036). IXE was non-inferior for ACR50 response (IXE: 51%, ADA: 47%; treatment difference: 3.9%) and superior for PASI100 response (IXE: 60%, ADA: 47%; p=0.001). IXE had greater response versus ADA in additional PsA, skin, nail, treat-to-target and quality-of-life outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported in 8.5% (ADA) and 3.5% (IXE) of patients.IXE was superior to ADA in achievement of simultaneous improvement of joint and skin disease (ACR50 and PASI100) in patients with PsA and inadequate response to csDMARDs.

Moreover, it is often assumed that cognitive capabilities imply "superior" computational mechanisms compared to those involved in emotion or motivation. In contrast to these ideas, we review data on the neural architecture across vertebrates that support the concept that association and integration are basic features of the vertebrate brain, which are needed to successfully adapt to a changing world. This property is not restricted to a few isolated brain centers, but rather resides in neuronal networks working collectively in a context-dependent manner. In different vertebrates, we identify shared large-scale connectional systems involving the midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and amygdala. The high degree of crosstalk and association between these systems at different levels supports the notion that cognition, emotion, and motivation cannot be separated - all of them involve a high degree of signal integration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study proposes a framework that incorporates two game theory models designed for the allocation of police officers to patrol shifts. In the first step, the interactions of three factors between the criminal and the operation captain are modeled as a zero-sum, noncooperative game, after which a mixed strategy  equilibrium method is used to derive the risk value for each district to be patrolled. In the second step, the risk values are used to compute the Shapley value for all 10 districts, for three different threat levels. A fair allocation of police personnel based on the Shapley value is made with a minimum set of personnel deployment costs. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified using openly available data from the San Francisco City Police detailing incidents from the year 2016. The experimental results show that police planners can use this framework to quantitatively evaluate the criminal threat in each district when deciding upon the deployment of patrol officers for three shifts per day.© 2019 Society for Risk Analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619789>Habenular TCF7L2 links nicotine addiction to diabetes.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is far more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers, but the underlying mechanisms of vulnerability are unknown. Here we show that the diabetes-associated gene Tcf7l2 is densely expressed in the medial habenula (mHb) region of the rodent brain, where it regulates the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inhibition of TCF7L2 signalling in the mHb increases nicotine intake in mice and rats. Nicotine increases levels of blood glucose by TCF7L2-dependent stimulation of the mHb. Virus-tracing experiments identify a polysynaptic connection from the mHb to the pancreas, and wild-type rats with a history of nicotine consumption show increased circulating levels of glucagon and insulin, and diabetes-like dysregulation of blood glucose homeostasis. By contrast, mutant Tcf7l2 rats are resistant to these actions of nicotine. Our findings suggest that TCF7L2 regulates the stimulatory actions of nicotine on a habenula-pancreas axis that links the addictive properties of nicotine to its diabetes-promoting actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620652>Effect of alcohol consumption on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to be 26.3% among the US population. A subset of this population exhibits an aggressive histological phenotype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with ≥ stage 2 fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. The definition of NAFLD excludes excessive alcohol intake, which is well known to cause alcoholic liver disease and will not be discussed here. Most NAFLD clinical trials use ~14 drinks per week as the cutoff for excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption below this threshold, which we define as moderate alcohol consumption, is common in the US. According to the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 56% of the US adult population consume alcohol, but only 8.2% report drinking heavily and 18.3% report binge drinking. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidance of 2018 states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation with regard to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with NAFLD, citing a lack of longitudinal studies that examine the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on disease progression and its extrahepatic harms versus benefits, specifically in individuals with established NAFLD. NAFLD prevalence studies have generally noted a negative correlation between modest alcohol consumption and NAFLD. However, prevalence studies have limited application to patients with established NAFLD who present to the clinic. There can also be many confounding factors, because modest alcohol consumption is also negatively associated with some NAFLD risk factors, and those risk factors may not be adequately adjusted for in analyses. The prevalence of  with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) is more important because this is the group that is believed to have progressive disease. Thus, cohort studies of disease progression are more important from the patient's standpoint. Because these patients have already developed NAFLD or , their interest lies in their odds of disease progression if they have moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence. It is also noteworthy that cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death among patients with NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction in overall mortality, but mostly in cardiovascular mortality. However, this protective effect has not been demonstrated specifically in patients with NAFLD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

Changes in the gut microbiota have been investigated and are believed to contribute to at least some cases of the disease, though a causal relationship remains unclear. Here, we show that high-alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (HiAlc Kpn) is associated with up to 60% of individuals with NAFLD in a Chinese cohort. Transfer of clinical isolates of HiAlc Kpn by oral gavage into mice induced NAFLD. Likewise, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) into mice using a HiAlc-Kpn-strain-containing microbiota isolated from an individual with  induced NAFLD. However, selective elimination of the HiAlc Kpn strain before FMT prevented NAFLD in the recipient mice.

However, the role of melanocytes in the process is understudied. Our data show that melanocytes are the only epidermal cell type to express the senescence marker p16 during human skin ageing. Aged melanocytes also display additional markers of senescence such as reduced HMGB1 and dysfunctional telomeres, without detectable telomere shortening. Additionally, senescent melanocyte SASP induces telomere dysfunction in paracrine manner and limits proliferation of surrounding cells via activation of CXCR3-dependent mitochondrial ROS. Finally, senescent melanocytes impair basal keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to epidermal atrophy in vitro using 3D human epidermal equivalents. Crucially, clearance of senescent melanocytes using the senolytic drug ABT737 or treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ suppressed this effect. In conclusion, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent melanocytes affect keratinocyte function and act as drivers of human skin ageing.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623428>Implementation of "Treat-all" at adult HIV care and treatment sites in the Global IeDEA Consortium: results from the Site Assessment Survey.</a></h2><p>Since 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART), irrespective of CD4+ count or clinical stage. National adoption of universal treatment has accelerated since WHO's 2015 "Treat All" recommendation; however, little is known about the translation of this guidance into practice. This study aimed to assess the status of Treat All implementation across regions, countries, and levels of the health care delivery system.Between June and December 2017, 201/221 (91%) adult HIV treatment sites that participate in the global IeDEA research consortium completed a survey on capacity and practices related to HIV care. Located in 41 countries across seven geographic regions, sites provided information on the status and timing of site-level introduction of Treat All, as well as site-level practices related to ART initiation.Almost all sites (93%) reported that they had begun implementing Treat All, and there were no statistically significant differences in site-level Treat All introduction by health facility type, urban/rural location, sector (public/private) or country income level. The median time between national policy adoption and site-level introduction was one month. In countries where Treat All was not yet adopted in national guidelines, 69% of sites reported initiating all patients on ART, regardless of clinical criteria, and these sites had been implementing Treat All for a median period of seven months at the time of the survey. The majority of sites (77%) reported typically initiating patients on ART within 14 days of confirming diagnosis, with 60% to 62% of sites implementing Treat All in East, Southern and West Africa reporting same-day ART initiation for most patients.By mid- to late-2017, the Treat All strategy was the standard of care at almost all IeDEA sites, including rural, primary-level health facilities in low-resource settings. While further assessments of site-level capacity to provide high-quality HIV care under Treat All and to support sustained viral suppression after ART initiation are needed, the widespread introduction of Treat All at the service delivery level is a critical step towards global targets for ending the HIV epidemic as a public health threat.© 2019 The Authors.

In rats, higher incidences of stereotypic behaviors were observed in 10 mg/kg females and 40 mg/kg males, and slower responses for reflex and sensory tests were observed only in males at 10 and 40 mg/kg during neurobehavioral testing. Sporadic minimal incidences of decreased activity (males) and seizures (both sexes) were observed in rats during daily clinical observations, without any clear dose-relationship. Male dogs at 75 mg/kg during treatment period, but not recovery period, had an increased incidence of gut associated lymphoid tissue hyperplasia and inflammation in the intestine.

Although majority of patients with NAFLD are benign and non-progressive, having only steatosis, some fraction of patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually increased liver-related mortality. Among histological features of NAFLD, it has been reported that liver fibrosis is the most important predictor of long-term outcomes. Liver fibrosis is a dynamic process characterized by the over-accumulation of extracellular matrix due to chronic liver injury resulting from any etiology including not only , but also viral infection and alcoholic liver disease. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has been well established as a central driver of fibrosis in experimental animal models and human liver injury. It is a transdifferentiation of quiescent, vitamin-A‑storing cells into proliferative and fibrogenic myofibroblasts. However, the discovery of novel pathways and mediators reveals the complexity of HSC activation. These emerging pathways include hedgehog, autophagy, free cholesterol, YAP1, hepcidin, and nuclear/G-protein coupled receptor-mediated signals. In addition, pathways of HSC clearance have been uncovered such as apoptosis, senescence, and reversion to an inactivated state. Thus, clarifying the underlying mechanisms of HSC activation could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for , and several drug candidates are currently being developed in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628409>Accuracy of proton magnetic resonance for diagnosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Liver biopsy is the reference standard test to differentiate between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and simple steatosis (SS) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but noninvasive diagnostics are warranted.

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino-acid defined (CDAA) diets with increasing fat content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of fat content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary fat in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the lipid metabolism genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60% fat (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High fat supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

It was first identified for its growth factor-like properties, being implicated in tissue remodeling, development, inflammation, and protein homeostasis. However, these findings are controversial, and the role of PGRN in liver disease remains unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of PGRN in two different models of chronic liver disease, methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCD)-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. To induce long-term expression of PGRN, PGRN-expressing adenovirus was delivered via injection into the tibialis anterior. In the CCl4-induced fibrosis model, PGRN showed protective effects against hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis via inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation. PGRN also decreased lipid accumulation and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and fibrosis in the MCD-induced  model. In vitro treatment of primary macrophages and Raw 264.7 cells with conditioned media from hepatocytes pre-treated with PGRN prior to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or palmitate decreased their expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, PGRN suppressed inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in a cell culture model of hepatocyte injury and primary stellate cell activation. These observations increase our understanding of the role of PGRN in liver injury and suggest PGRN delivery as a potential therapeutic strategy in chronic inflammatory liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586364>Using Wearable Physiological Monitors With Suicidal Adolescent Inpatients: Feasibility and Acceptability Study.</a></h2><p>Wearable physiological monitoring devices enable the continuous measurement of human behavior and psychophysiology in the real world. Although such monitors are promising, their availability does not guarantee that participants will continuously wear and interact with them, especially during times of psychological distress.This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable behavioral and physiological monitor, the Empatica E4, to continuously assess a group of suicidal adolescent inpatients.Participants (n=50 adolescent inpatients) were asked to wear an Empatica E4 on their wrist for the duration of their inpatient stay. In addition to assessing behavioral metadata (eg, hours worn per day), we also used qualitative interviews and self-report measures to assess participants' experience of wearing the monitor.Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of this approach. Participants wore the monitor for an average of 18 hours a day and reported that despite sometimes finding the monitor uncomfortable, they did not mind wearing it. Many of the participants noted that the part of the study they enjoyed most was contributing to scientific understanding, especially if it could help people similar to them in the future.These findings provide promising support for using wearable monitors in clinical samples in future studies, especially if participants are invested in being part of a research study.©Evan Kleiman, Alexander J Millner, Victoria W Joyce, Carol C , Ralph J Buonopane, Matthew K Nock.

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders-autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder-to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer-promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645988>Relationship between  expressing Cnm in the oral cavity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a severe state of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is pathologically characterised by steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation.

We report one center's experience of the incidence, and etiological factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation over 5 years and 265 grafts.265 Acuseal grafts were placed in the last 5 years. All patients had prospective data entered into an electronic searchable patient record. Surveillance was performed with 3 monthly imaging (DSA or ultrasound), clinical examination and hemodynamic performance. Data examined included the incidence, causative factors and outcomes for pseudoaneurysm.11 grafts (4.15%) developed a pseudoaneurysm, with 2 patients developing significant hemorrhage. The median time to development of a pseudoaneurysm was 25 months (IQR 20-28 months). Several common etiological factors were identified. All but one patient had over-use of needling sites (n=10; 90.9%). Other factors associated with pseudoaneurysm formation were inadequate surveillance (n=9; 81.8%); venous outflow stenosis (n=9; 81.8%) and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy (n=7; 63.6%). Management included observation and needle rotation (n=5, 45.5%); stent-grafting (n=3; 27.3%), or excision (n=1; 9.1%) of the pseudoaneurysm. Surgical or endovascular augmentation of the venous outflow was required in 9 patients (81.8%). Graft ligation and explantation was required in 5 patients (45.5%) with graft preservation achieved in 6/11 patients (54.5%).Pseudoaneurysm formation occurs less frequently in Acuseal grafts compared with historical data for standard PTFE grafts. Pseudoaneurysm formation did not occur in any graft within the first 13 months following implantation; suggesting early-cannulation prior to incorporation is not in itself a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm development. Poor needling, venous stenosis, inadequate surveillance and anticoagulation/dual antiplatelet therapy are remediable factors, and graft preservation is possible. Acuseal is a robust graft with lower rates of pseudoaneurysm formation on long-term follow up than standard PTFE grafts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The control group consisted of age and sex-matched individuals with normal physical examinations, laboratory findings, and liver ultrasounds. Serum zinc level was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Liver histopathological findings were determined based on non-alcoholic fatty liver activity score.A cohort of eighty biopsy-proven  patients and eighty controls were enrolled in the study. The mean serum zinc level was significantly lower in the  group compared with the controls. The mean serum zinc concen- tration was significantly lower in moderate and severe lobular inflammation groups than the mild group. After multiple adjustments for potential contributing variables, serum zinc level was associated with the severity of lobular inflam- mation. Nonetheless, it was not associated with liver steatosis and fibrosis. A serum zinc value of 89 (µg/dl) yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 86%, respectively, characterizing patients with lobular inflammation of less than two inflammatory foci per high-power field (HPF) from more advanced groups. Furthermore, a value of 79.55 (µg/dl) yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively, distinguishing those with a lobular inflammation grade of less than four foci per HPF from more advanced cases.Serum zinc level might be associated with the severity of lobular inflammation in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536511>Silymarin in non-cirrhotics with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The botanical product silymarin, an extract of milk thistle, is commonly used by patients to treat chronic liver disease and may be a treatment for  due to its antioxidant properties.

Success in these rivalries requires that individuals choose dynamically and unpredictably, often adopting a mixed strategy. Understanding the neural basis of strategic decision making is complicated by the fact that it recruits various cognitive processes that are often shared with non-strategic forms of decision making, such as value estimation, working memory, response inhibition, response selection, and reward processes. Although researchers have explored neural activity within key brain regions during mixed-strategy games, how brain activity differs in the context of strategic interactions versus non-strategic choices is not well understood. We developed a novel behavioral paradigm to dissociate choice behavior during mixed-strategy interactions from non-strategic choices, and we used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to contrast brain activation. In a block design, participants competed in the classic mixed-strategy game, "matching pennies," against a dynamic computer opponent designed to exploit predictability in players' response patterns. Results were contrasted with a non-strategic task that had comparable sensory input, motor output, and reward rate; thus, differences in behavior and brain activation reflect strategic processes. The mixed-strategy game was associated with activation of a distributed cortico-striatal network compared to the non-strategic task. We propose that choosing in mixed-strategy contexts requires additional cognitive demands present to a lesser degree during the control task, illustrating the strength of this design in probing function of cognitive systems beyond core sensory, motor, and reward processes.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589678>Understanding the Fertilizer Management Impacts on Water and Nitrogen Dynamics for a Corn Silage Tile-Drained System in Canada.</a></h2><p>Effective management of dairy manure is important to minimize N losses from cropping systems, maximize profitability, and enhance environmental sustainability. The objectives of this study were (i) to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model using measurements of silage corn ( L.) biomass, N uptake, soil temperature, tile drain flow, NO leaching, NO emissions, and soil mineral N in eastern Canada, and (ii) to investigate the long-term impacts of manure management under climate variability. The treatments investigated included a zero-fertilizer control, inorganic fertilizer, and dairy manure amendments (raw and digested). The DNDC model overall demonstrated statistically "good" performance when simulating silage corn yield and N uptake based on normalized RMSE (nRMSE) < 10%, index of agreement () > 0.9, and -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.5. In addition, DNDC, with its inclusion of a tile drainage mechanism, demonstrated "good" predictions for cumulative drainage (nRMSE < 20%, > 0.8, and NSE > 0.5). The model did, however, underestimate daily drainage flux during spring thaw for both organic and inorganic amendments. This was attributed to an underestimation of soil temperature and soil water under frequent soil freezing and thawing during the 2013-2014 overwinter period. Long-term simulations under climate variability indicated that spring applied manure resulted in less NO leaching and NO emissions than fall application when manure rates were managed based on crop N requirements. Overall, this study helped highlight the challenges in discerning the short-term climate interactions on fertilizer-induced N losses compared with the long-term dynamics under climate variability.© 2019 The Author(s) and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589122>Natural aldose reductase inhibitor: A potential therapeutic agent for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Aldose reductase (AR) has been reported to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hepatic AR is induced under hyperglycemia condition and converts excess glucose to lipogenic fructose, which contributes in part to the accumulation of fat in the liver cells of diabetes rodents. In addition, the hyperglycemia-induced AR or nutrition-induced AR causes suppression of the transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and reduced lipolysis in the liver, which also contribute to the development of NAFLD. Moreover, AR induction in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () may aggravate oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the liver. Here, we summarize the knowledge on AR inhibitors of plant origin and review the effect of some plant-derived AR inhibitors on NAFLD/ in rodents. Natural AR inhibitors may improve NAFLD at least in part through attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression. Some of the natural AR inhibitors have been reported to attenuate hepatic steatosis through the regulation of PPARα-mediated fatty acid oxidation. In this review, we propose that the natural AR inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604692>Performance of Plasma Biomarkers and Diagnostic Panels for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and Advanced Fibrosis in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The 2019  suggested that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) should be evaluated for liver fibrosis.

Of note, none of the panels or biomarkers was able to outperform plasma ALT (AUC 0.78 [95% CI 0.71-0.84]). Performance was better to diagnose advanced fibrosis, in which plasma PRO-C3, AST, and APRI showed better results than the other approaches (AUC 0.90 [0.85-0.95]; 0.85 [0.80-0.91]; and 0.86 [0.80-0.91]; respectively). Again, none of the approaches did significantly better than plasma AST. Sequential use of plasma AST and other noninvasive tests may help in limiting the number of liver biopsies required to detect patients with advanced fibrosis.Performance of noninvasive clinical models/scores and plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of  or advanced fibrosis was suboptimal in patients with T2DM.

Treatment is largely based on lifestyle modification, which is difficult to achieve in most patients. Progression of simple fatty liver or steatosis to its severe form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and liver fibrosis has been explained by a 'two-hit hypothesis'. Whilst simple steatosis is considered the first hit, its transformation to  may be driven by a second hit. Of several factors that constitute the second hit, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are formed when reducing-sugars react with proteins or lipids, have been implicated as major candidates that drive steatosis to  via the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Both endogenous and processed food-derived (exogenous) AGEs can activate RAGE, mainly present on Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, thus propagating NAFLD progression. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of NAFLD with special emphasis on the role of food-derived AGEs in NAFLD progression to  and liver fibrosis. Moreover, the effect of dietary manipulation to reduce AGE content in food or the therapies targeting AGE/RAGE pathway on disease progression is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612792>Discovery of potent apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 inhibitors via integrated computational strategy and biological evaluation.</a></h2><p>Apoptosis signal-regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1) has been confirmed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () disorder and the discovery of ASK1 inhibitors has attracted increasing attention.

The water balance model (WBM) uses standard meteorological parameters as input variables and runs on a daily time step. It consists of two modules. The aboveground module (1) comprises routines for fog precipitation generation, precipitation interception and snowfall/snowmelt dynamics. Covered belowground processes (2) are bypass flow, percolation, soil evaporation and transpiration, where the latter two processes are considered separately. Preceding to the WBM, a routine is introduced, specifying the intra-annual foliage dynamics of beech. Emphasis is also laid on the inter-annual variation of beech phenology. Leaf sprouting and leaf senescence are calculated as functions of day-length and air temperature. The WBM was applied to four European beech dominated forest stands in the northeastern part of Austria. They are located on a gradient of declining annual precipitation (from west to east). The two easterly sites are located close to the (dry) limit of the natural distribution of beech. Records of soil moisture were used for the adjustment of 26 parameters. On all sites the calibration process (simulated annealing) delivered good predictions of soil moisture (-Sutcliffe efficiency≥ 0.925). Then, the obtained parameterization was used to apply different scenarios of global warming. The temperature was increased step-wisely up to 4 °C. All scenarios were run (1) with present phenological conditions and (2) with phenology responding to higher temperatures. This way, we wanted to assign the effect of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons on the water dynamics of the forest stands. A warming of 1 °C corresponded roughly to an elongation of the growing season of 4.5 days, where the start of the growing season was affected more strongly than the end. Apparently, higher temperatures led to drier soils. The strongest change was observed in early summer, also amplified by an earlier start of the growing season. Rising temperatures led to lower export fluxes of liquid water, simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration (ET). The gain in ET was almost entirely assignable to increased soil evaporation. Drier soils led to a sharp depression of transpiration during summer months. This decline was compensated by the effect of elongated growing seasons. The risk of severe drought was increased by higher temperatures, but here the contribution of growing season length was negligible. Drier soils seem to hamper the stands' productivity. For all warming scenarios, the estimated increase of the gross primary production, caused by longer periods of assimilation, is nullified by the effect of soil water deficit in mid-summer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535424>Short-term heat stress impairs testicular functions in the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica: Molecular mechanisms and induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis in spermatogenic cells.</a></h2><p>Global temperature is increasing due to anthropogenic activities. Abnormal temperature has devastating effects on growth, reproduction, and development of aquatic organisms. In this study, we examined the effects of short-term exposure to elevated temperatures (28 and 32°C for 1 week) on testicular functions, heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), dinitrophenyl protein (DNP, a biomarker of reactive oxygen species [ROS]), and nitrotyrosine protein (NTP, an indicator of reactive nitrogen species [RNS]) expressions, protein carbonyl (PC, a measure of ROS) contents, nitrates/nitrites (NOx, a metabolite of nitric oxide) levels, extrapallial fluid (EPF) conditions, and cellular apoptosis in American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Higher temperatures significantly decreased (~26%) sperm production in oysters compared with controls (24°C). HSP70, NTP, and DNP expressions were increased after heat exposure, consistent with increased EPF pH, and cellular apoptosis. The enhanced apoptosis in spermatogenic cells is associated with increased caspase 3/7 activity, PC contents, and NOx levels in testicular tissues. Together these results suggest that elevated temperature drastically increases oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis which in turn leads to decreased testicular functions in oysters. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first findings on the impacts of elevated temperatures on testicular functions in oysters.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629472>MC4R deficiency in pigs results in hyperphagia and ultimately hepatic steatosis without high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)-deficient mice had been used for several years to study human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

We report herein that YAP in Kupffer cells (KCs) enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Our data show that the expression of YAP is significantly increased in KCs of wild type mice fed HFD. We then generated mice with macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of YAP (YAP ) or TLR4 (TLR4 ) and the animals were fed high fat diet (HFD) or treated with LPS. Our data showed that YAP mice fed HFD exhibited lower serum ALT/AST levels and less hepatic inflammation when compared to their littermate controls. LPS treatment induced the accumulation of YAP in KCs in vitro and in mice which was prevented by macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of TLR4 (TLR4 ). LPS transcriptionally activates YAP via AP-1 in macrophages/KCs. The LPS-induced YAP further enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6) through YAP association with the TEAD-binding motif in the promoter region of inflammatory cytokines. Forced overexpression of active YAP (YAP5SA) in KCs enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of HFD-fed mice with verteporfin inhibited Kupffer cell activation, reduced liver inflammation and decreased serum ALT/AST levels. Analyses of liver tissues from  patients reveal that YAP is increased in KCs and that the level of YAP in human liver tissues is positively correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: This study describes an important role of YAP in Kupffer cells for regulation of liver inflammation in . Our findings suggest that inhibition of YAP may represent a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for  treatment.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618320>Steatosis and steatohepatitis found in adults after death due to non-burn trauma.</a></h2><p>With the increasing prevalence of steatosis, the number of steatotic liver grafts from deceased donors is also increasing. Thus, determining the prevalence and the population risk factors of steatosis may assist in risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of steatosis and steatohepatitis among livers from adults who died due to non-burn trauma.Specimens were collected from 224 adults undergoing autopsy at a regional autopsy referral center from September 2011 to April 2013. Histopathological examination was performed on six samples obtained from different lobes of each liver. The outcomes of interest were the presence of steatosis, steatohepatitis,  inflammation and  fibrosis. The main predictors were body mass index, abdominal circumference, liver weight and volume, presence of cholelithiasis, and siderosis. Our modeling strategy made use of a series of generalized linear models with a binomial family.Our sample had a mean age of 40 years; steatosis was diagnosed in 48.2% of cases, and steatohepatitis was diagnosed in 2.7%. The presence of a high proportion of fatty changes was more prevalent among males and older individuals, with the most affected age group being 41-60 years. When evaluating the crude odds ratio for steatosis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of steatosis were greater abdominal circumference, BMI, and liver weight and the presence of siderosis.Our study reinforces the role of older age, obesity and hepatomegaly as predictors of fatty liver disease.

Simple hepatic steatosis may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), even fibrosis and cirrhosis, and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, NAFLD has become a public health concern with increasing prevalence.

The combination of liver disease and renal dysfunction can occur as a result of systemic conditions that affect both the liver and the kidney, although primary disorders of the liver complicated by renal dysfunction are much more common. As most of the renal dysfunction scenarios in cirrhotic patients correspond to either prerenal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), physicians tend to conceive renal dysfunction in cirrhotic patients as mainly HRS. However, there are many systemic conditions that may cause both a "baseline" chronic kidney damage and a superimposed kidney dysfunction when this systemic condition worsens. The main aim of this article is to review some of the most important non prerenal non-HRS considerations regarding acute on chronic kidney dysfunction in cirrhotic patients, including renal manifestation of related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () viral hepatitis, the effect of cardiorenal syndrome in cirrhotics and corticosteroid-deficiency associated renal dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

No accurate model of RC exists to answer fundamental research questions relevant to patients. We established a biorepository of 65 patient-derived RC organoid cultures (tumoroids) from patients with primary, metastatic or recurrent disease. RC tumoroids retained molecular features of the tumors from which they were derived, and their ex vivo responses to clinically relevant chemotherapy and radiation treatment correlated with the clinical responses noted in individual patients' tumors. Upon engraftment into murine rectal mucosa, human RC tumoroids gave rise to invasive RC followed by metastasis to lung and liver.

Whether functional status affects LT outcomes equally across cirrhosis etiologies is unclear.We evaluate the impact of functional status on waitlist and post-LT mortality stratified by etiology and age.Functional status among US adults from 2005 to 2017 United Network for Organ Sharing LT registry data was retrospectively evaluated using Karnofsky Performance Status Score (KPS-1 = functional status 80-100%, KPS-2 = 60-70%, KPS-3 = 40-50%, KPS-4 = 10-30%). Waitlist and post-LT survival were stratified by KPS and cirrhosis etiology, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), hepatitis C (HCV), and HCV/ALD, and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.Among 94,201 waitlist registrants (69.4% men, 39.5% HCV, 26.7% ALD, 23.2% ), ALD patients had worse functional status compared to HCV (KPS-4: 17.2% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001). Worse functional status at time of waitlist registration was associated with higher 90-day waitlist mortality with the greatest effect in ALD (KPS-4 vs. KPS-1: ALD HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.83-2.55; HCV HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.87-2.51). Similar trends occurred in 5-year post-LT survival with ALD patients the most harmed. Compared to patients < 50 years, patients ≥ 65 years had increased waitlist mortality at 90-days if they had HCV or HCV/ALD, and 5-year post-LT mortality regardless of cirrhosis etiology with ALD patients most severely affected.In a retrospective cohort study of patients, US ALD patients had disparately worse functional status at time of LT waitlist registration. Worse functional status correlated with higher risk of waitlist and post-LT mortality, affecting ALD and HCV patients the most.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520407>Editorial: The 20% Rule of  Progression: The Natural History of Advanced Fibrosis and Cirrhosis due to .</a></h2><p>The global epidemic of obesity has led to the rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as a significant cause of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and need for liver transplantation.(1) NAFLD is common, with a global estimate of 25% of adults (2), however only a small proportion will progress to cirrhosis and develop liver related morbidity.

The first step of the spectrum of the disease is the non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). Based on hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, NAFL will progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which may have the potential to progress cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a few years. Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver-resident macrophages and have been proven to play a crucial role in NAFLD development. Cardiolipin is reported to be effective to trigger the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through a ROS-independent signaling pathway. However, the exact mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activated by cardiolipin in KCs is still unclear.To make clear of the specific mechanism mentioned above, we firstly used a MCD-induced  mice model to demonstrate that CLS1 suppression reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Secondly, the results of IHC staining indicated that the expressions of CLS1 and NLRP3 in liver tissues were significantly upregulated in the  group compared to the ND group. On the contrary, CLS1 inhibition significantly downregulated NLRP3 expression in liver tissues, which indicated that CLS1 probably regulated the level of NLRP3 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CLS1 suppression significantly ameliorated the liver function and decreased the TG level, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 were markedly reduced upon CLS1 inhibition.In this work, we reported that cardiolipin is involved in the development of , and the suppression of the cardiolipin synthesis by shRNA-CLS1 could ameliorate the hepatic pathogenic manifestations, as well as the serum inflammatory biomarkers. We further showed that the protein expressions of CLS1, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 were all upregulated in the  liver tissues and palmitic stimulated KCs.Our study showed that the upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activated by cardiolipin is crucial in  pathogenesis, which might provide a novel potential role of cardiolipin blockade in the treatment of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592538>Treatment patterns and outcomes in goblet cell carcinoid tumors of the appendix.</a></h2><p>Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) tumors of the appendix are a rare malignancy. We aim to examine the overall survival per stage and the relationship between different treatment modalities and outcomes for patients with GCC tumors of the appendix.We identified patients with GCC tumors of the appendix from the National Cancer Database. The main outcome was overall patient survival and cox proportional hazard models were used to ascertain predictors of survival.There were 2552 patients identified. The median age of diagnosis was 57 (interquartile range: 49-65) and 52.3% of patients were female. The 5-year survival for Stage I disease was 91.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.2%-95.7%), for Stage II disease was 90.5% (95% CI: 85.8%-93.7%), for Stage III disease was 57.0% (95% CI: 45.0%-67.3%), and for Stage IV disease was 18.9% (95% CI: 9.3%-31.0%). In a Cox proportional hazard model, older age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12; P < .001), lymph node metastasis (HR: 6.9; 95% CI: 2.76-17.01; P < .001), and positive surgical margins (HR: 2.9; 95% CI:1.13-7.26; P = .003) were associated with worse overall survival for Stages I to III disease while only older age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.002-1.06; P = .04) was associated with worse overall survival for Stage IV disease.Patients with GCC tumors of the appendix who have the nonmetastatic disease have a high 5-year survival.

After baseline surveys demonstrated that Sudan was endemic for trachoma, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Trachoma Control Program conducted trachoma prevention and treatment interventions in endemic localities. The Sudan FMOH conducted population-based trachoma prevalence surveys between September 2016 and April 2017 in seven localities across five states of Sudan to document current trachoma prevalence estimates and measure water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) indicators. Children aged 1-9 years were examined for five clinical signs of trachoma, and participants of all ages were examined for trachomatous trichiasis (TT). A household questionnaire was administered to gather demographic and WASH-related information. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-1.1%) to 6.4% (95% CI: 3.3-11.9%). Trachomatous trichiasis in those aged 15 years and older ranged from 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0-0.6%) to a high of 4.4% (95% CI: 2.1-9.1%). Of seven localities surveyed, four localities had achieved the elimination threshold of less than 5% TF in children aged 1-9 years. Six localities still required interventions to achieve less than 0.2% TT in those aged 15 years and older. The presence of latrine ranged from a low of 10.8% (95% CI: 5.2-21.1%) to 88.4% (CI: 81.5-93.0%) and clean face among children ranged between 69.5% (95% CI: 63.5-75.0%) and 87.5% (95% CI: 81.2-91.9%).

Ferroptosis is a recently recognized type of cell death characterized by an iron dependent and lipid peroxidation-mediated non-apoptotic cell death. We demonstrate the impact of ferroptosis on the progression of  induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) feeding for 10 days. RSL-3 (a ferroptosis inducer) treatment showed decreased hepatic expression of GPX4, and conversely increased 12/15-lipoxygenase, and apoptosis inducing factor, indicating that ferroptosis plays a key role in -related lipid peroxidation and its-associated cell death. Consistently, levels of serum biochemical, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in MCD-fed mice were exacerbated with RSL-3 treatment. However, MCD-fed mice treated with sodium selenite (a GPX4 activator) showed increase of hepatic GPX4, accompanied by reduced  severity. To chelate iron, deferoxamine mesylate salt was used. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate salt significantly reduced  severity and abolished the harmful effects of RSL-3 in MCD-fed mice. Finally, treatment with Liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) repressed hepatic lipid peroxidation, and its associated cell death, resulting in decreased  severity. Consistent with the in vivo findings, modulation of ferroptosis /GPX4 affected hepatocellular death in palmitic acid-induced in vitro  milieu. We conclude that GPX4 and its-related ferroptosis might play a major role in the development of .Copyright © 2019.

In addition to metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors, a dysregulated circadian rhythm resulting from lifestyle changes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). An accumulating body of evidence also supports strong association between NAFLD and metabolic disorder, the pathogenesis of which is related to periodic fluctuations in hormonal homeostasis. It is clear that endocrine and circadian rhythms are tightly interconnected. Generally, the circadian rhythm regulates flux patterns of physiological functions.

In humans, most diseases of the liver are primarily caused by an unhealthy lifestyle-high fat diet, drug and alcohol consumption- or due to infections and exposure to toxic substances like aflatoxin or other environmental factors. All these noxae cause changes in the metabolism of functional cells in the liver. In this literature review we focus on the changes at the miRNA level, the formation and impact of reactive oxygen species and the crosstalk between those factors. Both, miRNAs and oxidative stress are involved in the multifactorial development and progression of acute and chronic liver diseases, as well as in viral hepatitis and carcinogenesis, by influencing numerous signaling and metabolic pathways.

We studied the effectiveness of a national quality improvement (QI) programme to implement a care pathway to improve survival for these patients.The objectives were to assess whether or not the QI programme improves 90-day survival after emergency abdominal surgery; to assess effects on 180-day survival, hospital stay and hospital readmission; and to better understand these findings through an integrated process evaluation, ethnographic study and cost-effectiveness analysis.This was a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Hospitals were organised into 15 geographical clusters, and commenced the QI programme in random order over 85 weeks. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was analysed using a mixed-effects parametric survival model, adjusting for time-related effects. Ethnographic and economics data were collected in six hospitals. The process evaluation included all hospitals.The trial was set in acute surgical services of 93 NHS hospitals.Patients aged ≥ 40 years who were undergoing emergency abdominal surgery were eligible.The intervention was a QI programme to implement an evidence-based care pathway.The primary outcome measure was mortality within 90 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes were mortality within 180 days, length of hospital stay and hospital readmission within 180 days. The main economic measure was the quality-adjusted life-years.Data were obtained from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit database; qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations; quality-of-life and NHS resource use data were collected via questionnaires.Of 15,873 eligible patients from 93 NHS hospitals, primary outcome data were analysed for 8482 participants in the usual care group and 7374 in the QI group. The primary outcome occurred in 1393 participants in the usual care group (16%), compared with 1210 patients in the QI group (16%) [QI vs. usual care hazard ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.28]. No differences were found in mortality at 180 days or hospital readmission; there was a small increase in hospital stay in the QI group (HR for discharge 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). There were only modest improvements in care processes following QI implementation. The ethnographic study revealed good QI engagement, but limited time and resources to implement change, affecting which processes teams addressed, the rate of change and eventual success. In some sites, there were challenges around prioritising the intervention in busy environments and in obtaining senior engagement. The intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective at standard cost-effectiveness thresholds, but may be cost-effective over the lifetime horizon.Substantial delays were encountered in securing data access to national registries. Fewer patients than expected underwent surgery and the mortality rate was lower than anticipated.There was no survival benefit from a QI programme to implement a care pathway for patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. The modest impact of the intervention on process measures, despite good clinician engagement, may have been limited by the time and resources needed to improve patient care.Future QI programmes must balance intervention complexity with the practical realities of NHS services to ensure that such programmes can be delivered with the resources available.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN80682973 and  protocol 13PRT/7655.This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 7, No. 32.

Liver fibrosis is the common feature of almost all chronic liver diseases and remains a key determinant of clinical prognosis. Over the last two decades, basic science studies have uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of chronic liver diseases, leading to the recent development of new anti-fibrotic drugs. These new drugs target different steps in the pathophysiology of chronic liver injury: metabolism of glucose, lipids and bile acids, apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis.

Adipose tissue grafting may induce healing in a persistent anastomotic defect. The aim of the present study was to report retrospectively reviewed outcomes for a series of patients who were managed with heterotopic grafted adipose tissue to facilitate anastomotic healing.Patients with anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection sequentially treated with grafting of adipose tissue were included in the study. All patients had pelvic radiation during treatment and had a diverting ileostomy in situ. The cohort had a persistent defect despite being treated with available modalities such as suture repair, fibrin glue, Endo-Sponge and surgical debridement. The outcomes were reviewed and reported.There were 11 patients (8 males and 3 females) with a median age of 54 years (range 33-72 years). Five patients experienced complete healing of the anastomotic defect with successful reversal of the diverting ileostomy. The anastomotic defect of one other patient in the series appeared to have healed and hence his diverting ileostomy was reversed. However, he presented with a recurrent leak, which ultimately necessitated an abdominoperineal resection. Another patient had a persistent defect after an attempt at adipose tissue grafting and opted to proceed with a takedown of the anastomosis. In the remaining four patients, the outcome after adipose tissue grafting remains unknown, as two patients succumbed to metastatic disease, one was lost to follow-up and the remaining patient developed a recurrence which required pelvic exenteration. Procedural associated morbidity occurred in one patient who developed fat embolism, which was treated expectantly.Adipose tissue grafting is safe and feasible, though its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Generally, treatment with obeticholic acid improved hepatic histology, including inflammation and fibrosis, the latter being the main histological predictor of advanced disease. Nonetheless, there were adverse effects, the most common being pruritus and unfavorable changes in the lipid profile. Pruritus led to discontinuation of treatment in some patients. Obeticholic acid, however, is not the only farnesoid X receptor agonist currently investigated for the treatment of . Another farnesoid X receptor agonist, cilofexor, in combination with firsocostat, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor, improved hepatic steatosis, liver stiffness, liver function tests and serum fibrosis markers, without causing pruritus after 12 weeks of treatment.

HF is associated with substantial microstructural remodeling, which is linked to changes in left ventricular geometry and impaired cardiac function. The role of myocardial remodeling in altering the mechanics of failing hearts remains unclear. Structurally based constitutive modeling provides an approach to improve understanding of the relationship between biomechanical function and tissue organization in cardiac muscle during HF. In this study, we used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and extended-volume confocal microscopy to quantify the remodeling of left ventricular geometry and myocardial microstructure of healthy and spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts at the ages of 12 and 24 months. Passive cardiac mechanical function was characterized using left ventricular pressure-volume compliance measurements. We have developed a, to our knowledge, new structurally based biomechanical constitutive equation built on parameters quantified directly from collagen distributions observed in confocal images of the myocardium. Three-dimensional left ventricular finite element models were constructed from subject-specific in vivo magnetic resonance imaging data. The structurally based constitutive equation was integrated into geometrically subject-specific finite element models of the hearts and used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of ventricular dysfunction during HF. Using a single pair of material parameters for all hearts, we were able to produce compliance curves that reproduced all of the experimental compliance measurements. The value of this study is not limited to reproducing the mechanical behavior of healthy and diseased hearts, but it also provides important insights into the structure-function relationship of diseased myocardium that will help pave the way toward more effective treatments for HF.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

Hf-Ir-Ni was highly effective in catalytic C-S, C-O, and C-C cross-coupling reactions with broad substrate scopes and turnover numbers of ∼4500, ∼1900, and ∼450, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594780>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of incident acute myocardial infarction and stroke: findings from matched cohort study of 18 million European adults.</a></h2><p>To estimate the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().Matched cohort study.Population based, electronic primary healthcare databases before 31 December 2015 from four European countries: Italy (n=1 542 672), Netherlands (n=2 225 925), Spain (n=5 488 397), and UK (n=12 695 046).120 795 adults with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or  and no other liver diseases, matched at time of NAFLD diagnosis (index date) by age, sex, practice site, and visit, recorded at six months before or after the date of diagnosis, with up to 100 patients without NAFLD or  in the same database.Primary outcome was incident fatal or non-fatal AMI and ischaemic or unspecified stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models and pooled across databases by random effect meta-analyses.120 795 patients with recorded NAFLD or  diagnoses were identified with mean follow-up 2.1-5.5 years. After adjustment for age and smoking the pooled hazard ratio for AMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.30; 1035 events in participants with NAFLD or , 67 823 in matched controls). In a group with more complete data on risk factors (86 098 NAFLD and 4 664 988 matched controls), the hazard ratio for AMI after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension was 1.01 (0.91 to 1.12; 747 events in participants with NAFLD or , 37 462 in matched controls). After adjustment for age and smoking status the pooled hazard ratio for stroke was 1.18 (1.11 to 1.24; 2187 events in participants with NAFLD or , 134 001 in matched controls). In the group with more complete data on risk factors, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04 (0.99 to 1.09; 1666 events in participants with NAFLD, 83 882 in matched controls) after further adjustment for type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, statin use, and hypertension.The diagnosis of NAFLD in current routine care of 17.7 million patient appears not to be associated with AMI or stroke risk after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular risk assessment in adults with a diagnosis of NAFLD is important but should be done in the same way as for the general population.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

NAFLD is associated with liver-related and cardiovascular complications. Despite this, the first licensed drug for NAFLD is yet to be approved. Given the scale of the problem and unmet needs, there is a myriad of agents in the development pipeline.  We discuss promising agents in early phase clinical trials and categorize these agents based on their action on steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. Furthermore, given the multisystemic nature of NAFLD, we consider the effects of these agents on the liver, their cardiometabolic effects, and the potential future strategies of combination therapies.  The paradigm for the ideal drug is the targeting of both steatohepatitis and fibrosis and the amelioration of cardiometabolic risk factors. New drugs that confer benefit in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () must also be tested for their effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The treatment of  will become analogous to the treatment of hypertension; it is very likely that multiple classes of drugs targeting different mechanistic pathways will be necessary because no single agent is likely to control all aspects of this complex liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612944>Transcriptome visualization and data availability at the Saccharomyces Genome Database.</a></h2><p>The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; www.yeastgenome.org) maintains the official annotation of all genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference genome and aims to elucidate the function of these genes and their products by integrating manually curated experimental data.

Dual-photon microscopy allows automated quantification of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs) and may facilitate large-scale histological studies. We aim to validate the performance of q-FPs in a large histological cohort.344 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underwent 428 liver biopsies (240 had paired transient elastography examination). Fibrosis stage was scored using the  Clinical Research Network system, and q-FPs were measured by dual-photon microscopy using unstained slides. Patients were randomly assigned to the training and validation cohorts to test the performance of individual q-FPs and derive optimal cut-offs.Over 25 q-FPs had area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves >0.90 for different fibrosis stages. Among them, the perimeter of collagen fibres and number of long collagen fibres had the highest accuracy. At the best cut-offs, the two q-FPs had 88.3%-96.2% sensitivity and 78.1%-91.1% specificity for different fibrosis stages in the validation cohort. q-FPs and histological scoring had nearly identical correlations with liver stiffness measurement, suggesting that the accuracy of q-FPs approached that of histological assessment. Among patients with paired liver biopsies, changes in the same q-FPs were associated with changes in fibrosis stage. At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, baseline q-FPs predicted liver-related events.q-FP is highly accurate in the assessment of fibrosis in NAFLD patients.

The failure of preclinical approaches to provide significant sepsis survival benefit in the clinic is often attributed to inappropriate animal disease models. It has been demonstrated that high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) blockade can reduce inflammation, mortality and morbidity in experimental sepsis without promoting immunosuppression. Within this study, we explored the use of ovine anti-HMGB1 antibodies in a model of ovine septic shock incorporating intensive care supports (OSSICS). Results: Septic sheep exhibited elevated levels of HMGB1 within 12 h after the induction of sepsis. In this study, sepsis was induced in six anaesthetized adult Border Leicester × Merino ewes via intravenous instillation of  and sheep monitored according to intensive care unit standard protocols for 26 h, with the requirement for noradrenaline as the primary endpoint. Septic sheep exhibited a hyperdynamic circulation, renal dysfunction, deranged coagulation profile and severe metabolic acidosis. Sheep were assigned a severity of illness score, which increased over time. While a therapeutic effect of intravenous anti-HMGB1 antibody could not be observed in this model due to limited animal numbers, a reduced bacterial dose induced a septic syndrome of much lower severity. With modifications including a reduced bacterial dose, a longer timeframe and broad spectrum antibiotics, the OSSICS model may become a robust tool for preclinical assessment of sepsis therapeutics.Copyright: © Stevens et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650383>High fructose-containing drinking water-induced steatohepatitis in rats is prevented by the nicotinamide-mediated modulation of redox homeostasis and NADPH-producing enzymes.</a></h2><p>An imbalance in the redox state, increased levels of lipid precursors and overactivation of de novo lipogenesis determine the development of fibrosis during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Male rats were provided drinking water containing 40% fructose for 16 weeks. During the last 12 weeks of fructose administration, water containing NAM was provided to some of the rats for 5 h/day. The biochemical profiles and the ghrelin, leptin, lipoperoxidation and TNF-α levels in serum and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), malic enzyme (ME) and NADP-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase (IDP) levels, the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and reduced/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)) ratios, and the levels of various lipogenic and fibrotic markers in the liver were evaluated. The results showed that hepatic fibrosis induced by fructose consumption was associated with weight gain, hunger-satiety system dysregulation, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, lipoperoxidation and inflammation. Moreover, increased levels of hepatic G6PD and ME activity and expression, the NAD(P)H/NAD(P) ratios, and GSSG concentration and increased expression of lipogenic and fibrotic markers were detected, and these alterations were attenuated by NAM administration. Specifically, NAM diminished the activity and expression of G6PD and ME, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the NADPH/NADP ratios, increased GSH levels and decreased lipoperoxidation and inflammation, ameliorating fibrosis and  development. NAM reduces liver steatosis and fibrosis by regulating redox homeostasis through a G6PD- and ME-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636947>Daily blue-light exposure shortens lifespan and causes brain neurodegeneration in .</a></h2><p>Light is necessary for life, but prolonged exposure to artificial light is a matter of increasing health concern. Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, , and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain and establishes  as a model in which to investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular and organismal level.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535207>Association between body size-metabolic phenotype and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and significant fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Body size-metabolic phenotype may help predict whether or not individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develop advanced liver disease. We studied the association of body size-metabolic phenotype with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and significant fibrosis.Our cross-sectional study included 559 subjects (mean age of 53 years; women 51%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese (≥ 25 kg/m) or non-obese (< 25 kg/m). Body size-metabolic phenotypes were divided into four study groups: (1) non-obese metabolic syndrome (MS)-, (2) non-obese MS+ , (3) obese MS-, and (4) obese MS+.Obese MS- and non-obese MS+ groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas.

RSC mitigates stormwater runoff by converting surface flow to subsurface seepage using a series of pools and riffles built over a sand media bed. Subsurface seepage flows through media and exits the RSC beneath the outlet weir. Previous studies on RSC pollutant mitigation have focused on surface flow discharges from the RSC. To date, no known research has been conducted on the potential pollutant contributions of RSC seepage, despite the fact that this water also enters receiving waters. This research used Multi-Point Sampling coupled with in-situ ultraviolet-visual spectroscopy to measure nitrogen in seepage during simulated storm events (n = 9) at a field-scale RSC in Raleigh, North Carolina. Calibrations between light absorbance and concentrations were acceptable (-Sutcliffe coefficient > 0.65) for nitrate and total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) and very good (-Sutcliffe coefficient > 0.90) for total Kjehdahl nitrogen (TKN). Early storm simulations revealed some initial nutrient flushing from the substrate, which subsided by the third simulation. Overall, subsurface seepage nitrate, TAN, and TKN concentrations were lower by 29%, 57%, and 4% relative to storm inflow concentrations, respectively. Computed subsurface nitrogen concentrations demonstrated temporal variability, highlighting dynamic transport and biogeochemical transformations in saturated and unsaturated conditions. Nitrogen concentrations were lower in seepage than in surface flow; however, due to the high volume of runoff converted to seepage, nitrogen loads discharged in seepage can be larger than those of surface flow. Further research is needed to examine subsurface pollutant reductions under varying hydrologic and seasonal conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent government programmes such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Mission Indradhanush (MI) have catalysed important changes impacting VHNDs. To learn how VHNDs are currently being delivered, we assessed the fidelity of services provided as compared to government norms in a priority district of Uttar Pradesh.We fielded a cross-sectional study of VHNDs to provide a snapshot of health services functioning. Process evaluation data were collected via administrative sources, non-participant observation using a standardised form, and structured questionnaires. Questionnaires were designed using a framework to assess implementation fidelity. Key respondents were VHND participants, front-line workers involved in VHND delivery, and VHND non-participants (pregnant women due for antenatal care or children due for vaccination as per administrative records). Results were summarised as counts, frequencies, and proportions.In the 30 villages randomly selected for inclusion, 36 VHNDs were scheduled but four (11.1%) were cancelled and one VHND was not surveyed. Vaccination and antenatal care were offered at 96.8% (30/31) and child weighing at 83.9% (26/31) of VHNDs. Other normed services were infrequently provided or completely absent. Health education and promotion were particularly weak; institutional delivery was the only topic discussed in a majority of VHNDs. The true proportion of any serious problem impeding vaccine delivery was 47.2% (17/36), comprising 4 VHND cancellations and 13 VHNDs experiencing vaccine shortages. Of the 13 incidents of vaccine shortage, 11 related to an unexpected global shortage of injectable polio vaccine (IPV). Over the 31 VHNDs, 37.8% (171 of the 452 scheduled beneficiaries) did not participate. Analysis of missed opportunities for vaccination highlighted inaccuracies in beneficiary identification and tracking and demand side-factors.The transformative potential of VHNDs to improve population health is only partially being met. A core subset of high-priority services for antenatal care, institutional delivery, and vaccination associated with high-priority government programmes (JSY, MI) is now being provided quite successfully. Other basic health promotion and prevention services are largely not provided, constituting a critical missed opportunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574071>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Silent Epidemic.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a growing condition among adolescent and adult populations, present in around 20%-30% of people in the United Kingdom.

Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were 5.5 times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561285>Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 ameliorated renal injury in a novel medaka model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related kidney disease.</a></h2><p>The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () has been reported, but there are few studies on its effect on -related renal injury.

People gain nutrients from a varied diet, although fish-which are a rich source of bioavailable micronutrients that are essential to human health-are often overlooked. A lack of understanding of the nutrient composition of most fish and how nutrient yields vary among fisheries has hindered the policy shifts that are needed to effectively harness the potential of fisheries for food and nutrition security. Here, using the concentration of 7 nutrients in more than 350 species of marine fish, we estimate how environmental and ecological traits predict nutrient content of marine finfish species. We use this predictive model to quantify the global spatial patterns of the concentrations of nutrients in marine fisheries and compare nutrient yields to the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in human populations. We find that species from tropical thermal regimes contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc; smaller species contain higher concentrations of calcium, iron and omega-3 fatty acids; and species from cold thermal regimes or those with a pelagic feeding pathway contain higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids. There is no relationship between nutrient concentrations and total fishery yield, highlighting that the nutrient quality of a fishery is determined by the species composition. For a number of countries in which nutrient intakes are inadequate, nutrients available in marine finfish catches exceed the dietary requirements for populations that live within 100 km of the coast, and a fraction of current landings could be particularly impactful for children under 5 years of age. Our analyses suggest that fish-based food strategies have the potential to substantially contribute to global food and nutrition security.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519114>GS-0976 (Firsocostat): an investigational liver-directed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().</a></h2><p>:  lipogenesis (DNL) plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism and contributes significantly to triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

Namodenoson, a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), which is highly expressed in pathological liver cells, induces a robust anti‑inflammatory effect in the liver, mediated via the de‑regulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Namodenoson also acts as a liver protective agent by inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion injury. Based on these unique characteristics, we investigated the anti‑ effect of Namodenoson in murine models of steatohepatitis and in the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line (HSC). In the STAM model, Namodenoson significantly decreased the non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score, NAS, demonstrating anti‑inflammatory and anti‑steatotic effects. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) model, Namodenoson reversed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to normal values and significantly improved liver inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the adiponectin and leptin levels. Namodenoson de‑regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in the liver extracts of the CCl4 model mice and in the LX2 HSCs, manifested by a decrease in the expression of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB), β‑catenin, lymphoid enhancer‑binding factor 1 (Lef‑1) and cyclin D1, and an increase in the expression level of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β).

Small-for-gestational-age infants experienced weight gain (4.3   g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: 2.0, 6.5   g · kg-1 · d-1) during days 1-8, versus weight loss (-4.6     g · kg-1 · d-1; 95% CI: -5.6, -3.7     g · kg-1 · d-1) among appropriate-for-gestational-age infants (P < 0.001). Positive-pressure ventilation (versus oxygen/room air) was associated with slower weight (-1.8    g · kg-1 · d-1) and HC (-0.25 cm/wk) gain during days 9-29 (P < 0.001). Morbidities were negatively associated with growth after days 1-8, with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) showing negative associations with weight (-2.7     g · kg-1 · d-1), length (-0.11 cm/wk), and HC (-0.21 cm/wk) gain during days 9-29 (P < 0.001). Macronutrient/energy intakes were associated with weight across hospitalization (P ≤ 0.01), with greater weight gain (1.3-3.0 g  ·  kg-1  ·  d-1) among infants achieving macronutrient/energy recommendations during days 9-29 and 30-75. Macronutrient/energy intakes were associated with HC during the first month (P = 0.013-0.003), with greater HC gain (0.07-0.12 cm/wk) among infants achieving protein, lipid, and energy recommendations during days 9-29.Baseline characteristics, acuity, morbidity, and nutrition factors were independently associated with VLBW infant growth. A focus on achieving macronutrient/energy recommendations and improving nutrient delivery to PDA-diagnosed infants may yield improvements to their growth.

Thirty of 34 SUBNCC patients were treated with extended cysticidal and anti-inflammatory regimens and followed up a median of 4.2 years posttreatment (range: 15 for ≥ 4 years, 20 ≥ 2 years, 26 > 1 year, and 3 < 1 year). The median ages at the time of first symptom, diagnosis, and enrollment were 29.7, 35.6, and 37.9 years, respectively; 58.8% were male and 82.4% were Hispanic. The median time from immigration to symptoms (minimum incubation) was 10 years and the estimated true incubation period considerably greater. Fifty percent also had other forms of NCC. Common complications were hydrocephalus (56%), shunt placement (41%), infarcts (18%), and symptomatic spinal disease (15%). Thirty patients (88.2%) required prolonged treatment with albendazole (88.2%, median 0.55 year) and/or praziquantel (61.8%; median 0.96 year), corticosteroids (88.2%, median 1.09 years), methotrexate (50%, median 1.37 years), and etanercept (34.2%, median 0.81 year), which led to sustained inactive disease in 29/30 (96.7%) patients. Three were treated successfully for recurrences and one has continuing infection. Normalization of cerebral spinal fluid parameters and cestode antigen levels guided treatment decisions. All 15 patients with undetectable cestode antigen values have sustained inactive disease. There were no deaths and moderate morbidity posttreatment. Corticosteroid-related side effects were common, avascular necrosis of joints being the most serious (8/33, 24.2%). Prolonged cysticidal treatment and effective control of inflammation led to good clinical outcomes and sustained inactive disease which is likely curative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658321>Thymoquinone reverses nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with experimental hypothyroidism.</a></h2><p>To assess the efficacy of thymoquinone (TQ), the most active constituent in Nigella sativa, which is a medicinal plant from the Ranunculaceae family, in restoring the normal liver structure after 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism and explore the mechanism behind this.Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by injection of PTU [6 mg∕kg body weight (b.w.)] for six weeks. Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; the control, TQ-treated at the dose 400 mg∕kg b.w., untreated hypothyroidism and TQ-treated hypothyroid groups. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and antioxidant profile were measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression of catalase (CAT). Liver was histopathologically examined using routine and immunohistochemical techniques.Livers of rats with hypothyroidism displayed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the form of steatosis as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Moreover, there was an intralobular inflammatory reaction associated with significant (p<0.05) increases in the density of resident hepatic macrophages [cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ cells], as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) index in livers with hypothyroidism. Resolution of hypothyroid NAFLD was observed in livers after treatment with TQ. The significantly increased (p<0.05) steatosis, lobular inflammation, NAFLD activity scores, α-SMA index as well as CD68+ cells induced by hypothyroidism were corrected after TQ administration. Up-regulation of the CAT gene in livers with hypothyroidism after treatment with TQ supported our hypothesis of its antioxidant mechanistic hepatoprotective action.TQ efficiently restores the normal liver histology in hypothyroid rats with up-regulation of the antioxidant CAT gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589891>Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Proof-of-concept studies frequently assess changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by MR-based techniques as a surrogate marker of histology. The aim of this study was to establish how reliable this strategy is to predict changes in liver histology in patients with .Patients with  who had participated in our prior randomized controlled trials of pioglitazone with complete paired data for IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liver histology were included in the study.A total of 121 patients were included. Changes in IHTG were assessed in several ways: as a continuous variable (correlations), as categorical groups (IHTG change ≥0%; or IHTG reduction of 1-30%; 31-50%; 51-70%; or >70%), and in a binomial way as steatosis resolution or not (defined as achieving IHTG<5.56%). Changes in IHTG correlated with steatosis on histology (r = 0.54; p<0.01). However, the magnitude of IHTG reduction was not associated with the rate of response of the primary histological outcome (2-point improvement in the NAFLD activity score from two different parameters, without worsening of fibrosis) or resolution of  without worsening of fibrosis, neither in patients receiving pioglitazone nor placebo. Changes in lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, or liver fibrosis were also independent of changes in IHTG, irrespective of treatment arm. Steatosis resolution was not associated with better histological outcomes either.Changes in IHTG predicts changes in steatosis but not of other liver histological parameters. This implies that IHTG response to treatment should be interpreted with caution as changes may not be as reliable as previously believed to determine overall clinical efficacy of novel treatments in patients with .Quantification of liver fat by MRI is currently used to assess response to treatment in patients with fatty liver (NAFLD), with the assumption that improvement in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful as previously believed to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Four blood fibrosis tests were calculated: ELF, FibroMeter , NFS, and FIB4. Advanced fibrosis F3/4 on liver biopsy ( CRN scoring) was the primary endpoint.Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for advanced fibrosis were not significantly different between the direct markers of liver fibrosis (hyaluronate, PIIINP, TIMP-1, alpha2-macroglobulin) and the simple blood fibrosis tests NFS and FIB4. ELF (0.793 ± 0.022) and FibroMeter (0.804 ± 0.021) had significantly higher AUROC than NFS (0.722 ± 0.025, P < .010) and FIB4 (0.739 ± 0.024, P < .020). AUROC for advanced fibrosis and Obuchowski index were not significantly different between ELF and FibroMeter . Algorithms using first ELF or FibroMeter and then liver biopsy in case of undetermined diagnosis provided high diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis: 90% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 93% negative predictive value, 85% positive predictive value, and 90% correct classification. In these algorithms, the rate of liver biopsy was 45.3% with ELF versus 39.3% with FibroMeter (P = .065).ELF and FibroMeter have equal accuracy and perform better than the simple FIB4 and NFS tests for the non-invasive diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD from tertiary care centres.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575419>Bariatric surgery is associated with reduction in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: A propensity matched analysis.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The spleen in obese patients is associated with the cardiovascular system. Enlargement of the spleen is suggestive of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Patients with  present an increase in growth factor (HGF) as well as those with advanced heart failure. Interleukin-16 and interleukin-12p40 levels were found to correlate significantly with BMI, and waist circumference.We tried to find a relationship between BMR, spleen length and HGF.We analysed retrospective data from 80 obese patients with NAFLD. We evaluated indices of indirect calorimetry by the bioimpendance analysis; carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), spleen length (SLD) and HS by ultrasonography; serum HGF, IL-16, IL-12p40 and IL-6 concentrations by a magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays and the severity of NAFLD by BARD score > 2.HGF levels of the obese were higher than those of controls,  < 0.001. At linear regression, BMR was foreseen by spleen length ( < 0.001), which was predicted by HGF ( = 0.04). BMR was predicted by IL-16 ( = 0.005), which predicted HGF,  = 0.034. Only fat mass, among other factors, predicted early atherosclerosis,  = 0.017; IL-12p40 did not predict IMT, HGF and BMR ( = 0.57, 0.09 and 0.59, respectively). The BARD score > 2 was negatively predicted by BMR and FFM ( =0.032 and 0.031, respectively), at the logistic regression. Interesting findings at the extended regression (mediation effect) were: IL-16 was likely causal in predicting BMR by HGF levels; HGF was influential in predicting BMR by SLD level. HS was predicted by SLD in males ( = 0.014), of advanced age ( < 0.001) and by BMR ( < 0.001). IL-6 concentrations, but not BMR were influential in the prediction of HS by SLD.These data reinforce the concept that the immune system is a sensor of the metabolic state, showing a link between HGF levels and BMR, which is mediated by IL-16 (cytokine inducing a cascade of inflammatory factors), and ascertaining the influential effect of the spleen, as main immune organ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543356>Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse and Conventional Ultrasound in the Prediction of Cirrhosis Complicating Fatty Liver: Does Body Mass Index Independently Alter the Results?</a></h2><p>We investigated whether ultrasound (US) could quantify steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Estimates of fat by gray-scale, hepatorenal index (HRI) and fibrosis by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) were made using the interquartile range (IQR)/median for ARFI quality. Biopsy was the gold standard. US fat assessment correlated with histologic grade and predicted steatosis. HRI predicted steatosis but did not improve accuracy. ARFI of good quality was highly sensitive toward severe fibrosis. The median ARFI value depended linearly on body mass index (BMI). Poor quality ARFI data had higher histologic steatosis, leading to higher mean steatosis grades in rejected data (p = 0.018). The ARFI quality cut with IQR/median >0.15 or >0.3 excluded many more patients with severe steatosis versus normal, influenced by increasing BMI. By combining the baseline US with ARFI, patients can be concurrently diagnosed for steatosis and fibrosis, two of the key pathologies of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

High-fat diet-fed and aged chow-fed liver-specific ASK1-knockout mice develop a higher degree of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to controls. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ASK1 increased hepatic lipid accumulation in wild-type mice. In line, liver-specific ASK1 overexpression protected mice from the development of high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, ASK1 depletion blunts autophagy, thereby enhancing lipid droplet accumulation and liver fibrosis.

Automated qFIBS analysis outputs showed strong correlation with each respective component of the  CRN scoring (P < 0.001) (qFibrosis [r = 0.776], qInflammation [r = 0.557], qBallooning [r = 0.533], and qSteatosis [r = 0.802]) and high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values (qFibrosis [0.870-0.951; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.787-1.000; P < 0.001], qInflammation [0.820-0.838; 95% CI, 0.726-0.933; P < 0.001 ), qBallooning [0.813-0.844; 95% CI, 0.708-0.957; P < 0.001], and qSteatosis [0.939-0.986; 95% CI, 0.867-1.000; P < 0.001]) and was able to distinguish differing grades/stages of histological disease. Performance of qFIBS was best when assessing degree of steatosis and fibrosis but performed less well when distinguishing severe inflammation and higher ballooning grades. Conclusion: qFIBS is an automated tool that accurately quantifies the critical components of  histological assessment.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in . However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of B cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of  to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses.

Maximum likelihood, Bayesian phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses, based on two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, revealed the existence of three reciprocally monophyletic, deeply divergent and allopatric clades that probably represent cryptic species. The west coast clade is largely confined to the Langvlei, Verlorenvlei, Berg and Diep Rivers, the Klein River clade is endemic to the Klein River and the south coast clade is found everywhere else in the range of kurper sensu lato. It was hypothesised that divergences within kurper sensu lato probably occurred because of isolation of coastal drainages by persistent drainage divides or vicariance of current tributaries by the drowning of their confluences by high sea levels. The current distribution of lineages could be due to historical range expansion and gene flow via river capture or some other mode of transdivide dispersal or dispersal during periods of low sea level via paleoriver confluences of currently isolated coastal rivers. Comparison of BEAST2 estimated divergence times with the timing of climatic, geological and geomorphological events supported long-term coastal drainage isolation, punctuated by rare transdivide dispersal events and limited paleoriver dispersal, as the best explanation of current phylogeographic and divergence patterns in kurper. Hydrological barriers that block upstream passage in palaeotributaries could hypothetically explain why kurper failed to disperse through certain palaeoriver confluences. There were several sites where biogeographic patterns have likely been confounded by human translocation of kurper. Alien fish predators and water extraction may threaten the three cryptic species more severely than previously realised, due to their smaller population sizes and inhabitation of only a portion of the range previously ascribed to kurper sensu lato. The preponderance of cryptic diversity and endemism in the CFR suggests that additional undescribed cryptic species of obligate freshwater fishes may be found in short coastal river systems around the world, especially in regions with a history of geological stability and a narrow continental shelf.

Recent investigations have documented the prion-like features of tau protein and the involvement of microglial changes with tau pathology.

Based on available evidence, targeting tau seeds and controlling some signaling pathways in a complex inflammation process could represent a possible new therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings propose novel diagnostic assays and markers that may be used together with standard methods to complete and improve the diagnosis and classification of these diseases. In conclusion, a novel perspective on microglia-tau relations reveals new issues to investigate and imposes different approaches for developing therapeutic strategies for AD.Copyright © 2019 Španić, Langer Horvat, Hof and Šimić.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630897>NAFLD and Atherosclerosis: Two Sides of the Same Dysmetabolic Coin?</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly increasing and may put patients at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD). Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD. Genetic studies support that NAFLD may drive asCVD through mixed hyperlipidemia. Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction. Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in liver tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and /HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of  and prevented the progression of  to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641060>Identifying Ontario geographic regions to assess adults who present to hospital with laboratory-defined conditions: a descriptive study.</a></h2><p>In 2007, an electronic repository called the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) was introduced to allow health care providers timely access to laboratory test results. Since not all laboratories began submitting their data to OLIS simultaneously, we sought to create a date-dependent table of geographic regions (forward sortation areas [FSAs]) from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS.In this descriptive study, we used administrative data to capture adults in Ontario who presented to the emergency department for any reason from 2007 to 2017. To assess changes over time, we classified all emergency department visits into fiscal quarters. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of people in a given FSA presenting to an emergency department at an OLIS-linked hospital (v. a hospital not linked to OLIS). To be included in the catchment area, at least 90% of all emergency department visits in a given quarter from a given FSA must have occurred at an OLIS-linked hospital.By Dec. 31, 2017, 323 (61.4%) of 526 Ontario FSAs were in the catchment area (a population of about 8.5 million). There were no differences in selected demographic characteristics or comorbidities between people residing within the catchment area of OLIS-linked hospitals and those residing in the catchment area of unlinked hospitals on Dec. 31, 2017. We used the FSA information to construct a date-dependent table of geographic areas likely to have hospital laboratory data available in OLIS for future studies.We identified relevant Ontario geographic regions from which people would likely present to a hospital linked to OLIS. These geographic regions constitute a catchment area that may be used in future studies to capture adults who present to an OLIS-linked hospital with laboratory-defined conditions such as acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.Copyright 2019, Joule Inc. or its licensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589663>Modeling and Mitigating Phosphorus Losses from a Tile-Drained and Manured Field Using RZWQM2-P.</a></h2><p>Prediction of P losses from manured agricultural fields through surface runoff and tile drainage is necessary to mitigate widespread eutrophication in water bodies. However, present water quality models are weak in predicting P losses, particularly in tile-drained and manure-applied cropland. We developed a field-scale P management model, the Root Zone Water Quality Model version 2-Phosphorus (RZWQM2-P), whose accuracy in simulating P losses from manure applied agricultural field is yet to be tested. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the accuracy of this new model in simulating dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) losses in surface runoff and tile drainage from a manure amended field, and (ii) to identify best management practices to mitigate manure P losses including water table control, manure application timing, and spreading methods by the use of model simulation. The model was evaluated against data collected from a liquid cattle manure applied field with maize ( L.)-soybean [ (L.) Merr.] rotation in Ontario, Canada. The results revealed that the RZWQM2-P model satisfactorily simulated DRP and PP losses through both surface runoff and tile drainage (-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.50, percentage bias within ±25%, and index of agreement > 0.75). Compared with conventional management practices, manure injection reduced the P losses by 18%, whereas controlled drainage and winter manure application increased P losses by 13 and 23%, respectively. The RZWQM2-P is a promising tool for P management in manured and subsurface drained agricultural field. The injection of manure rather than controlled drainage is an effective management practice to mitigate P losses from a subsurface-drained field.© 2019 The Authors.

However, to predict the amount of incoming wastewater in WWTPs, wastewater engineers face challenges arising from numerous complexities and uncertainties, such as the nonlinear precipitation-runoff relationships in combined sewer systems, unpredictability due to aging infrastructure, and frequently inconsistent data quality. To address such challenges, a time series analysis model (i.e., the autoregressive integrated moving average, ARIMA) and an artificial neural network model (i.e., the multilayer perceptron neural network, MLPNN) were developed for predicting wastewater inflow. A case study of the Barrie Wastewater Treatment Facility in Barrie, Canada, was carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models. Fifteen-minute flow data over a period of 1 year were collected, and the resampled daily flow data were used to train and validate the developed models. The model performances were examined using root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination, and -Sutcliffe efficiency. The results indicate that both models provided reliable forecasts, while ARIMA showed a slightly better performance than MLPNN in this case study. The proposed models can provide useful decision support for the optimization and management of WWTPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595464>Low Awareness of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in a Population-Based Cohort Sample: the CARDIA Study.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, yet little is known about NAFLD awareness in individuals with incidental fatty liver on imaging.To assess the level of awareness of imaging-defined NAFLD among individuals with and without metabolic risk factors.Cross-sectional analysis within a prospective longitudinal population-based cohort study conducted in four U.S. cities.Adults age 43 to 55 years enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study who underwent computed tomography and a personal health questionnaire at the year 25 exam (2010-2011, n = 2788).NAFLD was defined as liver attenuation ≤ 51 Hounsfield units after exclusion of other causes of liver fat. Participants were considered "NAFLD aware" if they reported being told previously by a doctor or nurse that they had "fatty liver."NAFLD prevalence was 23.9%. Only 16 of 667 (2.4%) participants with CT-defined NAFLD were aware of a NAFLD diagnosis. NAFLD aware participants were more likely to be white (81.3% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.03) and have the metabolic syndrome (87.5% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.02) and/or hypertension (75.0% vs. 50.2%, p = 0.05). In multivariable analyses adjusted for demographics, metabolic syndrome and hypertension remained predictive of NAFLD awareness.There is low awareness of NAFLD among individuals with hepatic steatosis on imaging, even among those with metabolic risk factors.

This study addresses the effect of machine perfusion (MP) on allograft rejection in the United States. We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients undergoing kidney-alone transplants in the UNOS database from June 30, 2004 to May 31, 2017. DGF was defined as dialysis requirement in the first week post-transplant; graft rejection was defined at 6 months and 1 year. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for recipient and donor factors evaluated the effect of MP on DGF and graft rejection. Records for 79 300 kidney transplants meeting inclusion criteria were abstracted, 42% of which underwent MP. MP kidneys came from older donors, were more likely to have been obtained following donation after cardiac death, and had longer cold ischemic times. Rates of DGF and rejection were similar between MP and static storage kidneys. Following adjustment, recipients of MP kidneys were less likely to experience rejection at 1 year (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.97] P = .002), but not at 6 months post-transplantation (OR 0.94 [0.88-1.02] P = .07).

This is due to their high energy density (∼900 W h kg-1), which is larger than those of the currently used commercial cathode materials. Moreover, EV technologies require lithium ion batteries with a high rate performance to achieve short charging times. The high rate property largely depends on the electrochemical properties of the electrodes in these batteries. However, the correlation between the cycling rate, structural stability and electrochemical properties of cathode materials is not clearly understood. In this work, the influence of cycling rate on structural transition behaviors and cycling stability of a 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiCoO2 composite-based material was investigated. The experimental results reveal that cycling rates significantly affect the activation of the Li2MnO3 component.

It represents a range of disorders, including simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), and liver cirrhosis, and its prevalence continues to rise. In some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may develop. The develop;ment of non-invasive diagnostic and screening tools is needed, in order to reduce the frequency of liver biopsies. The most promising methods are those able to exclude advanced fibrosis and quantify steatosis. In this study, new perspective markers for inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrogenesis; emerging scoring models for detecting hepatic steatosis and fibrosis; and new genetic, epigenetic, and multiomic studies are discussed. As isolated biochemical parameters are not specific or sensitive enough to predict the presence of  and fibrosis, there is a tendency to use various markers and combine them into mathematical algorithms. Several predictive models and scoring systems have been developed. Current data suggests that panels of markers (NAFLD fibrosis score, Fib-4 score, BARD score, and others) are useful diagnostic modalities to minimize the number of liver biopsies.

This research is critical in understanding the factors that influence risk for depression and anxiety disorders and has the potential to contribute to the development of innovative treatments that can more precisely target vulnerable populations.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554328>Bridging Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly During GRACE/GRACE-FO Gap Using SSA Method: A Case Study in China.</a></h2><p>The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) gap between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO) is now a significant issue for scientific research in high-resolution time-variable gravity fields. This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to predict the TWSA derived from GRACE. We designed a case study in six regions in China (North China Plain (NCP), Southwest China (SWC), Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), Tianshan Mountains Region (TSMR), Heihe River Basin (HRB), and Lishui and Wenzhou area (LSWZ)) using GRACE RL06 data from January 2003 to August 2016 for inversion, which were compared with Center for Space Research (CSR), Helmholtz-Centre Potsdam-German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s Mascon (Mass Concentration) RL05, and JPL's Mascon RL06. We evaluated the accuracy of SSA prediction on different temporal scales based on the correlation coefficient (), -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), which were compared with that of an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were predicted using SSA, which was verified using Mascon RL06, the Global Land Data Assimilation System model, and GRACE-FO results. The results show that: (1) TWSA derived from GRACE agreed well with Mascon in most regions, with the highest consistency with Mascon RL06 and (2) prediction accuracy of GRACE in TRHR and SWC was higher. SSA reconstruction improved , NSE, and RMSE compared with those of ARMA. The  values for predicting TWS in the six regions using the SSA method were 0.34-0.98, which was better than those for ARMA (0.26-0.97), and the RMSE values were 0.03-5.55 cm, which were better than the 2.29-5.11 cm RMSE for ARMA as a whole. (3) The SSA method produced better predictions for obvious periodic and trending characteristics in the TWSA in most regions, whereas the detailed signal could not be effectively predicted. (4) The predicted TWSA from September 2016 to May 2019 were basically consistent with Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) results, and the predicted TWSA during June 2018 to May 2019 agreed well with GRACE-FO results. The research method in this paper provides a reference for bridging the gap in the TWSA between GRACE and GRACE-FO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570275>Endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function.

Stress is physiological and biological response to maintain homeostasis of body against stressors while severe stress response is an important contributor to various illnesses including metabolic syndrome and brain disorders. We have evaluated the effects of intermittent restraint stress on NAFLD in a HFD-fed mouse model. C57/BL6 mice had free access to a 60% HFD for 8 weeks, with or without intermittent restraint stress (3 h) conducted 3 times a week. HFD administration increased fat accumulation in liver tissues. Unlike the stressed standard diet group, the levels of hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly ameliorated in the HFD with stress group compared to the HFD alone group. These beneficial results were in accordance with serum levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and hepatic levels of TNF-α and oxidative stress parameters (ROS, NO, and malondialdehyde). The intermittent restraint stress significantly attenuated the HFD-derived alterations in serum insulin levels, hepatic protein kinase B (AKT) activity and gene expression especially related to lipogenesis. This intermittent restraint stress also elevated the serum epinephrine concentration and activated the adrenergic receptor β2 or β 3 in livers or WAT. The activations of energy expenditure markers (UCP1, PGC1α) in brown adipose tissue and the browning of WAT were also observed in the HFD with stress group.

Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to  is key step in the  formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Current and traditional models implicate the consciously perceived hedonic qualities of food as driving overeating, whereas subliminal signals arising from the gut would curb our uncontrolled desire for calories. Here we review recent animal and human studies that support a markedly different model for food reward. These findings reveal in particular the existence of subcortical body-to-brain neural pathways linking gastrointestinal nutrient sensors to the brain's reward regions. Unexpectedly, consciously perceptible hedonic qualities appear to play a less relevant, and mostly transient, role in food reinforcement. In this model, gut-brain reward pathways bypass cranial taste and aroma sensory receptors and the cortical networks that give rise to flavor perception. They instead reinforce behaviors independently of the cognitive processes that support overt insights into the nature of our dietary decisions.

We investigate the relationship between the number of missed study visits (MSVs) within each episode of 2 consecutively attended visits (MSVs) and subsequent HIV risk in a predominantly FSW cohort.Women at high risk of HIV are invited to attend an ongoing dedicated clinic offering a combination HIV prevention intervention in Kampala, Uganda. Study visits are scheduled once every 3 months. The analysis included HIV-seronegative women with ≥1 follow-up visit from enrollment (between April 2008 and May 2017) to August 2017. Cox regression models were fitted adjusted for characteristics on sociodemographic, reproductive, behavioral, and sexually transmitted infections (through clinical examination and serological testing for syphilis).Among 2206 participants, HIV incidence was 3.1/100 (170/5540) person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6 to 3.5]. Incidence increased from 2.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 2.1 to 3.2) in episodes without a MSV to 3.0/100 (95% CI: 2.2 to 4.1) for 1-2 MSVs and 4.3/100 (95% CI: 3.3 to 5.6) for ≥3 MSVs. Relative to episodes without a MSV, the hazard ratios (adjusted for confounding variables) were 1.40 (95% CI: 0.93 to 2.12) for 1-2 MSVs and 2.00 (95% CI: 1.35 to 2.95) for ≥3 MSVs (P-trend = 0.001).Missing study visits was associated with increased subsequent HIV risk.

It is often unclear whether this finding is a non-specific consequence of cirrhosis or indicative of underlying A1ATD (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) contributing to the cirrhosis. In this study, explanted livers were retrospectively evaluated for histopathology (including PASD status with confirmatory A1AT immunohistochemistry), and chart review provided etiology of liver failure and general clinical parameters. RT-PCR (real-time PCR) was used to detect A1AT genotype (SERPINA1 S and Z alleles) by melting curve analysis on liver explant tissue from selected cases. Of 196 explanted livers, 21 (11%) had PASD+ globules. PASD+ globules were significantly enriched in patients with a clinical diagnosis of  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 47%) compared to other causes such as chronic ethanol use (16%) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (6.7%) (P 0.001). Immunohistochemistry confirmed all PASD+ globules were A1AT positive, with 20 of 21 cases demonstrating diffuse A1AT staining. In an expanded  cohort, 42% (14/33) of explants had PASD+ globules, and 92% of these PASD+ cases were homozygous (n=1) or heterozygous (n=11) for the SERPINA1 Z allele, corresponding to nearly 40% of all  patients. Overall, the Z allele was present in 10% of all liver explants tested, with 85% of PASD+ cases genotyping homozygous (n=2) or heterozygous (n=20), far in excess of the estimated 2% in the general population. Conclusion: These results indicate PASD+ A1AT globules (with confirmatory genotyping showing at least one Z allele) are commonly observed in , suggesting a synergistic relationship towards liver fibrosis. In addition, the high frequency of SERPINA1 Z alleles in liver transplantation patients supports the utility of pre-transplant genotyping.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517638>Histologic Findings of Advanced Fibrosis and Cirrhosis in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Who Have Normal Aminotransferase Levels.</a></h2><p>Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and normal aminotransferase levels may have advanced liver histology.

Several human studies from the past years have demonstrated that NAFLD contains a disease-specific gut microbiome signature. Controlled studies propose that certain bacteria with rather pro-inflammatory features such as Proteobacteria or  are dominantly present in these patients. In contrast, rather protective bacteria such as  are decreased in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, various bacterial metabolites and microbiota-generated secondary bile acids are involved in NAFLD-associated metabolic dysfunction. Although these findings are exciting, research currently lack evidence that interference at the level of the gut microbiome is beneficial for these diseases. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to advance this aspect of NAFLD research and to support the notion that the intestinal microbiota is indeed of major relevance in this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584681>Association of Histologic Disease Activity With Progression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>The histologic evolution of the full spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and factors associated with progression or regression remain to be definitively established.To evaluate the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time.A prospective cohort substudy from the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network ( CRN) NAFLD Database study, a noninterventional registry, was performed at 8 university medical research centers. Masked assessment of liver histologic specimens was performed, using a prespecified protocol to score individual biopsies. Participants included 446 adults with NAFLD enrolled in the  CRN Database studies between October 27, 2004, and September 13, 2013, who underwent 2 liver biopsies 1 or more year apart. Data analysis was performed from October 2016 to October 2018.Progression and regression of fibrosis stage, using clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings, including the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; range, 0-8, with 8 indicating more severe disease).A total of 446 adults (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years; 294 [65.9%] women) with NAFLD (NAFL, 86 [19.3%]), borderline  (84 [18.8%]), and definite  (276 [61.9%]) were studied. Over a mean (SD) interval of 4.9 (2.8) years between biopsies, NAFL resolved in 11 patients (12.8%) and progressed to steatohepatitis in 36 patients (41.9%). Steatohepatitis resolved in 24 (28.6%) of the patients with borderline  and 61 (22.1%) of those with definite . Fibrosis progression or regression by at least 1 stage occurred in 132 (30%) and 151 [34%] participants, respectively. Metabolic syndrome (20 [95%] vs 108 [72%]; P = .03), baseline NAS (mean [SD], 5.0 [1.4] vs 4.3 [1.6]; P = .005), and smaller reduction in NAS (-0.2 [2] vs -0.9 [2]; P < .001) were associated with progression to advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis vs those without progression to stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. Fibrosis regression was associated with lower baseline insulin level (20 vs 33 μU/mL; P = .02) and decrease in all NAS components (steatosis grade -0.8 [0.1] vs -0.3 [0.9]; P < .001; lobular inflammation -0.5 [0.8] vs -0.2 [0.9]; P < .001; ballooning -0.7 [1.1] vs -0.1 [0.9]; P < .001). Only baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were associated with fibrosis regression vs no change and progression vs no change on multivariable regression: baseline AST (regression: conditional odds ratio [cOR], 0.6 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; P < .001; progression: cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P = .002). Changes in the AST level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and NAS were also associated with fibrosis regression and progression (ΔAST level: regression, cOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.2; P = .47; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .02; ΔALT level: regression, cOR, 0.7 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; P = .002; progression, cOR, 1.0 per 10 U/L AST; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2; P = .93; ΔNAS: regression, cOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9; P = .001; progression, cOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P = .01).Improvement or worsening of disease activity may be associated with fibrosis regression or progression, respectively, in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656024>Potential clinical variants detected in mitochondrial DNA D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a mitochondrial disease. However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150  as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with  and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of  and -complicated diseases were identified. In patients with , the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular inflammation and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with metabolic syndrome; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II diabetes.

Their capacity to build enduring crusts that underpin the formation of tropical reefs, rhodolith beds and other benthic substrate is dependent on the formation of a calcified thallus. However, this important process of skeletal carbonate formation is not well understood. We undertook a study of cellular carbonate features to develop a model for calcification. We describe two types of cell wall calcification; 1) calcified primary cell wall (PCW) in the thin-walled elongate cells such as central medullary cells in articulated corallines and hypothallial cells in crustose coralline algae (CCA), 2) calcified secondary cell wall (SCW) with radial Mg-calcite crystals in thicker-walled rounded cortical cells of articulated corallines and perithallial cells of CCA. The distinctive banding found in many rhodoliths is the regular transition from PCW-only cells to SCW cells. Within the cell walls there can be bands of elevated Mg with Mg content of a few mol% higher than radial Mg-calcite (M-type), ranging up to dolomite composition (D-type).We propose the following three-step model for calcification. 1) A thin (< 0.5 μm) PCW forms and is filled with a mineralising fluid of organic compounds and seawater. Nanometer-scale Mg-calcite grains precipitate on the organic structures within the PCW. 2) Crystalline cellulose microfibrils (CMF) are extruded perpendicularly from the cellulose synthase complexes (CSC) in the plasmalemma to form the SCW. 3) The CMF soaks in the mineralising fluid as it extrudes and becomes calcified, retaining the perpendicular form, thus building the radial calcite. In Clathromorphum, SCW formation lags PCW creating a zone of weakness resulting in a split in the sub-surface crust. All calcification seems likely to be a bioinduced rather than controlled process. These findings are a substantial step forward in understanding how corallines calcify.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622202>Protective effect of incretin aganist age-related disease.</a></h2><p>Incretin contains two peptides named glucagon-like peptide-1and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Incretin-based therapies have become a new class of antidiabetic drugs for its promising action on insulinotropic secretion and improving insulin receptor. Considering the fact which diabetes is a significant risk factor for most other age-related disease the extensive protective roles of incretin in chronic disease have being focused. Based on the evidence from animals where incretin protects against patholophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical trials for the treatment of AD and PD are currently ongoing. Moreover, the protective effect of incretin for heart has been observed in vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cardiac myocytes. Incretin is proven against atherosclerogenesis by inhibiting aortic vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation. It is also benefit for diabetic microvascular complications including nephropathy, retinopathy, and gastric ulcer. Furthermore, incretin can be used to treat NAFLD/. Anti-tumoral properties of incretin have also been proven in ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611031>Characterization of biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in healthy non-obese and lean population of living liver donors: The impact of uric acid.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequently seen among non-obese overweight individuals and lean subjects (those with normal body mass index).

The trials have focused on community-level interventions to increase diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve health and reduce HIV transmission. Universal test-and-treat strategies are deployed to achieve viral suppression thereby reducing risk to uninfected persons, known as treatment as prevention (TasP).We review the work that found HIV plasma load to correlate with transmission risk, demonstrated that ART could reduce genital tract viral expression, and showed early treatment to be beneficial for persons living with HIV, and that HIV-uninfected sexual partners were protected from infection. We review the seemingly inconsistent findings of the major TasP trials: the TasP [National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS) 12249] study in South Africa, the SEARCH trial in Kenya and Uganda, the Botswana Combination Prevention Project Ya Tsie study, and the HIV Prevention Trials Network 071 (PopART) trial in Zambia and South Africa.All the trials reinforce the critical need to identify approaches to optimize programs and incentivize uptake and engagement in HIV testing and ART-based care in ways that consistently reduce HIV transmission.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and liver elastography tests, defining the level of liver fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to liver biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their liver disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had  at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to liver disease.

Limited data exist on mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) in travelers. We describe the epidemiology of travel-associated CL and MCL among international travelers and immigrants over a 20-year period through descriptive analysis of GeoSentinel data.Demographic and travel-related data on returned international travelers diagnosed with CL or MCL at a GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 1, 1997 and August 31, 2017 were analyzed.Nine-hundred, fifty-five returned travelers or migrants were diagnosed with travel-acquired CL (n=916) or MCL during the study period, of whom 10% (n=97) were migrants. For the 858 non-migrant travelers, common source countries were Bolivia (n=156, 18.2%) and Costa Rica (n=97, 11.3%), while for migrants, they were Syria (n=34, 35%) and Afghanistan (n=22, 22.7%). Ninety-nine travelers (10%) acquired their disease on trips of ≤2 weeks. Of 274 cases for which species identification was available, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis was the most well represented strain (n=117, 42.7%), followed by L. major (n=40, 14.6%), and L. V. panamensis (n=38, 13.9%). Forty cases of MCL occurred, most commonly in tourists (n=29, 72.5%) and from Bolivia (n=18, 45%). 10% of MCL cases were acquired in the Old World.Amongst GeoSentinel reporting sites, CL is predominantly a disease of tourists traveling mostly to countries in Central and South America such as Bolivia where risk of acquiring L. V. braziliensis and subsequent MCL is high. The finding that some travelers acquired leishmaniasis on trips of short duration challenges the common notion that CL is a disease of prolonged travel. Migrants from areas of conflict and political instability, such as Afghanistan and Syria, were well represented, suggesting that as mass migration of refugees continues, CL will be increasingly encountered in intake countries.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Given its high prevalence, the absence of FDA-approved drugs for NAFLD is noticeable. In the pathogenesis of NAFLD, it is well known that mitochondrial dysfunction arises as a result of changes in ETC complexes and the membrane potential (Δψm), as well as decreased ATP synthesis. Due to their fundamental role in energy metabolism and cell death decision, alterations in mitochondria are considered to be critical factors causing NAFLD. Reduced levels of β-oxidation, along with increased lipogenesis, result in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, and the subsequent production of reactive oxygen species and hepatocyte injury, which contribute to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis through the activations of Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells. Here, we review the latest findings describing the involvement of mitochondrial processes in the development of NAFLD and discuss the potential targets against which therapeutics for this disease can be developed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523414>n-3 PUFAs reduce tumor load and improve survival in a -tumor mouse model.</a></h2><p>With 9.1% of all cancer deaths, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has evolved into a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Herein, we investigated whether a dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation improves the outcome of progressive NAFLD.Feeding three high-fat diets, differing in n-3 and n-6 PUFA contents and ratios (n-3/n-6: 1:8, 1:1, 5:1), the impact of n-3 PUFAs and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios on NAFLD-related liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis was analyzed in 12- and 20-week-old streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-treated mice.Feeding of n-3 PUFA-rich diets (1:1 and 5:1) resulted in increased hepatic n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio with decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. In 20-week-old mice, n-3 PUFA-rich diets alleviated tumor load significantly, with reduced liver/body weight index, tumor size, and tumor number. Finally, these effects were accompanied by a significant improvement of survival of these mice.Herein, we showed that increased n-3 PUFA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios lead to improved survival and attenuated tumor progression in STZ/HFD-treated mice. Thus, n-3 PUFAs could be the basis for new therapeutic options against NAFLD-related tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633654>Evaluation of Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Early Phase Clinical Trials of Steatohepatitis in Adolescents.</a></h2><p>Early-phase pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) clinical trials are designed with non-invasive parameters to assess potential efficacy. Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole-liver MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven  undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD 2.9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change 2.7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with , fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small.

Functional studies on BECs often rely on isolations of an BEC cell population from healthy and/or injured livers. However, a consensus on the characterization of these cells has not yet been reached. The aim of this study was to compare the publicly available transcriptome profiles of human and mouse BECs and to establish gene signatures that can identify quiescent and activated human and mouse BECs.We used publicly available transcriptome data sets of human and mouse BECs, compared their profiles and analyzed co-expressed genes and pathways. By merging both human and mouse BEC-enriched genes, we obtained a quiescent and activation gene signature and tested them on BEC-like cells and different liver diseases using gene set enrichment analysis. In addition, we identified several genes from both gene signatures to identify BECs in a scRNA sequencing data set.Comparison of mouse BEC transcriptome data sets showed that the isolation method and array platform strongly influences their general profile, still most populations are highly enriched in most genes currently associated with BECs. Pathway analysis on human and mouse BECs revealed the KRAS signaling as a new potential pathway in BEC activation. We established a quiescent and activated BEC gene signature that can be used to identify BEC-like cells and detect BEC enrichment in alcoholic hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and peribiliary sclerotic livers. Finally, we identified a gene set that can distinguish BECs from other liver cells in mouse and human scRNAseq data.Through a meta-analysis of human and mouse BEC gene profiles we identified new potential pathways in BEC activation and created unique gene signatures for quiescent and activated BECs. These signatures and pathways will help in the further characterization of this progenitor cell type in mouse and human liver development and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), but there is scarcity of data for lean  subgroup.

BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second liver biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups.

In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean .© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.

However, the function of αSyn in T cells is poorly understood. We hypothesized that αSyn can affect CD4 T-cell proliferation and activity. We found that αSyn deficiency exacerbates disease progression in 8 weeks old C57BL6/J EAE-induced mice, and that αSyn-deficient CD4 T cells have increased pro-inflammatory response to myelin antigen relative to wild-type cells, as measured by cytokine secretion of interleukin IL-17 and interferon gamma. Furthermore, expression of αSyn on a background of αSyn knockout mitigates the inflammatory responses in CD4 T cells. We discovered that elevated levels of Nurr1, a transcription factor belonging to the orphan nuclear receptor family, are associated with the pro-inflammatory profile of αSyn-deficient CD4 T cells. In addition, we demonstrated that silencing of Nurr1 expression using an siRNA reduces IL-17 levels and increases the levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Study of αSyn-mediated cellular pathways in CD4 T cells may provide useful insights into the development of pro-inflammatory responses in immunity, providing future avenues for therapeutic intervention.© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521175>Variations in hepatic lipid species of age-matched male mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet and housed in different animal facilities.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a common disease and feeding mice a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a frequently used model to study its pathophysiology. Genetic and environmental factors influence  development and liver lipid content, which was studied herein using C57BL/6 J mice bred in two different animal facilities.Age-matched male C57BL/6 J mice bred in two different animal facilities (later on referred to as WT1 and WT2) at the University Hospital of Regensburg were fed identical MCD or control chows for 2 weeks. Hepatic gene and protein expression and lipid composition were determined. was associated with increased hepatic triglycerides, which were actually higher in WT1 than WT2 liver in both dietary groups. Cholesterol contributes to hepatic injury but was only elevated in WT2  liver. Ceramides account for insulin resistance and cell death, and ceramide species d18:1/16:0 and d18:1/18:0 were higher in the  liver of both groups. Saturated sphingomyelins only declined in WT1  liver. Lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations were quite normal in  and only one of the 12 altered phosphatidylcholine species declined in  liver of both groups. Very few phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol species were comparably regulated in  liver of both animal groups. Seven of these lipid species declined and two increased in . Notably, hepatic mRNA expression of proinflammatory (F4/80, CD68, IL-6, TNF and chemerin) and profibrotic genes (TGF beta and alpha SMA) was comparable in WT1 and WT2 mice.Mice housed and bred in different animal facilities had comparable disease severity of  whereas liver lipids varied among the groups. Thus, there was no specific lipid signature for  in the MCD model.</p></html>
