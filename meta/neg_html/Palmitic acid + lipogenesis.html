The common variant in the  gene,  (A/G), whose allele A is characterized by a reduced protein expression, has been associated with taste sensitivity to and preference for fat. We therefore aimed at evaluating whether the  polymorphism may influence fatty  metabolism and endocannabinoid biosynthesis in normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) subjects. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty  composition, and plasma endocannabinoid levels were determined. In NW subjects with AA genotype was found a marked reduction of RBC saturated fatty acids and /linoleic ratio (PA/LA), considered as   (DNL) biomarkers. Remarkably, to the reduction of DNL biomarkers corresponded an increase of omega-6 index, an indirect marker of the impact on fatty  metabolism of dietary omega-6 fatty acids, endocannabinoid levels and a higher waist/hip ratio. The presence of the G allele was instead associated with increased endocannabinoid plasma levels and a trend for increased waist/hip ratio in obese subjects, even though exhibited decreased BMI with respect to those with AA genotype. These data indicate that the  polymorphism, , leads to a distinct metabolic pattern in NW and in OB subjects. Therefore, their determination may be crucial in developing personalized therapeutic strategies for ameliorating dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208301>Trigonelline prevents high cholesterol and high fat diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and lipo-toxicity in C57BL/6J mice, via restoration of hepatic autophagy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is often linked with impaired hepatic autophagy. Here, we studied the alterations in hepatocellular autophagy by high cholesterol and high-fat diet (HC-HF) diet in C57BL/6J mice, and by  (PA), in AML-12 and HepG2 cells. Further, we analysed role of Trigonelline (TG), a plant alkaloid, in preventing NAFLD, by modulating autophagy. For this, C57BL/6J mice were fed with Standard Chow (SC) or HC-HF diet, with and without TG for 16 weeks. In-vitro; AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells, were exposed to PA with and without TG, for 24 h. Cellular events related to autophagy, , and lipo-toxicity were studied. The HC-HF diet fed mice showed hepatic autophagy blockade, increased triglycerides and steatosis. PA exposure to AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells induced impaired autophagy, ER stress, resulting in lipotoxicity. TG treatment in HC-HF fed mice, restored hepatic autophagy, and prevented steatosis. TG treated AML-12, and HepG2 cells exposed to PA showed autophagy restoration, and reduced lipotoxicity, however, these effects were diminished in Atg7-/- HepG2 cells, and in the presence of chloroquine. This study shows that HC-HF diet-induced impaired autophagy, and steatosis is prevented by TG, which attributes to its novel mechanism in treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of  (C16:0) or oleic  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with oleic  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic  and oleic  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo  fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Irisin is a recently identified adipomyokine with protective effects on metabolic homeostasis and inflammation-suppressing effects in hepatic and vascular cells. The present study examined the effects of irisin on lipid metabolism and inflammation in β cells under glucolipotoxic conditions.Rat INS-1E β cells and islets isolated from C57BL/6 mice were incubated in glucolipotoxic conditions with or without irisin. Intracellular lipid contents and lipogenic gene expression were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays and real-time PCR, respectively. Inflammatory status was evidenced by Western blot analysis for the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and real-time PCR analysis for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.Irisin reversed glucolipotoxicity-induced intracellular non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and triglyceride accumulation, suppressed associated elevations in lipogenic gene expression, and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) in INS-1E cells. These demonstrated effects were dependent on irisin-activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, AMPK signaling mediated the protective effects of irisin on INS-1E cell insulin secretory ability and survival as well. Additionally, irisin inhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 while decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Moreover, irisin also improved insulin secretion, inhibited apoptosis, and restored β-cell function-related gene expression in isolated mouse islets under glucolipotoxic conditions.Irisin attenuated excessive  in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic state through activation of AMPK. Irisin also suppressed overnutrition-induced inflammation in INS-1E cells. Our findings implicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of islet lipid metabolic disorder and islet inflammation in T2DM.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

For the purpose of exploring molecular pathways in NAFLD development and testing potential drug candidates, well-characterised experimental models of ectopic TAG storage in hepatocytes are needed.Using an optimised Oil Red O assay, immunoblotting and real-time qRT-PCR, we compared the capability of dietary monosaccharides and fatty acids to promote lipid accumulation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells.Both high glucose and high fructose resulted in intracellular lipid accumulation after 48 h, and this was further augmented (up to twofold, as compared to basal levels) by co-treatment with the -stimulating hormone insulin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. The fatty acids  and oleic  were even more effective than these carbohydrates, inducing significantly elevated TAG storage already after 24 h of treatment. Highest (about threefold) increases in lipid accumulation were observed upon treatment with oleic , alone as well as in combinations with  or with high glucose and insulin. Increases in protein levels of a major lipid droplet coat protein, perilipin-2 (PLIN2), mirrored intracellular lipid accumulation following different treatment regimens.Several treatment regimens of excessive fat and sugar supply promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, albeit with differences in the extent and rapidity of steatogenesis. PLIN2 is a candidate molecular marker of sustained lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21300801>Ncb5or deficiency increases fatty  catabolism and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>The endoplasmic reticulum-associated NADH cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (Ncb5or) is widely distributed in animal tissues. Ncb5or(-/-) mice develop diabetes at age 7 weeks and have increased susceptibility to the diabetogenic oxidant streptozotocin. Ncb5or deficiency also results in lipoatrophy and increased hepatocyte sensitivity to cytotoxic effects of saturated fatty acids. Here we investigate the mechanisms of these phenomena in prediabetic Ncb5or(-/-) mice and find that, despite increased rates of fatty  uptake and synthesis and higher stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) expression, Ncb5or(-/-) liver accumulates less triacylglycerol (TAG) than wild type (WT). Increased fatty  catabolism and oxidative stress are evident in Ncb5or(-/-) hepatocytes and reflect increased mitochondrial content, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression, fatty  oxidation rates, oxidative stress response gene expression, and oxidized glutathione content. Ncb5or(-/-) hepatocytes readily incorporate exogenous fatty acids into TAG but accumulate more free fatty acids (FFA) and have greater palmitate-induced oxidative stress responses and cell death than WT, all of which are alleviated by co-incubation with oleate via TAG channeling. A high fat diet rich in palmitate and oleate stimulates both  and fatty  catabolism in Ncb5or(-/-) liver, resulting in TAG levels similar to WT but increased intracellular FFA accumulation. Hepatic SCD-specific activity is lower in Ncb5or(-/-) than in WT mice, although Ncb5or(-/-) liver has a greater increase in Scd1 mRNA and protein levels. Together, these findings suggest that increased FFA accumulation and catabolism and oxidative stress are major consequences of Ncb5or deficiency in liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22300160>Subcutaneous adipose tissue fatty  desaturation in adults with and without rare adipose disorders.</a></h2><p>Elevated stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity has been described in obese states, with an increased desaturation index (DI) suggesting enhanced . Differences in the DI among various phenotypes of abnormal adiposity have not been studied. Abnormal accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue occurs in rare adipose disorders (RADs) including Dercum's disease (DD), multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), and familial multiple lipomatosis (FML). Examining the DI in subcutaneous fat of people with DD, MSL and FML may provide information on adipose tissue fatty  metabolism in these disorders. The aims of this pilot study were: 1) to determine if differences in adipose tissue DIs are present among RADs, and 2) to determine if the DIs correlate to clinical or biochemical parameters.Subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from human participants with DD (n = 6), MSL (n = 5), FML (n = 8) and obese Controls (n = 6). Fatty  composition was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The DIs (palmitoleic/, oleic/stearic, vaccenic/stearic ratios) were calculated from the gas chromatogram peak intensities. SCD1 gene expression was determined. Spearman's correlations between the DIs and available clinical or biochemical data were performed.In DD subjects, the vaccenic/stearic index was lower (p < 0.05) in comparison to Controls. Percent of total of the saturated fatty  myristic  was higher in DD compared with Controls and FML. Percent of monounsaturated vaccenic  in DD trended lower when compared with Controls, and was decreased in comparison to FML. In MSL, total percent of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower than in the Control group (p < 0.05). In the total cohort of subjects, the palmitoleic/ and oleic/stearic DIs positively correlated with age, BMI, and percent body fat.The positive associations between the DIs and measures of adiposity (BMI and percent body fat) support increased desaturase activity in obesity. The lower vaccenic/stearic DI in DD SAT compared with Controls suggests presence of other factors involved in fat accumulation in addition to lifestyle. Other mechanisms driving fat accumulation in DD such as inflammation or lymphatic dysfunction should be investigated.© 2012 Yee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29169220>Fermented Soymilk Alleviates Lipid Accumulation by Inhibition of SREBP-1 and Activation of NRF-2 in the Hepatocellular Steatosis Model.</a></h2><p>Ingredients of soy and fermented soy products have been widely utilized as food supplements for health-enhancing properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fermented soymilk (FSM) and soymilk (SM) on free fatty -induced lipogenesis in the hepatocellular steatosis model. HepG2 cells were incubated with  (PA) for 24 h to induce lipogenesis and accumulation of intracellular lipid contents. The PA-treated cells were co-incubated with FSM, SM, genistein, and estrogen, respectively. Lipid accumulation in the PA-treated HpG2 cells was significantly decreased by co-incubation with FSM. Treatment of HepG2 cells with PA combined with genistein or estrogen significantly increased the expression of SREBP-1. However, FSM co-incubation significantly attenuated SREBP-1 expression in the PA-treated HepG2 cells; in addition, expression of NRF-2 and phosphorylation of ERK were significantly increased in the PA and FSM co-incubated cells. PA-induced ROS production was significantly reduced by FSM and SM. Our results suggested that the bioactive components of FSM could protect hepatocytes against the lipid accumulation and ROS production induced by free fatty acids. These effects may be mediated by the inhibition of SREBP-1 and the activation of NRF-2 via the ERK pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158770>Does the enterolactone (ENL) affect fatty  transporters and lipid metabolism in liver?</a></h2><p>NAFLD as a result of inappropriate diet and obesity, may progress to sever conditions such as: type 2 diabetes mellitus or steatohepatitis, and has recently become a prevalent topic of numerous investigations. Due to its dangerous aftermaths, finding new substances, such as polyphenols and their derivatives, which might reduce liver steatosis is the main target of research into NAFLD treatment. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect(s) of enterolactone (ENL), a metabolite of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), on lipid metabolism together with changes in the expression of fatty  transporters in fatty liver.The experiments were conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with either ENL and/or  during 16 h exposure. The expression of selected fatty  transport proteins: FATP2, FATP5, CD36, FABPpm, ABCA1, MTP, ACBP and L-FABP, as well as the proteins directly involved in lipogenesis (FAS), oxidation pathway (CPT 1), and lipid metabolism (PPARα, LXR, SREBP1c, pAMPK) was estimated by Western Blot. Intra and extracellular lipid contents were assessed by Gas-Liquid Chromatography. The data was analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and results were considered to be statistically significant at  ≤ 0.05.ENL stimulated extracellular efflux of free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglicerols (TAG) to the medium, while, it had no influence on FATP-family mediated intracellular fatty  uptake. Moreover, ENL decreased the expression of CPT 1, pAMPK, PPARα, increased SREBP1c and had no effect on LXR, and FAS content.The findings of our study demonstrate that ENL had opposite effect on liver steatosis in comparison with other polyphenols what suggests that it may be an inactive metabolite. ENL did not affect significantly the intracellular accumulation of FFA, DAG and TAG, yet it promoted their extracellular efflux. Furthermore, it inhibited ß-oxydation and intracellular lipid metabolism what may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069585>Absence of Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein in Adipocytes Causes Systemic Insulin Resistance and Impairs Glucose Transport.</a></h2><p>Lower adipose-ChREBP and de novo  (DNL) are associated with insulin resistance in humans. Here, we generated adipose-specific ChREBP knockout (AdChREBP KO) mice with negligible sucrose-induced DNL in adipose tissue (AT). Chow-fed AdChREBP KO mice are insulin resistant with impaired insulin action in the liver, muscle, and AT and increased AT inflammation. HFD-fed AdChREBP KO mice are also more insulin resistant than controls. Surprisingly, adipocytes lacking ChREBP display a cell-autonomous reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport that is mediated by impaired Glut4 translocation and exocytosis, not lower Glut4 levels. AdChREBP KO mice have lower levels of  esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) in serum, and AT. 9-PAHSA supplementation completely rescues their insulin resistance and AT inflammation. 9-PAHSA also normalizes impaired glucose transport and Glut4 exocytosis in ChREBP KO adipocytes. Thus, loss of adipose-ChREBP is sufficient to cause insulin resistance, potentially by regulating AT glucose transport and flux through specific lipogenic pathways.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Transcription of the FAS gene is controlled synergistically by the transcription factors ChREBP (carbohydrate response element-binding protein), which is induced by glucose, and SREBP-1 (sterol response element-binding protein-1), which is stimulated by insulin through the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway. We investigated whether the genetic variability of the genes encoding for ChREBP, SREBP and FAS (respectively, MLXIPL, SREBF1 and FASN) is related to breast cancer risk and body-mass index (BMI) by studying 1,294 breast cancer cases and 2,452 controls from the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer (EPIC). We resequenced the FAS gene and combined information of SNPs found by resequencing and SNPs from public databases. Using a tagging approach and selecting 20 SNPs, we covered all the common genetic variation of these genes. In this study we were not able to find any statistically significant association between the SNPs in the FAS, ChREBP and SREPB-1 genes and an increased risk of breast cancer overall and by subgroups of age, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use or BMI. On the other hand, we found that two SNPs in FASN were associated with BMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470518>Beyond the Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Direct Effect of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles in Reducing Fatty Acids Content in an In Vitro Model of Hepatocellular Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic accumulation of lipids. Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to oleic and . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with oleic and  increased  and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced  and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29573267>Dietary Fatty Acids Differentially Regulate Secretion of Adiponectin and Interleukin-6 in Primary Canine Adipose Tissue Culture.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on canine adipose tissue secretion of adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Subcutaneous and omental visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 16 healthy intact female dogs. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocyte cultures, and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in undifferentiated stromovascular cell (SVC) cultures following treatment with eicosapentaenic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), arachidonic  (ARA, 20:4n-6), or  (PAM, 16:0) at 25, 50, or 100 μM. Secretion of adiponectin from mature adipocytes was higher (p < 0.001) following EPA treatment at 50 μM compared to control in subcutaneous tissue, and higher following EPA treatment compared to PAM treatment at 25 μM in both subcutaneous (p < 0.001) and visceral tissues (p = 0.010). Secretion of IL6 from SVC derived from subcutaneous tissue was lower following EPA treatment and higher following PAM treatment compared to control both at 50 μM (p = 0.001 and p = 0.041, respectively) and 100 μM (p = 0.013 and p < 0.001, respectively). These findings of stimulation of adiponectin secretion and inhibition of IL6 secretion by EPA, and stimulation of IL6 secretion by PAM, are consistent with findings of increased circulating concentrations of adiponectin and decreased circulating concentration of IL6 in dogs supplemented with dietary fish oil, and show that the effect of fish oil on circulating concentrations of adiponectin and IL6 is, at least partially, the result of local effects of EPA and PAM on adipose tissue.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29254285>Picroside II attenuates fatty  accumulation in HepG2 cells via modulation of fatty  uptake and synthesis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic steatosis is caused by an imbalance between free fatty acids (FFAs) uptake, utilization, storage, and disposal.

The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis.

It has been demonstrated that general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is required to maintain hepatic fatty  homeostasis under conditions of amino  deprivation. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of NAFLD has not been investigated. In this study, we used Gcn2 mice to investigate the effect of GCN2 on high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. After HFD feeding for 12 weeks, Gcn2 mice were less obese than wild-type (WT) mice, and Gcn2 significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver dysfunction, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. In the livers of the HFD-fed mice, GCN2 deficiency resulted in higher levels of lipolysis genes, lower expression of genes related to FA synthesis, transport and , and less induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, -induced steatosis, oxidative & ER stress, and changes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS) and metallothionein (MT) expression in HepG2 cells.

However, its role in hepatic  and chronic low-grade inflammation leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine whether JAZF1 overexpression in vivo or in vitro can protect against  (PA)-induced and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced systemic inflammatory responses, and the potential mechanism of this process. JAZF1 overexpression vector was transfected into PA-treated IAR-20 hepatocytes. The mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines were measured by real-time quantitative PCR, and stress-activated protein kinase activities were measured by immunoblotting. For in vivo studies, JAZF1 transgenic mice were fed an HFD for 12 weeks. Liver tissue was obtained for histological examination, real-time RT-PCR, and western blot analysis. PA significantly increased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-8 mRNA in IAR-20 hepatocytes in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Treatment with JAZF1 or stress-activated protein kinase inhibitors inhibited PA-induced tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interleukin-8 expression in these cells. In JAZF1-treated cells, the decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines was accompanied by decreased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation and increased nuclear factor-κB inhibitor-α protein levels, similarly to the role of signaling inhibitors. In vivo, HFD-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines was markedly attenuated in JAZF1-Tg mice as compared with controls. This attenuation was accompanied by decreased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-κB. These data provide evidence for the important role of JAZF1 in preventing  and systemic inflammation-related disease.© 2014 FEBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113297>Hepatic TLR4 signaling in obese NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurs frequently in the setting of metabolic syndrome, but the factors leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not fully understood. This study investigated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in human liver with the goal of delineating whether activation of this pathway segregates those with nonalcoholic fatty liver from those with NASH. Experiments were performed using liver biopsy tissue obtained from class III obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery, and extended to an immortalized human hepatocyte HepaRG cell line and primary human hepatocytes. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and total free fatty  levels were significantly increased in plasma of NASH patients. TLR4 mRNA levels were significantly increased in subjects with NASH compared with NAFL as was interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 in the myeloid differentiation factor 88-independent signaling pathway. In HepaRG cells, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and functional activity increased following treatment with the fatty , palmitate, and following exposure to LPS compared with hepatocytes stimulated with a lipogenic treatment that induced de novo . Palmitate and LPS induction of NF-κB activity was partially attenuated by chemical- or small-interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of TLR4. Expression of TLR4 and its downstream mediators was upregulated with palmitate and LPS. Similar results were observed using primary human hepatocytes from a lean donor. Interestingly, NF-κB activity assays showed obese donor hepatocytes were resistant to chemical TLR4 inhibition. In conclusion, TLR4 expression is upregulated in a large cohort of NASH patients, compared with those with NAFL, and this occurs within the setting of increased LPS and fatty acids.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24376543>De novo  and cholesterol synthesis in humans with long-standing type 1 diabetes are comparable to non-diabetic individuals.</a></h2><p>Synthesis of lipid species, including fatty acids (FA) and cholesterol, can contribute to pathological disease.

We aimed to characterize the fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), namely  hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs)-endogenous lipids with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, in human breast milk. Breast milk samples from 30 lean (BMI=19-23) and 23 obese (BMI>30) women were collected 72h postpartum. Adipose tissue and milk samples were harvested from C57BL/6J mice. FAHFA lipid profiles were measured using reverse phase and chiral liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. PAHSA regioisomers as well as other FAHFAs were present in both human and murine milk. Unexpectedly, the levels of 5-PAHSA were higher relative to other regioisomers. The separation of both regioisomers and enantiomers of PAHSAs revealed that both R- and S-enantiomers were present in the biological samples, and that the majority of the 5-PAHSA signal is of R configuration. Total PAHSA levels were positively associated with weight gain during pregnancy, and 5-PAHSA as well as total PAHSA levels were significantly lower in the milk of the obese compared to the lean mothers. Our results document for the first time the presence of lipid mediators from the FAHFA family in breast milk, while giving an insight into the stereochemistry of PAHSAs. They also indicate the negative effect of obesity on 5-PAHSA levels. Future studies will be needed to explore the role and mechanism of action of FAHFAs in breast milk.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is accompanied by excessive hepatic  via liver X receptor α (LXRα). Thus we examined the pathophysiological role of PRMTs in NAFLD and their relationship with LXRα. In this study,  (PA) treatment increased PRMT3, which is correlated with the elevation of hepatic lipogenic proteins. The expression of lipogenic proteins was increased by PRMT3 overexpression, but decreased by PRMT3 silencing and use of the PRMT3 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. PRMT3 also increased the transcriptional activity of LXRα by directly binding with LXRα in a methylation-independent manner. In addition, PA treatment translocated PRMT3 to the nucleus. In animal models, a high-fat diet increased the LXRα and PRMT3 expressions and binding, which was not observed in LXRα KO mice. Furthermore, increased PRMT3 expression and its binding with LXRα were observed in NAFLD patients. Taken together, LXRα and PRMT3 expression was increased in cellular and mouse models of NAFLD and human patients, and PRMT3 translocated into the nucleus bound with LXRα as a transcriptional cofactor, which induced . In conclusion, PRMT3 translocation by PA is coupled to the binding of LXRα, which is responsible for the onset of fatty liver.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

NLRP3 inflammasome activation is an essential player in aging-related chronic diseases like osteoporosis, particularly due to the causal caspase-1 activation and its correlation to adipose accumulation in bone tissue. Moreover, the expression of anti-aging/senescence SIRT1 was reported to decline along with aging. As the major cellular contributor of bone formation, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells processing mutually exclusive differentiatability toward osteocytes or adipocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that NLRP3 inflammasome activation promotes  and repress osteogenesis in MSCs via inhibiting SIRT1 expression. We activated NLRP3 inflammasome in human MSCs via lipopolysaccharide and  (LPS/PA) treatment for self-renewal maintenance, adipogenic differentiation or osteogenic differentiation. LPS/PA treatment significantly increased NLRP3 expression, decreased SIRT1 expression and promoted caspase-1 activity in MSCs. LPS/PA treatment also boosted  of MSCs and suppressed osteogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of caspase-1 activity repressed adipogenic differentiation and partially improved osteogenic differentiation of MSCs with LPS/PA treatment. Our study demonstrated the pivotal roles of NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream mediator caspase-1 for the progress of osteo-differentiation MSCs, and offered novel therapeutic target of treatment for osteoporosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, therapeutic options are poor and the long-term burden to society is constantly increasing. Previously, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP)-a serum protein mainly secreted by liver-was shown to inhibit oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)/lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation in mouse macrophages. Additionally, MSP could reduce  (PA)-induced lipid accumulation and  in the HepG2 cell line. Altogether, these data suggest MSP as a suppressor for metabolic inflammation. However, so far the potential of MSP to be used as a treatment for NASH was not investigated. We hypothesized that MSP reduces lipid accumulation and hepatic inflammation. To investigate the effects of MSP in the early stage of NASH, low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr-/-) mice were fed either a regular chow or a high fat, high cholesterol (HFC) diet for 7 days. Recombinant MSP or saline (control) was administrated to the mice by utilizing subcutaneously-implanted osmotic mini-pumps for the last 4 days. As expected, mice fed an HFC diet showed increased plasma and hepatic lipid accumulation, as well as enhanced hepatic inflammation, compared with chow-fed controls. Upon MSP administration, the rise in cholesterol and triglyceride levels after an HFC diet remained unaltered. Surprisingly, while hepatic macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was similar between the groups, MSP-treated mice showed increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators in the liver, compared with saline-treated controls. Contrary to our expectations, MSP did not ameliorate NASH. Observed changes in inflammatory gene expression suggest that further research is needed to clarify the long-term effects of MSP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631603>Heat shock protein 70 promotes  in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has followed the international rise in obesity rates. Multiple mechanisms are involved in NAFLD, including endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which is abundant in most organisms, is sensitive to stress. However, the role of HSP70 in NAFLD has not been investigated. Here, we investigated the possible role of HSP70 in lipid synthesis.C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet, and HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  (PA). HSP70 expression was detected by qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After Hsp70 overexpression and knockdown, TC and TG levels and FAS, SCD, and ACC expression were detected.HSP70 expression was significantly increased in the livers of obese mice. In vitro, HSP70 expression was markedly induced by PA in HepG2 cells. Notably, HSP70 overexpression in HepG2 cells enhanced TC and TG synthesis, in parallel with the upregulation of lipogenic genes, including FAS, SCD and ACC. By contrast, HSP70 knockdown decreased the levels of cellular lipids and the expression of FAS, SCD, and ACC in HepG2 cells. Together, our results suggest that HSP70 may promote  in HepG2 cells.Heat shock protein 70 promotes  in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160717>SIRT3 promotes lipophagy and chaperon-mediated autophagy to protect hepatocytes against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Lipophagy is a lysosomal lipolytic pathway that complements the actions of cytosolic neutral lipases. Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O ( and oleic  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress . In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21184748>Soraphen A, an inhibitor of acetyl CoA carboxylase activity, interferes with fatty  elongation.</a></h2><p>Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC1 and ACC2) generates malonyl CoA, a substrate for de novo  (DNL) and an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation (FAO). Malonyl CoA is also a substrate for microsomal fatty  elongation, an important pathway for saturated (SFA), mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) synthesis. Despite the interest in ACC as a target for obesity and cancer therapy, little attention has been given to the role ACC plays in long chain fatty  synthesis. This report examines the effect of pharmacological inhibition of ACC on DNL and palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2, n-6) metabolism in HepG2 and LnCap cells. The ACC inhibitor, soraphen A, lowers cellular malonyl CoA, attenuates DNL and the formation of fatty  elongation products derived from exogenous fatty acids, i.e., 16:0 and 18:2, n-6; IC(50)∼5nM. Elevated expression of fatty  elongases (Elovl5, Elovl6) or desaturases (FADS1, FADS2) failed to override the soraphen A effect on SFA, MUFA or PUFA synthesis. Inhibition of fatty  elongation leads to the accumulation of 16- and 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids derived from 16:0 and 18:2, n-6, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition of ACC activity will not only attenuate DNL and induce FAO, but will also attenuate the synthesis of very long chain saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We recently showed that ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells produce significantly high amounts of fats, because of overexpression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma-binding protein and the nuclear receptor NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1; Rev-erbalpha). These genes upregulate de novo fatty  synthesis, which is a critical pathway for the energy production and survival of these cells. NR1D1 and PPARgamma-binding protein are functionally related to PPARgamma, a well established positive regulator of  and lipid storage.The effects of GW9662 and exogenously added palmitate on breast cells (BT474, MDA-MB-361, MCF-7, and human mammary epithelial cells) in monolayer culture were assessed. Mass spectrometric quantitation of fatty acids and fluorescence-based high content microscopy assays of cell growth, apoptosis, triglyceride storage and reactive oxygen species production were used.ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells are more sensitive to inhibition of PPARgamma activity by the antagonist GW9662. PPARgamma inhibition results in increased levels of total fats in the cells, mostly because of increased amounts of  and stearic unsaturated acids. Administration of exogenous palmitate is lethal to ERBB2-positive but not to ERBB2-negative cells. GW9662 exacerbates the effects of palmitate addition on BT474 and MDA-MB-361 cells, but it has no significant effect on MCF-7 and human mammary epithelial cells. Palmitate administration results in a fivefold to tenfold greater increase in fat stores in ERBB2-negative cells compared with ERBB2-positive cells, which suggests that the ERBB2-positive cells have maximized their ability to store fats and that additional palmitate is toxic to these cells. Both PPARgamma inhibition and palmitate administration result in increased reactive oxygen species production in BT474 cells. The cell death that results from this treatment can be counteracted by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine.Our findings indicate that PPARgamma activity enables ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells, which produce high levels of fat, to convert fatty acids to triglycerides, allowing these cells to avert the cell death that results from lipotoxicity. Endogenous palmitate toxicity represents a genetically based property of ERBB2-positive breast cancer that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058170>PAM, OLA, and LNA are Differentially Taken Up and Trafficked Via Different Metabolic Pathways in Porcine Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids have different effects on fat deposition in pigs. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of this difference, we compared the metabolism of  (PAM, saturated), oleic (OLA, monounsaturated) and linoleic  (LNA, polyunsaturated) in porcine adipocytes treated with 100 μM PAM, OLA or LNA. We observed that the adipocytes incubated with LNA accumulated more lipids compared with those treated with PAM and OLA. We then probed the metabolism of these fatty acids in porcine adipocytes by using isotope-labelled fatty acids. The results showed that 42% of the [1-C] LNA, 34% of the [1-C] PAM and 28% of the [1-C] OLA were recovered in the cellular lipids. The gene expression analyses showed that LNA significantly increased the expression of - and oxidation-related genes including PPARγ, C/EBPα, ap2 and NRF1. In addition, the cells incubated with LNA showed a decreased Ser phosphorylation in PPARγ compared to those incubated with PAM and OLA. Furthermore, when PPARγ Ser phosphorylation was inhibited, no significant difference in the triacylglycerol contents in the adipocytes was observed. These results showed the dietary fatty acids had different metabolism pathways in porcine adipocytes, and LNA significantly promoted lipid accumulation, probably by regulating PPARγ phosphorylation in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931237>Adipogenic/lipogenic gene expression and fatty  composition in chuck, loin, and round muscles in response to grain feeding of Yanbian Yellow cattle.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that gene expression and fatty  composition would differ among different muscle depots and over time on a grain-based finishing diet. Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular lipid (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of oleic  (18:1n-9), linoleic  (18:2n-6), and α-linolenic  (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty - binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty  synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666198>High Glucose Concentration Impairs 5-PAHSA Activity by Inhibiting AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Activation and Promoting Nuclear Factor-Kappa-B-Mediated Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Recently, the endogenous fatty  -5-hydroxystearic  (5-PAHSA) was found to increase insulin sensitivity and have anti-inflammatory effects in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes. However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced  and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) mediated inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19536518>Synthesis of specific fatty acids contributes to VLDL-triacylglycerol composition in humans with and without type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>It is recommended that patients with diabetes reduce their intake of saturated fat and increase their intake of monounsaturated fat or carbohydrate. However, high-carbohydrate diets may result in higher saturated fatty acids in VLDL-triacylglycerol. This is attributed to de novo , although synthesis of specific fatty acids is rarely measured. The objective of this study was to examine the contribution of de novo fatty  synthesis to VLDL-triacylglycerol composition. It was hypothesised that levels of total and de novo synthesised fatty acids would increase with increased carbohydrate intake in diabetic participants.Seven individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and seven matched non-diabetic controls consumed two diets differing in fat energy (lower fat <25%, higher fat >35%) for 3 days in a randomised crossover design. Blood samples were drawn before and 24 h after the ingestion of (2)H-labelled water.In the control participants, the higher-fat diet resulted in a 40% reduction in VLDL-triacylglycerol fatty acids because of decreases in myristic, , palmitoleic and linoleic acids, but the opposite trend occurred in participants with diabetes. The lower-fat diet increased the fractional synthesis rate by 35% and 25% in the control and diabetes participants, respectively (range: 0-33%). Palmitate accounted for 71% of fatty acids synthesised (range: 44-84% total de novo synthesised fatty acids).(2)H incorporation was used for the first time in humans showing variability in the synthesis rate of specific fatty acids, even . A lower-fat diet stimulated saturated fatty  synthesis at high rates, but no net stimulation of synthesis of any fatty  occurred in the diabetes group. The implications of this finding for our understanding of lipid metabolism in diabetes require further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27689828>Metabolic Fate of Branched-Chain Amino Acids During , in Adipocytes From Obese Mice and C2C12 Myotubes.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain amino  (BCAA) catabolism is regulated by the branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT2) and the branched-chain α-keto  dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH). BCAT2 and BCKDH expression and activity are modified during  and altered in adipose tissues of mice with genetic or diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about how these modifications and alterations affect the intracellular metabolic fate of BCAAs during , in adipocytes from mice fed a control or high-fat diet or in C2C12 myotubes. Here, we demonstrate that BCAAs are mainly incorporated into proteins during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation. However, they are oxidized and incorporated into lipids during the late days of differentiation. Conversely, 92% and 97% of BCAA were oxidized, 1.6% and 6% were used for protein synthesis and 1.2% and 1.5% were incorporated into lipids in adipocytes from epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively. All three pathways were decreased in adipocytes from mice fed a high-fat diet. In C2C12 myotubes, leucine is mainly used for protein synthesis and palmitate is incorporated into lipids. Interestingly, leucine decreased both palmitate oxidation and its incorporation to lipids and proteins; and palmitate increased leucine oxidation and decreased its incorporation to lipids and proteins in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that BCAA metabolic fate differs between the early and late stages of adipocyte differentiation and in adipocytes from mice fed a control or high-fat diet; and that leucine affects the metabolic fate of palmitate and vice versa in C2C12 myotubes.

However, the role and molecular mechanism of IGFBP-7 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely unknown. Therefore, the potential function of IGFBP7 in the pathological progression of NAFLD was explored in this investigation. For in vivo experiments, an animal model of NAFLD was established in C57BL/6 mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD), and IGFBP7 was knocked down by injecting adeno-associated adenovirus (AAV)-mediated short-hairpin (sh)-IGFBP7 into the liver. We found that AAV-sh-IGFBP7 treatment significantly alleviated hepatocyte injury and inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation by reducing -associated gene expression. Furthermore, downregulation of IGFBP7 markedly ameliorated IR and restored impaired insulin signalling by elevating the phosphorylation levels of IRS-1, Akt and GSK3β in HFD-treated mice. Similar results were also confirmed by an in vitro study in a  (PA)-stimulated HepG2 cell model. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that IGFBP7 contributes to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD development, which might serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727953>Fatty  Composition of Plasma Phosphatidylcholine Determines Body Fat Parameters in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome-Related Traits.</a></h2><p>This study examines the associations of fatty acids (FAs) in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) with the anthropometrical and biochemical characteristic of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits.We analyzed the FA profiles of PC in 300 persons with MetS-related traits (152 M/148F, mean age 46.9 ± 9.0 years) and in 70 healthy controls of the same age using a balanced men/women ratio and gas-liquid chromatography. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the coefficients of determination (R) using FA proportions of the mentioned proband characteristics.The FA composition of PC in patients with MetS traits was only associated with waist circumference (R = 0.27), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; R = 0.41), body fat percentage (R = 0.62), and fat mass (R = 0.29).

Twenty-eight Angus steers were assigned randomly to 3 groups of 9 or 10 steers and fed a basal diet without additional fat (control), with 3% palm oil (rich in ), or with 3% soybean oil (rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids), for 10 wk, top-dressed daily. Palm oil had no effect (P > 0.05) on ADG, food intake, or G:F, whereas soybean oil depressed ADG (P = 0.02), food intake (P = 0.04), and G:F (P = 0.05). Marbling scores tended (P = 0.09) to be greater in palm oil-fed steers (Modest(09)) than in soybean oil-fed steers (Small(55)). Subcutaneous adipocyte mean volume was greater in palm oil-fed steers (515.9 pL) than in soybean-supplemented cattle (395.6 pL; P = 0.01). Similarly, glucose and acetate incorporation into total lipids in vitro was greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue of palm oil-fed steers (119.9 and 242.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively) than adipose tissue of soybean oil-fed steers in (48.9 and 95.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively).

In a second experiment, pullets were fed a daily 15 mg dose of U-C-glucose beginning 2 wk prior to sexual maturity through the end of the experimental period. A 50 mg meal of U-C-linoleic  was orally administered approximately 10 d prior to sexual maturity (defined as first egg) representing body linoleic . Upon each hen's first egg, each bird received a 25 mg meal of D-linoleic  representing dietary linoleic . All eggs were collected for the next 10 days. The incorporation of labeled linoleic  and  in egg yolk was then determined using GC-MS. This process was repeated at peak production and at 45 wk of age. At sexual maturity, the deposition of labeled  in the yolk was higher compared with its deposition at peak production and 45 wk of age. The deposition of both C- and D-linoleic  increased with hen age. These results suggest that dietary and tissue linoleic  is utilized to a greater extent in older hens and that  (synthesis of ) plays a larger role at sexual maturity in the young hen.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365116>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep.

Supplementation of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  during late gestation alters the fatty  profile of plasma, colostrum, milk and adipose tissue, and increases lipogenic gene expression of adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) to establish whether feeding a source of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to ewes during late gestation changes the fatty  profile of colostrum, milk, ewe adipose tissue, and plasma and subsequently lamb plasma and red blood cells (RBC), and 2) to investigate the effects of EPA and DHA on mRNA expression in ewe adipose tissue. Eighty-four gestating ewes (28 pens, three per pen) were blocked by lambing day and assigned to a diet with an addition of fat at 0.39% of the DM during the last 50 d of gestation using Ca salts of a palm fatty  distillate (PFAD) high in  and oleic acids or EPA + DHA. Blood samples were taken from ewes on days 20, 1 (parturition), and 30 and from lambs on days 1 and 30 for plasma fatty  analysis. Fatty analysis of lamb RBC was performed on day 1. Colostrum samples were taken at lambing and milk samples on day 30 for fatty  analysis. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken from one ewe per pen on day 20 for fatty  analysis and gene expression analysis of 27 genes. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.10) were observed for several isomers of C18:1, with concentrations that were greater in plasma of EPA + DHA ewes on day 20, but were not different on day 1 or 30. Plasma concentrations of EPA tended to be greater (P = 0.07), whereas DHA was greater (P < 0.001) in EPA + DHA ewes compared with PFAD ewes. There was no difference in EPA or DHA in adipose tissue with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation (P > 0.10). Concentrations of fatty acids with 6 to 10 carbons were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in colostrum and milk of EPA + DHA ewes. There was a treatment × day interaction with EPA + DHA ewes yielding greater EPA (P = 0.03) and DHA (P = 0.04) concentrations than PFAD in colostrum, but not in milk. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.05) were observed for several C18:1 isomers with concentrations that were greater in EPA + DHA ewe colostrum, but were not different between treatments in milk. In lamb plasma and RBC, EPA and DHA were not different between treatments (P > 0.10). The expression of fatty  synthase and leptin was significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 tended to be increased (P = 0.08) by supplementation of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD. These results suggest that supplementation with EPA and DHA to ewes during late gestation alters the fatty  profile of plasma, colostrum, and milk and may increase .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22023262>Adipocytes differentiated in vitro from rat mesenchymal stem cells lack essential free fatty acids compared to adult adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can be differentiated in vitro to become adipocyte-like cells with lipid vacuoles, similar to adipocytes derived from adult adipose tissue. Little is known regarding the composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) of the in vitro-differentiated adipocytes, or whether it resembles that of native adult adipocytes. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify FFA species in BMSC-derived adipocytes and compared them with FFAs found in adipocytes derived from adult adipose tissue. We found that adult adipocytes contained significant percentages of saturated and monounsaturated FFAs, including  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0), and oleic  (C18:1); some polyunsaturated FFAs, such as linoleic  (C18:2), a small percentage of arachidonic  (C20:4), and very little linolenic  (C18:3). In comparison, 80%-90% confluent BMSCs contained comparable percentages of  and oleic acids, significantly more arachidonic and stearic acids, very little linoleic , and no linolenic . After differentiation, compared with adult adipocytes, BMSC-derived adipocytes contained a comparable percentage of , more stearic and arachidonic acids, less oleic , almost no linoleic , and no detectable linolenic . This composition was quite similar to that of undifferentiated BMSCs. The differentiation medium contained only  and stearic acids, with traces of oleic ; it did not contain the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the composition of FFAs in BMSC-derived adipocytes was altered compared with adult adipocytes.

The two enzymes, DGAT1 [DAG (diacylglycerol) acyltransferase 1] and DGAT2 (DAG acyltransferase 2), involved in this process are synthesized on rough ER and localized in the ER near a monolayer surrounding entities like lipid bodies. After reaching the appropriate size, newly formed lipid bodies transform into mature spherical lipid bodies filled with less osmiophilic content. They appear to be surrounded by a half-unit membrane, with numerous microtubules running adjacently in different directions. The ER, no longer continuous with lipid bodies, makes contact with them through microtubules. At this stage, lipid synthesis takes place at the periphery of lipid bodies. This presumption, and a hypothesis that microtubules are involved in lipid synthesis delivering necessary components to lipid bodies, is based on strong arguments: (i) silver grains first appear over microtubules after a short [3H] incubation and before they are observed over lipid bodies; (ii) blockade of [3H] incorporation into lipotubuloids by propyzamide, an inhibitor of microtubule function; and (iii) the presence of gold grains above the microtubules after DGAT1 and DGAT2 reactions, as also near microtubules after an immunogold method that identifies phospholipase D1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25724108> induces central leptin resistance and impairs hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in male mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of diets rich in saturated fat largely contributes to the development of obesity in modern societies. A diet high in saturated fats can induce inflammation and impair leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. However, the role of saturated fatty acids on hypothalamic leptin signaling, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism remains largely undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of a saturated fatty ,  (PA, C16:0), on central leptin sensitivity, hypothalamic leptin signaling, inflammatory molecules and hepatic energy metabolism in C57BL/6J male mice. We found that the icv administration of PA led to central leptin resistance, evidenced by the inhibition of central leptin's suppression of food intake. Central leptin resistance was concomitant with impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling (JAK2-STAT3, PKB/Akt-FOXO1) and a pro-inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and pIκBa) in the mediobasal hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the pre-administration of icv PA blunted the effect of leptin-induced decreases in mRNA expression related to gluconeogenesis (G6Pase and PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2) and  (FAS and SCD1) in the liver of mice. Therefore, elevated central PA concentrations can induce pro-inflammatory responses and leptin resistance, which are associated with disorders of energy homeostasis in the liver as a result of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of targeting common pathological metabolism to inhibit the progression of malignant and proliferative diseases.Gefitinib-resistant (G-R) nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were studied as conditions representative of malignant and proliferative diseases, respectively. Strong lipogenic activity and high expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) were found in both G-R NSCLC cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients (RASFs). Berberine (BBR), an effective suppressor of SREBP1 and  regulated through reactive oxygen species (ROS)/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the growth of G-R NSCLC cells and RASFs but not that of normal cells. It effectively caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated ROS/AMPK pathway, and finally suppressed cellular  and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, AMPK inhibitor, and  significantly reduced the effect of BBR. In an in vivo study, treatment of BBR led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor xenograft growth and remarkably slowed down the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Innovation and Conclusion: Targeting ROS/AMPK/ signaling pathway selectively inhibited the growth of G-R NSCLC cells and the progress of RASFs in vitro and in vivo, which provides a new avenue for treating malignancies and proliferative diseases.

The objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the associations between milk fat content of de novo FA, with (1) diet composition, and (2) milk production and composition. Milk FA data from 96 peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2016 that included 324 treatment means from 83 bovine experiments, 36 treatment means from 12 caprine experiments, and 40 treatment means from 12 ovine experiments were used in this analysis. Individual species models including the fixed effect of experiment were fitted using multiple regression to explain milk content of de novo FA as a function of diet composition and milk production and composition variables. We also evaluated replacing the effect of the experiment by the effect of the experiment nested in the laboratory at which the research had been conducted, and the effect of the laboratory. Butyric  content in milk fat was positively but weakly related to dietary ether extract in does and ewes. Lauric, myristic, and  contents in milk fat were negatively related to dietary ether extract in does and to a somewhat lesser extent in cows and ewes. The results confirm that the inclusion of lipids in the diet may not only affect the availability of preformed FA but also the profile of FA synthesized de novo in the mammary gland. Most of the variation in all prediction models was explained by the experiment or by the laboratory if the latter was included in the model. The ample variation in analytical methods reported by the different research groups suggests that differences in analytical protocols might explain a substantial proportion of the variation in de novo FA profile. A main conclusion of this study is the potential influence of differences in analytical procedures to explain the variation in de novo FA profile. Standardization of methods of FA analysis to improve reproducibility seems to be an aspect of importance to this area of research.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Because fatty acids (FAs) may trigger ER stress, we hypothesized that the absence of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL/PNPLA2)-the main enzyme for intracellular lipolysis, releasing FAs, and closest homolog to adiponutrin (PNPLA3) recently implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD-protects against hepatic ER stress. Wild-type (WT) and ATGL knockout (KO) mice were challenged with tunicamycin (TM) to induce ER stress. Serum biochemistry, hepatic TG and FA profiles, liver histology, and gene expression for markers of hepatic lipid metabolism, ER stress, and inflammation were explored. Moreover, cell-culture experiments were performed in Hepa1.6 cells after the knockdown of ATGL before FA and TM treatment. TM increased hepatic TG accumulation in ATGL KO, but not in WT, mice.  and β-oxidation were repressed at the gene-expression level (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c, fatty  synthase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 2, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha) in both WT and ATGL KO mice. Genes for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein B) were down-regulated by TM in WT and even more in ATGL KO mice, which displayed strongly reduced serum VLDL cholesterol levels. Notably, ER stress markers glucose-regulated protein, C/EBP homolog protein, spliced X-box-binding protein, endoplasmic-reticulum-localized DnaJ homolog 4, and inflammatory markers Tnfα and iNos were induced exclusively in TM-treated WT, but not ATGL KO, mice. Total hepatic FA profiling revealed a higher /oleic  (PA/OA) ratio in WT mice, compared to ATGL KO mice, at baseline. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor-known to be involved in FA-derived ER stress and blocked by OA-was increased in TM-treated WT mice only. In line with this, in vitro OA protected hepatocytes from TM-induced ER stress.Lack of ATGL may protect from hepatic ER stress through alterations in FA composition. ATGL could constitute a new therapeutic strategy to target ER stress in NAFLD.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340817>1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D regulates lipid metabolism and glucose utilization in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>It is well established that adipose tissue can both store and metabolize vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)D], regulates adipocyte differentiation and inflammation, highlighting the multifaceted role that vitamin D plays in adipose tissue physiology. However, there is limited evidence regarding vitamin D regulation of mature adipocyte lipid metabolism. We hypothesize that 1,25(OH)D alters lipid and glucose metabolism in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to reduce triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. In this study, 1,25(OH)D (10 nmol/L) stimulated a 21% reduction in TAG accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 4 days (P = .01) despite a significant increase in fatty  uptake (P < .01). Additionally, 1,25(OH)D stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in CO production from [1-C]  (P < .01), indicative of an elevated rate of fatty  β-oxidation, while stimulating a 9% reduction in de novo fatty  synthesis (P = .03). Interestingly, d-[U-C]glucose incorporation into fatty acids was reduced by 30% in response to 1,25(OH)D (P < .01), indicating a reduced contribution of glucose as a substrate for de novo . Consistent with these findings, mRNA expression of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase was reduced by 41% (P < .01). In summary, 1,25(OH)D stimulated fatty  oxidation and reduced TAG accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)D reduced glucose utilization as a substrate for fatty  synthesis potentially by downregulating pyruvate carboxylase and stimulating glucose disposal as glycerol. Collectively, these 1,25(OH)D-induced changes in lipid metabolism and glucose utilization may contribute to the reduction in TAG accumulation and be protective against excessive fat mass accumulation and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Associations between bovine PRL receptor (PRLR) genotype and fat yield have been reported, which illustrates the role of PRL in conveying lipids toward the udder as well as in stimulating their local synthesis during lactation. Conversely, and to the best of our knowledge, the effects of PRLR genotype on milk fatty  content have not been studied so far in any mammalian species. In this study, we sequenced most of the coding region of the caprine PRLR gene in several individuals from the Malagueña and Murciano-Granadina breeds. This approach allowed us to identify 2 long and short mRNA isoforms, produced by alternative splicing, and 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely, c.177T>C, c.1131G>A, c.1201G>A and c.1355C>T. Two of these SNPs are nonsynonymous and involve G401R (c.1201G>A) and T452I (c.1355C>T) amino  substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of PRLR, which plays a fundamental role in signal transduction. Performance of an association analysis with milk composition traits in a Murciano-Granadina goat population revealed highly suggestive effects on palmitoleic  content, whereas suggestive effects were detected for other fatty acids, such as  and linoleic. These results are consistent with the pleiotropic effects of PRL on mammary gland lipid metabolism and milk composition.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was aimed to determine whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) by surplus free fatty acids (FA) in hyperlipidemic condition, has a positive feedback regulation over FAO and ketogenic enzymes controlling lipotoxicity and cardiac apoptosis.8 weeks old C57BL/6 wild type (WT) or PPAR-γ-/- mice were challenged with 16 weeks 60% HFD to induce obesity mediated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Treatment course was followed by echocardiographic measurements, glycemic and lipid profiling, immunoblot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PPAR-γ and following mitochondrial metabolic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), mitochondrial β- hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4). In vivo model was translated in vitro, with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) treated with PPAR-γ agonist/antagonist and PPAR-γ overexpression adenovirus in presence of  (PA). Apoptosis was determined in vivo from left ventricular heart by TUNEL assay and immunoblot analysis.We found exaggerated circulating ketone bodies production and expressions of the related mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4 in HFD-induced diabetic hearts and in PA-treated NRCM. As a mechanistic approach we found HFD mediated activation of PPAR-γ is associated with the above-mentioned mitochondrial enzymes. HFD-fed PPAR-γ-/-mice display decreased hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia associated with increased insulin responsiveness as compared to HFD-fed WT mice PPAR-γ-/-HFD mice demonstrated a more robust functional recovery after diabetes induction, as well as significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function.PPAR-γ has been described previously to regulate lipid metabolism and . The present study suggests for the first time that increased PPAR-γ expression by HFD is responsible for cardiac dysfunction via upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4.

We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathogenic paradox. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to palmitate for twenty hours. To establish the physiological relevance of the in vitro findings, we also studied insulin-resistant Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. While insulin-receptor phosphorylation was unaffected, activation of Akt and inactivation of the downstream targets Glycogen synthase kinase 3α (Gsk3α and Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) was inhibited in palmitate-exposed cells. Accordingly, dose-response curves for insulin-mediated suppression of the FoxO1-induced gluconeogenic genes and for de novo glucose production were right shifted, and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis were impaired. In contrast, similar to findings in human T2D, the ability of insulin to induce triglyceride (TG) accumulation and transcription of the enzymes that catalyze de novo  and TG assembly was unaffected. Insulin-induction of these genes could, however, be blocked by inhibition of the atypical PKCs (aPKCs). The activity of the Akt-inactivating Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was increased in the insulin-resistant cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A by specific inhibitors increased insulin-stimulated activation of Akt and phosphorylation of FoxO1 and Gsk3α. Finally, PP2A mRNA levels were increased in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, while PP2A activity was increased in liver and muscle tissue in insulin-resistant ZDF rats. In conclusion, our findings indicate that FFAs may cause a selective impairment of insulin action upon hepatic glucose metabolism by increasing PP2A activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25601567>Diabetes: Hepatic  independent of insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus--a paradox clarified.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25136608>Ruscogenin ameliorates experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via suppressing  and inflammatory pathway.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effects of ruscogenin, a major steroid sapogenin in Ophiopogon japonicus, on experimental models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatokine that potentially has a beneficial role in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the current study, we investigated the regulatory role of MSP in the development of inflammation and lipid metabolism in various NASH models, both in vitro and ex vivo. We observed that MSP treatment activated the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and  (PA)-induced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, MSP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in PA-induced lipid accumulation and inhibited the gene expression of key lipogenic enzymes in HepG2 cells. Upon short hairpin RNA-induced knockdown of RON (the membrane-bound receptor for MSP), the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic effects of MSP were markedly ablated. Finally, to mimic NASH ex vivo, we challenged bone marrow-derived macrophages with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in combination with LPS. OxLDL+LPS exposure led to a marked inhibition of AMPK activity and a robust increase in inflammation. MSP treatment significantly reversed these effects by restoring AMPK activity and by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and secretion under this condition. Taken together, these data suggest that MSP is an effective inhibitor of inflammation and lipid accumulation in the stressed liver, thereby indicating that MSP has a key regulatory role in NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111834>The IRE1α-XBP1s pathway promotes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes by increasing PPARγ activity.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) improves whole-body insulin sensitivity by regulating the adipogenic and metabolic functions of mature adipocytes. We have previously demonstrated that an active splice variant of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s) enhances PPARγ expression during . In this study, we investigated the role of XBP1s, particularly with respect to PPARγ, in the mechanisms underlying insulin sensitivity in mature adipocytes. Insulin was able to stimulate XBP1s generation by activating inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) α and was also able to increase its transcriptional activity by inducing nuclear translocation. XBP1s also upregulated the levels of phosphorylated IRS1 and AKT, demonstrating a positive feedback regulatory mechanism linking insulin and XBP1s. XBP1s enhanced the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 and, in turn, increased PPARγ activity, translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, and glucose uptake rate in adipocytes. In addition, XBP1s abolished palmitate-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes by increasing adiponectin secretion, repressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and tumor necrosis factor α, and decreasing fatty  release. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which XBP1s stimulate insulin sensitivity in adipocytes through fibroblast growth factor 21 induction and PPARγ activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362725>Role for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c activation in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance via repression of rat insulin receptor substrate-1 transcription.</a></h2><p>Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a master regulator of fatty  synthase and controls . IRS-1 is the key insulin signalling mediator in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigated the role of SREBP-1c in the regulation of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle cells.L6 muscle cells were treated with  (PA) or metformin. Adenovirus vectors expressing Srebp-1c (also known as Srebf1) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Srebp-1c were transfected into the L6 cells. Protein-DNA interactions were assessed by luciferase reporter analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.We found that both gene and protein expression of SREBP-1c was increased in contrast to IRS-1 expression in PA-treated L6 cells. SREBP-1c overproduction decreased Irs-1 mRNA and IRS-1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, and suppressed the resultant insulin signalling, whereas SERBP-1c knockdown by Serbp-1c siRNA blocked the downregulation of IRS-1 induced by PA. Protein-DNA interaction studies demonstrated that SREBP-1c was able to bind to the rat Irs-1 promoter region, thereby repressing its gene transcription. Of particular importance, we found that metformin treatment downregulated Srebp-1c promoter activity, decreased the specific binding of SREBP-1c to Irs-1 promoter and upregulated Irs-1 promoter activity in PA-cultured L6 cells.Our data indicate for the first time that SREBP-1c activation participates in skeletal muscle insulin resistance through a direct effect of suppressing Irs-1 transcription.

Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)]. Higher eicosapentaenoic  plasma concentration was associated with decreased odds of Group 1 status [quartile 4 aOR: 0.41 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.95)].Higher plasma concentrations of SFAs and MUFAs, primary de novo lipogenesis products, were associated with elevated FPG and HbA1c in a nationally representative study population in the United States. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate potential causal relationships between FAs (from endogenous production and dietary consumption) and diabetogenic indicators, as well as clinical implications for managing diabetes and prediabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27456850>Anti-lipoapoptotic effects of Alisma orientalis extract on non-esterified fatty -induced HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Liver steatosis was caused by lipid accumulation in the liver. Alisma orientale (AO) is recognized as a promising candidate with therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HepG2 hepatocyte cell line is commonly used for liver disease cell model.The HepG2 cells were cultured with the NEFAs mixture (oleic and  acids, 2:1 ratio) for 24 h to induce hepatic steatosis. Then different doses of Alisma orientale extract (AOE) was treated to HepG2 for 24 h. Incubated cells were used for further experiments.The AOE showed inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation in the Oil Red O staining and Nile red staining tests with no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 300 μg/mL. Fatty  synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) mRNA and protein expression level were down-regulated after AOE treatment. Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA expression level were decreased as well as p-JNK (activated form of JNK), Bax, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 protein expression level. Anti-apopototic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein level increased after AOE treatment. In addition, inflammatory protein expression including p-p65, p65, COX-2 and iNOS were inhibited by AOE treatment.The results suggest that AOE has anti-steatosis effects that involve , anti-lipoapoptosis, and anti-inflammation in the NEFA-induced NAFLD pathological cell model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122028>Obesity reduces the pro-angiogenic potential of adipose tissue stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) by impairing miR-126 content: impact on clinical applications.</a></h2><p>Soluble factors and cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial tissue repair mediators in cell-based therapy. In the present study, we investigate the therapeutic impact of EVs released by adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) recovered from obese subjects' visceral and subcutaneous tissues.ASCs were recovered from 10 obese (oASCs) and 6 non-obese (nASCs) participants and characterized. In selected experiments, nASCs and oASCs were cultured with  (PA) or high glucose (HG), respectively. EVs from obese (oEVs) and non-obese (nEVs) subjects' visceral and subcutaneous ASCs were collected after ultracentrifugation and analyzed for their cargo: microRNA-126 (miR-126), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and for their biological effects on endothelial cells (ECs). Western blotting analysis and loss- and gain-of function experiments were performed.oEVs show impaired angiogenic potential compared with nEVs. This effect depends on EV cargo: reduced content of VEGF, MMP-2 and, more importantly, miR-126. We demonstrate, using gain- and loss-of-function experiments, that this reduced miR-126 content leads to Spred1 upregulation and the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in ECs. We also show that PA treatment of nASCs translates into the release of EVs that recapitulate oEV cargo. Moreover, HG treatment of oASCs further reduces miR-126 EV content and EV-mediated in vitro angiogenesis. Finally, impaired pro-angiogenic potential is also detected in EVs released from obese subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived ASCs.These results indicate that obesity impacts on EV pro-angiogenic potential and may raise concerns about the use of adipose tissue-derived EVs in cell-based therapy in the obese setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523479>Fatty Acids Have Different Adipogenic Differentiation Potentials in Stromal Vascular Cells Isolated from Abdominal Fat in Laying Hens.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to examine the effects of fatty acids (FA) with/without chicken serum (CS) on the expression of adipogenic transcripts and  in chicken stromal vascular cells (SVC).

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA promotes brown  by modulating miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, murine brown preadipocytes were induced to differentiate the fatty acids of , oleate, or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The increases of brown-specific signature genes and oxygen consumption rate by EPA were concurrent with up-regulation of miR-30b and 378 but not by oleate or . Next, we hypothesize that free fatty  receptor 4 (Ffar4), a functional receptor for n-3 PUFA, modulates miR-30b and 378. Treatment of Ffar4 agonist (GW9508) recapitulated the thermogenic activation of EPA by increasing oxygen consumption rate, brown-specific marker genes, and miR-30b and 378, which were abrogated in Ffar4-silenced cells. Intriguingly, addition of the miR-30b mimic was unable to restore EPA-induced Ucp1 expression in Ffar4-depleted cells, implicating that Ffar4 signaling activity is required for up-regulating the brown adipogenic program. Moreover, blockage of miR-30b or 378 by locked nucleic  inhibitors significantly attenuated Ffar4 as well as brown-specific signature gene expression, suggesting the signaling interplay between Ffar4 and miR-30b/378. The association between miR-30b/378 and brown thermogenesis was also confirmed in fish oil-fed C57/BL6 mice. Interestingly, the Ffar4 agonism-mediated signaling axis of Ffar4-miR-30b/378-Ucp1 was linked with an elevation of cAMP in brown adipocytes, similar to cold-exposed or fish oil-fed brown fat. Taken together, our work identifies a novel function of Ffar4 in modulating brown  partly through a mechanism involving cAMP activation and up-regulation of miR-30b and miR-378.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083413>Arazyme Suppresses Hepatic Steatosis and Steatohepatitis in Diet-Induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease-Like Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Arazyme, a metalloprotease from the spider , exerts hepatoprotective activity in CCL-induced acute hepatic injury. This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-like C57BL/6J mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups ( = 10/group): the normal diet group, the HFD group, the arazyme group (HFD with 0.025% arazyme), and the milk thistle (MT) group (HFD with 0.1% MT). Dietary supplementation of arazyme for 13 weeks significantly lowered plasma triglyceride (TG) and non-esterified fatty  levels. Suppression of HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in the arazyme group was caused by the reduced hepatic TG and total cholesterol (TC) contents. Arazyme supplementation decreased hepatic -related gene expression, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1 (, fatty  synthase (), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (), , glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (), diacylglycerol -acyltransferase 1 (), and . Arazyme directly reduced  (PA)-induced TG accumulation in HepG2 cells.

Thus, it is important to explore its underlying mechanisms.Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 50 NAFLD patients and 50 healthy controls. In addition, human liver specimens were obtained through liver biopsies from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. The level of miRNA was studied using real-time PCR. The expression of lipogenic genes was analyzed using western blot, and a dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to identify the possible target gene. Adenovirus vectors were injected into the tail vein of the high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice to study the role of miR-155 on lipid accumulation in vivo.The level of miR-155 was markedly reduced in the livers and peripheral blood of NAFLD patients compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-155 decreased intracellular lipid content and the SREBP1 and FAS protein levels, while inhibition of miR-155 enhanced the intracellular lipid content. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Liver X receptor (LXR)α was the target gene of miR-155, and silencing miR-155 reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS. An in vivo study showed that upregulation of miR-155 decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation mainly by suppressing the LXRα-dependent lipogenic signaling pathway.In summary, decreased expression of miR-155 in the peripheral blood may be utilized as a potential novel biomarker for NAFLD screening mainly by targeting LXRα.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

It has been reported to exert a protective effect against hepatic steatosis by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the detailed mechanism by which GN inhibits hepatic steatosis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examined whether GN activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and exerts therapeutic effects on liver X receptor (LXR)- or  (PA)-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, in vivo protective effects of GN against hepatic steatosis were assessed in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. GN stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) in HepG2 cells. It decreased the expression of  genes, but increased the expression of fatty  oxidation genes. Additionally, GN decreased the expression of  genes induced by the LXR agonist T0901317 or PA in HepG2 cells, resulting in reduced intracellular TG content. However, preincubation with compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, prevented GN-mediated effects. Administration of GN to HFD-induced obese mice decreased HFD-induced liver weight, hepatic TG accumulation, and cytoplasmic lipid droplet. These findings demonstrate that GN activates the AMPK pathway and ameliorates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In the fed state, hSTC-1 decreases the incorporation of C from glucose into lipids in the rat BAT. The data support the hypothesis that the capacity of the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)-generating pathway (glycolysis) from glucose is regulated by hSTC-1, decreasing the adequate supply of G3P needed for fatty  esterification and triacylglycerol (TG) storage in BAT. The results also suggest the effect of hSTC-1 on de novo fatty  synthesis from pyruvate generated by C-glucose in the glycolysis pathway. In addition, by decreasing , hSTC-1 increased ATP levels and these two factors may decrease BAT thermogenic function. The presence of hSTC-1 in the incubation medium did not alter C-glucose and C-1- oxidation. The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expression was not altered by hSTC-1 either. In conclusion, hSTC-1 is one of the hormonal factors that control glucose metabolism in BAT in the fed state. The decrease of TG capacity synthesis from C-glucose by hSTC-1 compromises the BAT thermogenic capacity. Furthermore, the increase in ATP levels would inhibit a futile cycle via UCP-1, which dissipates oxidative energy as heat.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Despite null results from recent large omega-3 FA supplementation trials, new research continues to support past studies showing that blood levels of EPA + DHA are inversely related to risk for total mortality and fatal CVD events. But blood levels of other FAs may also be useful markers of risk for a variety of diseases. The essential omega-6 FA linoleic  is inversely associated with risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), whereas risk for T2D is directly related to biomarkers of de novo  ( and palmitoleic acids). Levels of industrially produced trans FAs have been linked to higher risk for CVD.

Potential roles of this pathway in adipocyte differentiation and  are unknown. Mammalian fatty  2-hydroxylase (FA2H) was recently identified and suggested to catalyze the initial step of straight chain fatty  alpha-oxidation. Accordingly, we examined whether FA2H modulates adipocyte differentiation and  in mature adipocytes. FA2H level markedly increases during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and small interfering RNAs against FA2H inhibit the differentiation process. In mature adipocytes, depletion of FA2H inhibits basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and , which are partially rescued by the enzymatic product of FA2H, 2-hydroxy . Expression of fatty- synthase and SCD1 was decreased in FA2H-depleted cells, and levels of GLUT4 and insulin receptor proteins were reduced. 2-Hydroxy fatty acids are enriched in cellular sphingolipids, which are components of membrane rafts. Accelerated diffusional mobility of raft-associated lipids was shown to enhance degradation of GLUT4 and insulin receptor in adipocytes. Consistent with this, depletion of FA2H appeared to increase raft lipid mobility as it significantly accelerated the rates of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements of lipid rafts labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B. Moreover, the enhanced recovery rates were partially reversed by treatment with 2-hydroxy . In conclusion, our findings document the novel role of FA2H in adipocyte  possibly by modulation of raft fluidity and level of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304472>Determination of Fat Accumulation Reduction by Edible Fatty Acids and Natural Waxes .</a></h2><p>Natural edible waxes mixed with plant oils, containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), are known as oleogels.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of FAs and natural waxes on the  in 3T3-L1 cells. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and treated with FAs and waxes. These FAs [ (PA), Stearic  (SA), Oleic  (OA), Linoleic  (LA), and Alpha-linolenic  (ALA)] and waxes [beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW)] were prepared at varying concentrations, and cell toxicity, triglyceride accumulation, lipid droplets size, and distribution inside of cells were determined. Adipogenic gene expression including , , , , and  was determined. Results showed that increasing the concentration of FAs and waxes led to a decrease in the adipocyte cells viability and metabolic performance. SA showed the highest level of triglyceride accumulation (p<0.05), whereas ALA showed the lowest (p<0.05). Both BW and CW at 3.0 ppm showed significantly higher lipid accumulation than in the control and other groups (p<0.05). ALA had significantly downregulated adipogenic gene expression levels, excluding those of , compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.05). Moreover, BW demonstrated similar adipogenic gene expression levels as ALA compared to CW.

Acetate is the major carbon source spared and it may increase lipid synthesis in adipose tissue during MFD. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and the amount of acetate spared during CLA-induced MFD on adipose tissue . Nine multiparous, lactating, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows (244 ± 107 d in milk; 25 ± 8.4 kg of milk/d; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Experimental periods were 4 d followed by a 10-d washout. Treatments were control (CON), ruminal infusion of acetate (AC; continuous infusion of 7 mol/d adjusted to pH 6.1 with sodium hydroxide), or abomasal infusion of CLA (10 g/d of both trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA). Dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein yield and percentage were not affected by treatments. Compared with CON, milk fat yield decreased 23% and fat percent decreased 28% in CLA, and milk fat yield increased 20% in AC. Concentration and yield of milk de novo synthesized fatty acids (<C16) were reduced and concentration of preformed fatty acids (>C16) was increased by CLA, compared with CON. Yield of de novo synthesized fatty acids and  was increased by AC, compared with CON.  capacity of adipose tissue explants was decreased 72% by CLA, but was not affected by AC. Acetate oxidation by adipose explants was not affected by treatments. Treatments had no effect on expression of key lipogenic factors, lipogenic enzymes, and leptin; however, expression of fatty  binding protein 4 was reduced in CLA compared with CON. Additionally, hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin 1 were decreased by CLA and acetate. Plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations were not affected by treatments; however, CLA increased nonesterified fatty acids 17.7%, β-hydroxybutyrate 16.1%, and insulin 27.8% compared with CON, and AC increased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate 18%. In conclusion, during CLA-induced MFD in low-producing cow adipose tissue was sensitive to the anti-lipogenic effects of CLA, while spared acetate did not stimulate adipose .

NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic metabolic syndrome. Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo  in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired fatty  transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium. This novel ex vivo NAFLD model could be used to investigate the multicellular and molecular mechanisms that drive NAFLD development and progression, and to study potential anti-steatotic drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738135>Permethrin and ivermectin modulate lipid metabolism in steatosis-induced HepG2 hepatocyte.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have reported the positive association between exposure to insecticides and increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is not known if insecticide exposure can contribute to NAFLD. Thus, the goal of the current study was to determine if insecticide exposures can exacerbate the physiological conditions of NAFLD by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism.

Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with  to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted fatty  synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited -related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates fatty  oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive fatty acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study is to delineate the mechanism of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in preventing obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.By subjecting the complete subdiaphragmatic vagotomized mice to various nutritional conditions and investigating hepatic de novo  pathway, we found that complete disruption of subdiaphragmatic vagal signaling resulted in a significant decrease of circulating VLDL-triglyceride compared with the mice obtained sham procedure. Vagotomy further prevented overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride induced by an acute fat load and a high-fat diet-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed that plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 was significantly raised in the vagotomized mice, which was associated with significant reductions in mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), and FASN (fatty  synthase), as well as enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In vitro, treating mouse primary hepatocytes with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, for 48 hours inhibited free fatty ,  treatment induced de novo lipid synthesis, and VLDL secretion from hepatocytes.Elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1 in vagotomized mice may prevent VLDL overproduction and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet.

In line, Abhd15 is mainly expressed in brown and white adipose tissue and strongly upregulated during  in various murine and human cell lines. Stable knockdown of Abhd15 in 3T3-L1 cells evokes a striking differentiation defect, as evidenced by low lipid accumulation and decreased expression of adipocyte marker genes. In preconfluent cells, knockdown of Abhd15 leads to impaired proliferation, which is caused by apoptosis, as we see an increased SubG1 peak, caspase 3/7 activity, and BAX protein expression as well as a reduction in anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein. Furthermore, apoptosis-inducing amounts of  evoke a massive increase of Abhd15 expression, proposing an apoptosis-protecting role for ABHD15. On the other hand, in mature adipocytes physiological (i.e. non-apoptotic) concentrations of  down-regulate Abhd15 expression. Accordingly, we found that the expression of Abhd15 in adipose tissue is reduced in physiological situations with high free fatty  levels, like high-fat diet, fasting, and aging as well as in genetically obese mice. Collectively, our results position ABHD15 as an essential component in the development of adipocytes as well as in apoptosis, thereby connecting two substantial factors in the regulation of adipocyte number and size. Together with its intricate regulation by free fatty acids, ABHD15 might be an intriguing new target in obesity and diabetes research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21703185>Altered composition of fatty acids exacerbates hepatotumorigenesis during activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.</a></h2><p>Some clinical findings have suggested that systemic metabolic disorders accelerate in vivo tumor progression. Deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is implicated in both metabolic dysfunction and carcinogenesis in humans; however, it remains unknown whether the altered metabolic status caused by abnormal activation of the pathway is linked to the protumorigenic effect.We established hepatocyte-specific Pik3ca transgenic (Tg) mice harboring N1068fs*4 mutation.The Tg mice exhibited hepatic steatosis and tumor development. PPARγ-dependent  was accelerated in the Tg liver, and the abnormal profile of accumulated fatty  (FA) composition was observed in the tumors of Tg livers. In addition, the Akt/mTOR pathway was highly activated in the tumors, and in turn, the expression of tumor suppressor genes including Pten, Xpo4, and Dlc1 decreased. Interestingly, we found that the suppression of those genes and the enhanced in vitro colony formation were induced in the immortalized hepatocytes by the treatment with oleic  (OA), which is one of the FAs that accumulated in tumors.Our data suggest that the unusual FA accumulation has a possible role in promoting in vivo hepato-tumorigenesis under constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway.

Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) regulates the cellular redox state and metabolism and has been linked to many diseases, including diabetes. Therefore, we examined the role of TXNIP in hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo.Lipogenic and inflammatory proteins produced by hepatocytes treated with  (PA) or transfected with TXNIP or Txnip siRNA were measured by Western blotting. Lipid accumulation was assessed using Oil Red O staining. Protein interactions were assessed by immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Hepatic protein levels were measured by Western blotting from wild type or Txnip(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or chow diet. Livers from NAFLD patients were compared with normal liver by immunohistochemistry.PA increased TXNIP, and inflammatory and lipogenic proteins in both AML12 and H4IIE cells. It also increased the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1α (PGC-1α), which mediated the expression of lipogenic markers and lipid accumulation. In addition, PA increased protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) and PRMT1 siRNA abolished the increase in lipogenic markers with PGC-1α. Furthermore, TXNIP interacted with PRMT1 in PA-treated hepatocytes. In vivo, levels of lipogenic proteins, inflammatory molecules, PGC-1α, and PRMT1 were increased in the livers of HFD mice compared with those fed a chow diet, and were ameliorated in HFD Txnip(-/-) mice. Moreover, TXNIP, PRMT1, and PGC-1α were elevated in the livers of human NAFLD patients.TXNIP mediates hepatic  via PRMT1 and PGC-1α regulation and inflammation in vitro and in vivo, implying that targeting TXNIP and PRMT1 is a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, it is unknown which effector protein connects mTORC1 and PPARγ. This study investigated the interaction between 4EBP1 with PPARγ as part of the underlying mechanism by which insulin-induced lipid synthesis and secretion are regulated by mTORC1 in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1, downregulated 4EBP1 phosphorylation and the expression of PPARγ and the following lipogenic genes: lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS. Rapamycin also decreased the levels of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG); 10 types of fatty ; and the accumulation of TAG,  (PA), and stearic  (SA) in the cell culture medium. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor or shRheb attenuated the synthesis and secretion of TAG and PA. In contrast, activation of mTORC1 by Rheb overexpression promoted 4EBP1 phosphorylation and PPARγ expression and upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS, whereas the levels of intracellular and extracellular TAG, PA, and SA also rose. Further, 4EBP1 interacted directly with PPARγ. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor prevented the nuclear location of PPARγ. These results demonstrate that mTORC1 regulates lipid synthesis and secretion by inducing the expression of lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS, which is likely mediated by the 4EBP1/PPARγ axis. This finding constitutes a novel mechanism by which lipid synthesis and secretion are regulated in pBMECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371918>Long-term administration of tacrolimus and everolimus prevents high cholesterol-high fructose-induced steatosis in C57BL/6J mice by inhibiting de-novo .</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of tacrolimus (TC) and everolimus (EV) on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced by high fat, high cholesterol and fructose (fast food) diet in C57BL/6J mice.C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups (n=8). 1) Standard Chow (SC); 2) Fast food (FF) diet; 3) FF + Tacrolimus (TC, 1mg/kg) and; 4) FF + Everolimus (EV, 1mg/kg) and treated for 16 weeks. Serum and tissue samples were analyzed for evidence of inflammation, fibrosis, , and apoptosis.TC and EV treatments significantly reduced the hepatic lipid accumulation, improved liver-body weight ratio, blood biochemistry, and insulin resistance in mice fed with FF diet. However, inflammation, enlarged portal tracts, and fibrosis were pronounced in EV treated group. The lipogenic parameters, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) and fatty  translocase (CD36) were significantly down-regulated in livers of TC and EV treated groups as compared to FF group. TC improved Bcl2/Bax ratio, decreased apoptosis, CYP2E1 protein expression and liver fibrosis levels, however, EV offered no such protection.

Serum NAMPT (by ELISA), , and the DNL index of erythrocyte membranes as markers of hepatic DNL (by gas chromatography) were analyzed. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and body impedance analyzer were used to assess hepatic and body fat, respectively. Univariate and multiple linear regressions (to adjust for confounders) were used to analyze the association of serum NAMPT with , DNL index, CAP, and body fat.The respective values of serum NAMPT (2.44 ± 1.03 vs. 2.45 ± 1.13 ng/mL, p = 0.98), DNL index (3.11 [2.60-3.71] vs. 3.05 [2.40-3.59], p = 0.90), and  (20.55% [15.34-24.04] vs. 22.64% [21.15-25.95], p = 0.07) were not significantly different between men and women, but those of CAP (326 [300-340] vs. 300 [261.25-329], p = 0.002) and body fat (37.71 ± 3.80 vs. 26.60 ± 5.70, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in women. In women, serum NAMPT had a significant negative association with the DNL index (β = -0.56, p = 0.01). The DNL index also had a significant negative association with body fat (β = -0.46, p = 0.02). In men, the only significant association was the positive association between serum NAMPT and CAP (β = 0.35, p = 0.035).Higher serum NAMPT in women was associated with a lower hepatic DNL index, while in men it was associated with higher hepatic fat and had no association with the DNL index.

Clarification of the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploration of drug targets are crucial for the treatment of T2DM.  We examined miR-125a-5p levels in -induced AML12 cells and the livers of type 2 diabetic rats and mice, and then validated its target gene. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, the effects of miR-125a-5p via targeting of STAT3 on regulating glycolipid metabolism were further illustrated  and .  We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in the livers of diabetic mice and rats, and STAT3 was identified as the target gene of miR-125a-5p. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in C57BL/6 mice decreased STAT3 level and downregulated the expression levels of p-STAT3 and SOCS3. Consequently, SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis pathway was inhibited, and PI3K/AKT pathway was activated. Moreover, silencing of miR-125a-5p significantly increased the expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and SOCS3, thus activating SREBP-1c pathway and suppressing PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and decreased liver glycogen appeared in C57BL/6 mice. In -induced AML12 cells, miR-125a-5p mimic markedly increased glucose consumption and uptake and decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets by regulating STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, miR-125a-5p overexpression obviously inhibited STAT3 expression in diabetic KK-Ay mice, thereby decreasing blood glucose and lipid levels, increasing hepatic glycogen content, and decreasing accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-125a-5p in KK-Ay mice aggravated glycolipid metabolism dysfunction through regulating STAT3.  Our results confirmed that miR-125a-5p should be considered as a regulator of glycolipid metabolism in T2DM, which can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and  and elevate glycogen synthesis by targeting STAT3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820969>Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 Regulates Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Through Inhibition of the  and Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1 Pathways.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit  under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the exact mechanism of PPARγ regulation on milk fat synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells (DCMECs) remains largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PPARγ regarding milk fat synthesis in DCMECs and to ascertain whether milk fat precursor acetic  and  could interact with PPARγ signaling to regulate milk fat synthesis. For this study, we examined the effects of PPARγ overexpression and gene silencing on cell growth, triacylglycerol synthesis, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in DCMECs. In addition, we investigated the influences of acetic  and  on the mRNA and protein levels of milk lipogenic genes and triacylglycerol synthesis in DCMECs transfected with PPARγ small interfering RNA (siRNA) and PPARγ expression vector. The results showed that when PPARγ was silenced, cell viability, proliferation, and triacylglycerol secretion were obviously reduced. Gene silencing of PPARγ significantly downregulated the expression levels of milk fat synthesis-related genes in DCMECs. PPARγ overexpression improved cell viability, proliferation, and triacylglycerol secretion. The expression levels of milk lipogenic genes were significantly increased when PPARγ was overexpressed. Acetic  and  could markedly improve triacylglycerol synthesis and upregulate the expression levels of PPARγ and other lipogenic genes in DCMECs. These results suggest that PPARγ is a positive regulator of milk fat synthesis in DCMECs and that acetic  and  could partly regulate milk fat synthesis in DCMECs via PPARγ signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26316333>GADD34-deficient mice develop obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic carcinoma and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in parallel with the prevalence of obesity. DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34/Ppp1r15a), originally isolated from UV-inducible transcripts in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, dephosphorylates several kinases that function in important signaling cascades, including dephosphorylation of eIF2α. We examined the effects of GADD34 on natural life span by using GADD34-deficient mice. Here we observed for the first time that with age GADD34-deficient mice become obese, developing fatty liver followed by liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and insulin resistance. We found that myofibroblasts and immune cells infiltrated the portal veins of aged GADD34-deficient mouse livers. A high-fat diet (HFD) induced a higher level of steatosis in young GADD34-deficient mice compared with WT mice. Differentiation into fat is dependent on insulin signaling. Insulin signaling in young GADD34-deficient mice was higher than that in WT mice, which explained the higher fat differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) observed in GADD34-deficient mice. Through aging or a HFD, insulin signaling in GADD34-deficient liver converted to be down regulated compared with WT mice. We found that a HFD or palmitate treatment converted insulin signaling by up-regulating TNF-α and JNK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27166182>Reduced miR-200b and miR-200c expression contributes to abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation by stimulating JUN expression and activating the transcription of srebp1.</a></h2><p>Previous studies indicated that miR-200s participated in IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance. However, the role of miR-200s in hepatic lipid accumulation has not been elucidated. Here we found that miR-200b and miR-200c were reduced in the steatotic livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This down-regulation was accompanied by an increase in the expression of lipogenic proteins such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS). The suppression of miR-200b and miR-200c in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 hepatocytes enhanced intracellular triglyceride levels, which were associated with increased SREBP-1 and FAS protein levels. In contrast, the over-expression of miR-200b and miR-200c suppressed lipid accumulation and reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 cells transfected with miR-200b or miR-200c mimics. Importantly, the up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-200c could reverse oleic /-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. A luciferase reporter assay identified that miR-200b and miR-200c could directly bind the 3'UTR of jun. JUN activated the transcription of srebp1 to increase lipid accumulation. The data also demonstrated that increased miR-200b and miR-200c expression might be associated with sitagliptin-reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in mice fed a HFD. These findings suggest, for the first time, that reduced miR-200b and miR-200c expression contributes to abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation by stimulating JUN expression and activating the transcription of srebp1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355570>[Psoralen and isopsoralen improve lipid metabolism disorder via inhibition of NF-κB activation in LO2 cells].</a></h2><p>The aim of this paper was to investigate the mechanism and effect of psoralen and isopsoralen in the treatment of lipid accumulation in LO2 cells. Human LO2 cells nonalcoholic fatty liver models were established by using ( PA). Then psoralen and isopsoralen were administered for intervention. Intracellular triglyceride( TG) and total cholesterol( TC) content,the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase( AST) levels were determined by enzyme method. Cell supernatant proinflammatory cytokines( IL-6,TNF-α) and chemokines( IL-8,MCP-1) were determined by ELISA method. Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group. As compared with the model cells,intracellular TG content had no significant changes,but all the other indexes were reduced( P<0. 01,P<0. 05) in the cells of isopsoralen intervention group. Psoralen exhibited better effect than isopsoralen( P< 0. 01,P<0. 05). It is concluded that psoralen could improve the  of LO2 cells induced by PA; both psoralen and isopsoralen are effective in ameliorating LO2 cells injury induced by PA,reducing inflammation via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408826>Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic  is endogenously synthesized from palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9)  in bovine adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9)  has been suggested to have beneficial effects on human health, including reduced adiposity. Objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic  in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic  supplementation on  in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro. For the first objective, palmitelaidic  content of LM samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined. Palmitelaidic  in LM samples from forage-finished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg/100 g of muscle corresponding to 0.52% to 0.65% of total fatty acids. Forage species grazed during finishing, and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic  concentrations and contents in the LM of forage-finished beef. Palmitelaidic  concentration of concentrate-finished beef was lower (P < 0.05; 0.25% vs. 0.56%); however, because of increased (P < 0.05) total fatty  content with concentrate finishing, amount of palmitelaidic  was similar (P > 0.05) to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater (P < 0.05) than those finished on alfalfa. For the second objective, undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 μM of palmitelaidic . Palmitelaidic  supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels (150 and 300 μM) but did not affect (P > 0.05) the viability of differentiated adipocytes. In preadipocytes, palmitelaidic  increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic and trans-11 vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) acids at high levels of supplementation (300 μM). In adipocytes, palmitelaidic  supplementation increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic , trans-11 vaccenic , and total fatty  content. In addition, cis-9, trans-11 CLA also increased (P < 0.05) with palmitelaidic  supplementation in adipocytes. These results indicate that palmitelaidic  can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans-11 vaccenic  and cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively. Beef products are a source of palmitelaidic  in the human diet, which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans-11 vaccenic  and cis-9, trans-11 CLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep.

Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in  and oleic  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that  decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that  decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we investigated the effects of FAs released during adipocyte lipolysis on AT macrophages (ATMs).Human THP-1 macrophages were treated with media from human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) adipocytes stimulated with lipolytic drugs. Macrophages were also treated with mixtures of FAs and an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4, since this receptor is activated by saturated FAs.

The effect of chronic inhibition or acute activation of fat cell lipolysis on ATM response was investigated in vivo in mice.Whereas  alone activates THP-1, conditioned media from hMADS adipocyte lipolysis had no effect on IL, chemokine and cytokine gene expression, and secretion by macrophages. Mixtures of FAs representing de novo  or habitual dietary conditions also had no effect. FAs derived from adipocyte lipolysis were taken up by macrophages and stored as triacylglycerol droplets. In vivo, chronic treatment with an antilipolytic drug did not modify gene expression and number of ATMs in mice with intact or defective Tlr4. Stimulation of adipocyte lipolysis increased storage of neutral lipids by macrophages without change in number and phenotype.Our data suggest that adipocyte lipolysis does not activate inflammatory pathways in ATMs, which instead may act as scavengers of FAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045975>Increased lipid synthesis and decreased β-oxidation in the liver of SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) rats, an animal model of metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>SHR/NDmcr-cp (cp/cp) rats (SHR/NDcp) are an animal model of metabolic syndrome. A previous study of ours revealed drastic increases in the mass of  (16:0), oleic (18:1n-9), palmitoleic (16:1n-7), cis-vaccenic (18:1n-7) and 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acids in the liver of SHR/NDcp. However, detailed information on the class of lipid accumulated and the mechanism responsible for the overproduction of the accumulated lipid in the liver was not obtained. This study aimed to characterize the class of lipid accumulated and to explore the mechanism underlying the lipid accumulation in the liver of SHR/NDcp, in comparison with SHR/NDmcr-cp (+/+) (lean hypertensive littermates of SHR/NDcp) and Wistar Kyoto rats. In the liver of SHR/NDcp, de novo synthesis of fatty acids (16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis were up-regulated and fatty  β-oxidation was down-regulated. These perturbations of lipid metabolism caused fat accumulation in hepatocytes and accumulation of TAG, which were enriched with 16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7, in the liver of SHR/NDcp. On the other hand, no changes were found in hepatic contents of diacylglycerol and unesterified fatty  (FFA); among FFA, there were no differences in the hepatic concentrations of unesterified 16:0 and stearic  between SHR/NDcp and two other groups of rats. Moreover, little change was brought about in the expression of genes responsive to endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of SHR/NDcp.

It is possible that the capacity of adipocytes to synthesize lipids from carbohydrate precursors through a process known as "de novo " (DNL) is one of the factors that contributes to glucose intolerance in Atlantic salmon.Primary adipocytes from Atlantic salmon differentiated in vitro were incubated with radiolabelled glucose in order to explore the capacity of salmon adipocytes to synthesize and deposit lipids from glucose through DNL. The lipid-storage capacity of adipocytes incubated with glucose was compared with that of cells incubated with the fatty  . Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to assess changes of genes and proteins involved in glucose and lipid transport and metabolism.Less than 0.1% of the radiolabelled glucose was metabolized to the fatty acids 16:0 and the stearoyl-CoA desaturase products 16:1 and 18:1 by DNL, whereas approximately 40% was converted to glycerol to form the triacylglycerol backbone of lipids. Transcriptional analysis indicated that adipocytes ensure the availability of necessary cofactors and other substrates for lipid synthesis and storage from glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and glyceroneogenesis.We have shown for the first time that the DNL pathway is active in fish adipocytes. The capacity of the pathway to convert glucose into cellular lipids for storage is relatively low.The limited capacity of adipocytes to utilize glucose as a substrate for lipid deposition may contribute to glucose intolerance in salmonids.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Three major food classes that promote acne are: 1) hyperglycemic carbohydrates, 2) milk and dairy products, 3) saturated fats including trans-fats and deficient ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Diet-induced insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)-signaling is superimposed on elevated IGF-1 levels during puberty, thereby unmasking the impact of aberrant nutrigenomics on sebaceous gland homeostasis. Western diet provides abundant branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), glutamine, and . Insulin and IGF-1 suppress the activity of the metabolic transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1). Insulin, IGF-1, BCAAs, glutamine, and palmitate activate the nutrient-sensitive kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the key regulator of anabolism and . FoxO1 is a negative coregulator of androgen receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), liver X receptor-α, and sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), crucial transcription factors of sebaceous . mTORC1 stimulates the expression of PPARγ and SREBP-1c, promoting sebum production. SREBP-1c upregulates stearoyl-CoA- and Δ6-desaturase, enhancing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in sebum triglycerides. Diet-mediated aberrations in sebum quantity (hyperseborrhea) and composition (dysseborrhea) promote Propionibacterium acnes overgrowth and biofilm formation with overexpression of the virulence factor triglyceride lipase increasing follicular levels of free palmitate and oleate. Free palmitate functions as a "danger signal," stimulating toll-like receptor-2-mediated inflammasome activation with interleukin-1β release, Th17 differentiation, and interleukin-17-mediated keratinocyte proliferation. Oleate stimulates P. acnes adhesion, keratinocyte proliferation, and comedogenesis via interleukin-1α release. Thus, diet-induced metabolomic alterations promote the visible sebofollicular inflammasomopathy acne vulgaris. Nutrition therapy of acne has to increase FoxO1 and to attenuate mTORC1/SREBP-1c signaling.

In this study, we evaluated expression profiles of GDF5 in cultured murine brown pre-adipocytes exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids (FFAs), which are all shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Both interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were effective in up-regulating GDF5 expression in a concentration-dependent manner, while similar upregulation was seen in cells exposed to the saturated FFA palmitate, but not to the unsaturated FFA oleate. In silico analysis revealed existence of the putative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) binding site in the 5'-flanking region of mouse GDF5, whereas introduction of NF-κB subunits drastically facilitated both promoter activity and expression of GDF5 in brown pre-adipocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed significant facilitation of the recruitment of NF-κB to the GDF5 promoter in lysed extracts of BAT from leptin-deficient ob/ob obese mice. Upregulation o GDF5 expression was invariably inhibited by an NF-κB inhibitor in cultured brown pre-adipocytes exposed to IL-1β, TNF-α and palmitate. These results suggest that obesity leads to upregulation of GDF5 expression responsible for the promotion of brown  through a mechanism relevant to activation of the NF-κB pathway in response to particular pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or saturated FFAs in BAT.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For this, both differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic  (16:1n7, 200 μM) or  (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from wild-type or PPARα-deficient mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) or oleic  (18:1n9, 300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for lipolysis, TAG, and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis and gene and protein expression profile. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with 16:1n7, but not 16:0, increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, mRNA levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and protein content of ATGL and pSer(660)-HSL. Such increase in lipolysis induced by 16:1n7, which can be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of PPARα, was associated with higher rates of PPARα binding to DNA. In contrast to lipolysis, both 16:1n7 and 16:0 increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose without affecting glyceroneogenesis and glycerokinase expression. Corroborating in vitro findings, treatment of wild-type but not PPARα-deficient mice with 16:1n7 increased primary adipocyte basal and stimulated lipolysis and ATGL and HSL mRNA levels. In contrast to lipolysis, however, 16:1n7 treatment increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose in both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice. In conclusion, palmitoleic  increases adipocyte lipolysis and lipases by a mechanism that requires a functional PPARα.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650287>Reduction in liver fat by dietary MUFA in type 2 diabetes is helped by enhanced hepatic fat oxidation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to investigate hepatic lipid metabolic processes possibly involved in the reduction of liver fat content (LF) observed in patients with type 2 diabetes after an isoenergetic diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs).This is an ancillary analysis of a published study. In a parallel-group design, 30 men and eight women, aged 35-70 years, with type 2 diabetes and whose blood glucose was controlled satisfactorily (HbA < 7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) by diet or diet plus metformin, were randomised by MINIM software to follow either a high-carbohydrate/high-fibre/low-glycaemic index diet (CHO/fibre diet, n = 20) or a high-MUFA diet (MUFA diet, n = 18) for 8 weeks. The assigned diets were known for the participants and blinded for people doing measurements. Before and after intervention, LF was measured by H-MRS (primary outcome) and indirect indices of de novo  (DNL) (serum triacylglycerol :linoleic  ratio), stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (SCD-1) (serum triacylglycerol palmitoleic: ratio) and hepatic β-oxidation of fatty acids (β-hydroxybutyrate plasma concentrations) were measured.LF was reduced by 30% after the MUFA diet, as already reported. Postprandial β-hydroxybutyrate incremental AUC (iAUC) was significantly less suppressed after the MUFA diet (n = 16) (-2504 ± 4488 μmol/l × 360 min vs baseline -9021 ± 6489 μmol/l × 360 min) while it was unchanged after the CHO/fibre diet (n = 17) (-8168 ± 9827 μmol/l × 360 min vs baseline -7206 ± 10,005 μmol/l × 360 min, p = 0.962) (mean ± SD, p = 0.043). In the participants assigned to the MUFA diet, the change in postprandial β-hydroxybutyrate iAUC was inversely associated with the change in LF (r = -0.642, p = 0.010). DNL and SCD-1 indirect indices did not change significantly after either of the dietary interventions.Postprandial hepatic oxidation of fatty acids is a metabolic process possibly involved in the reduction of LF by a MUFA-rich diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.ClinicalTrials.gov  FUNDING : The study was funded by Ministero Istruzione Università e Ricerca and Italian Minister of Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19252892>Markers of de novo  in adipose tissue: associations with small adipocytes and insulin sensitivity in humans.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown relationships between fatty  ratios in adipose tissue triacylglycerol (TG), adipocyte size and measures of insulin sensitivity. We hypothesised that variations in adipose tissue de novo  (DNL) in relation to adiposity might explain some of these observations.In a cross-sectional study, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies from 59 people were examined in relation to fasting and post-glucose insulin sensitivity. Adipocyte size, TG fatty  composition and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were determined.We found strong positive relationships between adipose tissue TG content of the fatty acids myristic  (14:0) and stearic  (18:0) with insulin sensitivity (HOMA model) (p < 0.01 for each), and inverse relationships with adipocyte size (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). Variation in 18:0 content was the determinant of the adipose tissue TG 18:1 n-9/18:0 ratio, which correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity (p < 0.01), as observed previously. Adipose tissue 18:0 content correlated positively with the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes (e.g. FASN, p < 0.01). Lipogenic gene expression (a composite measure derived from principal components analysis) was inversely correlated with adipocyte cell size (p < 0.001). There was no relationship between dietary saturated fatty  intake and adipose tissue 18:0 content.Our data suggest a physiological mechanism whereby DNL is downregulated as adipocytes expand. Taken together with other data, they also suggest that hepatic and adipose tissue DNL are not regulated in parallel. We also confirm a strong relationship between small adipocytes and insulin sensitivity, which is independent of BMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25491540>Effects of berberine and cinnamic  on -induced intracellular triglyceride accumulation in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of berberine (BBR) and cinnamic  (CA), the main active components in Jiaotai Pill (, JTP), on  (PA)-induced intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells.Cells were incubated in culture medium containing PA (0.25 mmol/L) for 24 h. Then treatments with BBR (10 μmol/L), CA (100 μmol/L) and the combination of BBR and CA (BBR+CA) were performed respectively. Intracellular lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O staining and TG content was measured by colorimetric assay. The expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and its downstream lipogenic and fatty  oxidation genes, including fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC), phosphorylation acetyl-coA carboxylase (pACC), carnitine acyl transferase 1 (CPT-1) and sterol regulating element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were determined by Western blot or real time polymerase chain reaction.PA induced an obvious lipid accumulation and a significant increase in intracellular TG content in NIT-1 cells. PA also induced a remarkable decrease in AMPK protein expression and its downstream targets such as pACC and CPT-1. Meanwhile, AMPK downstream lipogenic genes including SREBP-1c mRNA, FAS and ACC protein expressions were increased. Treatments with BBR and BBR+CA, superior to CA, significantly reversed the above genes changes in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells. However, the synergistic effect of BBR and CA on intracellular TG content was not observed in the present study.It can be concluded that in vitro, BBR and BBR+CA could inhibit PA-induced lipid accumulation by decreasing  and increasing lipid oxidation in NIT-1 pancreatic β cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549163>Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Defense and Peroxiredoxin 6 Are Linked to Biosynthesis of  Ester of 9-Hydroxystearic .</a></h2><p>Fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are lipid mediators with promising antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties that are formed in white adipose tissue (WAT) via de novo , but their biosynthetic enzymes are unknown. Using a combination of lipidomics in WAT, quantitative trait locus mapping, and correlation analyses in rat BXH/HXB recombinant inbred strains, as well as response to oxidative stress in murine models, we elucidated the potential pathway of biosynthesis of several FAHFAs. Comprehensive analysis of WAT samples identified ∼160 regioisomers, documenting the complexity of this lipid class. The linkage analysis highlighted several members of the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 ()-mediated antioxidant defense system (), lipid-handling proteins (), and the family of flavin containing monooxygenases () as the positional candidate genes. Transgenic expression of  and deletion of  genes resulted in reduction of  ester of 9-hydroxystearic  (9-PAHSA) and 11-PAHSA levels, while oxidative stress induced by an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis increased PAHSA levels nonspecifically. Our results indicate that the synthesis of FAHFAs via carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-driven de novo  depends on the adaptive antioxidant system and suggest that FAHFAs may link activity of this system with insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27638259>Increasing  intake enhances milk production and prevents glucose-stimulated fatty  disappearance without modifying systemic glucose tolerance in mid-lactation dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Feeding saturated fatty acids may enhance milk yield in part by decreasing insulin sensitivity and shifting glucose utilization toward the mammary gland. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of  (C16:0) on milk production and insulin sensitivity in cows. Twenty multiparous mid-lactation Holstein cows were enrolled in a study consisting of a 5-d covariate, 49-d treatment, and 14-d posttreatment period. All cows received a common sorghum silage-based diet and were randomly assigned to a diet containing no supplemental fat (control; n=10; 138±45d in milk) or C16:0 at 4% of ration DM (PALM; 98% C16:0; n=10; 136±44d in milk). Blood and milk were collected at routine intervals. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (300mg/kg of body weight) were performed at d -1, 24, and 49 relative to start of treatment. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using a mixed model with fixed effects of treatment and time, and milk yield served as a covariate. The PALM treatment increased milk yield by wk 7. Furthermore, PALM increased milk fat yield and energy-corrected milk at wk 3 and 7. Changes in milk production occurred in parallel with enhanced energy intake. Increased milk fat yield during PALM treatment was due to increased C16:0 and C16:1 incorporation; PALM had no effect on concentration of milk components, BW, or body condition score. Two weeks posttreatment, energy-corrected milk and milk fat yield remained elevated in PALM-fed cows whereas yields of milk were similar between treatments. Increased milk fat yield after PALM treatment was due to increased de novo  and uptake of preformed fatty acids. The basal concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in plasma increased by d 4, 6, and 8 of PALM treatment, a response not observed thereafter. Although PALM supplementation did not modify insulin, glucose, or triacylglycerol levels in plasma, total cholesterol in plasma was elevated by wk 3. Estimated insulin sensitivity was lower during the first week of PALM treatment; however, glucose disposal following glucose tolerance tests was not modified. In contrast, C16:0 feeding reduced glucose-stimulated NEFA disappearance by wk 7. Results demonstrate that increasing dietary energy from C16:0 for 7wk improves milk yield and milk composition without modifying systemic glucose tolerance. Reduced glucose-stimulated NEFA disappearance with C16:0 feeding and elevated circulating NEFA may reflect changes in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

AMPK phosphorylation inhibits SREBP-1, a major transcription factor of de novo , by inhibiting the liver X receptor (LXR) or by direct phosphorylation. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, has regulatory effects on hepatic lipid metabolism as a potent AMPK activator. In this study, we evaluated the anti-steatogenic effects of resveratrol and its derivatives and identified the molecular mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Resveratrol and its derivatives decreased lipid accumulation by free fatty acids (FFA mixture; 0.5 mM, oleic : = 2: 1) in H4IIEC3 cells. Synthesized derivatives of resveratrol had lower cytotoxicity than the parental molecule with similar potency. SY-102 suppressed SREBP-1 maturation by T0901317, an LXR agonist, and decreased SRE luciferase activity and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes. Inhibition of AMPK by pre-treatment with compound C completely blocked the effects of SY-102. To evaluate their efficacy in vivo, mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 days, and resveratrol or SY-102 was administered orally for the last 2 days. Oral administration of the SY-102 increased AMPK phosphorylation, followed by reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation to a similar extent as resveratrol. These data demonstrate that SY-102, a synthesized derivative of resveratrol, might provide a promising therapeutic effect against fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223619>mTORC2 Regulates Lipogenic Gene Expression through PPAR to Control Lipid Synthesis in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) primarily functions as an effector of insulin/PI3K signaling to regulate cell proliferation and is associated with cell metabolism.

MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of AZD8055 on cell proliferation. ELISA assay and GC-MS analysis were used to determine the content of lipid.

Overall, mTORC2 plays a critical role in regulating lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis, and secretion in pBMECs, and this process probably is through PPAR.

To clarify aspects of this difference we have compared the metabolism of oleic (OA, monounsaturated) and  acids (PA, saturated) in human myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with 100μM OA or PA and the metabolism of [(14)C]-labeled fatty  was studied. We observed that PA had a lower lipolysis rate than OA, despite a more than two-fold higher protein level of adipose triglyceride lipase after 24h incubation with PA. PA was less incorporated into triacylglycerol and more incorporated into phospholipids after 24h. Supporting this, incubation with compounds modifying lipolysis and reesterification pathways suggested a less influenced PA than OA metabolism. In addition, PA showed a lower accumulation than OA, though PA was oxidized to a relatively higher extent than OA. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that 24h of PA treatment upregulated  and fatty  β-oxidation and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation compared to OA. The differences in lipid accumulation and lipolysis between OA and PA were eliminated in combination with eicosapentaenoic  (polyunsaturated fatty ). In conclusion, this study reveals that the two most abundant fatty acids in our diet are partitioned toward different metabolic pathways in muscle cells, and this may be relevant to understand the link between dietary fat and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

PA is the most common saturated fatty  accounting for 20-30% of total fatty acids in the human body and can be provided in the diet or synthesized endogenously via  lipogenesis (DNL). PA tissue content seems to be controlled around a well-defined concentration, and changes in its intake do not influence significantly its tissue concentration because the exogenous source is counterbalanced by PA endogenous biosynthesis. Particular physiopathological conditions and nutritional factors may strongly induce DNL, resulting in increased tissue content of PA and disrupted homeostatic control of its tissue concentration. The tight homeostatic control of PA tissue concentration is likely related to its fundamental physiological role to guarantee membrane physical properties but also to consent protein palmitoylation, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) biosynthesis, and in the lung an efficient surfactant activity. In order to maintain membrane phospholipids (PL) balance may be crucial an optimal intake of PA in a certain ratio with unsaturated fatty acids, especially PUFAs of both n-6 and n-3 families. However, in presence of other factors such as positive energy balance, excessive intake of carbohydrates (in particular mono and disaccharides), and a sedentary lifestyle, the mechanisms to maintain a steady state of PA concentration may be disrupted leading to an over accumulation of tissue PA resulting in dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, increased ectopic fat accumulation and increased inflammatory tone via toll-like receptor 4. It is therefore likely that the controversial data on the association of dietary PA with detrimental health effects, may be related to an excessive imbalance of dietary PA/PUFA ratio which, in certain physiopathological conditions, and in presence of an enhanced DNL, may further accelerate these deleterious effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29499237>Metabolomic elucidation of the effects of media and carbon sources on fatty  production by Yarrowia lipolytica.</a></h2><p>Lipid production by oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica depends highly on culture environments, such as carbon sources, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios, types of media, and cellular growth phases.

The high lipid production by Y. lipolytica in SCG was presumed to be due to the higher C/N ratio in SCG than in the complex media. Moreover, glycerol promoted lipid production better than glucose in both complex and minimal media because glycerol can easily incorporate into the core of triglycerides. Metabolite profiling revealed that levels of long-chain fatty acids, such as stearic , , and arachidic , increased in SCG medium. Meanwhile, in complex media supplemented with either glucose or glycerol, levels of amino acids, such as cysteine, methionine, and glycine, highly increased. This metabolomic approach could be applied to modulate the global metabolic network of Y. lipolytica for producing lipids and other valuable products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is critical for innate immunity, is generally believed to aggravate disease progression by inducing inflammation. Unexpectedly, we found that deficiency in TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), a cytosolic adaptor that transduces some TLR signals, worsened hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and that such exacerbation was independent of myeloid cells. The aggravated steatosis in  mice was due to the increased hepatocyte transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1), the rate-limiting enzyme for . Activation of the TRIF pathway by polyinosinic:polycytidylic  [poly(I:C)] suppressed the increase in SCD1 abundance induced by  or an HFD and subsequently prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

Endocannabinoid levels are elevated in the blood of obese individuals and nonobese type 2 diabetes patients. To date, no study has evaluated endocannabinoid levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of subjects with both obesity and type 2 diabetes (OBT2D), characterised by similar adiposity and whole body insulin resistance and lower plasma leptin levels as compared to non-diabetic obese subjects (OB).The levels of anandamide and 2-AG, and of the anandamide-related PPARalpha ligands, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in the SAT obtained by abdominal needle biopsy in 10 OBT2D, 11 OB, and 8 non-diabetic normal-weight (NW) subjects, were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The role of Pex11a in dyslipidaemia and obesity is investigated here with Pex11a knockout mice (Pex11a ). Metabolic phenotypes including tissue weight, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fatty  profile, oxygen consumption, physical activity were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Pex11a fed with a high-fat diet. Molecular changes and peroxisome abundance in adipose tissue were evaluated through qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence. Pex11a showed increased fat mass, decreased skeletal muscle, higher cholesterol levels, and more severely impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Pex11a consumed less oxygen, indicating a decrease in fatty  oxidation, which is consistent with the accumulation of very long- and long-chain fatty acids. Adipose  (C16:0) levels were elevated in Pex11a , which may be because of dramatically increased fatty  synthase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Pex11a deficiency increased ventricle size and macrophage infiltration, which are related to the reduced physical activity.

Among neosynthesized fatty acids,  formation was greatly reduced, suggesting that enzymatic step(s) of de novo fatty synthesis was affected. Only ACC activity was noticeably reduced, but no change in FAS activity was observed. DGAT activity was also inhibited. The decreased intracellular TAG content was paralleled by a reduction in acetate incorporation into VLDL-TAG. Conversely, cholesterol synthesis and HMG-CoA-R were not significantly affected by quercetin.In hepatocytes from normal rats, the quercetin-induced decrease in both de novo fatty  and TAG synthesis, with a consequent reduction in VLDL-TAG formation, may represent a potential mechanism contributing to the reported hypotriacylglycerolemic effect of quercetin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30361530>Adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with low levels of the novel  Hydroxystearic Acids.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue dysfunction is considered an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, a novel family of endogenous lipids,  hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), was discovered. These have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice and are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin resistant humans. In the present study, we investigate if adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with reduced PAHSA levels in human subjects and if PAHSAs influence adipocyte differentiation. Our results show that low expression of adipocyte GLUT4 and adipocyte hypertrophy, markers of adipose tissue dysfunction, are associated with reduced expression of key enzymes for de novo  and adipose tissue levels of PAHSAs in human subjects. We also show that GLUT4 is not only a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction, but may be causally related to the observed impairments. PAHSAs may also act locally in the adipose tissue to improve  through a mechanism bypassing direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ). The discovery of PAHSAs and our current results provide novel insights into positive effects of lipid species in adipose tissue and mechanisms by which dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and risk of developing T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362303>Genome-wide association study identifies novel loci associated with concentrations of four plasma phospholipid fatty acids in the de novo  pathway: results from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND-  (16:0), stearic  (18:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), and oleic  (18:1n-9) are major saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids that affect cellular signaling and metabolic pathways. They are synthesized via de novo  and are the main saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Levels of these fatty acids have been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS- Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 5 population-based cohorts comprising 8961 participants of European ancestry to investigate the association of common genetic variation with plasma levels of these 4 fatty acids. We identified polymorphisms in 7 novel loci associated with circulating levels of ≥1 of these fatty acids. ALG14 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:0 (P=2.7×10(-11)) and lower 18:0 (P=2.2×10(-18)). FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7 (P=6.6×10(-13)) and 18:1n-9 (P=2.2×10(-32)) and lower 18:0 (P=1.3×10(-20)). LPGAT1 (lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase) polymorphisms were associated with lower 18:0 (P=2.8×10(-9)). GCKR (glucokinase regulator; P=9.8×10(-10)) and HIF1AN (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1; P=5.7×10(-9)) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7, whereas PKD2L1 (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1; P=5.7×10(-15)) and a locus on chromosome 2 (not near known genes) were associated with lower 16:1n-7 (P=4.1×10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS- Our findings provide novel evidence that common variations in genes with diverse functions, including protein-glycosylation, polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism, phospholipid modeling, and glucose- and oxygen-sensing pathways, are associated with circulating levels of 4 fatty acids in the de novo  pathway.

Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triacylglycerols and plasma free FA [nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs)] were analyzed by using gas chromatography for the FA composition (molar percentage) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry for deuterium enrichment.In all subjects, VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 was significantly (P < 0.01) related to DNL(Meas) (r = 0.56), liver fat (r = 0.53), and adipose insulin resistance (r = 0.56); similar positive relations were shown with the SCD1₁₆ index, and the pattern in NEFAs echoed that of VLDL-triacylglycerols. Compared with subjects with low LF (3.1 ± 2.7%; n = 11), subjects with high LF (18.4 ± 3.6%; n = 13) exhibited a 45% higher VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 molar percentage (P < 0.01), 16% of subjects had lower 18:2n-6 (P = 0.01), and 27% of subjects had higher DNL as assessed by using a published DNL index (ratio of 16:0 to 18:2n-6; P = 0.03), which was isotopically confirmed by DNL(Meas) (increased 2.5-fold; P < 0.01). Compared with 16:0 in the diet, the low amount of dietary 16:1n-7 in VLDL-triacylglycerols corresponded to a stronger signal of elevated DNL.The current data provide support for the use of the VLDL-triacylglycerol 16:1n-7 molar percentage as a biomarker for elevated liver fat when isotope use is not feasible; however, larger-scale confirmatory studies are needed.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214287>Free fatty -induced histone acetyltransferase activity accelerates lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common metabolic disease triggered by epigenetic alterations, including lysine acetylation at histone or non-histone proteins, affecting the stability or transcription of lipogenic genes.

Furthermore, correlations between lipid accumulation and HAT activity for 22 representative natural food extracts (NExs) were evaluated.Non-histone protein acetylation increased following OPA treatment and the acetylation of histones H3K9, H4K8, and H4K16 was accelerated, accompanied by an increase in HAT activity. OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor.

DNL could affect coronary heart disease (CHD) or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) via generation of specific fatty acids. Whether these fatty acids are prospectively associated with SCA or other CHD events is unknown.The objective was to investigate the relations of 4 fatty acids in the DNL pathway- (16:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic  (16:1n-9), and cis-vaccenic  (18:1n-7)-with incident CHD, including fatal CHD, nonfatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), and SCA.A community-based prospective study was conducted in 2890 men and women aged ≥65 y, who were free of known CHD at baseline and who were followed from 1992 to 2006. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured at baseline by using standardized methods. Incident CHD was ascertained prospectively and was centrally adjudicated by using medical records.

The gene expression of FNDC5/Irisin, associated to key regulators of DNL, inflammation and cancer progression was evaluated in liver tissue of 18 patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation and of 18 deceased donors. Hepatic mRNA expression of FNDC5/Irisin and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), main enzymatic regulator of DNL, were significantly higher in HCC patients than in donors (p<0.0001 and p=0.015, respectively). The hepatic mRNA expression of the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) tended to be higher in HCC patients than in donors (p=0.06). Only in HCC patients, hepatic FNDC5/Irisin strongly correlated with the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, SCD-1, NOTCH1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-6 mRNA expression.

We analyzed global metabolic changes induced by latent infection with an oncogenic virus, Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor of AIDS patients. Approximately one-third of the nearly 200 measured metabolites were altered following latent infection of endothelial cells by KSHV, including many metabolites of anabolic pathways common to most cancer cells. KSHV induced pathways that are commonly altered in cancer cells including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, amino  production and fatty  synthesis. Interestingly, over half of the detectable long chain fatty acids detected in our screen were significantly increased by latent KSHV infection. KSHV infection leads to the elevation of metabolites involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, not degradation from phospholipids, and leads to increased lipid droplet organelle formation in the infected cells. Fatty  synthesis is required for the survival of latently infected endothelial cells, as inhibition of key enzymes in this pathway led to apoptosis of infected cells. Addition of  to latently infected cells treated with a fatty  synthesis inhibitor protected the cells from death indicating that the products of this pathway are essential. Our metabolomic analysis of KSHV-infected cells provides insight as to how oncogenic viruses can induce metabolic alterations common to cancer cells. Furthermore, this analysis raises the possibility that metabolic pathways may provide novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of latent KSHV infection and ultimately KS tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869449>Lipid accumulation stimulates the cap-independent translation of SREBP-1a mRNA by promoting hnRNP A1 binding to its 5'-UTR in a cellular model of hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disease characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Enhanced release of non-esterified fatty acids from adipose tissue accounts for a remarkable fraction of accumulated lipids. However, the de novo  (DNL) is also implicated in the etiology of the NAFLD. Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a transcription factor modulating the expression of several lipogenic enzymes. In the present study, in order to investigate the effect of lipid droplet accumulation on DNL, we used a cellular model of steatosis represented by HepG2 cells cultured in a medium supplemented with free oleic and  fatty acids (FFAs). We report that FFA supplementation induces the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in the DNL as well as for the transcription factor SREBP-1a. The SREBP-1a mRNA translation, dependent on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and the SREBP-1a proteolytic cleavage are activated by FFAs. Furthermore, FFA treatment enhances the expression and the nucleus-cytosolic shuttling of hnRNP A1, a trans-activating factor of SREBP-1a IRES. The binding of hnRNP A1 to the SREBP-1a IRES is also increased upon FFA supplementation. The relocation of hnRNP A1 and the consequent increase of SREBP-1a translation are dependent on the p38 MAPK signal pathway, which is activated by FFAs. By RNA interference approach, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 is implicated in the FFA-induced expression of SREBP-1a and of its target genes as well as in the lipid accumulation in cells.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, CD73, is released from adipocytes into microvesicles in response to the lipogenic stimuli, palmitate, the antidiabetic sulfonylurea drug glimepiride, phosphoinositolglycans (PIG), and H(2)O(2). Upon incubation of microvesicles with adipocytes, CD73 is translocated to cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LD) and esterification is upregulated. The role of CD73-harboring microvesicles in coordinating esterification between differently sized adipocytes was studied here. Populations consisting of either small or large or of both small and large isolated rat adipocytes as well as native adipose tissue pieces from young and old rats were incubated with or depleted of endogenous microvesicles and analyzed for translocation of CD73 and esterification in response to the lipogenic stimuli. Large adipocytes exhibited higher and lower efficacy in releasing CD73 into microvesicles and in translocating CD73 to LD, respectively, compared to small adipocytes. Populations consisting of both small and large adipocytes were more active in esterification in response to the lipogenic stimuli than either small or large adipocytes. With both adipocytes and adipose tissue pieces from young rats esterification stimulation by the lipogenic stimuli was abrogated by depletion of CD73-harboring microvesicles from the incubation medium and interstitial spaces, respectively. In conclusion, stimulus-induced lipid synthesis between differently sized adipocytes is controlled by the release of microvesicle-associated CD73 from large cells and its subsequent translocation to LD of small cells. This information transfer via microvesicles harboring GPI-anchored proteins may shift the burden of triacylglycerol storage from large to small adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013659>Liver MicroRNA-291b-3p Promotes Hepatic  through Negative Regulation of Adenosine 5'-Monophosphate (AMP)-activated Protein Kinase α1.</a></h2><p>In a microarray study, we found that hepatic miR-291b-3p was significantly increased in leptin-receptor-deficient type 2 mice (db/db), a mouse model of diabetes. The function of miR-291b-3p is unknown. The potential role of miR-291b-3p in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism was explored in this study. High-fat diet (HFD)- and chow-fed mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing a miR-291b-3p inhibitor and a miR-291b-3p mimic through the tail vein. Hepatic lipids and lipogenic gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in vitro to identify direct targets of miR-291b-3p. MiR-291b-3p expression and the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were increased in the steatotic liver of db/db mice and HFD-fed mice versus their respective controls. Inhibition of hepatic miR-291b-3p expression prevented increases in hepatic  and steatosis in HFD-fed mice. The opposite was observed when miR-291b-3p was overexpressed in the livers of chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type mice. In vitro studies revealed that silencing of miR-291b-3p in NCTC1469 hepatic cells ameliorated oleic / mixture-induced elevation of cellular triglycerides. Importantly, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-291b-3p. Using metformin, an activator of AMPK, we showed that AMPK activation-induced inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by reduced expression of miR-291b-3p in the liver. Liver miR-291b-3p promoted hepatic  and lipid accumulation in mice. AMPKα1 is a direct target of miR-291b-3p. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-291b-3p promotes hepatic  by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and activity, indicating the therapeutic potential of miR-291b-3p inhibitors in fatty liver disease.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27565538>Dimethylarginine Dimethylaminohydrolase 1 Protects Against High-Fat Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance in Mice.</a></h2><p>High plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, are associated with hepatic dysfunction in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is unknown whether ADMA is involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) is an enzyme that degrades ADMA. In this study, we used Ddah1 mice to investigate the effects of the ADMA/DDAH1 pathway on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis.After HFD feeding for 20 weeks, Ddah1 mice were more obese and had developed more severe hepatic steatosis and worse insulin resistance compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In the livers of HFD-fed mice, loss of DDAH1 resulted in higher levels of lipogenic genes, lower expression of β-oxidation genes, and greater induction of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation than in the WT livers. Furthermore, ADMA treatment in HepG2 cells led to oxidative stress and steatosis, whereas overexpression of DDAH1 attenuated -induced steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Innovation and Conclusion: Our results provide the first direct evidence that the ADMA/DDAH1 pathway has a marked effect on hepatic  and steatosis induced by HFD feeding.

These events are highly dependent on glucose utilization and inhibited by vitamin E (VE) (α-tocopherol) administration. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing lipid metabolism in the gastric mucosa and ethanol-induced gastric damage and the effect of α-tocopherol administration. For this, rates of fatty  β-oxidation and  were tested in gastric mucosa samples. Through histological analysis, we found loss of the mucosa's superficial epithelium, which became gradually normalized during the recovery period. Proliferation of gastric mucosa occurred with augmented formation of β-oxidation by-products, diminished synthesis of triacylglycerols (TGs), as well as of phospholipids, and a reduced cytoplasmic NAD/NADH ratio, whereas the mitochondrial redox NAD/NADH ratio was much less affected. In addition, α-tocopherol increased  utilization in the gastric mucosa, which was accompanied by the induction of 'mirror image' effects on the cell redox state, reflected in an inhibited cell gastric mucosa proliferation by the vitamin administration. In conclusion, the present study shows, for the first time, the role of lipid metabolism in the adaptive cell gastric mucosa changes that drive proliferation after a chronic insult. Moreover, α-tocopherol increased gastric mucosa utilization of  associated with energy production. These events could be associated with its antioxidant properties in co-ordination with regulation of genes and cell pathways, including changes in the cell NAD/NADH redox state.© 2018 The Author(s).

This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with  (PA), a combination of palmitate and oleic , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased  and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153512>Dose- and type-dependent effects of long-chain fatty acids on  and  of bovine adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Differentiation and lipid metabolism of adipocytes have a great influence on milk performance, health, and feed efficiency of dairy cows. The effects of dietary long-chain fatty acids (FA) on  and  of dairy cows are often confounded by other nutritional and physiological factors in vivo. Therefore, this study used an in vitro approach to study the effect of dose and type of long-chain FA on  and  of bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cells were isolated from adipose tissue of dairy cows and induced into mature adipocytes in the presence of various long-chain FA including myristic, , stearic, oleic, or linoleic . When concentrations of myristic, , and oleic acids in adipogenic mediums were 150 and 200 μM, the induced mature adipocytes had greater lipid content compared with other concentrations of FA. In addition, mature adipocytes induced at 100 μM stearic  and 300 μM linoleic  had the greatest content of lipid than at other concentrations. High concentrations of saturated FA were more toxic for cells than the same concentration of unsaturated FA during the induction. When commitment stage was solely treated with FA, the number of differentiated mature adipocytes was greater for oleic and linoleic acids than other FA. When the maturation stage was treated with FA, the number of mature adipocytes was not affected, but the lipid content in adipocytes was affected and ranked oleic > linoleic > myristic > stearic > . In summary, this study showed that  and  of bovine adipocytes were differentially affected by long-chain FA, with unsaturated FA more effective than saturated FA.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

This includes basic research on the pathways of solar energy conversion and on lipid biosynthesis and catabolism, and applied research dealing with the various biological and technical bottlenecks of the lipid production process. In here, we review the current knowledge in microalgal lipids with respect to their metabolism and various biotechnological applications, and we discuss potential future perspectives. The committing step in fatty  biosynthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA that is then introduced in the fatty  synthesis cycle leading to the formation of  and stearic acids. Oleic  may also be synthesized after stearic  desaturation while further conversions of the fatty acids (i.e. desaturations, elongations) occur after their esterification with structural lipids of both plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum. The aliphatic chains are also used as building blocks for structuring storage acylglycerols via the Kennedy pathway. Current research, aiming to enhance  in the microalgal cell, is focusing on over-expressing key-enzymes involved in the earlier steps of the pathway of fatty  synthesis. A complementary plan would be the repression of lipid catabolism by down-regulating acylglycerol hydrolysis and/or β-oxidation. The tendency of oleaginous microalgae to synthesize, apart from lipids, significant amounts of other energy-rich compounds such as sugars, in processes competitive to , deserves attention since the lipid yield may be considerably increased by blocking competitive metabolic pathways. The majority of microalgal production occurs in outdoor cultivation and for this reason biotechnological applications face some difficulties. Therefore, algal production systems need to be improved and harvesting systems need to be more effective in order for their industrial applications to become more competitive and economically viable. Besides, a reduction of the production cost of microalgal lipids can be achieved by combining lipid production with other commercial applications. The combined production of bioactive products and lipids, when possible, can support the commercial viability of both processes. Hydrophobic compounds can be extracted simultaneously with lipids and then purified, while hydrophilic compounds such as proteins and sugars may be extracted from the defatted biomass. The microalgae also have applications in environmental biotechnology since they can be used for bioremediation of wastewater and to monitor environmental toxicants. Algal biomass produced during wastewater treatment may be further valorized in the biofuel manufacture. It is anticipated that the high microalgal lipid potential will force research towards finding effective ways to manipulate biochemical pathways involved in lipid biosynthesis and towards cost effective algal cultivation and harvesting systems, as well.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mice overexpressing GLUT4 in adipocytes (AG4OX) have elevated AT  and enhanced glucose tolerance despite being obese and having elevated circulating fatty acids. Lipidomic analysis of AT identified a structurally unique class of lipids, branched fatty  esters of hydroxy-fatty acids (FAHFAs), which were elevated in AT and serum of AG4OX mice.  esters of hydroxy-stearic acids (PAHSAs) are among the most upregulated FAHFA families in AG4OX mice. Eight PAHSA isomers are present in mouse and human tissues. PAHSA levels are reduced in insulin resistant people, and levels correlate highly with insulin sensitivity. PAHSAs have beneficial metabolic effects. Treatment of obese mice with PAHSAs lowers glycemia and improves glucose tolerance while stimulating glucagon-like peptide 1 and insulin secretion. PAHSAs also reduce inflammatory cytokine production from immune cells and ameliorate adipose inflammation in obesity. PAHSA isomer concentrations are altered in physiological and pathophysiological conditions in a tissue- and isomer-specific manner. The mechanisms most likely involve changes in PAHSA biosynthesis, degradation, and secretion. The discovery of PAHSAs reveals the existence of previously unknown endogenous lipids and biochemical pathways involved in metabolism and inflammation, two fundamental physiological processes.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

Few prospective studies have been conducted, especially among populations with a high carbohydrate intake, to determine whether DNL fatty acids are associated with the risk of the metabolic syndrome (MetS).We aimed to investigate associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway-including myristic  (14:0),  (16:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), hexadecenoic  (16:1n-9), stearic  (18:0), vaccenic  (18:1n-7), and oleic  (18:1n-9)-with the risk of MetS in a Chinese population with an average carbohydrate intake of >60% of energy.A total of 1176 free-living Chinese men and women aged 50-70 y from Beijing and Shanghai were included in our analysis, giving rise to 412 incident MetS cases during 6 y of follow-up. Erythrocyte fatty acids and metabolic traits were measured in these participants.Erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway were correlated with a high ratio of carbohydrate-to-fat intake, less favorable lipid profiles, and elevated liver enzymes at baseline. In comparison with the lowest quartile, RRs (95% CIs) of MetS in the highest quartile were 1.30 (1.04, 1.62; P-trend = 0.007) for 16:1n-7, 1.48 (1.17, 1.86; P-trend < 0.001) for 16:1n-9, 1.26 (1.01, 1.56; P-trend = 0.06) for 18:1n-7, and 1.51 (1.19, 1.92; P-trend < 0.001) for 18:1n-9 after multivariate adjustment for lifestyle factors and body mass index. Moreover, 16:0 and 16:1n-7 were associated with an elevated risk of diabetes.Our findings suggest that fatty acids in the DNL pathway are independently associated with an elevated risk of metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009654>Quercetin induces HepG2 cell apoptosis by inhibiting fatty  biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Quercetin can inhibit the growth of cancer cells with the ability to act as a 'chemopreventer'. Its cancer-preventive effect has been attributed to various mechanisms, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, as well as its antioxidant functions. Quercetin can also reduce . Previous studies have shown that quercetin has potent inhibitory effects on animal fatty  synthase (FASN). In the present study, activity of quercetin was evaluated in human liver cancer HepG2 cells. Intracellular FASN activity was calculated by measuring the absorption of NADPH via a spectrophotometer. MTT assay was used to test the cell viability, immunoblot analysis was performed to detect FASN expression levels and the apoptotic effect was detected by Hoechst 33258 staining. In the present study, it was found that quercetin could induce apoptosis in human liver cancer HepG2 cells with overexpression of FASN. This apoptosis was accompanied by the reduction of intracellular FASN activity and could be rescued by 25 or 50 μM exogenous  acids, the final product of FASN-catalyzed synthesis. These results suggested that the apoptosis induced by quercetin was via the inhibition of FASN. These findings suggested that quercetin may be useful for preventing human liver cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189916>Chronic administration of saturated fats and fructose differently affect SREBP activity resulting in different modulation of Nrf2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome pathways in mice liver.</a></h2><p>The overconsumption of both saturated fats and fructose in the modern society has been related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the specific contribution of individual dietary components on the progression of NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the dissimilar effects of these two dietary components on selected proinflammatory and antioxidant pathways in the liver of C57BL/6 mice fed a standard (SD), a 45% saturated fat (HFAT) or a 60% fructose (HFRT) diet for 12 weeks. HFAT diet evoked systemic metabolic alterations and overweight, not observed in HFRT mice. However, HFRT mice had a greater hepatic triglyceride deposition with increased ratio of triacylglycerols containing the  compared to HFAT, as assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This effect is due to the higher activation of the SCAP/SREBP1c lipogenic pathway by HFRT feeding. In addition, we found inhibition of Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant signaling and more robust stimulation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome pathway in the livers of HFRT-fed mice when compared with HFAT-fed mice, which is consistent with the recent finding that palmitate and SREBP1c are implicated in hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects were associated with increased hepatic inflammation, as confirmed by high expression of markers of leukocyte infiltration in the HFRT group. Thus, we hypothesize an amplifying loop among , palmitate, Nrf2 and Nlrp3 that leads to a higher risk of NAFLD progression to NASH in a high-fructose diet compared to a high-saturated fat intake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ACC1 localizes in the cytoplasm and produces malonyl-CoA for fatty  (FA) synthesis. ACC2 localizes in the outer mitochondrial membrane and produces malonyl-CoA that inhibits FA import into mitochondria for subsequent oxidation. We hypothesized that ACCs are checkpoints in adipocyte differentiation and tested this hypothesis using the ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitor soraphen A (SA) in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 100nM SA for 8 days after induction of differentiation, the expression of PPARγ mRNA and FABP4 mRNA decreased by 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with solvent controls; the decrease in gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in FABP4 protein expression and associated with a decrease in lipid droplet accumulation. The rate of FA oxidation was 300% greater in SA-treated cells compared with vehicle controls. Treatment with exogenous palmitate restored PPARγ and FABP4 mRNA expression and FABP4 protein expression in SA-treated cells. In contrast, SA did not alter lipid accumulation if treatment was initiated on day eight after induction of differentiation. We conclude that loss of ACC1-dependent FA synthesis and loss of ACC2-dependent inhibition of FA oxidation prevent lipid accumulation in adipocytes and inhibit early stages of adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that Bscl2 (-/-) mice develop lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) due to unbridled lipolysis. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) displays a browning phenotype with much smaller lipid droplets (LD) and higher expression of brown adipose tissue marker proteins. Here we used targeted lipidomics and gene expression profiling to analyze lipid profiles as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism in WAT of wild-type and Bscl2(-/-) mice. Analysis of total saponified fatty acids revealed that the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice contained a much higher proportion of oleic 18:1n9  concomitant with a lower proportion of  16:0 , as well as increased n3- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remodeling. The acyl chains in major species of triacylglyceride (TG) and diacylglyceride (DG) in the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice were also enriched with dietary fatty acids. These changes could be reflected by upregulation of several fatty  elongases and desaturases. Meanwhile, Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes from EWAT had increased gene expression in lipid uptake and TG synthesis but not de novo . Both mitochondria and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes were also markedly increased in Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes, highlighting that these machineries were accelerated to shunt the lipolysis liberated fatty acids through uncoupling to dissipate energy. The residual subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) was not browning but displays similar changes in lipid metabolism. Overall, our data emphasize that, other than being essential for adipocyte differentiation, Bscl2 is also important in fatty  remodeling and energy homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25700562>Preservation of high-fat diet-induced femoral trabecular bone loss through genetic target of TNF-α.</a></h2><p>Obesity and osteoporosis are two common chronic diseases, however, the basis for the correlation between them remains largely unknown. The pro-inflammation cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays important roles in lipid and bone metabolisms, which may be a good candidate in the correlation between obesity and osteoporosis. We investigated the pathological roles of TNF-α in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced bone loss. Wild-type (WT) mice and TNF-α knockout (TNF-α(-/-)) mice were fed with the standard diet or the HFD for 12 weeks. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from both genotypes were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts and treated with  (PA). Bone mass and microstructure of femurs were evaluated by micro-CT. Lipid and bone metabolisms were investigated by histological and plasma analyses, and real-time PCR. On the HFD, both TNF-α(-/-) and WT mice presented notable visceral obesity, dyslipidemia.  and osteoclastogenesis were enhanced, while osteoblastogenesis was reduced in both genotypes. However, the changes were significantly different between TNF-α(-/-) and WT mice after the HFD. The gain of body and fat-pad weight was less and adipocyte area was smaller by 22 % in TNF-α(-/-) mice. Osteoclast numbers and plasma CTX level were lower by 40 % and by 23 % in TNF-α(-/-) mice. There were more ALP positive cells in the PA-treated TNF-α(-/-) BMSCs. mRNA expression of PPAR-γ was lower while that of Runx2 was higher in the bone from TNF-α(-/-) HFD group and in the PA-treated TNF-α(-/-) BMSCs, compared to WT on the same treatment. Furthermore, femoral trabecular bone mass and trabecular bone number were significantly decreased in WT mice on the HFD, whereas they were increased by 1.56-fold and 1.53-fold, respectively, in TNF-α(-/-) mice on the same diet (P < 0.05). Our results demonstrated that TNF-α gene knockout retained HFD-induced femoral trabecular bone loss mainly by suppressing  and osteoclastogenesis, and enhancing osteoblastogenesis, which suggests that TNF-α plays a critical role in the development of HFD-related bone metabolic disorders and it may be a new potential therapeutic target for obesity-related bone loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26201685>Lipopolysaccharide binding protein is an adipokine involved in the resilience of the mouse adipocyte to inflammation.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP) is a novel 65 kDa adipokine, linked to adipose tissue (AT) inflammation, obesity and insulin resistance, that inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms behind these detrimental effects on  through whole-genome transcriptomics and in vitro experiments.Permanent and transient knockdown (KD) and co-culture experiments were performed in 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cell lines during adipocyte differentiation. Microarray gene expression was performed using Genechip Affymetrix technology and validated by real-time PCR.LBP KD of 3T3-L1 cells led to a potentiated adipocyte differentiation with a dose-response relationship; genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty  metabolism and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) action were dramatically upregulated in parallel to increased insulin signalling. Cells with LBP KD became refractory to proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory stimuli (LPS and palmitate). This phenotype, mediated through disrupted nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signalling, was reversed by a soluble factor present in a co-culture with native cells and by exogenous LBP. Double-silencing of LBP and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) again rendered these cells insensitive to co-culture, LBP and inflammatory factors.In summary, LBP is a proinflammatory soluble adipokine that acts as a brake for , strengthening the negative effects of palmitate and LPS on adipocyte differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722377>Chalcones suppress fatty -induced lipid accumulation through a LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive lipid accumulation in the liver has been proposed to cause hyperlipidemia, diabetes and fatty liver disease. 4-Hydroxyderricin (4HD), xanthoangelol (XAG), cardamonin (CAR) and flavokawain B (FKB) are chalcones that have exhibited various biological effects against obesity, inflammation, and diabetes; however, little is known about the inhibitory effects of these chalcones on fatty liver disease. In the present study, we investigated the ability of 4HD, XAG, CAR, and FKB to reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. When HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of fatty acids (FAs;  : oleic  = 1 : 2 ratio), significant lipid accumulation was observed. Under the same experimental conditions, addition of chalcones at 5 μM significantly suppressed the FA-induced lipid accumulation. We found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key molecule involved in , was decreased in these chalcone-treated cells. We also found that these chalcones increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is involved in FA oxidation. Moreover, these chalcones increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), upstream regulators of SREBP-1 and PPARα. We confirmed that an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, reversed chalcone-induced changes in SREBP-1 and PPARα expression in the HepG2 cells. Collectively, we found that 4HD, XAG, CAR, and XAG attenuated lipid accumulation through activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25686501>The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ is regulated by Krüppel-like transcription factors 6 & 9 under steatotic conditions.</a></h2><p>Liver steatosis is characterised by lipid droplet deposition in hepatocytes that can leads to an inflammatory and fibrotic phenotype. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play key roles in energetic homeostasis by regulating lipid metabolism in hepatic tissue. In adipose tissue PPARγ regulates the adipocyte differentiation by promoting the expression of lipid-associated genes. Within the liver PPARγ is up-regulated under steatotic conditions; however, which transcription factors participate in its expression is not completely understood. Krüppel-like transcription factors (KLFs) regulate various cellular mechanisms, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. KLFs are key components of  by regulating the expression of PPARγ and other proteins such as the C-terminal enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Here, we demonstrate that the transcript levels of Klf6, Klf9 and Pparγ are increased in response to a steatotic insult in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIp) experiments showed that klf6 and klf9 are actively recruited to the Pparγ promoter region under these conditions. Accordingly, the loss-of-function experiments reduced cytoplasmic triglyceride accumulation. Here, we demonstrated that KLF6 and KLF9 proteins directly regulate PPARγ expression under steatotic conditions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A series of studies has questioned the ubiquity of  in parasitoid wasps suggesting that the vast majority of species have lost the ability to synthesize fatty acids de novo. One such species is Nasonia vitripennis, which, like the congeneric species N. giraulti and N. longicornis, uses a fatty -derived male sex pheromone for sexual communication. Here we demonstrate by feeding fully C-labeled α-D-glucose and analyzing insect-derived fatty  methyl esters and the male sex pheromone by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that both males and females of N. vitripennis as well as N. giraulti and N. longicornis are capable of synthesizing fatty acids de novo. We furthermore show by a proteomics approach that predicted fatty  synthase, ATP-citrate synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, key enzymes of , are expressed in the male pheromone gland of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. Labeling experiments with Urolepis rufipes, a closely related species producing a male sex pheromone independently of fatty acids via the mevalonate pathway, revealed that both sexes are likewise able to synthesize fatty acids de novo. We conclude that the parasitoid wasp species studied here, irrespective of the biosynthetic origin of their sex pheromones, are capable of responding flexibly to lipid shortage during their adult life by keeping enzymatic machinery for  running.Copyright © 2019.

We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo  proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

At the end of 16 weeks, hepatic miR-192-5p and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) levels were measured. MiR-192-5p mimic and inhibitor and SCD-1 siRNA were transfected into Huh7 cells exposed to  (PA). Lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining and triglyceride assays. Direct interaction was validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays.The HFD rats showed a 0.46-fold decrease and a 3.5-fold increase in hepatic miR-192-5p and SCD-1 protein levels compared with controls, respectively, which could be reversed after disease remission by liraglutide injection ( < 0.01). The Huh7 cells exposed to PA also showed down-regulation and up-regulation of miR-192-5p and SCD-1 protein levels, respectively ( < 0.01).

We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-linolenic , 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes.

The present study intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of AA on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with lipid accumulation by activating Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) signaling. C57BL/6 mice were received a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet with 71% high-fat (L-D) and treated with AA (20 and 40 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline for 12 weeks. The regulation of AA on lipid accumulation was also detected in pro-steatotic stimulated AML12 cells with  (PA). When L-D diet-fed mice were treated with AA, loss in body weight, liver index, and liver lipid droplet were observed along with reduced triglyceride (TG) and serum transaminase. Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated lipid accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating lipid accumulation and fatty  synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Also, the delta-9 DI for the newly synthesized 18:0 and 18:1 pools was higher at 2 and 6 hours postprandial, with a pattern of change which supports the increased stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) activity following high carbohydrate feeding followed by a down regulation of this enzyme.Our data show that high sucrose meals increase the relative contribution of systemic DNL produced fatty acids to the total postprandial plasma fatty  pool. These data also show that a different pattern of both fatty  synthesis and disposal occurs depending on energy and macronutrient profile of the meal.

PAHSA administration in mice lowers ambient glycemia and improves glucose tolerance while stimulating GLP-1 and insulin secretion. PAHSAs also reduce adipose tissue inflammation. In adipocytes, PAHSAs signal through GPR120 to enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Thus, FAHFAs are endogenous lipids with the potential to treat type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we revealed a repertoire of miRs dysregulated in NAFLD by high-throughput sequencing. Here, we showed that microRNA-199a-3p was down-regulated in the livers of C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat-diet (HFD) and oleic /-induced Hepa1-6 cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that microRNA-199a-3p exhibited a suppressive role in hepatic . Adenoviral mediated microRNA-199a-3p expression in C57BL/6J mice largely attenuated triglyceride (TG) accumulation and expression of lipogenic genes. Furthermore, we identified Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) as the functional target of miR-124. Restoration of Sp1 expression largely compromised the effect of microRNA-199a-3p on hepatic TG metabolism. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel function of microRNA-199a-3p/Sp1 axis in NAFLD and provide a mechanism underlying perturbations of hepatic TG homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940464>Synthesis and biological evaluations of marine oxohexadecenoic acids: PPARα/γ dual agonism and anti-diabetic target gene effects.</a></h2><p>Obesity and associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have reached epidemic proportions. Several natural products have been reported as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists, functioning as lead compounds towards developing new anti-diabetic drugs due to adverse side effects of existing PPAR drugs. We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic  (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic  (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis, pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPARα and -γ, with EC values in the micromolar range, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive  when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but with lowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation compared to the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. Importantly, whole transcriptome analysis shows that both compounds induce anti-diabetic gene programs in adipocytes by upregulating insulin-sensitizing adipokines and repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)- and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with , fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of -related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105962>7-Hydroxymatairesinol improves body weight, fat and sugar metabolism in C57BJ/6 mice on a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>7-Hydroxymatairesinol (7-HMR) is a plant lignan abundant in various concentrations in plant foods. The objective of this study was to test HMRLignan™, a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea abies extract (total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a background of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice and in the 3T3-L1  model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in male mice, whereas their metabolites inhibit  and lipid uptake in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077002>Palmitoleic (16:1 cis-9) and cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)  alter  in bovine adipocyte cultures.</a></h2><p>Our objectives were to: (1) confirm elongation products of palmitoleic  (16:1 cis-9) elongation in vitro using stable isotopes and (2) evaluate if exogenous supplementation of palmitoleic , elongation products, or both are responsible for decreased desaturation and  rates observed with palmitoleic  supplementation in bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cultures were isolated from adipose tissue of two beef carcasses, allowed to reach confluence, held for 2 days, and differentiated with a standard hormone cocktail (day 0). On day 2, secondary differentiation media containing 1 of 4 fatty  treatments [0 μM fatty  (control), or 150 μM  (16:0), palmitoleic, or cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)] was added for 4 days. On day 6, cells were incubated with [(13)C] 16:1, [(13)C] 2, or [(13)C] 18:0 to estimate elongation, lipogenic, and desaturation rates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enrichment of [(13)C] 18:1 cis-11 confirmed 18:1 cis-11 is an elongation product of 16:1. Additionally, [(13)C] label was seen in 20:1 cis-13 and cis-9, cis-11 CLA. Synthesis of [(13)C] 16:0 from [(13)C] 2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic  and cis-vaccenic -treated compared with control cells following 36 h incubation. By 12 h of [(13)C] 18:0 incubation, cells supplemented with palmitoleic  had reduced (P < 0.05) [(13)C] 18:1 cis-9 compared with all other treatments. Gene expression and fatty  results support isotopic data for  and desaturation. Therefore, palmitoleic  is actively elongated in vitro and its elongation product, cis-vaccenic , can also reduce . However, inhibition of desaturation can be directly attributed to palmitoleic  and not its elongation products, 18:1 cis-11 or 20:1 cis-13.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759573>Alternation of plasma fatty acids composition and desaturase activities in children with liver steatosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate changes in plasma fatty acids proportions and estimated desaturase activities for variable grading of liver steatosis in children.In total, 111 schoolchildren (aged 8-18 years) were included in the analysis from March 2015 to August 2016. Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05). In all subjects, the NAFLD score was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (r = 0.696), homeostasis model of assessment ratio-index (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.510), SCD1(16) (r = 0.273), and the delta-6 index (r = 0.494); and inversely associated with the delta-5 index (r = -0.443).Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance. In addition, increased endogenous  through altered desaturase activity may contribute to the progression of liver steatosis in children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511897>Suppression of  by valproic  through repression of USF1-activated fatty  synthesis in adipocytes.</a></h2><p>VPA (valproic ), a short-chain fatty  that is a HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, is known to suppress . In the present study, we identified the molecular mechanism of VPA-mediated suppression of  in adipocytes. VPA suppressed the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerol. The expression levels of PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) and C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α), which are key regulators of , as well as the expression of SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), were decreased by the treatment with VPA. Moreover, glycerol release was decreased in the VPA-treated cells, even though the transcription levels of ATGL (adipose triacylglycerol lipase), HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) and MGL (monoacylglycerol lipase), all of which are involved in lipolysis, were elevated by the treatment with VPA. It is noteworthy that the expression level of FAS (fatty  synthase) was significantly suppressed when the cells were cultured in medium containing VPA. Furthermore, VPA-mediated suppression of the accumulation of the intracellular triacylglycerols was prevented by the treatment with , a major product of FAS. The results of promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that USF1(upstream stimulating factor 1) bound to the E-box of the promoter region of the FAS gene. In addition, the expression of USF1 was decreased by the treatment with VPA. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of the USF1 gene repressed  along with the decreased expression of the FAS gene. The overexpression of USF1 enhanced both  and the expression of FAS in VPA-treated cells. These results indicate that VPA suppressed  through the down-regulation of USF1-activated fatty  synthesis in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25564660>Insulin-independent regulation of hepatic triglyceride synthesis by fatty acids.</a></h2><p>A central paradox in type 2 diabetes is the apparent selective nature of hepatic insulin resistance--wherein insulin fails to suppress hepatic glucose production yet continues to stimulate , resulting in hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Although efforts to explain this have focused on finding a branch point in insulin signaling where hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism diverge, we hypothesized that hepatic triglyceride synthesis could be driven by substrate, independent of changes in hepatic insulin signaling. We tested this hypothesis in rats by infusing [U-(13)C] palmitate to measure rates of fatty  esterification into hepatic triglyceride while varying plasma fatty  and insulin concentrations independently. These experiments were performed in normal rats, high fat-fed insulin-resistant rats, and insulin receptor 2'-O-methoxyethyl chimeric antisense oligonucleotide-treated rats. Rates of fatty  esterification into hepatic triglyceride were found to be dependent on plasma fatty  infusion rates, independent of changes in plasma insulin concentrations and independent of hepatocellular insulin signaling. Taken together, these results obviate a paradox of selective insulin resistance, because the major source of hepatic lipid synthesis, esterification of preformed fatty acids, is primarily dependent on substrate delivery and largely independent of hepatic insulin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527759>Prospective association of fatty acids in the de novo  pathway with risk of type 2 diabetes: the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>Experimental evidence suggests that hepatic de novo  (DNL) affects insulin homeostasis via synthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Few prospective studies have used fatty  biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [ (16:0) and stearic  (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic  (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty  biomarkers [myristic  (14:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic  (16:1n-9), and vaccenic  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating  and stearic  were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic  showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle,  (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic  (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic  was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses, vaccenic  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty  biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating  and stearic  were associated with higher diabetes risk, and vaccenic  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

Endurance-trained athletes have high amounts of IMTG but are insulin sensitive, suggesting IMTG content alone does not change insulin action. Recent data suggest increased muscle lipid synthesis protects against fat-induced insulin resistance. We hypothesized that rates of IMTG synthesis at rest would be increased in athletes compared with controls. Eleven sedentary men and 11 endurance-trained male cyclists participated in this study. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed to assess insulin action. After 3 days of dietary control and an overnight fast, [13C16]palmitate was infused at 0.0174 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1) for 4 h, followed by a muscle biopsy to measure isotope incorporation into IMTG and diacylglycerol. Compared with controls, athletes were twice as insulin sensitive (P=0.004) and had a significantly greater resting IMTG concentration (athletes: 20.4+/-1.6 microg IMTG/mg dry wt, controls: 14.5+/-1.8 microg IMTG/mg dry wt, P=0.04) and IMTG fractional synthesis rate (athletes: 1.56+/-0.37%/h, controls: 0.61+/-0.15%/h, P=0.03). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 mRNA expression (P=0.02) and protein content (P=0.03) were also significantly greater in athletes. Diacylglycerol, but not IMTG, saturation was significantly less in athletes compared with controls (P=0.002). These data indicate endurance-trained athletes have increased synthesis rates of skeletal muscle IMTG and decreased saturation of skeletal muscle diacylglycerol. Increased synthesis rates are not due to recovery from exercise and are likely adaptations to chronic endurance exercise training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317502>Macrophages with a deletion of the  () gene have a more proinflammatory phenotype.</a></h2><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) is a metabolic enzyme that is integral to the gluconeogenic and glyceroneogenic pathways. However, Pck1's role in macrophage metabolism and function is unknown. Using stable isotopomer MS analysis in a mouse model with a myeloid cell-specific  deletion, we show here that this deletion increases the proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Incubation of LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with [U-C]glucose revealed reduced C labeling of citrate and malate and increased C labeling of lactate in Pck1-deleted bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that the Pck1 deletion in the myeloid cells increases reactive oxygen species (ROS). Of note, this altered macrophage metabolism increased expression of the M1 cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. We therefore conclude that  contributes to M1 polarization in macrophages. Our findings provide important insights into the factors determining the macrophage inflammatory response and indicate that Pck1 activity contributes to metabolic reprogramming and polarization in macrophages.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28577569>Overexpression of apolipoprotein A-I alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Abnormal lipid metabolism may contribute to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) accepts cellular free cholesterol and phospholipids transported by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 to generate nascent high density lipoprotein particles. Previous studies have revealed that the overexpression of apoA-I alleviated hepatic lipid levels by modifying lipid transport.

Eight-week-old male apoA-I transgenic or C57BL/6 wild-type mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg/kg body weight tunicamycin or with saline. At 48 h after injecting, blood and liver samples were collected.The overexpression of apoA-I in the models above resulted in decreased protein levels of ER stress makers and lipogenic gene products, including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1, fatty  synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. In addition, the cellular levels of triglycerides and free cholesterol also decreased. Some of gene products which are related to ER stress-associated apoptosis were also affected by apoA-I overexpression.

However, whether TMAO aggravates liver steatosis by modulating BA metabolism and the related mechanisms has not been investigated.A case-control study including biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 34) and controls (n = 14) is conducted to determine the correlation between TMAO and BA metabolism. Serum levels of total BA and the percentage of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-antagonistic BA species are markedly higher in NAFLD patients than in the controls. Serum levels of TMAO positively correlated with the serum levels of total BA and hepatic mRNA expression of cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In a murine model, it is found that 18 weeks administration of TMAO impairs liver function and increases hepatic triglyceride accumulation and  in mice fed with a high-fat diet. TMAO increases BA synthesis and shifted hepatic BA composition toward FXR-antagonistic activity.

Whereas both a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD) and a choline-deficient diet (CDD) lead to hepatic triglyceride accumulation, MCDD alone is associated with hepatic insulin resistance and inflammation (steatohepatitis). We used metabolic tracer techniques, including stable isotope ([¹³C₄]palmitate) dilution and mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) of [¹³C₂]acetate, to define differences in intrahepatic fatty  metabolism that could explain the contrasting effect of MCDD and CDD on NASH in C57Bl6 mice. Compared with control-supplemented (CS) diet, liver triglyceride pool sizes were similarly elevated in CDD and MCDD groups (24.37 ± 2.4, 45.94 ± 3.9, and 43.30 ± 3.5 μmol/liver for CS, CDD, and MCDD, respectively), but intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration and plasma alanine aminotransferase (31 ± 3, 48 ± 4, 231 ± 79 U/l, P < 0.05) were elevated only in MCDD mice. However, despite loss of peripheral fat in MCDD mice, neither the rate of appearance of palmitate (27.2 ± 3.5, 26.3 ± 2.3, and 28.3 ± 3.5 μmol·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) nor the contribution of circulating fatty acids to the liver triglyceride pool differed between groups. Unlike CDD, MCDD had a defect in hepatic triglyceride export that was confirmed using intravenous tyloxapol (142 ± 21, 122 ± 15, and 80 ± 7 mg·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, P < 0.05). Moreover, hepatic de novo  was significantly elevated in the MCDD group only (1.4 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.4, and 3.4 ± 0.4 μmol/day, P < 0.01).

DNL up-regulation is able to induce fat accumulation through an increase in fatty acids. To investigate the relationship between DNL up-regulation and the accumulation of fatty acids and lipid droplets in response to 2,2',4,4' tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47), we examined DNL in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Transcription levels of DNL-related genes were increased after exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 for 24h. After exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47,  was significantly increased (P<0.05) at days 1 and 4, along with upregulation of fatty  synthesis-related genes (e.g., desaturases and elongases).

Lipid droplet area significantly increased in Nile red staining analysis after 24h of exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 in T. japonicus, while DNL was down-regulated in response to 500μM salicylate (a  inhibitor), indicating that BDE-47 exposure is closely associated with an increase in fatty acids in this copepod.

We have evaluated effects of pharmacological inhibition of ACC by soraphen (SP) on high fat (HF) diet-induced insulin resistance in mice.Male C57Bl6/J mice were fed control chow, a HF diet or a HF diet supplemented with SP (50 or 100 mg/kg/day).Body weight gain and total body fat content of SP-treated animals were significantly reduced compared with HF-fed mice. Fractional synthesis of palmitate was significantly reduced in mice treated with SP, indicative for ACC1 inhibition. Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly elevated by SP, reflecting simultaneous inhibition of ACC2 activity. Mice treated with SP showed improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, as assessed by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps.Pharmacological inhibition of the ACC system is of potential use for treatment of key components of the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923600>Natural Abundance Carbon Isotopic Analysis Indicates the Equal Contribution of Local Synthesis and Plasma Uptake to Palmitate Levels in the Mouse Brain.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty acids are the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, however, there has been some debate regarding the ability of intact dietary saturated fatty acids to be incorporated into the brain. In the present study, we use compound specific isotope analysis to measure the natural abundance carbon isotopic signature of brain, liver, and blood  (PAM) and compare it to the dietary PAM and sugar isotopic signatures to calculate the relative contribution of both the incorporation of intact and endogenously synthesized PAM to these pools. Mice were equilibrated to the study diet, and extracted fatty acids were analyzed with gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine the carbon isotopic signature of PAM (δ C ). Liver, serum total, and serum unesterified fatty  δ C ranged between -20.6 and -21.1 mUr and were approximately 8.5 mUr more enriched in  C when compared to the dietary PAM signature. Brain δ C was found to be more enriched than liver or blood pools (-16.7 ± 0.2 mUr, mean ± SD). Two end-member-mixed modeling using the carbon isotopic signature of dietary PAM and dietary sugars determined the contribution of synthesis to the total tissue PAM pool to range between 44% and 48%. This suggests that endogenous synthesis and dietary PAM are near equal contributors to brain, liver, and blood PAM pools. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that brain PAM levels are maintained by both local endogenous synthesis and through the uptake of intact PAM from the blood.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057608>Inhibitory effects of high stability fucoxanthin on -induced lipid accumulation in human adipose-derived stem cells through modulation of long non-coding RNA.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a serious worldwide disease, which is growing in epidemic proportions. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are characterized as a source of mesenchymal stem cells that have acted as a potential application for regeneration. Recently, seaweeds rich in flavonoids and polysaccharides have been supposed to show the ability to modulate risk factors for obesity and related diseases. In the present study, we investigated the anti-obesity properties of high stability fucoxanthin (HS-Fx) derived from brown seaweeds on the  of ADSCs upon treatment with  (PA). First, we showed the differentiation capability of ADSCs from morbid obesity patients to transform into different cell types. Second, we found that the co-treatment of ADSCs with HS-Fx and PA showed no significant cytotoxicity against ADSCs, but PA induced the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid droplet accumulation was abolished. Thirdly, the PA-mediated down-regulation of lipid metabolism genes was reversed by the treatment of HS-Fx. By long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) screening, we found that PA-induced increases in the targeted lncRNAs were also decreased upon treatment with HS-Fx. On Silencing, these lncRNAs corresponded to the decrease in the lipid droplet accumulation of ADSCs induced by PA. ADSCs from obese patients would be direct and meaningful model cells to investigate the development of obesity-related diseases and their treatments, rather than cell lines from other species. HS-Fx showed anti-obesity capability through modulating the elevation of ROS, down-regulation of lipid metabolism genes induced by PA, and upstream signaling, which might be critically resulted from the expression of lncRNAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23048135>Effect of linseed addition on the expression of some lipid metabolism genes in the adipose tissue of young Italian Simmental and Holstein bulls.</a></h2><p>The objective of this trial was to determine the effect of breed and long-term dietary linseed addition on composition of fatty acids and expression of some genes involved in the lipid metabolism within subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissue of young bulls. Italian Simmental and Holstein bulls (n=16/breed) were fed a corn silage-grass hay diet with or without 8% (DM basis) whole ground linseed. Inclusion of linseed, rich in α-linoleic  (C18:3n-3), increased (P<0.05) the proportions of linolelaidic (C18:2n-6trans), γ-linolenic (C18:3n-6), C18:3n-3, and rumenic (cis9,trans11 conjugated linoleic ) acids, as well as total n-3 fatty , total PUFA, and PUFA:SFA, but decreased (P<0.05) weight percentages of myristic (C14:0), pentadecanoic (C15:0),  (C16:0), palmitelaidic (C16:1n-9trans), and margaric (C17:0) acids, along with n-6:n-3, in the s.c. fat of young bulls. Even though PUFA were similar (P≥0.23) between bull breeds, s.c. fat from Holstein bulls had greater (P<0.05) proportions of tridecylic (C13:0), myristoleic (C14:1) and palmitoleic (C16:1n-9cis) acids and a lower (P<0.05) proportion of margaric (C17:0)  than s.c. fat from Simmental bulls.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA) are known regulators of fatty  metabolism. However, their roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes remain incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of EPA and the LXR agonist T0901317 on saturated fatty  ()-induced apoptosis in the insulinoma β-cell line INS-1, a model for insulin-secreting β-cells. T0901317 significantly promoted -induced apoptotic cell death in the INS-1 cells. Consistent with these results, caspase-3 activity and BAX and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA levels were markedly increased in INS-1 cells co-administered  and T0901317. The production of reactive oxygen species was considerably higher in the cells cultured concurrently with T0901317 and  than in the cells incubated with either agent alone. EPA treatment attenuated the cellular death promoted by  and T0901317 in the INS-1 cells, disclosing a possible mediating mechanism involving the inhibition of SREBP-1c. Finally, T0901317 up-regulated the -induced expression of p27(KIP1), transforming growth factor beta 1, and SMAD3 proteins in INS-1 cells. These results demonstrate that -induced apoptosis in β-cells is enhanced by T0901317 via the activation of LXRs and is blocked by EPA via the inhibition of SREBP-1c, suggesting that the regulation of  and lipotoxicity affecting pancreatic β-cell viability and insulin production may be a unique strategy for diabetes therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142454>Procyanidin B2 ameliorates free fatty acids-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state.</a></h2><p>Procyanidin B2, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, has been reported to exert multiple beneficial functions. However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating -related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic fatty acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of , oleic  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced liver steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Different pathogenic processes have been proposed, among them, an increase of bone marrow (BM) fat resulting from adipocyte accumulation. Marrow adipocytes are active BM residents that influence the microenvironment by releasing cytokines, adipokines, and free fatty acids (FA). We explored the impact of palmitate (Palm) and oleate on function and survival of BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) of osteonecrotic patients (ONMSC) and healthy volunteers. Moreover, we analyzed the FA profile of the serum and the BM supernatant fluid (BMSF). We demonstrated that exposure to the saturated FA Palm favored MSC differentiation through the adipogenic lineage at the expense of the osteoblastic phenotype. Moreover,  was intensified in ONMSC. The susceptibility to Palm toxicity was aggravated in ONMSC concomitantly with a greater activation of the proapoptotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Moreover, cellular mechanisms implicated in the protection against lipotoxicity, such as stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 expression, were dysregulated in ONMSC. Palm-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion was also exacerbated in ONMSC. Our results established that, in the serum, the FA profiles were comparable in ON and healthy subjects. However, both the concentrations and the FA composition were modified in the BMSF of ON patients, highlighting a drastic change of the BM microenvironment in ON patients. Altogether, our work suggests that marrow adipocyte enlargement could affect the process of bone remodeling and, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of ON.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576936>Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate ameliorates hepatic steatosis by inhibiting  and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an epidemic disease in adults and children worldwide. Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in oleic  (OA) and  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed  by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced inflammation in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways.

It is located on pig chromosome 8 (SSC8) in a region where a QTL affecting , and palmitoleic  composition was previously detected, using an Iberian x Landrace intercross. The main goal of this work was to fine-map the QTL and to evaluate the ELOVL6 gene as a positional candidate gene affecting the percentages of  and palmitoleic fatty acids in pigs.The combination of a haplotype-based approach and single-marker analysis allowed us to identify the main, associated interval for the QTL, in which the ELOVL6 gene was identified and selected as a positional candidate gene. A polymorphism in the promoter region of ELOVL6, ELOVL6:c.-533C>T, was highly associated with the percentage of  and palmitoleic acids in muscle and backfat. Significant differences in ELOVL6 gene expression were observed in backfat when animals were classified by the ELOVL6:c.-533C>T genotype. Accordingly, animals carrying the allele associated with a decrease in ELOVL6 gene expression presented an increase in C16:0 and C16:1(n-7) fatty  content and a decrease of elongation activity ratios in muscle and backfat. Furthermore, a SNP genome-wide association study with ELOVL6 relative expression levels in backfat showed the strongest effect on the SSC8 region in which the ELOVL6 gene is located. Finally, different potential genomic regions associated with ELOVL6 gene expression were also identified by GWAS in liver and muscle, suggesting a differential tissue regulation of the ELOVL6 gene.Our results suggest ELOVL6 as a potential causal gene for the QTL analyzed and, subsequently, for controlling the overall balance of fatty  composition in pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964317>Dietary carnosic  suppresses hepatic steatosis formation via regulation of hepatic fatty  metabolism in high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>In this study, we examined the hepatic anti-steatosis activity of carnosic  (CA), a phenolic compound of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) leaves, as well as its possible mechanism of action, in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice model. Mice were fed a HFD, or a HFD supplemented with 0.01% (w/w) CA or 0.02% (w/w) CA, for a period of 12 weeks, after which changes in body weight, blood lipid profiles, and fatty  mechanism markers were evaluated. The 0.02% (w/w) CA diet resulted in a marked decline in steatosis grade, as well as in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index values, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IGTT) results, body weight gain, liver weight, and blood lipid levels (P < 0.05). The expression level of hepatic lipogenic genes, such as sterol regulating element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), liver-fatty  binding protein (L-FABP), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and fatty  synthase (FAS), was significantly lower in mice fed 0.01% (w/w) CA and 0.02% (w/w) CA diets than that in the HFD group; on the other hand, the expression level of β-oxidation-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), was higher in mice fed a 0.02% (w/w) CA diet, than that in the HFD group (P < 0.05).

CDDO-Me, a synthetic triterpenoid, suppressed expression of Spot 14 and FASN genes and likewise inhibited LS cell growth. Importantly, the anti-proliferative effect of each agent was prevented by the co-administration of palmitate, the major product of cellular long-chain fatty  synthesis. In stark contrast to LS cells, these compounds had no effect on the growth of fibroblasts. Four biochemically distinct agents that target critical points in the fatty  synthetic pathway exert anti-proliferative effects on LS cells, and rescue of cell growth by  suggests that reduced tumor cell  mediates the growth inhibition.

Since it is not clear whether modulation of one step in the lipogenic pathway is more important than another, the use of tracer methods can provide a deeper level of insight regarding the control of metabolic activity. Although [H]water is generally considered a reliable tracer for quantifying DNL in vivo (it yields a homogenous and quantifiable precursor labeling), the relatively long half-life of body water is thought to limit the ability of performing repeat studies in the same subjects; this can create a bottleneck in the development and evaluation of novel therapeutics for inhibiting DNL. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to perform back-to-back studies of DNL using [H]water. However, this work uncovered special circumstances that affect the data interpretation, i.e., it is possible to obtain seemingly negative values for DNL. Using a rodent model, we have identified a physiological mechanism that explains the data.

Animals were fed ad libitum diets, and stable isotopes were administered via diet (d₃₁-tripalmitin) and intravenously (¹³C₄-palmitate, ¹³C₁-acetate). Plasma was collected in the fed and fasted states, and blood lipids were analyzed by GC-MS. DEXA was used to assess body composition and a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp used to assess insulin-mediated glucose disposal. During the study, no changes were observed in food intake, body weight, plasma, and tissue endocannabinoid concentrations or the quantity of liver-TG fatty acids originating from de novo  (19 ± 6 vs. 16 ± 5%, for pre- and posttreatment, respectively, P = 0.39). However, waist circumference was significantly reduced 4% in the treated animals (P < 0.04), glucose disposal increased 30% (P = 0.03), and FFA turnover increased 37% (P = 0.02). The faster FFA flux was consistent with a 43% reduction in these fatty acids used for TRL-TG synthesis (40 ± 3 vs. 23 ± 4%, P = 0.02) and a twofold increase in TRL-TG turnover (1.5 ± 0.9 vs. 3.1 ± 1.4 μmol·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹, P = 0.03).

Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are , oleic, and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk fat yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) is activated by FFA treatment upon splicing. XBP-1 is a transcription factor induced by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α). However, the role of XBP-1 in NAFLD remains relatively unexplored. Toyocamycin was recently reported to attenuate the activation of XBP-1, possibly by inducing a conformational change in IRE1α. In this study, we examined the effect of toyocamycin on hepatocyte lipoapoptosis and steatosis. We also explored the effects of toyocamycin in a mouse model of NAFLD.Huh-7 cells and isolated rat primary hepatocytes were treated with  (PA), which is a saturated FFA, in the presence or absence of toyocamycin. In addition, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a diet rich in saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol (FFC) for 4 months, after which the effect of toyocamycin was assessed.Toyocamycin attenuated FFA-induced steatosis. It also significantly reduced PA-induced hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. In addition, toyocamycin reduced the expression of cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), which is a key player in ER stress-mediated apoptosis, as well as its downstream cell death modulator, death receptor 5. In the in vivo study, toyocamycin ameliorated the liver injury caused by FFC-induced NAFLD. It also reduced hepatic steatosis and the expression of lipogenic genes.The data we obtained suggest that toyocamycin attenuates hepatocyte  and ameliorates NAFLD in vivo and may therefore be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785> (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ-linolenic acids for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo  from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 144 1-day-old broilers (Cobb500) were randomly allotted into four treatment diets with each having six replicates of six chicks in each replicate following a completely randomized design. Live weight gain and feed efficiency was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in birds fed with a combination of oil sources compared to controls. Birds fed with the combination of oil and SO alone had higher carcass yield and lower abdominal fat. Higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and lower concentrations of  and saturated fatty  (SFA) was found in birds fed SO alone and combinations of SO and PO. Furthermore, the outcomes showed that birds fed diet supplemented with SO and the combination of SO and PO down-regulated gene expression of key hepatic lipogenic enzymes of fatty acids synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). These findings suggest that the diet containing the combination of 2% PO and 4% SO may reduce hepatic , as well as lower abdominal fat content of broilers.© 2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25917316>New role of irisin in hepatocytes: The protective effect of hepatic steatosis in vitro.</a></h2><p>Irisin is a newly identified myokine related to exercise and the browning of white fat. Recently, it was reported that irisin serum levels are associated with intrahepatic triglyceride content, suggesting that it might have an important role in the liver. The aim of this study was to determine the role of irisin in hepatocytes. Specifically, the effect of recombinant irisin on  (PA)-induced  and its related signal pathways were examined in AML12 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. In the present study, we observed the presence of irisin inside the cells in response to the treatment of recombinant irisin by flow cytometry and cell imaging technique. Recombinant irisin significantly inhibited the PA-induced increase in lipogenic markers ACC and FAS at the mRNA and protein levels, and prevented the PA-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Additionally, irisin inhibited the PA-induced increase in the expression, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activities of the master regulators of  (LXRα and SREBP-1c). Moreover, irisin attenuated PA-induced oxidative stress, which was confirmed by measuring the expression of inflammatory markers (NFκB, COX-2, p38 MAPK, TNF, IL-6) and superoxide indicator (dihydroethidium). The preventive effects of irisin against  and oxidative stress were mediated by the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase-3 (PRMT3). These findings suggested that irisin might have a beneficial role in the prevention of hepatic steatosis by altering the expression of lipogenic genes and attenuating oxidative stress in a PRMT3 dependent manner.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

On the fifth day, the men ingested an oral (13)C-labeled fructose load (0.75 g/kg), and their total fructose oxidation ((13)CO2 production), fructose storage (fructose ingestion minus (13)C-fructose oxidation), fructose conversion into blood (13)C glucose (gluconeogenesis from fructose), blood VLDL-(13)C palmitate (a marker of hepatic de novo ), and lactate concentrations were monitored over 7 postprandial h. On one occasion, participants remained lying down throughout the experiment [fructose treatment alone with no exercise condition (NoEx)], and on the other 2 occasions, they performed a 60-min exercise either 75 min before fructose ingestion [exercise, then fructose condition (ExFru)] or 90 min after fructose ingestion [fructose, then exercise condition (FruEx)].Fructose oxidation was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the FruEx (80% ± 3% of ingested fructose) than in the ExFru (46% ± 1%) and NoEx (49% ± 1%). Consequently, fructose storage was lower in the FruEx than in the other 2 conditions (P < 0.001). Fructose conversion into blood (13)C glucose, VLDL-(13)C palmitate, and postprandial plasma lactate concentrations was not significantly different between conditions.Compared with sedentary conditions, exercise performed immediately after fructose ingestion increases fructose oxidation and decreases fructose storage. In contrast, exercise performed before fructose ingestion does not significantly alter fructose oxidation and storage. In both conditions, exercise did not abolish fructose conversion into glucose or its incorporation into VLDL triglycerides.

One of the major sites of renal lipid accumulation is in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, suggesting that these cells may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that loss of hepatic biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) causes fat accumulation in livers of mice on a high-fat diet. To determine the role of BVRA in mouse proximal tubule cells, we generated a CRISPR targeting BVRA for a knockout in mouse proximal tubule cells (BVRA KO). The BVRA KO cells had significantly less metabolic potential and mitochondrial respiration, which was exacerbated by treatment with , a saturated fatty . The BVRA KO cells also showed increased intracellular triglycerides which were associated with higher fatty  uptake gene cluster of differentiation 36 as well as increased de novo  as measured by higher neutral lipids. Additionally, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 1 expression, annexin-V FITC staining, and lactate dehydrogenase assays all demonstrated that BVRA KO cells are more sensitive to -induced lipotoxicity than wild-type cells. Phosphorylation of BAD which plays a role in cell survival pathways, was significantly reduced in -treated BVRA KO cells. These data demonstrate the protective role of BVRA in proximal tubule cells against saturated fatty -induced lipotoxicity and suggest that activating BVRA could provide a benefit in protecting from obesity-induced kidney injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646889>PKA/AMPK signaling in relation to adiponectin's antiproliferative effect on multiple myeloma cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk of developing multiple myeloma (MM). Adiponectin is a cytokine produced by adipocytes, but paradoxically decreased in obesity, that has been implicated in MM progression. Herein, we evaluated how prolonged exposure to adiponectin affected the survival of MM cells as well as putative signaling mechanisms. Adiponectin activates protein kinase A (PKA), which leads to decreased AKT activity and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. AMPK, in turn, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Adiponectin-induced apoptosis may be mediated, at least in part, by the PKA/AMPK-dependent decline in the expression of the enzyme acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), which is essential to . Supplementation with , the preliminary end product of fatty  synthesis, rescues MM cells from adiponectin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic  (TOFA), an ACC inhibitor, exhibited potent antiproliferative effects on MM cells that could also be inhibited by fatty  supplementation. Thus, adiponectin's ability to reduce survival of MM cells appears to be mediated through its ability to suppress . Our findings suggest that PKA/AMPK pathway activators, or inhibitors of ACC, may be useful adjuvants to treat MM. Moreover, the antimyeloma effect of adiponectin supports the concept that hypoadiponectinemia, as occurs in obesity, promotes MM tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22363635>Exendin-4 improves steatohepatitis by increasing Sirt1 expression in high-fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>The effects of exendin-4 on Sirt1 expression as a mechanism of reducing fatty liver have not been previously reported. Therefore, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of exendin-4 treatment on fatty liver are mediated via Sirt1 in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice and related cell culture models. Exendin-4 treatment decreased body weight, serum free fatty  (FA), and triglyceride levels in HF-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. Histological analysis showed that exendin-4 reversed HF-induced hepatic accumulation of lipids and inflammation. Exendin-4 treatment increased mRNA and protein expression of Sirt1 and its downstream factor, AMPK, in vivo and also induced genes associated with FA oxidation and glucose metabolism. In addition, a significant increase in the hepatic expression of Lkb1 and Nampt mRNA was observed in exendin-4-treated groups. We also observed increased expression of phospho-Foxo1 and GLUT2, which are involved in hepatic glucose metabolism. In HepG2 and Huh7 cells, mRNA and protein expressions of GLP-1R were increased by exendin-4 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Exendin-4 enhanced protein expression of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPKα in HepG2 cells treated with 0.4 mM . We also found that Sirt1 was an upstream regulator of AMPK in hepatocytes. A novel finding of this study was the observation that expression of GLP-1R is proportional to exendin-4 concentration and exendin-4 could attenuate fatty liver through activation of Sirt1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28112007>The fatty -rich fraction of Eruca sativa (rocket salad) leaf extract exerts antidiabetic effects in cultured skeletal muscle, adipocytes and liver cells.</a></h2><p>Eruca sativa Mill. (Brassicaceae), commonly known as rocket salad, is a popular leafy-green vegetable with many health benefits.To evaluate the antidiabetic activities of this plant in major insulin-responsive tissues.Five E. sativa leaf extracts of varying polarity were prepared (aqueous extract, 70% and 95% ethanol extracts, the n-hexane-soluble fraction of the 95% ethanol extract (ES3) and the defatted 95% ethanol extract). Eruca sativa extracts were investigated through a variety of cell-based in vitro bioassays for antidiabetic activities in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, H4IIE hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Guided by the results of these bioassays, ES3 was fractionated into the saponifiable (SM) and the unspaonifiable (USM) fractions. Glucose uptake was measured using [H]-deoxy-glucose, while the effects on hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and  were assessed using Wako AutoKit Glucose and AdipoRed assays, respectively.ES3 and its SM fraction significantly stimulated glucose uptake with EC values of 8.0 and 5.8 μg/mL, respectively. Both extracts significantly inhibited G6Pase activity (IC values of 4.8 and 9.3 μg/mL, respectively). Moreover, ES3 and SM showed significant adipogenic activities with EC of 4.3 and 6.1 μg/mL, respectively. Fatty  content of SM was identified by GC-MS. trans-Vaccenic and palmitoleic acids were the major unsaturated fatty acids, while  and azelaic acids were the main saturated fatty acids.These findings indicate that ES3 and its fatty -rich fraction exhibit antidiabetic activities in insulin-responsive cell lines and may hence prove useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28516281>ToF-SIMS study of differentiation of human bone-derived stromal cells: new insights into osteoporosis.</a></h2><p>Lipids have numerous important functions in the human body, as they form the cells' plasma membranes and play a key role in many disease states, presumably also in osteoporosis. Here, the fatty  composition of the outer plasma membranes of cells differentiated into the osteogenic and adipogenic direction is studied with surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). For data evaluation, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied. Human (bone-derived) mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) from an osteoporotic donor and a control donor are compared to reveal differences in the fatty  composition of the membranes. The chemical information is correlated to staining and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) results to provide insight into the gene expression of several differentiation markers on the RNA level. Adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs from a non-osteoporotic donor correlates with increased relative intensities of all fatty acids under investigation. After osteogenic differentiation of non-osteoporotic cells, the relative mass signal intensities of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acids are increased. However, the osteoporotic cells show increased levels of  in the plasma membrane after exposure to osteogenic differentiation conditions, which correlates to an immature differentiation state relative to non-osteoporotic osteogenic cells. This immature differentiation state is confirmed by increased early osteogenic differentiation factor Runx2 on RNA level and by less calcium mineralization spots seen in von Kossa staining and ToF-SIMS images.

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a member of the p160 coactivator family, is reported as a key regulator of  and energy homeostasis. We sought to determine the influence of SRC-3 on hepatic steatosis and the mechanism beneath.The influence of siRNA-mediated SRC-3 silencing on hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed in HepG2 cells. The molecular mechanism of SRC-3 regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism was also studied. Moreover, the effect of SRC-3 ablation on hepatic steatosis was examined in SRC-3 deficient mice.In this study, we report that SRC-3 ablation reduces -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, deletion of SRC-3 ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation response in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). These metabolic improvements can presumably be explained by the reduction in chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) expression and the subsequent elevation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) level. At the molecular level, SRC-3 interacts with retinoic receptor α (RARα) to activate COUP-TFII expression under all-trans retinoic  (ARTA) treatment.These findings indicate a crucial role for SRC-3 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and provide the possible novel inner mechanisms.Copyright © 2011.

In this study, we determined whether the depletion of TLR3 modulated hepatic injury in mice and further aimed to provide mechanistic insights into the TLR3-mediated modulation of diet-induced hepatic inflammation and fat accumulation. Hepatic steatosis and inflammatory response were induced by feeding wild-type (WT) or TLR3 knockout mice a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Primary liver resident cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were treated with . TLR3 knockout mice fed a high-fat diet showed severe hepatic inflammation accompanied by nuclear factor-κB and IRF3 activation, which is mainly induced by the activation of Kupffer cells. Decreased TLR4 expression was restored in hepatic mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells in TLR3 knockout mice compared to that in the WT. Moreover, hepatic steatosis was decreased in TLR3 knockout mice. Hepatocytes from TLR3 knockout mice exhibited reduced expression of cannabinoid receptors. HSCs from TLR3 knockout mice showed decreased expression of the enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis. In conclusion, this study suggests that the selective modulation of TLR3 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatic inflammation and steatosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

An in vitro NAFLD model was generated by treating HepG2 cells with oleic and  acids. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) with or without supplementation with either 1% or 3% TA (w/w) for 12 weeks. Finally, the possibility of interacting p300 and TA was simulated.TA suppressed HAT activity both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TA abrogated occupancy of p300 on the sterol regulatory element in the fatty  synthase and ATP-citrate lyase promoters, eventually inducing hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H3K36. Furthermore, TA decreased acetylation at lysine residues 9 and 36 of histone H3 protein and that of total proteins. Consequently, TA decreased the mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes and attenuated lipid accumulation in vivo. We observed that NAFLD features, including body weight, liver mass, fat mass, and lipid profile in serum, were improved by TA supplementation in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility that TA directly binds to p300 through docking simulation between ligand and protein.Our findings demonstrate that TA, a novel HATi, has potential application for the prevention of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

PA+OA co-treatment fully prevents PA lipotoxicity through mechanisms that are not well defined but which have been previously attributed to more efficient esterification and sequestration of PA into triglycerides (TGs) when OA is abundant. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested by experimentally modulating the relative partitioning of PA/OA between TGs and other lipid fates in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that addition of OA to PA-treated hepatocytes enhanced TG synthesis, reduced total PA uptake and PA lipid incorporation, decreased phospholipid saturation and rescued PA-induced ER stress and lipoapoptosis. Knockdown of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the rate-limiting step in TG synthesis, significantly reduced TG accumulation without impairing OA-mediated rescue of PA lipotoxicity. In both wild-type and DGAT-knockdown hepatocytes, OA co-treatment significantly reduced PA lipid incorporation and overall phospholipid saturation compared to PA-treated hepatocytes. These data indicate that OA's protective effects do not require increased conversion of PA into inert TGs, but instead may be due to OA's ability to compete against PA for cellular uptake and/or esterification and, thereby, normalize the composition of cellular lipids in the presence of a toxic PA load.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, its actual function in most tissues remains unresolved, and its role in cellular fatty  uptake is still controversial. To characterize Fatp4 functions in adipocytes in vivo, we generated a mouse line with adipocyte-specific inactivation of the Fatp4 gene (Fatp4(A-/-)). Under standard conditions mutant mice showed no phenotypical aberrance. Uptake of radiolabeled  and lignoceric  into adipose tissue of Fatp4(A-/-) mice was unchanged. When exposed to a diet enriched in long chain fatty acids, Fatp4(A-/-) mice gained more body weight compared with control mice, although they were not consuming more food. Pronounced obesity was accompanied by a thicker layer of subcutaneous fat and greater adipocyte circumference, although expression of genes involved in de novo  was not changed. However, the increase in total fat mass was contrasted by a significant decrease in various phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesteryl esters in adipocytes. Livers of Fatp4-deficient animals under a high fat diet exhibited a higher degree of fatty degeneration. Nonetheless, no evidence for changes in insulin sensitivity and adipose inflammation was found. In summary, the results of this study confirm that Fatp4 is not crucial for fatty  uptake into adipocytes. Instead, under the condition of a diet enriched in long chain fatty acids, adipocyte-specific Fatp4 deficiency results in adipose hypertrophy and profound alterations in the metabolism of complex lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19937697>The plasma lipidomic signature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Specific alterations in hepatic lipid composition characterize the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which extends from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

A comprehensive analysis of plasma lipids and eicosanoid metabolites quantified by mass spectrometry was performed in NAFL (n = 25) and NASH (n = 50) subjects and compared with lean normal controls (n = 50). The key findings include significantly increased total plasma monounsaturated fatty acids driven by palmitoleic (16:1 n7) and oleic (18:1 n9) acids content (P < 0.01 for both acids in both NAFL and NASH). The levels of palmitoleic , oleic , and palmitoleic  to  (16:0) ratio were significantly increased in NAFLD across multiple lipid classes.

The docosahexanoic  (22:6 n3) to docosapentenoic  (22:5n3) ratio was significantly decreased within phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) pools, which was most marked in NASH subjects (P < 0.01 for PC and P < 0.001 for PE).

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of  genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

After the HepG2 human hepatoma cells were treated with PA for 24 hours, total triglycerides levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels of perilipin family members were upregulated in cells treated with 400 μM PA. For our in vitro model of hepatic steatosis, HepG2 cells were treated with 400 μM  (PA) in the presence or absence of 100 nM exendin-4 for 24 hours.

Moreover, exendin-4 treatment increased the expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) in the cytosolic fraction and the expression of β-catenin and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in the nuclear fraction. In addition, siRNA-mediated inhibition of β-catenin upregulated the expression of lipogenic transcription factors. The protective effects of exendin-4 on intracellular triglyceride content and total triglyceride levels were not observed in cells treated with the β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1. These data suggest that exendin-4 treatment improves hepatic steatosis by inhibiting  via activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22517924>Stereospecificity of fatty  2-hydroxylase and differential functions of 2-hydroxy fatty  enantiomers.</a></h2><p>FA 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) is an NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme that initiates FA α oxidation and is also responsible for the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy FA (2-OH FA)-containing sphingolipids in mammalian cells. The 2-OH FA is chiral due to the asymmetric carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. Our current study performed stereochemistry investigation and showed that FA2H is stereospecific for the production of (R)-enantiomers. FA2H knockdown in adipocytes increases diffusional mobility of raft-associated lipids, leading to reduced GLUT4 protein level, glucose uptake, and . The effects caused by FA2H knockdown were reversed by treatment with exogenous (R)-2-hydroxy , but not with the (S)-enantiomer. Further analysis of sphingolipids demonstrated that the (R)-enantiomer is enriched in hexosylceramide whereas the (S)-enantiomer is preferentially incorporated into ceramide, suggesting that the observed differential effects are in part due to synthesis of sphingolipids containing different 2-OH FA enantiomers. These results may help clarify the mechanisms underlying the recently identified diseases associated with FA2H mutations in humans and may lead to potential pharmaceutical and dietary treatments. This study also provides critical information to help study functions of 2-OH FA enantiomers in FA α oxidation and possibly other sphingolipid-independent pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846317>CHP1 Regulates Compartmentalized Glycerolipid Synthesis by Activating GPAT4.</a></h2><p>Cells require a constant supply of fatty acids to survive and proliferate. Fatty acids incorporate into membrane and storage glycerolipids through a series of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes, but how these enzymes are regulated is not well understood. Here, using a combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens and unbiased lipidomics, we identified calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a major regulator of ER glycerolipid synthesis. Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty  incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins. Interestingly, upon CHP1 loss, the peroxisomal enzyme, GNPAT, partially compensates for the loss of ER lipid synthesis, enabling cell proliferation. Thus, our work identifies a conserved regulator of glycerolipid metabolism and reveals plasticity in lipid synthesis of proliferating cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol. However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic  cycle and fatty- synthesis. Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis, the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of α-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate for de novo . Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732859>High-Protein Intake during Weight Loss Therapy Eliminates the Weight-Loss-Induced Improvement in Insulin Action in Obese Postmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>High-protein (HP) intake during weight loss (WL) therapy is often recommended because it reduces the loss of lean tissue mass. However, HP intake could have adverse effects on metabolic function, because protein ingestion reduces postprandial insulin sensitivity. In this study, we compared the effects of ∼10% WL with a hypocaloric diet containing 0.8 g protein/kg/day and a hypocaloric diet containing 1.2 g protein/kg/day on muscle insulin action in postmenopausal women with obesity. We found that HP intake reduced the WL-induced decline in lean tissue mass by ∼45%. However, HP intake also prevented the WL-induced improvements in muscle insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as the WL-induced adaptations in oxidative stress and cell structural biology pathways. Our data demonstrate that the protein content of a WL diet can have profound effects on metabolic function and underscore the importance of considering dietary macronutrient composition during WL therapy for people with obesity.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

We investigated lipid accumulation in cultured human hepatocytes (HepG2) and rat liver after exposure to four different carbon-based particles. HepG2 cells were exposed to particles for 3h and subsequently incubated for another 18h to manifest lipid accumulation. In an animal model of metabolic syndrome we investigated the association between intake of carbon black (CB, 14nm) particles and hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and gene expression of Srebp-1, Fasn and Scd-1 involved in lipid synthesis. There was a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular lipid content after exposure to CB in HepG2 cells, which was only observed after co-exposure to oleic/. Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells after exposure to diesel exhaust particles, fullerenes C60 or pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes. All four types of particles also generated oxidatively damaged DNA, assessed as formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) sensitive sites, in HepG2 cells after 3h exposure. The animal model of metabolic syndrome showed increased lipid load in the liver after one oral exposure to 6.4mg/kg of CB in lean Zucker rats. This was not associated with increased iNOS staining in the liver, indicating that the oral CB exposure was associated with hepatic steatosis rather than steatohepatitis. The lipid accumulation did not seem to be related to increased  because there were unaltered gene expression levels in both the HepG2 cells and rat livers. Collectively, exposure to particles is associated with oxidative stress and steatosis in hepatocytes.© 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, miR-1224-5p was highly expressed in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and in obese (ob/ob) mice. To examine the potential role of miR-1224-5p, we constructed liver-specific adenoviral vectors expressing either an miR-1224-5p inhibitor sequence or miR-1224-5p mimic sequences. After tail-vein vector injection, HFD-fed mice were examined for expression of lipogenic genes. We found that miR-1224-5p inhibitors significantly attenuated hepatic  and steatosis in HFD-fed mice, whereas miR-1224-5p mimicked promoted lipid accumulation in the liver of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that downregulation of miR-1224-5p in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes led to a reduction of cellular triglycerides after treatment with an oleic  and  mixture. Importantly, this study also identified adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-1224-5p. miR-1224-5p binding to the 3' untranslated region of AMPKα1 suppressed expression of the AMPKα1 protein and its downstream molecules. Metformin, an activator of AMPK, also inhibited hepatic expression of miR-1224-5p. Together, these findings indicate that miR-1224-5p promotes hepatic  by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and suggest that miR-1224-5p inhibitors warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic tools in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164796>Alpha-mangostin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy which count against fatty  synthase inhibition mediated apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>One of the most important metabolic hallmarks of breast cancer cells is enhanced . Increasing evidences suggest that fatty  synthase (FAS) plays an important role in human breast cancer. Previously we discovered that alpha-mangostin showed apoptotic effect on human breast cancer cells via inhibiting FAS activity. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy are involved in cell apoptosis. However, the role of ER stress and autophagy in FAS inhibition induced apoptosis still remains unclear.We evaluated the effects of alpha-mangostin on ER stress and autophagy in human breast cancer cells. Intracellular FAS activity was measured by a spectrophotometer at 340 nm of NADPH absorption. Cell Counting Kit assay was used to test the cell viability. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect protein expression levels. Apoptotic effects were detected by flow cytometry.Alpha-mangostin induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy, both of which reduced the apoptotic effect of alpha-mangostin in MDA-MB-231 cells. , the end product of FAS catalyzed reaction, rescued the ER stress and autophagy induced by alpha-mangostin. Cell apoptosis was markedly promoted by inhibiting ER stress and autophagy while treating cells with alpha-mangostin.We propose a hypothesis that a combination of FAS inhibition and ER stress and autophagy inhibition has an application potential in the chemoprevention and treatment of breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492181>Adipokines secretion in feline primary adipose tissue culture in response to dietary fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Obesity in cats has been associated with alterations in adipokines including: adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty acids on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , or , at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003). Arachidonic  treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic  treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty acids treatments at 25 (P = 0.2), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of arachidonic  on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic  on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p></html>
