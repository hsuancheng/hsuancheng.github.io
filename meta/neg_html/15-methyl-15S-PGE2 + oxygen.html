As the apneic profile of CRSwNP may differ from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) classic patients without nasal polyps (NP), it may prove useful to define a new profile for OSA screening in these patients. The aim of the current study was to compare baseline characteristics and apneic profile of OSA patients with CRSwNP to OSA patients without NP.Thirty-one apneic patients with CRSwNP and 62 apneic cases without NP were included in our study. Both groups underwent nasal endoscopy, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) evaluation, and overnight polysomnography (PSG). We additionally accessed anthropometric characteristics such as snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, neck circumference, male gender, and OSA risk via the STOP-Bang questionnaire.Although the patients were matched according to age and gender, the median BMI and STOP-Bang score were significantly higher in patients with OSA than in those with OSA and CRSwNP. Notably, the median ESS showed low somnolence and a low median apnea-hypopnea index in patients with CRSwNP, despite the fact that the lowest median  saturation was not significantly different between groups.Anthropometric characteristics in individuals with apnea caused by CRSwNP were significantly different from those in individuals with typical. This finding will improve screening and treatment of apneic patients CRSwNP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the search for efficient and low-cost procedure the use of multispectral polarized light (λ400-2000 nm) emerges as a possibility for the execution of aPDT. The use of a highly effective photosensitizer is also of great importance. 1,9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue Zinc Chloride Double Salt - DMMB is a potent phenothiazine derivative that presents high photodynamic action due to its high lipophilicity as well as a greater quantum yield of Singlet  and phototoxicity when compared to other Photosensitizers. The aim of this study was to assess, In Vitro, the efficacy of aPDT on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) using different concentrations of DMMB associated to a Polarized light source (Bioptron®, 40 mW, ᴓ = 15.8 cm) using different energy densities. Based on the IC, 150 and 300 ng/mL of DMMB concentrations were chosen for this study. Twelve experimental groups were used: (Control, PLs, PSs and aPDTs). Serial dilutions (up to 10) of the bacterial inoculum were used and the DMMB was added using the two previously determined concentrations. After 5 min of preincubation the dilutions of the inoculum were illuminated by the polarized light source. Subsequently, 100 μL of each dilution, in triplicate, were inoculated into Petri dishes containing TSA medium and incubated in a bacteriological oven at 37 °C for 24-h and quantification of UFCs was done. The results showed significant exponential reduction (p < .0001) of 99.93% (150 ng/mL + LP 10 J/cm) and 99.97% (300 ng/mL + LP 5 J/cm) the CFU counts in comparison to non-illuminated control. The results of this study allow to conclude that aPDT carried out with 1,9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue Zinc Chloride Double Salt-DMMB and a PL souce was efficacious on the reduction (99.97%), in vitro, of the bacterial counts of S. aureus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Synthetic wastewater having chemical  demand (COD) and biochemical  demand (BOD) of 400 ± 10% and 210 ± 10% mg/L respectively was fed and the reactor was subjected to OLRs ranging from 0.37 to 1.26 kg COD/m.d. It was observed that steady sloughing of biofilm occurs within the SAFF reactor all the times and average concentration of sloughed biomass in the effluent was 26 mg/L. The COD and BOD removal efficiencies varied between 85 and 89% and 86 to 94%, respectively. The kinetic studies demonstrated that SAFF reactor followed Stover-Kincannon and Grau models, with high correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9977 and 0.9916, respectively. Thus, the values of kinetic coefficients such as maximum substrate utilization rate, U = 64.1 g/(Ld); saturation value constant, K = 72.31 g/(L.d) and Grau second-order substrate removal rate constant, Ks = 2.44 day can be useful to develop and design large scale SAFF reactors. Finally, the study reveals that the optimum range for OLR can vary within 0.68-0.94 kg COD/m.d.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658211>A Retrospective Analysis of Collegiate Athlete Blood Biomarkers at Moderate Altitude.</a></h2><p>Morris, KL, Widstrom, L, Goodrich, J, Poddar, S, Rueda, M, Holliday, M, San Millian, I, and Byrnes, WC. A retrospective analysis of collegiate athlete blood biomarkers at moderate altitude. J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 2913-2919, 2019-Blood biomarkers are used to assess overall health and determine positive/negative adaptations to training/environmental stimuli. This study aimed to describe the changes in blood biomarkers in collegiate football (FB) (n = 31) and cross-country (XC) (n = 29; 16 women [FXC], 13 men [MXC]) athletes across a competitive season while training and living at a moderate altitude (1,655 m). This study used a database of previously collected hematological (complete blood count and serum ferritin) and muscle damage (lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase) blood biomarkers. Data were analyzed both within and between groups using linear mixed-model and variance component analyses, alpha = 0.05. All 3 groups had significant but different patterns of change in the measured biomarkers. Hematological blood biomarkers increased at different time points but remained within the normal reference ranges with greater between-subject vs. within-subject variability, suggesting no significant decrements to -carrying capacity across the season for FB, MXC, or FXC. Muscle damage biomarkers increased over time and exceeded the normal reference ranges, indicating cell damage pathology. However, it is also possible that the demands of training and competition might alter baseline values in these athletes, although this cannot be confirmed with the current experimental design. The patterns of change in the hematological and muscle damage biomarkers varied by sport discipline, suggesting that the training/competitive environments of these athletes influence these changes. Further studies should assess how much training, altitude, and nutrition influence these changes by using a more comprehensive set of biomarkers and related performance parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive  species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657888>Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies in Adult Patients With Exacerbation of COPD: A Systematic Review [Internet].</a></h2><p>To synthesize existing knowledge about the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD).Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from database inception to January 2, 2019.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated pharmacologic intervention or nonpharmacologic interventions for ECOPD. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded for critical final health outcomes.We included 98 RCTs (13,401 patients, mean treatment duration 9.9 days, mean followup 3.7 months). Final health outcomes, including mortality, resolution of exacerbation, hospital readmissions, repeat exacerbations, and need for intubation, were infrequently evaluated and often showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Antibiotic therapy increases the clinical cure rate and reduces the clinical failure rate regardless of the severity of ECOPD (moderate SOE). There is insufficient evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids improve dyspnea and reduce the clinical failure rate (low SOE). Despite the ubiquitous use of inhaled bronchodilators in ECOPD, we found only a small number of trials that assessed lung function tests, and not final health outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to support the effect of aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, mucolytics, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled antibiotics, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, and statins on final health outcomes. Titrated  reduces mortality compared with high flow  (low SOE). Low SOE suggested benefit from some nonpharmacologic interventions such as chest physiotherapy using vibration/percussion/massage or breathing technique (on dyspnea), resistance training (on dyspnea and quality of life), early pulmonary rehabilitation commenced before hospital discharge during the initial most acute phase of exacerbation rather than the convalescence period (on dyspnea) and whole body vibration training (on quality of life). Vitamin D supplementation may improve quality of life (low SOE).Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common condition, the evidence base for most interventions in ECOPD remains limited. Systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids are associated with improved outcomes in mild and moderate to severe ECOPD. Titrated  reduces mortality. Future research is required to assess the effectiveness of several emerging nonpharmacologic and dietary treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657650>A Kindred with a β-Globin Base Substitution [β89(F5)Ser→Arg (AG>AG); : c.270T>G] Resulting in Hemoglobin Vanderbilt.</a></h2><p>High  affinity hemoglobins (Hbs), characterized by a decreased ability to release  to the tissues and a left-shifted  dissociation curve, are a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis.

However, before the implementation of these nanomaterials, toxicity assessment is essential for its safe usage. In the present study, the toxicity of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) was investigated which was derived from candle soot and compared with commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. First instar Drosophila larvae were exposed to CNPs as well as CNTs, and the toxic effects of these nanomaterials were compared. The result shows that both nanomaterials enhance the level of reactive  species and oxidative stress in the Drosophila, which leads to the upregulation of heat shock proteins that may cause cytotoxicity in exposed Drosophila larvae. In contrast, exposure to CNPs and CNTs did not affect the developmental period of the larvae. Morphology of the internal organs, brain, gut and Malpighian tubules was also not altered in the exposed larvae. Similarly, no change observed in the cytoskeleton (F-actin) of these organs. Reproductive performance was slightly reduced in the case of CNPs compare to control. However, CNTs exposure did not show any significant effect on the reproductive performance of the flies that emerged from exposed larvae in comparison to control. Hence the study concludes that exposure to CNPs and CNTs cause a moderate level of cytotoxicity in Drosophila. The study also indicates that the inexpensive CNPs may use as an alternative to expensive CNTs for biomedical and biological applications.Copyright © 2019.

It was hypothesized that the asymmetry results from the need of the dominant cerebral hemisphere for more glucose and , i.e. more blood supply. In this study, we aimed to test this hypothesis in patients by evaluating their arterial diameter and hand preference, as it is the most common criterion to determine the dominance of hemisphere.The study was performed with 844 participants who consented to participate in the study. We identified the dominant cerebral hemisphere by questioning their hand preference. Then we measured both the vertebral artery (VA) diameter and VA flow volume by Doppler ultrasonography. After demonstrating the asymmetry, correlation was tested.Among 844 participants included in the study, the mean diameter of the right VA was 3,14±0,35 mm, the left VA was 3,41±0,54 mm, mean flow volumes of right VA was 119,21±44,98 mL/min. and left VA was 151,45±57,26 mL/min. It is recorded that 771 (86.43%) of the participants were right-handed, 73 (8.18%) were left-handed.No significant relationship was found between the increased blood demand of the dominant cerebral hemisphere and the vertebral artery dominance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660566>Two-dimensional Dirac fermions on oxidized black phosphorus.</a></h2><p>We explore the oxidation of a single layer of black phosphorus using ab initio density functional theory calculations. We search for the equilibrium structures of phosphorene oxides, POx with various  concentrations x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). By evaluating the formation energies with diverse configurations and their vibrational properties for each of various x values, we identify a series of stable oxidized structures with x and confirm that the oxidation occurs naturally. We also find that oxidation makes some modes from the P-O bonds and P-P bonds IR-active implying that the infrared spectra can be used to determine the degree of oxidation of phosphorene. Our electronic structure calculations reveal that the fully oxidized phosphorene (PO) has a direct band gap of 0.83 eV similar to the pristine phosphorene. Intriguingly, the PO possesses two nonsymmorphic symmetries with the inversion symmetry broken, guaranteeing symmetry-protected band structures including the band degeneracy and four-fold degenerate Dirac points. Our results provide an important guide in the search for the rare example of a Dirac semimetal with a higher level of degeneracy, giving significant insight into the relations between the symmetry of the lattice and band topology of electrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659867>Nanoparticle-Embedded Electrospun Fiber-Covered Stent to Assist Intraluminal Photodynamic Treatment of Oesophageal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Drug-eluting stents (DESs) are promising candidates for treating human oesophageal cancer. However, the use of DESs to assist photodynamic therapy (PDT) of orthotopic oesophageal tumors is not yet demonstrated to the best of current knowledge. Herein, through an electrospinning technology it is shown that -producing manganese dioxide nanoparticles are embedded into elelctrospun fibers, which are subsequently covered onto stents. Upon implantation, the nanoparticles are gradually released from the fibers and then diffuse into the nearby tumor tissue. Then, the hypoxic microenvironment can be effectively alleviated by reaction of MnO with the endogenous H O within the tumor. After demonstrating the excellent PDT efficacy of the stents in a conventional subcutaneous mouse tumor model, such stents are further used for PDT treatment in a rabbit orthotopic oesophageal cancer model by inserting an optical fiber into the tumor site. Greatly prolonged survival of rabbits is observed after such intraluminal PDT treatment. Taken together, this work shows that the fiber-covered stent as a nanoparticle delivery platform can enable effective PDT as a noninvasive treatment method for patients with advanced-stage oesophageal cancer.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Cerebral I/R results in excessive autophagy and neuronal demise. The present study was designed to explore the role of autophagy during ICS II-mediated neuroprotection on cerebral I/R in vivo and in vitro.The rat focal cerebral ischemia was induced 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion with ICS II, 3-MA or Rapamycin. The effect of ICS II was detemined using neurological behaviour and cerebral infarction. The expressions of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), autophagy-related proteins and phosphorylation levels of GSK-3β were determined. Primary rat cortical neurons were subjected to  and glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) were applied to further elucidate the mechanism of ICS II on cerebral (I/R). A surface plasmon resonance assay and molecular docking were used to explore the interactions of ICS II with PDE 5 or GSK-3β.ICS II not only protected against MCAO-induced injury in rats, but also attenuated primary cortical neurons injury upon OGD/R. The neuroprotective effects of ICS II on cerebral I/R were attributed to mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. ICS II directly bound to PDE 5 and GSK-3β, and there also existed the interaction between PKG and GSK-3β.These findings indicate that ICS II attenuates cerebral I/R-induced injury via mediating PKG/GSK-3β/autophagy axis. This study will raise the possibility that ICS II may be exploited into a potent PDE 5 inhibitor against ischemia stroke.This article is protected by copyright.

SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655324>Nocturnal dialysis improves sleep apnea more than daytime dialysis: a meta-analysis of crossover studies.</a></h2><p>To systematically review the literature for articles evaluating differences in polysomnography (PSG) data when patients are on primarily daytime hemodialysis (conventional hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) versus nocturnal hemodialysis (nocturnal hemodialysis or nocturnal peritoneal dialysis).

Searches were performed through December 6, 2018.A total of four adult crossover studies (91 patients, age 50.4 ± 12.4, BMI 25.1 ± 5.3) reported PSG data. The daytime hemodialysis (DHD) and nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) AHI decreased from 24.6 ± 18.2 to 12.6 ± 11.8 (events/hour) with a mean difference of -11.9 [95% CI -13.47, -10.37], Z score of 15.07 (P < 0.00001). The standardized mean difference was -1.35 [95% CI -2.70, 0.01]. Two studies reported mean SpO changes during PSG. The DHD and NHD SpO increased from 92.7 ± 2.4 to 94.7 ± 2.2 with a mean difference of 2.26 [95% CI -0.18, 4.71], Z score 1.82 (P = 0.07).In the current literature, nocturnal hemodialysis improves AHI more than daytime hemodialysis.

However, current fluorescent dyes are limited by low brightness, high cytotoxicity, poor tissue penetration, and unwanted side effects. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a platform for optoelectronic tuning, which allows independent control of the optical properties from the electronic properties of fluorescent organic salts. This is achieved through cation-anion pairing of organic salts that can modulate the frontier molecular orbital without impacting the bandgap. Optoelectronic tuning enables decoupled control over the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of fluorescent organic salts by selective generation of mitochondrial reactive  species that control cell viability. We show that through counterion pairing, organic salt nanoparticles can be tuned to be either nontoxic for enhanced imaging, or phototoxic for improved photodynamic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654945>Modeling the conformations of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup a CPS and a carba-analogue: Implications for vaccine development.</a></h2><p>Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis worldwide, especially in Africa. The capsular polysaccharide is the main virulence factor and the target antigen for polysaccharide- and conjugate vaccines. Three tetravalent conjugate vaccines against serogroups A, C, Y and W have been licensed and the monovalent MenAfriVac® was introduced to address the high burden of serogroup A disease in the Meningitis Belt of sub-Saharan Africa. Three of these four vaccines are lyophilized due to the instability of the serogroup A antigen (MenA) in aqueous solution, resulting in a two vial presentation with concomitant additional costs for storage and distribution. Replacement of the saccharide ring  with a methylene group is a promising approach to preparing a stable oligosaccharide MenA analogue (Carba-MenA) vaccine suitable for a liquid formulation. However, to be effective, Carba-MenA must elicit an immune response that is cross-reactive to the native MenA. Here we employ microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of ten repeats of MenA and Carba-MenA to establish that there are significant differences in the conformation and dynamics of these antigens in solution. Carba-MenA has a more random extended, conformation than MenA; MenA has a significant population of compact S-bend conformations that are absent in the analogue. We also find that the disaccharides are poor models of the conformational behaviour of longer chains. This information is relevant for the rational design of optimal analogues for conjugate vaccines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, a pilot bioretention column experiment was performed to evaluate the nutrient control of systems with commercial activated carbon and river sediment-derived biochar. Significant chemical  demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) leaching were found with the addition of activated carbon and biochar, but total nitrogen (TN) leaching was significantly improved when activated carbon was used as the medium. During a semi-synthetic runoff experiment, the bioretention systems containing two types of fluvial biochar showed relatively better COD and TN control (average mass removal efficiencies and cumulative removal efficiencies) than commercial activated carbon. However, the average TP mass removal efficiency with commercial activated carbon (95% ± 3%) was significantly higher than biochar (48% ± 20% and 56 ± 14%). The addition of biochar in the media increased the nitrogen removal efficiency, and the addition of activated carbon significantly increased the phosphorous removal efficiency.

J Strength Cond Res 33(11): 3151-3161, 2019-The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a goal setting and implementation planning (GSIP) intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness among firefighters. Male career firefighters (N = 20) from a large municipal fire department were assigned to an intervention arm (n = 12) or passive control arm (n = 8) of a 14-week study involving cardiorespiratory exercise. The intervention consisted of GSIP coaching at baseline and support throughout the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed through a standardized physical protocol for firefighters (Candidate Physical Ability Test) at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 14 weeks time points, using the Cosmed K4b portable metabolic system to measure physiological variables. Using intention-to-treat principles, we employed a 2-level multilevel model to examine the effect of intervention group on intercept and change over time on primary outcomes of interest:  transport and utilization (VO2), heart rate (HR), and respiratory exchange ratio (R). Results demonstrated that the intervention and control groups both exhibited a significant increase in VO2 (B = 0.143, SE = 0.025, p < 0.001) and a decline in R (B = -0.003. SE = 0.001, p < 0.01) over the course of the study. Although both groups exhibited improvements on 2 of the 3 cardiorespiratory outcomes, subjects assigned to the intervention did not exhibit superior outcomes when compared to the control group. Given the improvements we observed in 2 out of 3 outcomes across both conditions, future research may consider testing effectiveness of interventions consisting of functional training exercises that closely translate to firefighting tasks over time periods sufficient to elicit aerobic metabolic adaptations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658548>[Clinical therapeutic observation on sequential treatment of chronic wounds with repeated recurrence of hidradenitis suppurativa in buttocks].</a></h2><p> To observe the clinical effects of sequential treatment with extensive lesion resection, vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation on hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in buttocks which recurred after multiple surgeries.

After extensive resection of the lesion, continuous VSD combined with intermittent irrigation of -loaded fluid was given, with negative pressure of -16.7 kPa and flow rate of pure  of 1.0 L/min. After 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, the negative pressure device was removed and autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts and/or local flaps were transplanted to repair the wounds. Six patients were performed with split-thickness skin grafting, 4 patients with local flap transplantation, and 5 patients with split-thickness skin grafting together with local flap transplantation. The donor sites of local flaps were sutured directly or transplanted with autologous posterior thigh split-thickness skin grafts, and the donor sites of split-thickness skin grafts with autologous thin split-thickness scalp. The wound tissue or wound granulation tissue was collected before lesion resection and 7 days after treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid respectively for bacterial culture and detecting of the content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival of skin grafts and flaps after operation was observed, hospitalization time was recorded, and recurrence and complications of HS were followed up. Data were processed with paired sample  test.  Bacterial culture result of wound tissue before lesion resection was positive in all patients, mainly  and anaerobic bacteria, etc., while that of wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was negative. The content of TNF-α in wound granulation tissue after 7 days of treatment with VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid was (10.1±2.9) pg/L, significantly lower than (73.6±5.6) pg/L before lesion resection (=33.47, <0.01). The skin grafts and/or flaps of 15 patients survived post operation, and the wounds were healed. The patients were hospitalized for 17-31 days. During follow-up of 1 to 5 years, no recurrence of HS occurred in operative site of buttocks of 15 patients, but 1 patient had ulceration of healed perianal incision caused by high anal fistula and was healed after treatment.  Sequential treatment with extensive resection, VSD combined with irrigation of -loaded fluid, and tissue transplantation can thoroughly remove HS lesions in the buttocks and improve the condition of wound bed for skin acceptance after debridement, which is conducive to the cure of HS in the buttocks which has undergone multiple operations but still recurs after operation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661108>Graphene oxide mediated co-generation of C-doping and  defects in BiWO nanosheets: a combined DRIFTS and DFT investigation.</a></h2><p>In order to efficiently control air pollutants using photocatalytic technology, the co-generation of C-doping and  vacancies (OVs) in Bi2WO6 (BWO) nanosheets was achieved by a graphene oxide (GO)-mediated hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic performance was highly improved with the synergistic effects of C-doping and OVs. The experimental characterization and DFT calculations were closely combined to reveal that the C element could serve as both an electron acceptor and channel for charge transfer to promote charge separation. Meanwhile, the OVs could induce the formation of a defect level in the band gap which increases the production of ˙OH as the primary reactive species by introducing more light-generated holes into the valence band. Meanwhile, the OVs could enhance the generation of ˙O2- species via the promotion of O2 adsorption and activation on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the reaction intermediates were monitored and the mechanism of photocatalytic NO oxidation was proposed based on in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The design concept of photocatalyst modification with C-doping and OVs could offer a novel strategy to enhance the performance for environmental applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657336>[Meta-analysis of clinical efficacy of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure].</a></h2><p>To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacies of Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for comparison of efficacy between Helmet non-invasive ventilation and  therapy for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure published by Wanfang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were retrieved. The retrieval time was from the establishment of database to February 1st, 2019. The indexes of the study outcomes included oxygenation index, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO), endotracheal intubation rate, hospital mortality and intolerance rate. Literature search and data extraction was performed separately by two researchers. Quality assessment of literature was conducted according to the risk of bias criterion provided by Cochrane collaboration net. The extractive data were Meta-analyzed by RevMan 5.1.0. Funnel plot and Egger regression analysis was employed to detect publication bias.Six RCTs including 5 English studies and 1 Chinese study were selected. Finally, 547 patients were enrolled, with 270 patients in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group and 277 in  therapy group. The study quality assessment revealed that the overall risk of bias was low, and no publication bias was detected by the funnel plot and Egger regression analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the oxygenation index in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group was significantly higher than that in  therapy group [mean difference (MD) = 73.47, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 52.01 to 94.92, P = 0.000 01], and PaCO (MD = -2.46, 95%CI was -4.54 to -0.39, P = 0.02), endotracheal intubation rate [relative risk ratio (RR) = 0.38, 95%CI was 0.20 to 0.73, P = 0.004] and hospital mortality (RR = 0.35, 95%CI was 0.19 to 0.65, P = 0.000 8) in Helmet non-invasive ventilation group were significantly lower than those in  therapy group. There was no significant difference in patient's intolerance between the two groups (RR = 2.38, 95%CI was 0.74 to 7.67, P = 0.15).Compared with  therapy, the Helmet non-invasive ventilation used for treatment of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure can effectively improve the oxygenation index, decrease the PaCO, reduce the endotracheal intubation rate and hospital mortality, and the patients are well tolerated to the Helmet method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661109>Spontaneous wrinkle emergence in nascent eumelanin thin films.</a></h2><p>Self-patterning processes originated by physical stimuli have been extensively documented in thin films, whereas spontaneous wrinkling phenomena due to chemical transformation processes are, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. Herein we report a case of spontaneous polymerization-driven surface nano-patterning (∼500 nm) that develops in smooth thin solid films of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a major precursor of eumelanin polymers, over a time scale of 30 to 60 days in air at room temperature. The phenomenon can be observed only above a critical film thickness of ∼250 nm and it is affected by exposure to ammonia vapors causing acceleration of the oxidation process. The thickness-dependent onset of wrinkling can be attributed to non-homogeneous rates of oxidation through the film causing slow swelling/expansion of the inner layers followed by fast stiffening and cross-linking in the outer layer exposed to higher  levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654830>Antioxidant response to cadmium exposure in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from humans and elephant seals.</a></h2><p>Cadmium (Cd) occurs naturally; however, its concentration can increase with anthropogenic activities. Excess Cd increases reactive  species (ROS) production and oxidative damage, which can lead to pathological conditions. Marine mammals accumulate Cd in the liver and the kidney; yet, there are no reports of Cd-associated tissue damage in whales, seals or dolphins. Response to Cd exposure (0-5.0 μM CdCl for 1-12 h) was analyzed and compared in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and humans (Homo sapiens). Antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase), glutathione concentration, and protein carbonyl levels (an indicator of oxidative damage) were quantified. Glutathione levels were higher in northern elephant seal than in human cells. Protein carbonyl content in cells exposed to Cd was lower and had a smaller variability range in elephant seals than in humans. Generalized linear models (GLIM) identified Cd exposure and antioxidant defenses as significant contributors to protein carbonyl variability in human but not in elephant seal cells. These results suggest that the previously observed differences in circulating and tissue glutathione levels between marine and terrestrial mammals are maintained under cell culture conditions and that northern elephant seal and human muscle cells respond differently to Cd exposure. The results also suggest that the observed differences could potentially be associated with the protective mechanisms that allow northern elephant seals to tolerate extreme conditions that result in increased ROS generation (e.g. diving, sleep apnea, fasting) with no oxidative damage.Copyright © 2019.

The Pt/Bi-BWO performed excellent photocatalytic activity on the degradation of gaseous toluene under visible light illumination. The photocatalytic reaction rate of 0.15% Pt/Bi-BWO was 2.88 times higher than that of BiWO. Over 90% gas phase toluene was removed by 0.15% Pt/Bi-BWO in one hour and over 80% of which was degraded into CO and HO. The Pt/Bi-BWO also performed great stability confirmed by circulating runs test. The mechanism of the promotion was explored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and DFT calculations. The produced  vacancies were below conduction band (CB) of BiWO, leading to a narrowed band gap. Meantime, the generated  vacancies could activate O to enhance the production of reactive  species (ROS), such as O and OH. In addition, the added Pt could act as electron trap to suppress the recombination of electrons-holes pairs.

It is industrially produced by chemical route; however, a more economical and environmentally friendly production process is of interest. In this context, this study aimed to select wild yeasts able to produce xylitol and compare their performance in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate. For this, 960 yeast strains, isolated from soil, wood, and insects have been prospected and selected for the ability to grow on defined medium containing xylose as the sole carbon source. A total of 42 yeasts was selected and their profile of sugar consumption and metabolite production were analyzed in microscale fermentation. The six best xylose-consuming strains were molecularly identified as  spp The fermentative kinetics comparisons on defined medium and on sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate showed physiological differences among these strains. Production yields vary from Y = 0.25 g/g to Y = 0.34 g/g in defined medium and from Y = 0.41 g/g to Y = 0.60 g/g in the hydrolysate. Then, the xylitol production performance of the best xylose-consuming strain obtained in the screening, which was named   B12, was compared with the previously reported xylitol producing yeasts   A3,  sp. JA1, and   740 in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate under -limited conditions. All the yeasts were able to metabolize xylose, but   740 showed the highest xylitol production yield, reaching a maximum of 0.83 g xylitol/g of xylose in hydrolysate. The screening strategy allowed identification of a new   strain that efficiently grows in xylose even in hydrolysate with a high content of acetic acid (~6 g/L). In addition, this study reports, for the first time, a high-efficient xylitol producing strain of  , which achieved, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest xylitol production yields in hydrolysate reported in the literature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657929> Formed IrLi Nanoparticles as Active Cathode Material in Li- Batteries.</a></h2><p>Lithium- (Li-O2) batteries are a promising class of rechargeable Li batteries with a potentially very high achievable energy density. One of the major challenges for Li-O2 batteries is the high charge overpotential, which results in a low energy efficiency. In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of ~1.5 nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1.5 nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir3Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO2 discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir3Li particles. The in situ formed Ir3Li core-shell nanoparticles discovered here provide a new direction for active cathode materials that can reduce charge overpotentials in Li-O2 batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659247>Time and rate dependent synaptic learning in neuro-mimicking resistive memories.</a></h2><p>Memristors have demonstrated immense potential as building blocks in future adaptive neuromorphic architectures. Recently, there has been focus on emulating specific synaptic functions of the mammalian nervous system by either tailoring the functional oxides or engineering the external programming hardware. However, high device-to-device variability in memristors induced by the electroforming process and complicated programming hardware are among the key challenges that hinder achieving biomimetic neuromorphic networks. Here, a simple hybrid complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-memristor approach is reported to implement different synaptic learning rules by utilizing a CMOS-compatible memristor based on -deficient SrTiO (STO). The potential of such hybrid CMOS-memristor approach is demonstrated by successfully imitating time-dependent (pair and triplet spike-time-dependent-plasticity) and rate-dependent (Bienenstosk-Cooper-Munro) synaptic learning rules. Experimental results are benchmarked against in-vitro measurements from hippocampal and visual cortices with good agreement. The scalability of synaptic devices and their programming through a CMOS drive circuitry elaborates the potential of such an approach in realizing adaptive neuromorphic computation and networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658159>Effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTEN on brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in a rat kindling model of epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Epilepsy is a chronic and severe neurological disorder. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)-deficient mice exhibit learning and memory deficits and spontaneous epilepsy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PTEN in brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in a rat model of epilepsy.An adenovirus (Ad)-PTEN vector was constructed, and status epilepticus (SE) was induced in 41 model rats using lithium chloride-pilocarpine. Thirty-six SE rats were then allocated into the Ad-PTEN, Ad-LacZ, and SE groups, those were administered intracerebroventricular injections of Ad-PTEN, Ad-enhanced green fluorescent protein, and phosphate buffer saline, respectively. The normal group was comprised of healthy Sprague-Dawley rats. Nissl staining was conducted to evaluate neuronal damage, and immunohistochemistry was conducted to observe the morphology of cells in the hippocampal CA1 region and the distribution of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and ED1 (rat homologue of human CD68). Levels of apoptosis-related proteins, inflammatory-related factors, and oxidative stress-related markers (reactive  species [ROS], glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and malondialdehyde [MDA]) were measured. Comparisons between multiple groups were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and pairwise comparisons after ANOVA were conducted using the Tukey multiple comparisons test.After SE induction, PTEN expression in the rat brain exhibited a four-fold decrease (P = 0.000) and the expression of both Iba1 and ED1 increased. Furthermore, significant neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and neuroinflammation were observed in the SE rat brain. After intracerebroventricular injection of Ad-PTEN, PTEN expression exhibited a three-fold increase (P = 0.003), and the expression of both Iba1 and ED1 decreased. Additionally, neurons were restored and neuronal apoptosis was inhibited. Furthermore, ROS and MDA levels decreased, GSH level and SOD activity increased, and neuroinflammation was reduced.Our study demonstrated that brain oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in SE rats were ameliorated by intracerebroventricular injection of Ad-PTEN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661096>Defect formation and migration in Nasicon LiAlTi(PO).</a></h2><p>NASICON-structured materials of the composition Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 are regarded as solid electrolytes with high Li-ion conductivity applicable in all solid-state batteries.

Usps play an important role in adaptation of bacteria to a variety of environmental stresses. There is increasing evidence that Usps facilitate pathogens to adapt host environment and are involved in pathogenicity. Edwardsiella piscicida (formerly included in E. tarda) is a severe fish pathogen and infects various important economic fish including Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In E. piscicida, a number of systems and factors that are involved in stress resistance and pathogenesis were identified. However, the function of Usps in E. piscicida is totally unknown. In this study, we examined the expressions of 13 usp genes in E. piscicida and found that most of these usp genes were up-regulated expression under high temperature, oxidative stress, acid stress, and host serum stress. Particularly, among these usp genes, usp13, exhibited dramatically high expression level upon several stress conditions. To investigate the biological role of usp13, a markerless usp13 in-frame mutant strain, TX01Δusp13, was constructed. Compared to the wild type TX01, TX01Δusp13 exhibited markedly compromised tolerance to high temperature, hydrogen peroxide, and low pH. Deletion of usp13 significantly retarded bacterial biofilm growth and decreased resistance against serum killing. Pathogenicity analysis showed that the inactivation of usp13 significantly impaired the ability of E. piscicida to invade into host cell and infect host tissue. Introduction of a trans-expressed usp13 gene restored the lost virulence of TX01Δusp13. In support of these results, host immune response induced by TX01 and TX01Δusp13 was examined, and the results showed reactive  species (ROS) levels in TX01Δusp13-infected macrophages were significantly higher than those in TX01-infected cells. The expression level of several cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and CC2) in TX01Δusp13-infected fish was significantly higher than that in TX01-infected fish. These results suggested that the deletion of usp13 attenuated the ability of bacteria to overcome the host immune response to pathogen infection. Taken together, our study indicated Usp13 of E. piscicida was not only important participant in adversity resistance, but also was essential for E. piscicida pathogenicity and contributed to block host immune response to pathogen infection.Copyright © 2019.

It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop novel materials and strategies for dealing with the clenbuterol. Herein, functional polymer microspheres prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerization were explored for the selective enrichment of the clenbuterol, and their structure and  functionalities could be tailor-made by a molecular imprinting process. The clenbuterol imprinting was adequately demonstrated to not only increase the particle size (~52 nm vs. ~42 nm) and create cavities for the accommodation of the clenbuterol molecules, but also reduce the  functionalities of the resulting molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (MIPMs) by approximately 4 at.%, which is believed to correlate with the high specificity of the MIPMs. Various characterization methods were employed to evidence these findings, including scanning electron microscopy, BET measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental mapping examination. More importantly, the MIPMs showed a markedly superior enrichment capability towards clenbuterol to the counterpart, that is, non-molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (NIPMs). Compared to the NIPMs without specificity for clenbuterol, the MIPMs exhibited an impressive selectivity to clenbuterol, with the relative selectivity coefficient () values largely exceeding 1, thus corroborating that the useful molecular imprinting led to the generation of the binding sites complementary to the clenbuterol molecule in the size and functionalities. The MIPMs were also employed as the stationary phase to fabricate molecularly imprinting solid-phase extraction column, and the spike recovery was demonstrated to be not significantly decreased even after nine cycles. Furthermore, the reliability of the method was also evidenced through the comparison of the MIPMs prepared from different batches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653020>How  Availability Affects the Antimicrobial Efficacy of Host Defense Peptides: Lessons Learned from Studying the Copper-Binding Peptides Piscidins 1 and 3.</a></h2><p>The development of new therapeutic options against  () infection is a critical public health concern, as the causative bacterium is highly resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics.

After 24 hours of model establishment, MCAO rats were given curcumin for 3 days by intragastric administration. PC12 cells were cultured for 6 h in -glucose deprivation medium and then reoxygenated for 24 h to establish an -glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model. The OGD/R model cells were treated with curcumin for 48 h.Curcumin inhibited the decrease of miR-7-5p expression and increase of RelA p65 expression induced by CIR and ODG/R. RelA p65 was a target of miR-7-5p. MiR-7-5p antagonists were able to counteract the effect of curcumin on the expression of RelA p65 in ischemic brain tissue of MCAO rats and OGD/R model cells. Curcumin improved OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell activity, necrosis and apoptosis. Curcumin significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in OGD/R-induced cells. Curcumin may inhibit OGD/R-induced cell damage by regulating miR-7-5p. Curcumin improved cerebral infarction, nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction in rats with CIR, which may be related to the regulation of miR-7-5p/RelA p65 axis.Curcumin exerts cerebral protection by attenuating cell necrosis and apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress following CIR, which may be related to its regulation of the miR-7/RELA p65 axis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656372>Physiology of  Transport and its Determinants in Intensive Care Unit.</a></h2><p>Transport of  is one of the most important functions of blood.

The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a metabolic fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln metabolism, as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS.

For patients in a hospital ward, the main challenges in the development of continuous and robust non-contact monitoring techniques are the identification of time periods and the segmentation of skin regions of interest (ROIs) from which vital signs can be estimated. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The first network was designed for detecting the presence of a patient and segmenting the patient's skin area. The second network combined the output from the first network with optical flow for identifying time periods of clinical intervention so that these periods can be excluded from the estimation of vital signs. Both networks were trained using video recordings from a clinical study involving 15 pre-term infants conducted in the high dependency area of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK. The proposed methods achieved an accuracy of 98.8\% for patient detection, a mean intersection-over-union (IOU) score of 88.6\% for skin segmentation and an accuracy of 94.5\% for clinical intervention detection using two-fold cross validation. Our deep learning models produced accurate results and were robust to different skin tones, changes in light conditions, pose variations and different clinical interventions by medical staff and family visitors. Finally, we show that cardio-respiratory signals can be continuously derived from the patient's skin during which the patient is present and no clinical intervention is undertaken.Creative Commons Attribution license.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661440>Modelling gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment: when current knowledge needs to encounter engineering practice and vice versa.</a></h2><p>Gas-liquid mass transfer in wastewater treatment processes has received considerable attention over the last decades from both academia and industry. Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant energy expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for  mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of  and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661534>Common variants in glyoxalase I do not increase chronic pancreatitis risk.</a></h2><p>Chronic pancreatitis (CP) may be caused by oxidative stress. An important source of reactive  species (ROS) is the methylglyoxal-derived formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). Methylglyoxal is detoxified by Glyoxalase I (GLO1). A reduction in GLO1 activity results in increased ROS. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GLO1 have been linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we analyzed whether common GLO1 variants are associated with alcoholic (ACP) and non-alcoholic CP (NACP).Using melting curve analysis, we genotyped a screening cohort of 223 ACP, 218 NACP patients, and 328 controls for 11 tagging SNPs defined by the SNPinfo LD TAG SNP Selection tool and the functionally relevant variant rs4746. For selected variants the cohorts were extended to up to 1,441 patient samples.In the ACP cohort, comparison of genotypes for rs1937780 between patients and controls displayed an ambiguous result in the screening cohort (p = 0.08). However, in the extended cohort of 1,441 patients no statistically significant association was found for the comparison of genotypes (p = 0.11), nor in logistic regression analysis (p = 0.214, OR 1.072, 95% CI 0.961-1.196). In the NACP screening cohort SNPs rs937662, rs1699012, and rs4746 displayed an ambiguous result when patients were compared to controls in the recessive or dominant model (p = 0.08, 0.08, and 0.07, respectively). Again, these associations were not confirmed in the extended cohorts (rs937662, dominant model: p = 0.07, logistic regression: p = 0.07, OR 1.207, 95% CI 0.985-1.480) or in the replication cohorts for rs4746 (Germany, p = 0.42, OR 1.080, 95% CI 0.673-1.124; France, p = 0.19, OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.06; China, p = 0.24, OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.90-1.54) and rs1699012 (Germany, Munich; p = 0.279, OR 0.903, 95% CI 0.750-1.087).Common GLO1 variants do not increase chronic pancreatitis risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655487>Free radicals and neonatal encephalopathy: mechanisms of injury, biomarkers, and antioxidant treatment perspectives.</a></h2><p>Neonatal encephalopathy (NE), most commonly a result of the disruption of cerebral  delivery, is the leading cause of neurologic disability in term neonates. Given the key role of free radicals in brain injury development following hypoxia-ischemia-reperfusion, several oxidative biomarkers have been explored in preclinical and clinical models of NE. Among these, antioxidant enzyme activity, uric acid excretion, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde, and non-protein-bound iron have shown promising results as possible predictors of NE severity and outcome. Owing to high costs and technical complexity, however, their routine use in clinical practice is still limited. Several strategies aimed at reducing free radical production or upregulating physiological scavengers have been proposed for NE. Room-air resuscitation has proved to reduce oxidative stress following perinatal asphyxia and is now universally adopted. A number of medications endowed with antioxidant properties, such as melatonin, erythropoietin, allopurinol, or N-acetylcysteine, have also shown potential neuroprotective effects in perinatal asphyxia; nevertheless, further evidence is needed before these antioxidant approaches could be implemented as standard care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654994>The influence of the technique of surfactant administration (LISA vs INSURE) on the outcomes of respiratory distress syndrome treatment in preterm infants.</a></h2><p>Intratracheal administration of exogenous surfactant is a well-established therapy for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. The two preferred methods for respiratory support in neonates that contribute to limiting the risk of lung damage associated with mechanical ventilation include nCPAP and non-invasive ventilation. The increasing popularity of surfactant administration techniques is due to the fact they reduce the time of mechanical ventilation until this medication is administered. In some cases a short period of mechanical ventilation follows (INSURE: INtubation-SURfactant-Extubation). There are also methods that make it possible to completely avoid intubation and help maintain spontaneous breathing during surfactant administration (LISA: Less Invasive Surfactant Administration, MIST: Minimal Invasive Surfactant Therapy). Aim: To analyze treatment outcomes in preterm infants who suffer from respiratory distress syndrome and require exogenous surfactant administration depending on the technique used: LISA vs INSURE.Material and methods: The present retrospective analysis included 129 infants born at a gestational age of between 24 and 33 weeks who were hospitalized in the Neonatology Department in the years 2014-2016, were administered surfactant and remained on non-invasive ventilation. All the subjects received only proractant alfa. Both study groups: LISA (n=83) and INSURE (n=46) were analyzed in terms of respiratory distress treatment outcomes and the presence of complications of prematurity.Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two study groups (LISA vs INSURE: mean birth body weight was 1210 g vs 1275 g, respectively; mean gestational age at birth was 30 weeks vs 29 6/7 weeks, respectively). The comparison of respiratory support method and FiO2 concentration within the first 72 hours after surfactant administration showed no significant differences between the groups. Similarly, respiratory outcomes did not significantly differ between the LISA and INSURE groups and were: the need for intubation ⎼ 42.2% vs 32.6%, p=0.201, duration of mechanical ventilation - median days 0 vs 0, p=0.377, duration of nCPAP - median days 5 vs 5, p=0.379, duration of  supplementation - median days 1 vs 1, p=0.555, and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia - 28.9% vs 23.9%, p=0.506. Also, the incidence of complications was similar in both study groups.Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis of preliminary outcomes of surfactant administration involving the use of the LISA technique showed no statistically significant differences as compared with the INSURE method. The randomized, prospective study that is currently being conducted at our Neonatology Department and includes biochemical markers of lung damage, will bring more objective data on the safety and effectiveness of both surfactant administration techniques (LISA vs INSURE).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653023>The Role of Magnesium in the Secondary Phase After Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury. A Prospective Clinical Observer Study.</a></h2><p>In the secondary injury phase after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI), oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory responses at the site of injury constitute crucial factors controlling damage extent and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. We determined Magnesium (Mg) serum concentration dynamics in context with the potential of neurological remission in patients with TSCI as Mg is suspected to limit the production of reactive  species and reduce lipid peroxidation. A total of 29 patients with acute TSCI were enrolled, and blood samples were drawn over 3 months at 11 time-points and Mg quantification was performed. Patients were divided into those with (G1,  = 18) or without neurological remission (G0,  = 11). Results show a slight drop in Mg level during the first 4 h after injury, then remained almost unchanged in G1, but increased continuously during the first 7 days after injury in G0. At day 7 Mg concentrations in G1 and G0 were significantly different ( = 0.039, G0 > G1). Significant differences were detected between patients in G1 that presented an AIS (ASIA Impairment Scale) conversion of 1 level versus those with more than 1 level ( = 0.014, G1 AIS imp. = +1 > G1 AI imp. > +1). Low and decreasing levels of Mg within the first 7 days are indicative of a high probability of neurological remission, whereas increasing levels are associated with poor neurological outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658599>Redox-Mediated Mechanism of Chemoresistance in Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Cellular reactive  species (ROS) status is stabilized by a balance of ROS generation and elimination called redox homeostasis. ROS is increased by activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family members and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of mitochondria. Increased ROS is detoxified by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxins. ROS has a role as a secondary messenger in signal transduction. Cancer cells induce fluctuations of redox homeostasis by variation of ROS regulated machinery, leading to increased tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Redox-mediated mechanisms of chemoresistance include endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated autophagy, increased cell cycle progression, and increased conversion to metastasis or cancer stem-like cells. This review discusses changes of the redox state in tumorigenesis and redox-mediated mechanisms involved in tolerance to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661456>Degradation of 1H-benzotriazole using vacuum ultraviolet: a prospective treatment method for micro-pollutants.</a></h2><p>Benzotriazoles (BTs) attract increasing concerns because of abundant presence in environmental water bodies. In this study, degradation of 1H-benzotriazole (1H-BT) was performed by a customized vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) device emitting 185 + 254 nm (VUV/UV-C) irradiation. Degradation of 1H-BT presented an apparent rate constant reached 8.17 × 10 s. Degradation mechanisms included 185 + 254 nm photodegradation and radical reaction. The later one may be the predominant one, which presented a k at (7.3 ± 0.8) × 10 M s. Effects of anions revealed that VUV interception and radical trapping were the dominant restraining factors. Degradation of 1H-BT can be attributed to VUV induced radical-based oxidation. Radical-induced addition, substitution and fracture generated abundant hydroxylated and open-loop products during 10-45 min. Identification using reactive  species and apoptosis in Escherichia coli was conducted. Variations of these two indicators revealed that the incomplete degradation products presented higher toxicities than 1H-BT, and a further mineralization reduced their toxicities. In the pure water solution with little impurities, VUV can induce efficient degradation of 1H-BT, suggesting its potential for eliminating and detoxifying MPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660990>Potential biomarkers for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration at short and long term after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insult in rat.</a></h2><p>Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy causes life-long morbidity and premature mortality in term neonates. Therapies in addition to whole-body cooling are under development to treat the neonate at risk for HI encephalopathy, but are not a quickly measured serum inflammatory or neuronal biomarkers to rapidly and accurately identify brain injury in order to follow the efficacy of therapies.In order to identify potential biomarkers for early inflammatory and neurodegenerative events after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, both male and female Wistar rat pups at postnatal day 7 (P7) were used and had their right carotid artery permanently doubly occluded and exposed to 8%  for 90 min. Sensory and cognitive parameters were assessed by open field, rotarod, CatWalk, and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Plasma and CSF biomarkers were investigated on the acute (24 h and 72 h) and chronic phase (4 weeks). Brains were assessed for gene expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR Array.We found a delay of neurological reflex maturation in HI rats. We observed anxiolytic-like baseline behavior in males more than females following HI injury. HI rats held on the rotarod for a shorter time comparing to sham. HI injury impaired spatial learning ability on MWM test. The CatWalk assessment demonstrated a long-term deficit in gait parameters related to the hind paw. Proinflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 in plasma and CCL2 and TNF-α in CSF showed an upregulation at 24 h after HI while other cytokines, such as IL-17A and CCL5, were upregulated after 72 h in CSF. At 24 h post-injury, we observed an increase of Edn1, Hif1-α, and Mmp9 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral vs the contralateral hemisphere of HI rats. An upregulation of genes involved with clotting and hematopoietic processes was observed 72 h post-injury.Our work showed that, in the immature brain, the HI injury induced an early increased production of several proinflammatory mediators detectable in plasma and CSF, followed by tissue damage in the hypoxic hemisphere and short-term as well as long-lasting neurobehavioral deficits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657442>The signalling role of ROS in the regulation of seed germination and dormancy.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are versatile compounds which can have toxic or signalling effects in a wide range living organisms, including seeds. They have been reported to play a pivotal role in the regulation of seed germination and dormancy but their mechanisms of action are still far from being fully understood. In this review, we sum-up the major findings that have been carried out this last decade in this field of research and which altogether shed a new light on the signalling roles of ROS in seed physiology. ROS participate in dormancy release during seed dry storage through the direct oxidation of a subset of biomolecules. During seed imbibition, the controlled generation of ROS is involved in the perception and transduction of environmental conditions that control germination. When these conditions are permissive for germination, ROS levels are maintained at a level which triggers cellular events associated with germination, such as hormone signalling. Here we propose that the spatiotemporal regulation of ROS production acts in concert with hormone signalling to regulate the cellular events involved in cell expansion associated with germination.© 2019 The Author(s).

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are believed to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway function by regulating the adherence of the molecules to the extracellular matrix. However, regulatory and molecular mechanisms through which the EGF and HA could influence the embryo development is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of continued or stage specific supplementation of EGF and/or HA on the developmental competence and quality of bovine preimplantation embryos and the subsequent consequences on the expression and DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway. The results revealed that, the supplementation of EGF or HA from zygote to the blastocysts stage reduced the level of reactive  species and increased hatching rate after thawing. On the other hand, HA decreased the apoptotic nuclei and increased blastocyst compared to EGF supplemented group. Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in the resulting blastocysts indicated that, combined supplementation of EGF and HA increased the expression of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway while supplementation of EGF, HA or a combination of EGF and HA during the entire preimplantation period changed the DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway. On the other hand, blastocysts developed in culture media supplemented with EGF + HA until the 16-cell stage exhibited higher expression level of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway compared to those supplemented after the 16-cell stage. Conversely, the DNA methylation level of candidate genes was increased in the blastocysts obtained from embryos cultured in media supplemented with EGF + HA after 16-cell stage. In conclusion, supplementation of bovine embryos with EGF and/or HA during the entire preimplantation period or in a stage specific manner altered the DNA methylation and expression patterns of candidate genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway which was in turn associated with the observed embryonic developmental competence and quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659889>Ternary Mixed Spinel Oxides as  Carriers for Chemical Looping Hydrogen Production Operating at 550 oC.</a></h2><p>Operating chemical looping at moderate temperatures circumvents the issue that the sintering of  carrier materials (OCMs) is serious at typical operating conditions, 800-950 oC. However, lower temperatures can lead to deterioration on the reaction kinetics and thereby the low H2 production rate and yield. Here, we present several doped spinel oxides consisting of earth-abundant elements for chemical looping water splitting. By virtue of the ability of Cu dopant to improve the reduction of Co based binary spinel, the high reducibility of the dopants in the reduction period, as well as the phase reversibility in the water splitting period, Cu0.25Co0.25Fe2.5Oy shows high hydrogen yield (~11.9 mmol.g-1) and average hydrogen production rate (~137.7 μmol.g-1.min-1) at 550 oC, with negligible decays in repetitive redox cycles.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine 5-20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial  saturation and cerebral regional  saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.5) l h for CL and 5.29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cancer can increase the risk of diabetes. Consequently, diabetes and cancer share many risk factors, but the cellular and molecular pathways correlating diabetes and colon and rectal cancer (CRC) remain far from understood. In this study, we assess the effect of hyperglycemia on cancer cell aggressiveness in human colon epithelial adenocarcinoma cells  and in an experimental animal model of CRC. Our results show that Nox (NADPH oxidase enzyme) 4-induced reactive  species (ROS) production is deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. This is paralleled by inactivation of the AMPK and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 signaling pathways, resulting in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) accumulation, induction of DNA damage, and exacerbation of cancer cell aggressiveness, thus contributing to the genomic instability and predisposition to increased tumorigenesis in the diabetic milieu. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK, inhibition of mTORC1, or blockade of Nox4 reduce ROS production, restore the homeostatic signaling of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/8-oxodG, and lessen the progression of CRC malignancy in a diabetic milieu. Taken together, our results identify the AMPK/mTORC1/Nox4 signaling axis as a molecular switch correlating diabetes and CRC.

Copper-based nanoparticles with a high antibacterial property may be a solution to the problem. It is, therefore, important to understand the mode of antibacterial action of the nanoparticles (NPs). Despite reports on induction of reactive  species (ROS) in bacteria by copper and copper-oxide nanoparticles and involvement of such ROS in cell killing, it is still unclear (a) if surface modification of the nanoparticles by media organics has any role on their antibacterial potency and (b) whether the bactericidal effects of these NPs are 'particle-specific' or 'ion-specific' in nature. We address these issues for cupric oxide nanoparticle (CuO-NP) in this study. Instead of nutrient medium, when E. coli bacterial cells were suspended in saline (0.9% NaCl), CuO-NP had a more anti-bacterial effect, with MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) value of 6 µg/mL, than in nutrient medium with MBC value of 160 µg/mL. Moreover, the lysine-modified CuO-NP in saline had MBC at 130 µg/mL. Thus, unmodified CuO-NP was more efficient killer than modified one.

All patients were treated with HFNC or conventional  therapy (COT), such as a nasal cannula or venturi mask, immediately after extubation. Decongestive therapy (intravenous furosemide infusion) was administered at the discretion of the attending physician.Of 212 patients treated during the study period, 47 were excluded due to recent open-heart surgery and two, due to insufficient clinical data. The remaining 163 patients had a mean age of 67.4±14.3 years, and 92 (56.4%) were male; 44 patients received HFNC, and 119 COT. Mean weight loss within 72 hours of extubation was -0.86±2.03 kg. A total of 38 patients (23.3%) required reintubation, 21 of whom (12.9%) required reintubation within 72 hours of extubation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 16 patients (9.8%). Multivariate analysis showed that weight increase within 72 hours of extubation was independent determinants of reintubation (OR =1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2; P<0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR =1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1; P=0.005). The use of HFNC was not associated with reintubation or in-hospital mortality.Our findings indicate that early weight loss resulted in reduced reintubation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ACPE. However, HFNC and COT did not differ in the prevention of reintubation and in-hospital mortality. Therefore, aggressive decongestive therapy, rather than HFNC, should be considered early after extubation.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) implantation via bronchoscopy can immediately relieve airway stenosis and improve survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict survival in patients with airway involvement due to advanced esophageal cancer after SEMS implantation.We conducted this retrospective study from February 2007 to October 2013 at a university hospital. Forty-two patients with advanced esophageal cancer and airway involvement were included. The patients underwent flexible bronchoscopy with electrosurgery and SEMS implantation under bronchoscopic visualization and local anesthesia with no fluoroscopic guidance throughout the procedure.Acute respiratory failure (ARF) occurred in 14 patients (33.3%). After SEMS implantation, 28 patients (66.7%) received additional anti-cancer therapy. The median survival after the procedure was 83 days. A longer survival was seen in the patients who received further anti-cancer therapy [hazard ratio (HR), 0.146; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.34; P<0.001]. Persistent pneumonia and poor performance status (PS) were potential factors for not receiving further therapy. The patients who received anti-cancer therapy before the procedure (HR, 3.429; 95% CI, 1.54-7.60; P=0.002) and those with ARF (HR, 5.224; 95% CI, 2.23-12.26; P<0.001) had worse survival.SEMS insertion with flexible bronchoscopy without fluoroscopic guidance in the patients with airway involvement due to advanced esophageal cancer was safe and feasible. The patients who received anti-cancer therapy before the procedure and those with ARF had a poor prognosis.

The objectives were to identify physiological and clinical parameters that predict the occurrence and severity of OSA and to investigate the effect of OSA on quality of life in patients with CRDs.Seventy-three patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 77 patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) and pulmonary function testing and completed clinical questionnaires. The oximetry tracing was interpreted blindly with respect to the PSG results.The prevalence of OSA was 44% and 62% in COPD and ILD, respectively. The COPD assessment test item scores related to sleep quality and daily vitality were worse among patients with OSA than among patients without OSA. The STOP-BANG questionnaire (cutoff point ≥ 3) and  desaturation index from the oximetry recording ( desaturation index (ODI) were associated with OSA in CRDs. The STOP-BANG questionnaire with a cutoff point ≥ 3 or 6 had the highest sensitivity and specificity, respectively, in detecting OSA in CRDs. ODI had the best accuracy in identifying OSA and was independently associated with the apnea-hypopnea index in CRDs.We found OSA to be common and associated with worse sleep quality and less daily vitality in patients with advanced CRDs. The STOP-BANG questionnaire with different cutoff points may help rule in or rule out OSA. Overnight oximetry can be used as a screening tool for OSA and can assist the clinical evaluation of OSA in patients with CRDs.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657747>Effect of a gradually increasing temperature on the behavioural and physiological response of juvenile Hippocampus erectus: Thermal preference, tolerance, energy balance and growth.</a></h2><p>The physiological and behavioural responses of ectotherms to temperature is strongly dependent on the individuals' previous thermal history. Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every 5 days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference,  consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the checkpoint gene PD-L1 that mediates the immune resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the immune system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor immune response based on PD-L1 blockade.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658500>A predictive spatial model for roasted coffee using  isotopes of α-cellulose.</a></h2><p>Fraudulent region-of-origin labeling is a concern for high-value, globally traded commodities such as coffee. The  isotope ratio of cellulose is a useful geographic tracer, as it integrates climate and source water signals. A predictive spatial model ("isoscape") of the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose is generated to evaluate coffee region-of-origin claims.The  isotope ratio of α-cellulose extracted from roasted coffee beans was measured via TC/EA-IRMS and used to calculate the δ O value of coffee bean water. The  O isotopic enrichment of coffee bean water relative to the δ O value of local precipitation was modeled as a function of local temperature and humidity. This function was incorporated into a mechanistic model of cellulose δ O values to predict the δ O values of coffee bean cellulose across coffee-producing regions globally.The δ O values of analyzed coffee bean cellulose ranged from approximately +22‰ to +42‰ (VSMOW). As expected, coffees grown in the same region tended to have similar isotope ratios, and the δ O value of coffee bean cellulose was generally higher than the δ O value of modeled stem cellulose for the region. Modeled δ O values of coffee cellulose were within ±2.3‰ of the measured δ O value of coffee cellulose.The  isotope ratio of coffee bean cellulose is a useful indicator of region-of-origin and varies predictably in response to climatic factors and precipitation isotope ratios. The isoscape of coffee bean cellulose δ O values from this study provides a quantitative tool that can be applied to region-of-origin verification of roasted coffee at the point-of-sale.This article is protected by copyright.

DosC is a diguanylate cyclase that synthesizes c-di-GMP from GTP, whereas DosP is a phosphodiesterase that linearizes c-di-GMP to pGpG. Both proteins are associated with the large degradosome enzyme complex that regulates many bacterial genes post-transcriptionally by processing or degrading the corresponding RNAs. Moreover, the c-di-GMP directly binds to PNPase, a key degradosome enzyme, and enhances its activity. This review combines biochemical, biophysical, and genetic findings on DosC and DosP, a task that has not been undertaken until now, partly because of the varied nomenclature. The DosC and DosP system is examined in the context of the current knowledge of degradosomes and considered as a possible prototype for the compartmentalization of sensing by E. coli.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the induction of autophagy has been suggested during ferroptosis. However, this relationship between autophagy and ferroptosis is still controversial and the autophagy-inducing mediator remains unknown. In this study, we confirmed that autophagy is indeed induced by the ferroptosis inducer erastin. Furthermore, we show that autophagy leads to iron-dependent ferroptosis by degradation of ferritin and induction of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression, using wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells, BECN1 and LC3B. Consistently, autophagy deficiency caused depletion of intracellular iron and reduced lipid peroxidation, resulting in cell survival during erastin-induced ferroptosis. We further identified that autophagy was triggered by erastin-induced reactive  species (ROS) in ferroptosis. These data provide evidence that ROS-induced autophagy is a key regulator of ferritin degradation and TfR1 expression during ferroptosis. Our study thus contributes toward our understanding of the ferroptotic processes and also helps resolve some of the controversies associated with this phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654851>Template-free Synthesis of Stable Cobalt Manganese Spinel Hollow Nanostructured Catalysts for Highly Water-Resistant CO Oxidation.</a></h2><p>Development of spinel oxides as low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts is highly desirable; however, rational synthesis of efficient and stable spinel systems with precisely controlled structure and components remains challenging. We demonstrate the design of complex nanostructured cobalt-based bimetallic spinel catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation by a simple template-free method. The self-assembled multi-shelled mesoporous spinel nanostructures provide high surface area (203.5 m/g) and favorable unique surface chemistry for producing abundant active sites and lead to the creation of robust microsphere configured by 16-nm spinel nanosheets, which achieve satisfactory water-resisting property and catalytic activity. Theoretical models show that O vacancies at exposed {110} facets in cubic spinel phase guarantee the strong adsorption of reactive  species on the surface of catalysts and play a key role in the prevention of deactivation under moisture-rich conditions. The design concept with architecture and composition control can be extended to other mixed transition metal oxide compositions.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The contribution of 1O2 and ˙OH to DNA degradation was proved using gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the pronounced generation of ROS by mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26) stimulated by both copper(ii) complexes was confirmed. A fluorescence method allowed the total amounts of ROS generated inside the CT26 cells to be detected, while the spin trapping technique proved that free radicals mainly attached to the membrane surface. These last results are in agreement with the data obtained from the ICP-MS method, which demonstrates that 1Cu and 2Cu complexes are not efficiently accumulated inside the cell. Furthermore, the role of ROS in lipid peroxidation was established.

Water temperature, salinity, dissolved , depth, and sediment type influence select fish life-history characteristics and community structure. Marine communities are vulnerable to major changes in environmental conditions, but the response and severity depends on various biological or ecological factors, such as resilience to stress or adaptation. Researchers around the world have predicted and documented numerous alterations in fish communities caused by ongoing significant physicochemical shifts associated with natural and potentially unnatural sources, but published studies describing the historical conditions are lacking for most regions around the world, including the coastal waters off New Jersey. Given the need to understand these processes, a multifaceted investigation was undertaken to describe, evaluate, and compare the oceanic conditions and nearshore marine fauna community off New Jersey during 1988 through 2015. Findings showed the oceanic conditions varied over time and space. Mean surface water temperature increased significantly about 0.6 °C per decade, mean salinity decreased about 1.3 psu per decade, and dissolved  increased 0.09 mg/l per decade. Over 20.4 million fish and invertebrates (1,338.3 mt) representing 214 (water temperature preference classified) species () were collected within 15 strata (areas: 12-26) off the coast of New Jersey from 1988 to 2015. Three marine fauna water temperature preference groups (coldwater-adapted, warmwater-adapted, and subtropic-adapted) were identified in the study area. The main coldwater-adapted species collected were longfin squid () ( = 2, 225, 975), Atlantic herring () ( = 544, 032), and little skate () ( = 316, 356), while Atlantic butterfish () ( = 2, 873, 138), scup () ( = 1, 318, 569), and northern searobin () ( = 503, 230) represented the warmwater-adapted group. Bay anchovy () ( = 9, 227, 960), striped anchovy () ( = 245, 214), and Atlantic moonfish () ( = 38, 691) denoted the subtropic-adapted group. Subtropic-adapted species were the most abundant and coldwater-adapted were the least abundant water temperature preference group. The estimated abundance of coldwater-adapted species declined, warmwater-adapted species slightly increased, and subtropic-adapted species decreased with time, which suggest the environmental conditions are influencing and thereby shifting the marine community.©2019 Levesque.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655958>Nrf2 dysfunction and impaired cellular resilience to oxidative stressors in the aged vasculature: from increased cellular senescence to the pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases.</a></h2><p>Aging is associated with increased oxidative stress in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which contribute to the development of a wide range of diseases affecting the circulatory system in older adults. There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive  species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile inflammation, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and barrier dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653091>Intracellular Redox-Balance Involvement in Temozolomide Resistance-Related Molecular Mechanisms in Glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common astrocytic-derived brain tumor in adults, characterized by a poor prognosis mainly due to the resistance to the available therapy. The study of mitochondria-derived oxidative stress, and of the biological events that orbit around it, might help in the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms at the base of GBM responsiveness to Temozolomide (TMZ). Sensitive and resistant GBM cells were used to test the role of mitochondrial ROS release in TMZ-resistance.

Treatments with HO were used to test their potential in reverting resistance. Fluctuations of cytoplasmic ROS levels were accountable for CMA induction and cytotoxic effects observed in TMZ sensitive cells after treatment. On the other hand, in resistant cells, TMZ failed in producing an increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels and CMA activation, preventing GBM cell toxicity. By increasing oxidative stress, CMA activation was recovered, as also cell cytotoxicity, especially in combination with TMZ treatment.

This experimental study developed a comprehensive kinetic model of cellulose degradation via non-oxidative hydrothermal processing at various temperatures (ranges 180-260 °C). Values of activation energies and pre-exponential factors were determined using chemical  demand (COD)-based lumped concentrations. In this study, a new reaction pathway between solid, soluble matter and gaseous products was proposed which not only enables prediction of solid phase degradation but also can predict the formation of various types of products (in liquid and gas phase) during the reaction time. The results show that the reaction rate of cellulose to liquid products (k=2.7×10exp(-102810RT)) were fast compared to that of for liquid products to gaseous products (k=4.4×10exp(-64629RT)). Moreover, the model infers that the major part of solid degradation leads to the formation of the gaseous product with the reaction rate constant of k=5.7exp(-12905RT). The proposed model can provide an opportunity to predict the performance of the non-oxidative hydrothermal processing of organic solid waste.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent developments in literature have suggested that the ratio of iron and nickel in Fe-Ni thin films plays an essential role in the performance and stability of the catalysts. In this work, the metallic ratio of iron to nickel was tested in alloy bimetallic nanoparticles. Similar to thin films, nanoparticles with iron-nickel atomic compositions where the atomic iron percentage is ≤50% outperformed nanoparticles with iron-nickel ratios of >50%. Nanoparticles of FeNi, FeNi, and FeNi compositions were evaluated and demonstrated to have overpotentials of 313, 327,, and 364 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm. While the FeNi composition might be considered to have the best OER performance at low current densities, FeNi was found to have the best current density performance at higher current densities, making this composition particularly relevant for electrolysis conditions. However, when stability was evaluated through chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry, the FeNi composition resulted in the lowest degradation rates of 2.9 μA/h and 17.2 μV/h, respectively. These results suggest that nanoparticles with higher iron and lower nickel content, such as the FeNi composition, should be still taken into consideration while optimizing these bimetallic OER catalysts for overall electrocatalytic performance.

Although numerous studies have examined the biological action of olive and olive oil extracts, the literature lacks studies investigating the putative antioxidant capacity of olive tree flower extracts. Given that olive tree flowers are actually by-products of the olive oil production process with high waste burden for the environment, it becomes evident that their exploitation could increase their added value. Therefore, in this study the potential antioxidant action of four olive flower extracts was investigated. All the extracts exerted potent antioxidant activity as indicated using the DPPH• and ABTS•+ assays, as well as antigenotoxic and antimutagenic properties, identified by the results of the plasmid relaxation assay and the Ames test, respectively. Furthermore, the extracts also improved redox status of four cell lines (i.e., EA.hy926, C2C12, HeLa, and HepG2) enhancing reduced glutathione and reducing reactive  species levels using flow cytometry. Taking into account that during olive tree cultivation a considerable amount of olive flowers is generated, the waste burden is high and the management is difficult.

The complex was remarkably active against the cell lines and can be a good candidate for an anticancer drug. Theoretical docking studies were performed to further investigate the DNA and BSA binding interactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In advanced age, cerebromicrovascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction impair neurovascular coupling, contributing to age-related cognitive decline. Recently we developed a resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene)-containing fusogenic liposome (FL-RSV)-based molecular delivery system that can effectively target cultured cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells, attenuating age-related oxidative stress. To assess the cerebromicrovascular protective effects of FL-RSV in vivo, aged (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were treated with FL-RSV for four days. To demonstrate effective cellular uptake of FL-RSV, accumulation of the lipophilic tracer dyes in cells of the neurovascular unit was confirmed using two-photon imaging (through a chronic cranial window). NVC was assessed by measuring CBF responses (laser speckle contrast imaging) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that NVC responses were significantly impaired in aged mice. Treatment with FL-RSV significantly improved NVC responses by increasing NO-mediated vasodilation. These findings are paralleled by the protective effects of FL-RSV on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aorta. Thus, treatment with FL-RSV rescues endothelial function and NVC responses in aged mice. We propose that resveratrol containing fusogenic liposomes could also be used for combined delivery of various anti-geronic factors, including proteins, small molecules, DNA vectors and mRNAs targeting key pathways involved in microvascular aging and neurovascular dysfunction for the prevention/treatment of age-related cerebromicrovascular pathologies and development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657553>Iron oxide nanoparticle-induced neoplastic-like cell transformation in vitro is reduced with protective amorphous silica coating.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) have recently surged in production and use in a wide variety of biomedical and environmental applications. However, their potential long term health effects, including carcinogenesis, are unknown. Limited research suggests IONP can induce genotoxicity and neoplastic transformation associated with particle dissolution and release of free iron ions. "Safe by design" strategies involve the modification of particle physicochemical properties to affect subsequent adverse outcomes, such as an amorphous silica coating to reduce IONP dissolution and direct interaction with cells. We hypothesized that long-term exposure to a specific IONP (nFe2O3) would induce neoplastic-like cell transformation related to changes in intracellular iron, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, which could be prevented with an amorphous silica coating (SiO2-nFe2O3). To test this hypothesis, human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B) were continuously exposed to 0.6 µg/cm2 administered dose of nFe2O3 (~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose), SiO2-nFe2O3 (~0.55 µg/cm2 delivered dose), or gas metal arc mild steel welding fumes (GMA-MS, ~0.58 µg/cm2 delivered dose) for 6.5 months. GMA-MS are composed of roughly 80% iron/iron oxide and were recently classified as a total human carcinogen. Our results showed that such low-dose/long-term in vitro exposure to nFe2O3 induced a time dependent neoplastic-like cell transformation, as indicated by increased cell proliferation and attachment independent colony formation, which closely matched that induced by GMA-MS. This transformation was associated with decreases in intracellular iron and reactive  species (ROS) production, and the induction of double stranded DNA damage. An amorphous silica-coated but otherwise identical particle (SiO2-nFe2O3) did not induce this neoplastic-like phenotype. Overall, the presented data suggests the carcinogenic potential with long term nFe2O3 exposure and the utility of an amorphous silica coating in "safe by design" hazard reduction strategy, using a physiologically relevant exposure scenario (low-dose/long-term) with model validation using GMA-MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659585>The Association of Cigarette Smoke Exposure with Lung Cellular Toxicity and Oxidative Stress: the Protective Role of Crocin.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoke (CS) contains many free radicals and toxic chemicals. Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2.5 and 5% cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive  species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive  species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660674>In vivo imaging of hemodynamic redistribution and arteriogenesis across microvascular network.</a></h2><p>Arteriogenesis is an important mechanism that contributes to restoration of  supply in chronically ischemic tissues, but remains incompletely understood due to technical limitations. This study presents a novel approach for comprehensive assessment of the remodeling pattern in a complex microvascular network containing multiple collateral microvessels.We have developed a hardware-software integrated platform for quantitative, longitudinal, and label-free imaging of network-wide hemodynamic changes and arteriogenesis at the single-vessel level. By ligating feeding arteries in the mouse ear, we induced network-wide hemodynamic redistribution and localized arteriogenesis. The utility of this technology's was demonstrated by studying the influence of obesity on microvascular arteriogenesis.Simultaneously monitoring the remodeling of competing collateral arterioles revealed a new, inverse relationship between initial vascular resistance and extent of arteriogenesis. Obese mice exhibited similar remodeling responses to lean mice through the first week, including diameter increase and flow upregulation in collateral arterioles. However, these gains were subsequently lost in obese mice.Capable of label-free, comprehensive, and dynamic quantification of structural and functional changes in the microvascular network in vivo, this platform opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms of microvascular arteriogenesis, its implications in diseases, and approaches to pharmacologically rectify microvascular dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656311>Prescription of exercise training for hypertensives.</a></h2><p>In Japan, there were an estimated 43 million patients with hypertension in 2010. The management of this condition is given the highest priority in disease control, and the importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of hypertension has been recognized in Japan. In particular, emphasis has been placed on increasing the levels of activities of daily living and physical exercise (sports). In this literature review, we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, duration per session, and frequency) for the prevention and treatment of hypertension as described in Japanese and foreign articles. This review recommends safe and effective whole-body aerobic exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum  intake, 30-60 min per session, 3-4 times a week) that primarily focuses on the major muscle groups for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Resistance exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but resistance exercise is contraindicated in patients with hypertension who have chest symptoms such as chest pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654499>Influence of cataract light scatters on retinal vessel  saturation.</a></h2><p>The aim of our study was to compare metabolic ( saturation; %) and anatomical parameters (retinal vessel diameter; μm) of retinal vessel oximetry (RO) in patients with cataract formation against those of healthy controls with clear lenses.A total of 96 eyes of 62 subjects were examined: 51 eyes from 33 cataract patients (mean age: 64.8y) were compared to 45 eyes from 29 controls with clear lenses (mean age: 61.5y). RO was performed with the  saturation measurement tool from the RVA (IMEDOS Systems UG). The  saturation in all major peripapillary retinal arterioles (A-SO ) and venules (V-SO ) was measured, and their difference (A-V SO ) was calculated. In addition, the corresponding diameter in retinal arterioles (D-A) and venules (D-V) was evaluated. Cataract formation was graded according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III). Oximetry data were compared with the grade of cataract formation within both groups. For statistical evaluation, anova-based linear mixed-effects models were calculated (spss , pairwise comparisons: Bonferroni-corrected; p < 0.05).Cataract eyes showed significantly lower A-SO and A-V SO values (mean ± SD 92.52 ± 9.80% and 28.56 ± 9.80%), when compared to healthy controls (95.47 ± 4.48% and 34.8 ± 7.08%; p = 0.046 and p = 0.001). Within the cataract group, cortical opacities showed significant interactions with the A-SO , V-SO and the A-V SO parameters (p = 0.027; p = 0.002; and p = 0.026, respectively).These data indicate that the cataract-induced light scatter influences optical retinal  measurements. Cortical opacities showed the highest influence on RO measurement when compared to nuclear opacification, nuclear colour and posterior cataract formation.© 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Unexpected drought stress has a substantial effect on the growth and productivity of valuable crops. The effects of carbon materials on living organisms in response to abiotic stresses remain poorly understood. In this study, we proposed a new method for enhancing drought tolerance in cucumber ( L.) using carbon nanotubes and natural carbon materials called shungite, which can be easily mixed into any soil. We analyzed the phenotype and physiological changes in cucumber plants grown under conditions of drought stress. Shungite-treated cucumber plants were healthier, with dark green leaves, than control plants when watering was withheld for 21 days. Furthermore, compared with the control cucumber group, in the shungite-treated plants, the monodehydroascorbate content of the leaf, which is a representative marker of oxidative damage, was 66% lower. In addition, major scavenger units of reactive  species and related drought stress marker genes were significantly upregulated. These results indicate that successive pretreatment of soil with low-cost natural carbon material improved the tolerance of cucumber plants to drought stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655022>FOXO1 inhibition prevents renal ischemia-reperfusion injury via promotion of CREB/PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>Background And Purpose Growing evidence indicates targeting mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis could accelerate recovery from renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and plays a pathologic role in the progression of renal disease. Experimental Approach A mouse model of renal I/R injury and a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model for human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK2s) were used. Key Results I/R injury up-regulated renal expression of FOXO1, and treatment with FOXO1-selective inhibitor AS1842856 prior to I/R injury decreased serum urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and the tubular damage score after injury. Post-I/R injury AS1842856 treatment could also ameliorate renal function and improve the survival rate of mice following injury. AS1842856 administration reduced mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, suppressed the overproduction of mitochondrial reactive  species (mtROS) and accelerated recovery of ATP both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, FOXO1 inhibition improved mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed mitophagy. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was down-regulated in both I/R and H/R injury, which could be abrogated by FOXO1 inhibition. Experiments using integrated bioinformatics analysis and coimmunoprecipitation established that FOXO1 inhibited PGC-1α transcription by competing with CREB for its binding to transcriptional coactivators CREBBP/EP300 (CBP/P300). Conclusion And Implications These findings suggested that FOXO1 was critical to maintain mitochondrial function in renal tubular epithelial cells and FOXO1 may serve as a therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention in renal.This article is protected by copyright.

Geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies were determined for all stationary points at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The focal point method along with several additive corrections was used to obtain reliable CCSDT(Q)/CBS potential energy surface features. Extensive conformational analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate computations were performed to ensure accurate chemical connectivity of the stationary points. Five minima were determined to be possible products of this reaction and three novel transition states were found that were previously unreported or mislabeled in the literature.

Cu and In2O3 catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic acid hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic acid through C-O bond breaking, while the H2 adsorption and dissociation ability of In2O3 is weak. In this work, Cu4/In2O3 is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic acid and H2. The detailed mechanism of acetic acid hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu4/In2O3 is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H2 adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to In2O3 is favorable on the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and In2O3 surface: H2 adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic acid activated by the In2O3  vacancy. Finally, compared with a Cu2In(100) surface, the Cu4/In2O3(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced energy barriers of acetic acid dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CH3COO*, CH3CHO*, and CH3CH2O*). The Cu4/In2O3 catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660715>Development of a handheld submersible chemiluminescent sensor: Quantification of superoxide at coral surfaces.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) are produced via various photochemical, abiotic and biological pathways. The low concentration and short lifetime of the ROS superoxide (O2-) make it challenging to measure in natural systems. Here we designed, developed, and validated a DIver-operated Submersible Chemiluminescent sensOr (DISCO), the first handheld submersible chemiluminescent sensor. The fluidic system inside DISCO is controlled by two high-precision pumps that introduce sample water and analytical reagents into a mixing cell. The resultant chemiluminescent signal is quantified by a photomultiplier tube, recorded by a miniature onboard computer and monitored in real-time via a hand-held underwater LED-interface. Components are contained within a pressure-bearing housing (max depth 30 m) and an external battery-pack supplies power. Laboratory calibrations with filtered seawater verified instrument stability and precision. Field deployment in Cuban coral reefs quantified background seawater-normalized extracellular superoxide concentrations near coral surfaces (0 - 173 nM) that varied distinctly with coral species. Observations were consistent with previous similar measurements from aquaria and shallow reefs using a standard benchtop system. In situ quantification of superoxide associated with corals was enabled by DISCO, demonstrating the potential application to other shallow water ecosystems and chemical species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655619>Protective mechanism of artemisinin on rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide via activation of c-Raf-Erk1/2-p90-CREB pathway.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation is one of the new therapeutic strategies for treating ischemic brain and heart tissues. However, the poor survival rate of transplanted BMSCs in ischemic tissue, due to high levels of reactive  species (ROS), limits the therapeutic efficacy of this approach. Considering that BMSC survival may greatly enhance the effectiveness of transplantation therapy, development of effective therapeutics capable of mitigating oxidative stress-induced BMSC apoptosis is an important unmet clinical need.BMSCs were isolated from the 4-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats by whole bone marrow adherent culturing, and the characteristics were verified by morphology, immunophenotype, adipogenic, and osteogenic differentiation potential. BMSCs were pretreated with artemisinin, and HO was used to induce apoptosis. Cell viability was detected by MTT, FACS, LDH, and Hoechst 33342 staining assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured by JC-1 assay. The apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V-FITC/PI and Caspase 3 Activity Assay kits. ROS level was evaluated by using CellROX® Deep Red Reagent. SOD, CAT, and GPx enzymatic activities were assessed separately using Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD Assay Kit with WST-8, Catalase Assay Kit, and Total Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit. The effects of artemisinin on protein expression of BMSCs including p-Erk1/2, t-Erk1/2, p-c-Raf, p-p90, p-CREB, BCL-2, Bax, p-Akt, t-Akt, β-actin, and GAPDH were measured by western blotting.We characterized for the first time the protective effect of artemisinin, an anti-malaria drug, using oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in vitro, in rat BMSC cultures. We found that artemisinin, at clinically relevant concentrations, improved BMSC survival by reduction of ROS production, increase of antioxidant enzyme activities including SOD, CAT, and GPx, in correlation with decreased Caspase 3 activation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and apoptosis, all induced by HO. Artemisinin significantly increased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. PD98059, the specific inhibitor of the Erk1/2 pathway, blocked Erk1/2 phosphorylation and artemisinin protection. Similarly, decreased expression of Erk1/2 by siRNA attenuated the protective effect of artemisinin. Additionally, when the upstream activator KRAS was knocked down by siRNA, the protective effect of artemisinin was also blocked. These data strongly indicated the involvement of the Erk1/2 pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, artemisinin increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 upstream kinases proto-oncogene c-RAF serine/threonine-protein kinase (c-Raf) and of Erk1/2 downstream targets p90 ribosomal s6 kinase (p90) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). In addition, we found that the expression of anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 protein (BcL-2) was also upregulated by artemisinin.These studies demonstrate the proof of concept of artemisinin therapeutic potential to improve survival in vitro of BMSCs exposed to ROS-induced apoptosis and suggest that artemisinin-mediated protection occurs via the activation of c-Raf-Erk1/2-p90-CREB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653042>Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals the Roles of Detoxification Systems in Response to Mercury in .</a></h2><p>Heavy metal pollution is an increasing global concern. Among heavy metals, mercury (Hg) is especially dangerous because of its massive release into the environment and high toxicity, especially for aquatic organisms. The molecular response mechanisms of algae to Hg exposure are mostly unknown. Here, we combine physiological, biochemical, and transcriptomic analysis to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive view on the pathways activated in  in response to toxic levels of Hg. Production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, two reactive  species (ROS), showed opposite patterns in response to Hg while reactive nitrogen species (RNS) levels did not change. A deep RNA sequencing analysis generated a total of 307,738,790 high-quality reads assembled in 122,874 transcripts, representing 89,853 unigenes successfully annotated in databases. Detailed analysis of the differently expressed genes corroborates the biochemical results observed in ROS production and suggests novel putative molecular mechanisms in the algal response to Hg. Moreover, we indicated that important transcription factor (TF) families associated with stress responses differentially expressed in  cultures under Hg stress.

(Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides metabolism have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

The results of our within-subject experimental design revealed that the physiological results varied significantly depending on the type of backpack. Backpacks B and C were superior to Backpack A, resulting in lower physiological responses and higher subjective preferences. Students carrying more weight experienced higher physiological stress; moreover, the use of Backpack C led to the lowest physiological strains and higher subjective preferences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655431>Synthesis and biological evaluation of panaxatriol derivatives against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat.</a></h2><p>Panaxatriol (PT) is a natural product derived from ginseng that possesses cardioprotective effects in isolated rat hearts.

However, the effects of exchange SA on metabolic scaling may be eclipsed because  transfer across the respiratory surface is determined not only by the exchange SA but also by ventilation. We hypothesize that the scaling of both gill surface area (GSA) and ventilation frequency (VF) positively affects the scaling of metabolic rate. In six closely related species of carp maintained under the same experimental conditions, the scaling exponents of RMR and GSA were analyzed. In the goldfish, RMR scaled with body mass by an exponent significantly lower than that of GSA but not different from the exponents of GSA in the remaining five species. The scaling exponent of RMR was positively related to those of both GSA and VF among the species. In addition, the VF-corrected metabolic scaling exponent was positively related to the scaling exponent of GSA among the species. These results suggest that variations in GSA scaling and in VF scaling among species mutually affect metabolic scaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659814>GPETAFLR, a biopeptide from Lupinus angustifolius L., protects against oxidative and inflammatory damage in retinal pigment epithelium cells.</a></h2><p>GPETAFLR, an octapeptide released from the enzymatic hydrolysis of lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.) protein, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effect in myeloid lineage. This work aims to evaluate in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells the protective role of GPETAFLR on both oxidative and inflammatory markers known to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In comparison with stimulated control cells, GPETAFLR increased glutathione production and diminished the secretion and gene expression of VEFG, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF-α, as well as reactive  species, and nitrite output. Our findings reveal that GPETAFLR, a novel plant peptide, is able to protect against RPE oxidative stress and inflammation. Taken together, these results strongly support innovative nutritional strategies considering Lupinus angustifolius L. as source of proteins to prevent the onset and progression of AMD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We reveal a novel nutraceutical impact of GPETAFLR peptide in human RPE cells to prevent oxidative and inflammatory mediators. Our results support that the intake of Lupine angustifolius L., proposed to be a reservoir of GPETAFLR, could lessen the functional decay of RPE cells, leading therefore to a slowdown of the progress of AMD during age. Not only this work, but also future simple clinical studies should raise new nutritional strategies focused on understanding the etiological role of the foods, nutrition, and metabolism in the pathogenesis of ocular disorders.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661353>Identification of novel Nrf2/Keap1 pathway mutations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h2><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of lymphoid progenitor cells, characterized by a wide range of biological and clinical heterogeneity. Oxidative stress is a common problem observed in carcinogenesis and it is involved in developing treatment resistance. Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-Like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor is the main regulator of antioxidant responses. The levels of reactive  species (ROS) are tightly controlled and regulated by Nrf2 and its suppressor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Recently, many studies have shown that most of the genes in the Nrf2/Keap1/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/phosphotyrosine-independent ligand for the Lck SH2 domain Of 62 KDa (p62) pathway show abnormally high mutational variations in cancer. However, variations in the Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway in pediatric ALL have not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Thirty children, who were diagnosed with pediatirc ALL were included in the study. The Nrf2/Keap1/NF-κB1/p62 pathway variants were analyzed by DNA sequencing analysis. The PolyPhen-2 program was used for identifying pathogenic mutations. Our study examined the molecular dynamics (MD) perspectives of the effect of A159T and E121K mutations on protein stability for the first time in the literature by using the GROMACS45 software package utilizing the OPSLAA force field. Of the detected 17 nucleotide changes, 6 were novel. The study predicted the potential pathological effect of two mutations p. A159T and p.E121K in the Keap1 gene. The MD perspectives revealed that the E121K mutant's observed structural behavior accounted for the key role of His-129 and E121K, where E121K exhibited much higher drift compared to His-129. For a future perspective, it would be meaningful to study the protein-small molecule interactions of the Keap1 protein to elaborate on the drug effects in patients carrying these mutations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656272>Long Non-Coding RNA MEG3 Promotes Apoptosis of Vascular Cells and is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Ischemic Stroke.</a></h2><p>This study focused on the expression pattern of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and its value in ischemic stroke (IS).The expression pattern and the roles of MEG3 in the development of IS were explored in mice IS model and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). A case-control study, including 215 IS patients and 153 controls, was also conducted to investigate its prognostic value.In vivo study showed that MEG3 increased significantly in the IS group (P=0.004), and its level remained stable within 3 to 48h after the onset of IS. Besides, the survival time of the mouse in the high MEG3 group was significantly lower than that in the low MEG3 group (P=0.042). In vitro study showed that -glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment significantly up-regulated expressions of MEG3, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3, and further promoted apoptosis of hBMECs, while si-MEG3 blocked these effects. A human study showed that MEG3 increased markedly within 48h of IS onset and was positively associated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (r=0.347, P＜0.001), modified Rankin Scale (r=0.385, P＜0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r=0.221, P=0.002) level, and infarct volume (r=0.201, P=0.006). Overall survival analysis showed that patients with higher MEG3 expression within 48h had a relatively poor prognosis (P＜0.001). Meanwhile, multivariate analysis revealed that MEG3 was an independent prognostic marker for unfavorable functional outcome and death in IS patients.This study suggested that MEG3 might be considered as an intervention point and potential prognostic indicator for IS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658511>Perivascular Stem Cells Suppress Inflammasome Activation during Inflammatory Responses in Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Perivascular stem cells (PVCs) have been identified as precursors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that offer promising prospects for application in the development of cellular therapies. Although PVCs have been demonstrated to have greater therapeutic potential compared to bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived MSCs in various diseases, the regulatory role of PVCs on inflammasome activation during macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses has not been investigated.In this study, we found that the PVC secretome effectively alleviates secretion of both caspase-1 and interleukin-1β in lipopolysaccharide-primed and activated human and murine macrophages by blocking inflammasome activation and attenuating the production of mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS). We further showed that the PVC secretome significantly reduces inflammatory responses and endoplasmic reticulum stress in peritoneal macrophages in a mouse model of monosodium urate-induced peritonitis. A cytokine antibody array analysis revealed that the PVC secretome contains high levels of serpin E1 and angiogenin, which may be responsible for the inhibitory effects on mitochondrial ROS generation as well as on inflammasome activation.Our results suggest that PVCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of macrophage- and inflammation-mediated diseases by paracrine action via the secretion of various biological factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654868>Effect of 24-epibrassinolide on reactive  species and antioxidative defense systems in tall fescue plants under lead stress.</a></h2><p>Lead is one of the most hazardous pollutants to both the environment as well as human beings. As one of the approaches to enhance phytoremediation, brassinosteroids are predicted as a potential candidate phytohormone for assisted phytoremediation. Few studies have focused on the physiological regulations of tall fescue plants (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), a potential phytoremediation species, for its responses to applications of brassinosteroids under lead stress. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of foliar application of 24-epibrassinolide, a brassinosteroids analogue, on reactive  species accumulation and antioxidative defense systems of tall fescue when exposed to lead, and ultimately its potential to be used in phytoremediation. When exposed to lead (1000 mg/kg) for 80 d, decreases in shoot and root biomass of tall fescue biomass as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid productions were found. Foliar application of 24-epibrassinolide at three rates and five applications every 7 d improved the biomass of both shoots and roots, and increased the photosynthetic pigments. The improved lead tolerance in tall fescue plants after 24-epibrassinolide applications was associated with reduced HO and O accumulations and increased antioxidative enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and guaiacol peroxidase. Additionally, osmoprotectants increased and lipid peroxidation decreased. Ultimately, foliar applications of 24-epibrassinolide enhanced the lead recovery rate of tall fescue plants, proving its potential role in phytoremediation for soil contaminated with heavy metals such as lead.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We reasoned that these 'non-greedy' decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here using reinforcement learning models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stem from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by blood  level-dependent responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and by phasic pupillary dilation, suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Together, these findings indicate that most behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659418>Cinnamaldehyde inhibits Candida albicans growth by causing apoptosis and its treatment on vulvovaginal candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis.</a></h2><p>The invasion of Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections seen in clinical practice, and serious drug resistance has been reported in recent years. Therefore, new anti-C. albicans drugs must be introduced. In this research, it was demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde (CA) shows strong antimicrobial activity, with 0.26 mg/mL CA being the minimum inhibitory concentration to manage C. albicans. Extraordinarily, we detected that CA accumulated the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and enhanced the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and mitochondria through flow cytometry. In addition, we observed that C. albicans cells released Cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated the metacaspase when exposed to 0.065, 0.13, 0.26, and 0.52 mg/mL CA. Furthermore, to confirm that CA introduces the C. albicans apoptosis, we discovered that when the phosphatidylserine was exposed, DNA damage and chromatin condensation occurred, which were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Finally, demonstrations of phenotype investigation, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were conducted to prove that CA possessed the ability to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). From the above, our research indicates that CA is a promising antifungal candidate when applied to C. albicans infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657384>What governs the nature of fouling in forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO)? A molecular dynamics study.</a></h2><p>Membrane fouling is a performance hampering phenomenon, which impacts forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO) differently. Experiments have found that the fouling layer structure for FO and RO is very different, but the reasons are not yet very clear, and hence a mechanistic understanding of the fouling in FO and RO is indispensable. Here we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the nature of fouling in FO and RO. Lysozyme and layered graphene oxide (GO) were used as typical representatives of the model foulant and desalination membrane, respectively. It was found that protein-solvent and protein-ion interactions are at the core of the structural differences between RO and FO. In particular, we suggest hydration repulsion and charge screening as probable mechanisms, which lead to different fouling layer structures in FO and RO. Also, a probable mechanism of lysozyme adsorption on the GO surface is proposed, which is based on the transport of protein towards the surface due to hydraulic pressure and Coulombic interactions induced between basic residues of lysozyme (arginine, lysine) facing the surface and -rich functional groups present on the GO surface. Both hydraulic pressure and Coulombic interactions acted synergistically, which led to lysozyme adsorption on the GO surface. Furthermore, the effect of initial protein orientation on protein-membrane interaction was also explored and was found to be an important factor in determining the nature of interaction and the time scale within which an adsorption event could be observed. This study facilitates the current understanding of the fouling in FO and RO and provides a probable molecular mechanism of how fundamental forces such as hydration repulsion and electrostatic interaction make fouling structurally different in FO and RO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659168>Targeted knock-in mice expressing the oxidase-fixed form of xanthine oxidoreductase favor tumor growth.</a></h2><p>Xanthine oxidoreductase has been implicated in cancer. Nonetheless, the role played by its two convertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and oxidase (XO) during tumorigenesis is not understood. Here we produce XDH-stable and XO-locked knock-in (ki) mice to address this question. After tumor transfer, XO ki mice show strongly increased tumor growth compared to wild type (WT) and XDH ki mice. Hematopoietic XO expression is responsible for this effect. After macrophage depletion, tumor growth is reduced. Adoptive transfer of XO-ki macrophages in WT mice increases tumor growth. In vitro, XO ki macrophages produce higher levels of reactive  species (ROS) responsible for the increased Tregs observed in the tumors. Blocking ROS in vivo slows down tumor growth. Collectively, these results indicate that the balance of XO/XDH plays an important role in immune surveillance of tumor development. Strategies that inhibit the XO form specifically may be valuable in controlling cancer growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652773>Modern Extraction and Purification Techniques for Obtaining High Purity Food-Grade Bioactive Compounds and Value-Added Co-Products from Citrus Wastes.</a></h2><p>Citrus contains a range of highly beneficial bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamins that show antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and help in building the body's immune system. On consumption or processing, approximately 50% of the fruit remains as inedible waste, which includes peels, seeds, pulp, and segment residues. This waste still consists of substantial quantities of bioactive compounds that cause environmental pollution and are harmful to the ecosystem because of their high biological  demand. In recent years, citrus cultivation and the production of processed foods have become a major agricultural industry. In addition to being a substantial source of economy, it is an ideal and sustainable and renewable resource for obtaining bioactive compounds and co-products for food and pharmaceutical industries. In the present article, the various methods of extraction, conventional and modern, as well as separation and isolation of individual bioactive compounds from the extraction mixture and their determination have been reviewed.

Most perioperative deaths are represented by patients who present insufficient physiological reserve to meet the demands of major surgery. Recognition and management of critical high-risk surgical patients require dedicated and effective teams, capable of preventing, recognize, start treatment with adequate support in time to refer patients to the satisfactory ICU level provision. The main task for health-care planners and managers is to identify and reduce this severe risk and to encourage patient's safety practices. Inadequate tissue perfusion and decreased cellular oxygenation due to hypovolemia, heart dysfunction, reduced cardiovascular reserve, and concomitant diseases are the most common causes of perioperative complications. Hemodynamic, respiratory and careful sequential monitoring have become essential aspects of the clinical practice both for surgeons and intensivists. New monitoring techniques have changed significantly over the past few years and are now able to rapidly identify shock states earlier, define the etiology, and monitor the response to different therapies. Many of these techniques are now minimally invasive or non-invasive. Advanced hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring combines invasive, non-invasive monitoring skills. Non-invasive ultrasound has emerged during the last years as an essential operative and perioperative evaluation tool, and its use is now rapidly growing. Perioperative management guided by appropriate sequential clinical evaluation combined with respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring is an established tool to help clinicians to identify those patients at higher risk in the attempt to reduce the complications rate and potentially improve patient outcomes. This review aims to provide an update of currently available standard concepts and evolving technologies of the various respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring systems for the high-risk surgical patients, highlighting their potential usefulness when integrated with careful clinical evaluation.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660070>Self-generating  enhanced mitochondrion-targeted photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment with hypoxia scavenging.</a></h2><p>Tumor hypoxia is an important reason for the limited therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) because of the  requirement of the therapeutic process. PDT consumes tissue  and destroys tumor vasculature, further hampering its own efficacy in promoting tumor deterioration. Therefore, overcoming the photodynamic exacerbation of tumor hypoxia is urgent.  Herein, we report a photodynamic nanoparticle with sustainable hypoxia remission skills by both intratumoral HO catalysis and targeted mitochondrial destruction. The MnO@MSNs@IR780 nanoparticles are formed by absorbing a photosensitizer (IR780) into 90 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and capping the surface pores with 5 nm MnO nanoparticles.  These MnO nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and respond to the HO-enriched tumor microenvironment by decomposing and catalyzing HO into O. Afterwards, IR780 is released and activated, spontaneously targeting the mitochondria due to its natural mitochondrial affinity. Under laser irradiation, this self-generated -enhanced PDT can destroy mitochondria and inhibit cell respiration, resulting in sustainable hypoxia remission in tumor tissues and consequently enhancing the therapeutic outcome.  experiments suggest that MnO@MSNs@IR780 exhibited highly mitochondrion-targeted properties and could sustainably inhibit tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the highest photoacoustic signal of HbO with the lowest Hb was observed in tumors from mice after PDT, indicating that these nanoparticles can also prevent tumor hypoxia .  Taken together, our study indicated a new approach for overcoming the sustainable hypoxia limitation in traditional PDT by targeted  supplementation and mitochondria destruction.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656111>Nasal High Flow for Stable Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of nasal high flow (NHF) to treat acute respiratory failure, particularly in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. Conversely, there are sparse data evaluating its effects in stable COPD patients. We identified randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of delivering air or   NHF, compared with delivering the same gas without NHF, in stable COPD patients through a systematic search using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Science Direct, and others sources until January 2019. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool) was performed by two independent authors. We included 6 studies (339 participants). Our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO) at long (two studies, MD -3 mmHg, [95% Confidence interval (CI) -4 to -2]) and short-term (two studies, MD -3 mmHg [95% CI -4 to -2]). NHF significantly improved quality of life on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (two studies, MD -5 out of 100, [95% CI -8 to -2]). NHF significantly reduced the rate of acute exacerbation at 1 year (one study, rate ratio: 0.6, [95% CI 0.6 to 0.7]). NHF did not significantly improve exercise capacity, hospitalization rate or mortality, but improved breathing pattern. NHF reduced PaCO, acute exacerbation and improved quality of life in stable COPD patients.

Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry weight and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino acids were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino acid in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive  species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression.

Photosynthetic organisms developed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a process that dissipates excess absorbed light energy as heat and limits the production of reactive  species and cellular damage. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the LHCSR pigment-binding proteins are essential for NPQ. These complexes are not constitutively present in the thylakoid membranes; however, in laboratory conditions their expression depends on prior high-light exposure of cells. To investigate the role of NPQ in physiologically relevant conditions, we measured cells grown under a day-night cycle. LHCSRs are present and NPQ is active consistently throughout the day, likely due to their slow degradation in vivo. This suggests that in physiologically relevant conditions Chlamydomonas cells are prepared to immediately activate photoprotection, as is the case in vascular plants. We further reveal that state transitions are fully functional under these conditions and that PsbS is highly expressed throughout the day, suggesting it might have a more impactful role than previously thought.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

At high concentrations, it is toxic to neurons, and such damage is positively correlated with acute and chronic neurological diseases. Our previous studies showed that inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) attenuated the production of TNF-α induced by lipopolysaccharides in microglial cells. However, whether PDE4 inhibition can block the neurotoxic effects of TNF-α in neuronal cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of FCPR16, a novel PDE4 inhibitor, against TNF-α-induced cellular apoptosis in HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells. We demonstrated that FCPR16 dose-dependently increased the viability of HT-22 cells exposed to TNF-α insult. Propidium iodide/calcein staining and flow cytometry analysis showed that FCPR16 decreased cell apoptosis triggered by TNF-α. Western blot analysis showed that FCPR16 decreased the level of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 8, but had no effect on caspase 9. Mechanistically, FCPR16 blocked the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in HT-22 cells, and inhibition of JNK showed a similar protective effect as FCPR16. Furthermore, FCPR16 decreased the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 from the cytosol into the nucleus. In addition, FCPR16 decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of reactive  species in HT-22 cells exposed to TNF-α. Moreover, knockdown of PDE4B by specific small interfering RNA reduced the apoptosis of HT-22 cells treated with TNF-α. Taken together, our findings suggest that FCPR16 promotes the survival of neuronal cells exposed to TNF-α by suppressing the activation of JNK and NF-κB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659213>Central metabolism of functionally heterogeneous mesenchymal stromal cells.</a></h2><p>Metabolism and mitochondrial biology have gained a prominent role as determinants of stem cell fate and function. In the context of regenerative medicine, innovative parameters predictive of therapeutic efficacy could be drawn from the association of metabolic or mitochondrial parameters to different degrees of stemness and differentiation potentials. Herein, this possibility was addressed in human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSC) previously shown to differ in lifespan and telomere length. First, these hMSC were shown to possess significantly distinct proliferation rate, senescence status and differentiation capacity. More potential hMSC were associated to higher mitochondrial (mt) DNA copy number and lower mtDNA methylation. In addition, they showed higher expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation subunits. Consistently, they exhibited higher coupled  consumption rate and lower transcription of glycolysis-related genes, glucose consumption and lactate production. All these data pointed at oxidative phosphorylation-based central metabolism as a feature of higher stemness-associated hMSC phenotypes. Consistently, reduction of mitochondrial activity by complex I and III inhibitors in higher stemness-associated hMSC triggered senescence. Finally, functionally higher stemness-associated hMSC showed metabolic plasticity when challenged by glucose or glutamine shortage, which mimic bioenergetics switches that hMSC must undergo after transplantation or during self-renewal and differentiation. Altogether, these results hint at metabolic and mitochondrial parameters that could be implemented to identify stem cells endowed with superior growth and differentiation potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661571>High energy visible light at ambient doses and intensities induces oxidative stress of skin - Protective effects of the antioxidant and Nrf2 inducer Licochalcone A in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Solar radiation causes skin damage through the generation of reactive  species (ROS). While UV filters effectively reduce UV-induced ROS, they cannot prevent VIS-induced (400 - 760 nm) oxidative stress. Therefore, potent antioxidants are needed as additives to sunscreen products.We investigated VIS-induced ROS formation and the photoprotective effects of the Nrf2-inducer Licochalcone A (LicA).VIS of 400-500 nm dose-dependently induced ROS in cultured human fibroblasts at doses equivalent to 1 hour of sunshine on a sunny summer day (150 J/cm ). A pretreatment for 24 hours with 1 µM LicA reduced ROS formation to the level of unirradiated cells while UV filters alone were ineffective, even at SPF50+.

Here, we show that in addition to the CydA and CydB subunits, the small protein CydX is required for the assembly and function of the cytochrome  complex in the enteric pathogen  serovar Typhimurium. Mutant  Typhimurium lacking CydX showed loss of proper heme arrangement and impaired oxidase activity comparable to that of a  mutant lacking all cytochrome  subunits. Moreover, both the  mutant and the  mutant showed increased sensitivity to β-mercaptoethanol and nitric oxide (NO). Cytochrome -mediated protection from β-mercaptoethanol was not a result of resistance to reducing damage, but rather was due to cytochrome  oxidase managing  respiration while β-mercaptoethanol interacted with copper ions necessary for the HCO activity of the cytochrome type quinol oxidase. Interactions between NO and hemes in cytochrome - and cytochrome -dependent respiration during nitrosative stress indicated a direct role for cytochrome  in mediating  resistance to NO. Additionally, CydX was required for  Typhimurium proliferation inside macrophages. Mutants deficient in cytochrome , however, showed a significant increase in resistance to antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, D-cycloserine, and ampicillin. The essential role of CydX in cytochrome  assembly and function suggests that targeting this small protein could be a useful antimicrobial strategy, but potential drug tolerance responses should also be considered.Cytochrome  quinol oxidases, which are found only in bacteria, govern the fitness of many facultative anaerobic pathogens by promoting respiration in low- environments and by conferring resistance to antimicrobial radicals. Thus, cytochrome  complex assembly and activity are considered to be potential therapeutic targets. Here we report that the small protein CydX is required for the assembly and function of the cytochrome  complex in  Typhimurium under stress conditions, including exposure to β-mercaptoethanol, nitric oxide, or the phagocytic intracellular environment, demonstrating its crucial function for  fitness.

An explanation of this well-known pattern is proposed based on the combination of three key insights: (i) well-studied anoxic environments are high flux environments: they are only anoxic because their high organic matter influx leads to  depletion; (ii) shorter, incomplete catabolic pathways provide the capacity for higher flux, but this capacity is only advantageous in high flux environments; (iii) longer, complete catabolic pathways have energetic happy ends but only with high redox potential electron acceptors. Thus, aerobic environments favour longer pathways. Bioreactors, in contrast, are high flux environments and therefore favour division of catabolic labour even if aeration keeps them aerobic; therefore, host strains and feeding strategies must be carefully engineered to resist this pull.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These detrimental environmental factors enhanced the ROS production such as singlet  (O), superoxide (O ), hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). ROS are highly reactive and directly target several cellular molecules and metabolites, which lead to severe cellular dysfunction. Plants respond to oxidative damages by activating antioxidant machinery to trigger signalling cascades for stress tolerance. HO signalling balances the plant metabolism through cross-talk with other signals and plant hormones during growth, development and stress responses. HO facilitates the regulation of different stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) including NAC, Zinc finger, WRKY, ERF, MYB, DREB and bZIP as both upstream and downstream events during stress signalling.

By increasing the MIL-101-SO3H content, the gas permeability of the membranes significantly decreases, since the crystalline region is larger and the water-bearing MIL-101-SO3H particles are efficient barriers for the gas molecules. The gas permeation in the composite membranes is a very complex process and the results indicate no simple linear relation between the gas permeability and the free volume size (VFV), or between the gas permeability and the crystallinity. Moreover, it is very interesting to observe that the influence of VFV on the gas permeability is closely related to the size of the particular gas molecules: the larger the size of the gas molecules, the larger the free volume needed to achieve their rapid diffusion in the membrane. The results suggest the presence of a threshold value for VFV, which depends on the size of the gas molecules: when VFV is lower than this value, the gas molecules cannot easily jump through neighboring free volumes to a neighboring site, and, as a result, the permeability drops quickly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656096>Leptin Restores Endothelial Function via Endothelial PPARγ-Nox1-Mediated Mechanisms in a Mouse Model of Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy.</a></h2><p>Leptin is the current treatment for metabolic disorders associated with acquired and congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL). Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of obesity, the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive  species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive  species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive. These data reveal a new direct role of leptin receptors in the control of vascular homeostasis and present leptin as a potential therapy for the treatment of vascular disease associated with low leptin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653515>Factors associated with longitudinal changes in serum concentrations of Mac-2 binding protein: A prospective 3-year observational study.</a></h2><p>Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP) plays an important role in cell adhesion. In a recent cross-sectional study we reported that serum M2BP concentrations may reflect silent atherosclerosis. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to investigate possible relationships between changes in concentrations of M2BP and other factors over a >3-year period.The present study enrolled subjects who visited Enshu hospital from 2014 to 2015 for a periodic physical check-up and then attended for another physical check-up after >3 years (n = 174). Factors affecting changes in M2BP concentrations were investigated at both baseline and follow-up. Subjects with liver dysfunction, a history of hepatic disease, malignant neoplasm, or cardiovascular events at baseline were excluded. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in serum M2BP concentrations during the follow-up period were significantly associated with changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, and oxidative stress marker derivatives of reactive  metabolites (d-ROM) concentrations. Moreover, the increase in LDL-C was significantly greater in subjects in whom M2BP concentrations increased during the follow-up period. Logistic regression analysis with an endpoint of increased M2BP revealed that increased LDL-C was an independent determinant of an increase in M2BP during the follow-up period.During the observation period of >3 years, serum M2BP concentrations were increased in subjects who also exhibited increases in levels of metabolic parameters, especially LDL-C, and the oxidative stress marker d-ROM. These results support that serum M2BP reflects one of the contributors to the progression of silent atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Oxidized nucleotides such as 2'-deoxyribo-5-hydroxyuridin (HdU) and 2'-deoxyribo-5-hydroxymethyluridin (HMdU) can be inserted into DNA during replication and repair. HdU and HMdU have attracted particular interest because they have different effects on damaged-DNA processing enzymes that control the downstream effects of the lesions. Herein, we studied the chemically simulated translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) across the lesions formed by HdU or HMdU using microscale thermophoresis (MST). The thermodynamic changes associated with replication across HdU or HMdU show that the HdU paired with the mismatched deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates disturbs DNA duplexes considerably less than thymidine (dT) or HMdU. Moreover, we also demonstrate that TLS by DNA polymerases across the lesion derived from HdU was markedly less extensive and potentially more mutagenic than that across the lesion formed by HMdU. Thus, DNA polymerization by DNA polymerase η (polη), the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF), and reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 RT) across these pyrimidine lesions correlated with the different stabilization effects of the HdU and HMdU in DNA duplexes revealed by MST. The equilibrium thermodynamic data obtained by MST can explain the influence of the thermodynamic alterations on the ability of DNA polymerases to bypass lesions induced by oxidative products of pyrimidines. The results also highlighted the usefulness of MST in evaluating the impact of oxidative products of pyrimidines on the processing of these lesions by damaged DNA processing enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654708>Preventive effects of a natural anti-inflammatory agent Salvianolic acid A on acute kidney injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of kidney function with high mortality. Inflammatory is considered driving the progression of AKI. Salvianolic acid A (SA), one of the major ingredients of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, displays plenty of biological effects. Herein, the effect of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI in mice and further related mechanism in inflammatory cells were explored. In vivo experiments demonstrated that SA significantly ameliorated LPS-challenged AKI by preventing glomerulus atrophy and decreasing plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Meanwhile, SA significantly decreased the release of serum inflammatory cytokines and blocked macrophage infiltration in damaged renal tissue. In in vitro studies, SA significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-6 release levels and altered the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which were consistent with the results from in vivo experiments. Furthermore, SA that bound to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) was able to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reactive  species (ROS) generation in response to LPS stimulation. All silence of TLR4 gene, ROS scavenger and Ca chelator decreased inflammatory cytokines releases. Taken together, SA could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing AKI by suppressing inflammatory responses.Copyright © 2019.

However, real-world studies based on clinical phenotypes to predict the long-term need of tiotropium as an add-on therapy for asthmatics are limited.This is a retrospective study conducted at a single medical center in Taiwan from July 2016 to July 2018. An asthma control test (ACT) is applied to uncontrolled asthmatics to evaluate the effectiveness of tiotropium as an add-on therapy. Asthmatic subgroups with different clinical phenotypes and needing long-term tiotropium as a maintenance treatment are identified. The effectiveness of tiotropium add-on therapy is defined as an improvement of ACT score ≥3 points 3 months after the treatment ( baseline), while the long-term requirement of tiotropium is defined as tiotropium dependency >1 year.The study analyzed a total of 160 uncontrolled asthmatics regardless of low- or medium-to-high-dose ICS plus LABA. One hundred and twelve patients responded well (ACT score increased ≥3 points) to tiotropium. These patients were further divided into two subgroups: one with tiotropium add-on therapy for ≥1 year due to patients' difficulties in stepping down from tiotropium; the other with tiotropium add-on therapy for <1 year due to successful step-down treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) score. All clinical characteristics of these two groups were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that asthma-and-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-overlap (ACO), initial forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) % predicted <80%, or body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m were predictors for asthmatics requiring long-term tiotropium add-on therapy.Tiotropium add-on therapy is effective for uncontrolled asthmatics.

Retinal vessel  saturation and diameters were assessed using a retinal oximeter before and minutes after IVI of ranibizumab or aflibercept.40 eyes with CNV and 34 eyes with DME were included in the analysis. At baseline, SO2a and SO2v were significantly higher in DME (p = 0.043 and p = 0.009, respectively). After IVI, SO2a significantly decreased in CNV and DME eyes by 2.6% (p = 0.016) and 4.6% (p = 0.002) and SO2v decreased by 14.0% (p = 0.004) and 12.4% (p = 0.017), respectively. However, a significant increase in AVD was only found in CNV (15.7%, p = 0.001). VDa decreased significantly only in DME by 5.7% (p = 0.010). No medication-specific disease effect was found and vice versa.The observed changes can be interpreted as signs of increased metabolic demand during the physiological stress after an IVI. The abnormal arterial constriction and the abolished increase in AVD seen only in eyes with DME indicate an impairment of vascular autoregulation and  distribution and a reduced neuroretinal metabolism in the diabetic retina with a significant impact on inner retinal  consumption shortly after IVI.© 2019 The Authors.

However, excessive autophagy can be deleterious to cardiomyocytes. CCN1/Cyr61, a matricellular protein, is expressed in the stressed heart to induce cardiomyopathy. The role of autophagy in CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity was not clear. Here, we found that autophagy was induced in the myocardium of the isoproterenol (ISO; 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days; s.c.) treated mice, where CCN1 expression is colocalized. The knock-in mice carrying an integrin α6β1-binding-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were resistant to the ISO-induced cardiac injury and autophagy. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that CCN1 dose- and time-dependently induced GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosome formation in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. The formation of autolysosomes in response to CCN1 (5 μg/ml; 3 h) treatment was identified by the acridine orange staining. The autophagy induction was confirmed by the elevated protein levels of Beclin 1, Atg5, and LC3-II, and the decrease of p62. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or by silencing Atg5 gene enabled CCN1-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells, suggesting a protective role of autophagy. CCN1 binds to integrin α6β1 to induce autophagy through reactive  species, and the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, mitophagy was observed after CCN1 treatment for the clearance of depolarized mitochondria. Together, these results demonstrated that autophagy is induced in response to CCN1/α6β1 signaling in cardiomyocytes to alleviate CCN1-associated cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661638>Fluorofenidone protects against acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin (CP) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human cancers. However, the beneficial effects of CP are limited by the toxic effects, especially nephrotoxicity. Fluorofenidone (AKFPD) is a promising multifunctional antifibrosis pyridinone drug discovered by our group. But there is no evidence of its protective effects against acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of AKFPD on CP-induced AKI  and . Compared with the model group, treatment with AKFPD effectively ameliorated kidney damages. In order to elucidate the mechanisms, we discovered that AKFPD treatment notably alleviated generation of reactive  species, reduced the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs (ERK1 and 2, JNKs, and p38), suppressed inflammatory response, inhibited apoptosis, and abated the expression of CP transporters (organic cation transporter 2 and copper transport protein 1) compared with the model group. Moreover, because renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI and LPS-induced AKI are the major models representative of renal transplantation-correlated AKI and sepsis-related AKI, which are also the main causes of AKI, we have also proved the effectiveness of AKFPD on these models. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AKFPD is a potent drug for CP-, IRI-, and LPS-caused AKI and elucidate the underlying mechanism.-Jiang, Y., Quan, J., Chen, Y., Liao, X., Dai, Q., Lu, R., Yu, Y., Hu, G., Li, Q., Meng, J., Xie, Y., Peng, Z., Tao, L.

HA is widely used in agriculture but is known to have therapeutic properties, which are still poorly explored. Previous studies have shown the potential of biotechnological processes in the production of HA in submerged fermentation (SF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) using pre-treated fibers of oil palm of empty fruit bunch (EFB) for the cultivation of  strains. EFB is an agro-industrial residue that is readily available at a low cost. The present study aimed to study the production of HA by  in the SSF of raw fibers of EFBs from two different palm oil producers. Profiles of HA production, cellular protein, pH, glucose, moisture, and  transfer were obtained during SSF by EFB with and without lipids, as well as, images by electron microscopy of fibers. Results showed efficient HA production in the raw fibers of the EFBs. HA production followed the cellular protein (6 g HA per 100 g of fibers) evolution of the fermentations in the absence of lipids, while the composition of lipids greatly affected its production. The best HA production (350 mg HA per 100 g of fibers) was obtained from EFB that was richer in lignocellulosics and the residual lipids were similar to the fractions of palm and kernel oils, while EFB with lower lignocellulosic presented a production 110 mg HA per 100 g of fibers.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654899>CeO nanorods supported M-Co bimetallic oxides (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) for catalytic CO and CH oxidation.</a></h2><p>Supported bimetallic catalysts with rational compositions and structural design have attracted great interest, due to the tunable structural orientation (alloy or intermetallic compound and core-shell structure etc.), synergetic effects, and combined properties related to the presence of two individual metals. In this study, 10 wt% Fe-Co, Ni-Co and Cu-Co bimetallic oxides with 1:2 atomic ratio (FeCoO, NiCoO and CuCoO) were deposited onto CeO nanorods (CeONR) via a hydrothermal-assisted precipitation-deposition method. The bimetallic synergism effects, surface structure configuration and the metal (oxide)-support interactions were investigated. The catalysts were characterized by means of powder XRD, TEM, EDX, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, BET surface area, H-TPR, O pulse chemisorption and O-TPD. All the CeONR supported bimetallic catalysts show considerable low-temperature CO oxidation performance. And the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation follows the order: 10 wt% CuCoO/CeONR (T = 95 °C and T = 148 °C) > 10 wt% FeCoO/CeONR (T = 129 °C and T = 193 °C) > 10 wt% NiCoO/CeONR (T = 147 °C and T = 196 °C). As for the catalytic oxidation of CH all the designed catalysts show similar low-temperature performance, but the 10 wt% NiCoO/CeONR catalyst exhibits the maximum CH conversion above 330 °C. In addition, we also demonstrate the important role of  storage capacity (OSC) of CeONR support and the impact of different  species (physi-/chemisorbed , and bulk lattice ) on the oxidation of CO and light hydrocarbons.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Massive and cost-effective production and efficient recovery of carbon-based catalysts are crucial to apply this technology. However, various nanostructured carbons with different dimensions are usually utilized as precursors while not considering their complex preparation procedures and the high costs of ingredients. Moreover, catalyst separation and recovery are not given sufficient attention. In this work, a calcium salt - assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to tune the catalytic site formation of carbon-based catalysts. Results show that blending equal amounts of Ca2+ (calcium chloride) and organic precursors could greatly improve the catalytic activity of the carbonated product to activate peroxymonosulfate for pollutant degradation. In addition, the proposed synthetic strategy is universal to most of the readily accessed and cost-effective organic precursors. Singlet  is identified as the main reactive oxidant for pollutant removal in the catalytic reaction. By crosslinking calcium ion and alginate as a hydrogel to immobilize the catalyst, the carbon material could be readily recovered. Furthermore, a long-term continuous-flow reactor test is conducted to validate the effectiveness of applying the immobilized catalyst to treat a synthetic wastewater with 0.5-mM bisphenol A. As a result, a green synthesis and immobilization strategy for persulfate catalysts is successfully established, and the prepared catalyst might be applied for wastewater treatment through using calcium salt in two purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655629>Polo-like kinase 3 inhibits glucose metabolism in colorectal cancer by targeting HSP90/STAT3/HK2 signaling.</a></h2><p>Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK3) has been documented as a tumor suppressor in several types of malignancies. However, the role of PLK3 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and glucose metabolism remains to be known.The expression of PLK3 in CRC tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. Cells proliferation was examined by EdU, CCK-8 and in vivo analyses. Glucose metabolism was assessed by detecting lactate production, glucose uptake, mitochondrial respiration, extracellular acidification rate,  consumption rate and ATP production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to explore the signaling pathway. Specific targeting by miRNAs was determined by luciferase reporter assays and correlation with target protein expression.PLK3 was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues and its low expression was correlated with worse prognosis of patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that PLK3 contributed to growth inhibition of CRC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLK3 impeded glucose metabolism via targeting Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. Mechanically, PLK3 bound to Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and facilitated its degradation, which led to a significant decrease of phosphorylated STAT3. The downregulation of p-STAT3 further suppressed the transcriptional activation of HK2. Moreover, our investigations showed that PLK3 was directly targeted by miR-106b at post-transcriptional level in CRC cells.This study suggests that PLK3 inhibits glucose metabolism by targeting HSP90/STAT3/HK2 signaling and PLK3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and Metabolism to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive  and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury.

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of  demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino acid concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino acid nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced  competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657199>Multicolor fluorescence based on FRET regulated by functional peptides to screen high metastatic potential cancer cells.</a></h2><p>The activation and execution of cancer invasion and metastasis involves in a complex network of intracellular, extracellular molecule levels (such as reactive  species, ROS, matrix metalloproteinase, MMPs) and signaling cascades. Obviously, fluorescence sensing is a powerful detection tool for the analytes. However, for imaging the intracellular signal cascades involved multiple molecules, traditional fluorescence probes were unsuitable, because most of them only can determine the change of only species, rather than response multiple species simultaneously. Herein, we constructed a novel probe: H2O2 responding fluorophore donor was linked by MMP2-sensitive peptides tagged a FRET Cy5 acceptor. Upon addition of H2O2, the system was lighted with green fluorescence emission (555 nm), further triggering a brighter red fluorescent emission (672 nm, belong to Cy5 acceptor), owing to FRET. In contrast, in the prescence of MMP2, the FRET was turned off, due to special cleavage of the peptide linker. The stimulation with H2O2 made probe-loaded living cells emit multicolor fluorescence: mainly red fluorescence in normal RAW264.7 cells and poorly-invasive MCF7 cells; only green fluorescence in highly-invasive MDA-MA-231 cells, owing to different expression of MMP2. This means that after activation of H2O2, probe can be used to distinguish MDA-MA-231 cells from RAW264.7 macrophages and MCF7 cells. Therefore, so multicolor fluorescent probe is a powerful tool in monitoring cancer invasion and metastasis, which will provide precision information for cancer control and cure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661365>Phytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticles on seed germination and growth of terrestrial plants.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) exhibit size and concentration dependent toxicity to terrestrial plants, especially crops. AgNP exposure could decrease seed germination, inhibit seedling growth, affect mass and length of roots and shoots. The phytotoxic pathway has been partly understood. Silver (as element, ion or AgNP) accumulates in roots/leaves and triggers the defense mechanism at cellular and tissue levels, which alters metabolism, antioxidant activities and related proteomic expression. Botanical changes (either increase or decrease) in response to AgNP exposure include reactive  species generation, superoxide dismutase activities, HO level, total chlorophyll, proline, carotenoid, ascorbate and glutathione contents, etc. Such processes lead to abnormal morphological changes, suppression of photosynthesis and/or transpiration, and other symptoms.

In the brain, EtOH affects redox signaling and increases reactive  species (ROS) production after acute and chronic exposures. Here, using a high-resolution respirometry assay, we investigated whether changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics play a role in both acute and chronic EtOH-mediated neurochemical responses in zebrafish. For the first time, we showed that acute and chronic EtOH exposures differently affect brain mitochondrial function. Acutely, EtOH stimulated mitochondrial respiration through increased baseline state, CI-mediated OXPHOS, OXPHOS capacity, OXPHOS coupling efficiency, bioenergetic efficiency, and ROX/ETS ratio. Conversely, EtOH chronically decreased baseline respiration, complex I- and II-mediated ETS, as well as increased ROX state and ROX/ETS ratio, which are associated with ROS formation. Overall, we observed that changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics play a role, at least partially, in both acute and chronic effects of EtOH in the zebrafish brain. Moreover, our findings reinforce the face, predictive, and construct validities of zebrafish models to explore the neurochemical bases involved in alcohol abuse and alcoholism.Copyright © 2019.

It is discovered that the incorporation of the dual Fe and Mn cations can simultaneously modulate the morphology and optimize the electron density of the obtained catalysts. As a result, the full sulfidation product of FM-NS NSAs display a much-enhanced activity for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with an overpotential of 188 mV. The NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSAs obtained from partial sulfidation demonstrate an enhanced HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The FM-NS NSA anode and the NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSA cathode were coupled in an alkaline medium for overall water splitting and exhibited a much lower cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2, superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Additionally, a battery-assisted electrolyzer (1.5 V) was assembled to explore the feasibility for practical energy-efficient water splitting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661199>Uremia and Hypoxia Independently Induce Eryptosis and Erythrocyte Redox Imbalance.</a></h2><p>Red blood cell (RBC) death could contribute to anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Recent observational research has suggested a relationship between RBC death (eryptosis) and hypoxemia in hemodialysis patients. Thus, we studied the isolated and joint effects of a uremic toxin (indoxyl sulfate; IS) and hypoxia on RBC biology.We incubated RBC from healthy donors with IS at concentrations of 0.01mM, 0.09mM and 0.17mM under both normoxic (21% O) and hypoxic (5% O) conditions for 24 hours. Eryptosis was evaluated by RBC phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell volume, and cytosolic calcium which were quantified by Annexin-V+, forward scatter, and Fluo-3AM+ binding, respectively. RBC redox balance was reported by reactive  species (ROS) production and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Analyses were performed by flow cytometry.Hypoxia induced a 2-fold ROS production compared to normoxia. PS exposure and cytosolic calcium increased, while cell volume decreased by hypoxia and likewise by IS. IS increased ROS production in a dose-dependent manner under conditions of both normoxia and hypoxia. The same conditions promoted a GSH decrease with IS intensifying the hypoxia-induced effects.In summary, our results indicate that the concurrent presence of hypoxia and uremia augments RBC death and may therefore, contribute to the genesis of anemia in CKD.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Vitamin-C (VitC), in addition to suppressing  radicals, exerts pleiotropic effects to preserve the core functions of SCs. However, this compound is labile and readily oxidized, resulting in cellular toxicity and preventing its reliable application in this context. We found that a VitC derivative, ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G), stably maintains the naïve pluripotency of murine embryonic-SCs (mESCs) and the primitiveness of human mesenchymal-SCs (hMSCs) without cellular toxicity.The beneficial effects of AA2G and related molecular mechanisms were evaluated in mESCs, induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs), and hMSCs. AA2G was stable in aqueous solution and barely induced cellular toxicity in cultured SCs, unlike VitC. AA2G supplementation recapitulated the well-known effects of VitC, including induction of ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent DNA demethylation in mESCs and suppression of p53 during generation of murine iPSCs. Furthermore, supplementation of hMSCs with AA2G improved therapeutic outcomes in an asthma mouse model by promoting their self-renewal, engraftment, and anti-inflammatory properties. Particularly, activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-1 (CREB1) pathway contributed to the ability of AA2G to maintain naïve pluripotency of mESCs and functionality of hMSCs. Innovation and Conclusion: Given its long-lasting effects and low cellular toxicity, AA2G supplementation is useful to support the naïve pluripotency of mESCs and the primitiveness of hMSCs, which affects their developmental potency and therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the significance of the CREB1 pathway in the mechanism of action of AA2G.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660497>A case report: use of cerebral oximetry in the early detection of cerebral hypoperfusion in a post-cardiac arrest patient during targeted temperature management.</a></h2><p>We present a patient who received cerebral oximetry monitoring during targeted temperature management (TTM) post-cardiac arrest and discuss its potential in the early detection of cerebral hypoperfusion and implications on haemodynamics and ventilatory management.A 60-year-old Chinese male was admitted for acute pulmonary oedema with Type 2 respiratory failure. He failed an initial trial of non-invasive ventilation and was planned for intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, the patient suffered a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest peri-intubation. He was started on our institution's protocolized post-cardiac arrest care bundle, which included cerebral regional  saturation (rSO) monitoring and TTM. Initial arterial blood gas (ABG) post-return of spontaneous circulation showed severe respiratory acidosis, and the patient was sedated, paralyzed, and ventilator settings optimized. Repeat ABG showed resolution of respiratory acidosis. However, a drop in rSO to 35% was subsequently noted. Ventilator settings were quickly adjusted, and dobutamine was started to improve global and cerebral perfusion. These measures improved cerebral rSO to more than 50%. Patient was cooled for 24 h and gradually rewarmed. He was later extubated with a cerebral performance category of 1 and is now on outpatient follow-up.During post-cardiac arrest care, there are many factors which can contribute to a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Therapeutic hypothermia and ventilation strategies, including the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, can both reduce pCO which is a major regulator of cerebrovascular tone. Accidental hypocapnia can lead to adverse cerebral vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion. Without cerebral oximetry, cerebral ischaemia may not be detected early and can potentially result in secondary brain injury.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the effect of scutellarin on hepatic hypoxia/reoxygenation (I/R) injury remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the protective effect of scutellarin on I/R-induced injury in hepatocytes. Our results showed that scutellarin improved cell viability in hepatocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Scutellarin treatment resulted in decreased levels of reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and increased SOD activity in H/R-induced hepatocytes. In addition, scutellarin reduced cell apoptosis in H/R-stimulated hepatocytes, as proved by the decreased apoptotic rate. Moreover, scutellarin significantly upregulated bcl-2 expression and downregulated bax expression in hepatocytes exposed to H/R. Furthermore, scutellarin treatment caused significant decrease in Keap1 expression and increase in nuclear Nrf2 expression. Besides, scutellarin induced the mRNA expressions of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Inhibition of Nrf2 significantly reversed the protective effects of scutellarin on H/R-stimulated hepatocytes. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that scutellarin protected hepatocytes from H/R-induced oxidative injury through regulating the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, indicating a potential relevance of scutellarin in attenuating hepatic I/R injury.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658450>The production of positron emitters with millisecond half-life during helium beam radiotherapy.</a></h2><p>Therapy with helium ions is currently receiving significantly increasing interest because helium ions have a sharper penumbra than protons and undergo less fragmentation than carbon ions and thus require less complicated dose calculations. For any ion of interest in hadron therapy, the accuracy of dose delivery is limited by range uncertainties. This has led to efforts by several groups to develop in-vivo verification techniques, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET), for monitoring of the dose delivery. Beam-on PET monitoring during proton therapy through the detection of short-lived positron emitters such as 12N (T1/2 = 11 ms), an emerging PET technique, provides an attractive option given the achievable range accuracy, minimal susceptibility to biological washout and provision of near prompt feedback. Extension of this approach to helium ions requires information on the production yield of relevant short-lived positron emitters. This study presents the first measurements of the production of short-lived positron emitters in water, graphite, calcium and phosphorus targets irradiated with 59 MeV/u 3He and 50 MeV/u 4He beams. For these targets, the most produced short-lived nuclides are 13O/12N (T1/2 = 8.6/11 ms) on water, 13O/12N on graphite, 43Ti/41Sc/42Sc (T1/2 = 509 - 680 ms) on calcium, 28P (T1/2 = 268 ms) on phosphorus. A translation of the results from elemental targets to PMMA and representative tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, compact and cortical bone, shows the dominance of 13O/12N in at least the first 20 s of an irradiation with 4He and somewhat longer with 3He. As the production of 13O/12N in a 3He irradiation is 3 to 4 times higher than in a 4He irradiation, from a statistical point of view, range verification using 13O/12N PET imaging will be about 2 times more precise for a 3He irradiation compared to a 4He irradiation.© 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656521>Pre-IVM treatment with C-type natriuretic peptide in the presence of cysteamine enhances bovine oocytes antioxidant defense ability and developmental competence .</a></h2><p>The use of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) combined with cysteamine during pre- maturation (IVM) can help establish an effective pre-IVM system.This study was designed to investigate the effects of CNP combined with cysteamine on meiotic maturation and developmental competence of bovine oocytes .Oocytes were cultured in pre-IVM medium supplemented with 100 nM CNP for 6 h in the absence or presence of 100 μM cysteamine, followed by standard IVM for 24 h. Oocytes matured by standard IVM for 24 h (no pre-IVM) were used as the control. The percentage of oocytes arrested at germinal vesicle (GV) stage in each treatment group was examined at 0 h of IVM, and the nuclear maturation rate was assessed by evaluating the percentages of oocytes that reached metaphase II (M II) stage at 24 h of IVM. After 24 h of IVM, oocytes were subjected to  fertilization (IVF) and   embryo culture (IVC). Cleavage rates were assessed 48 h post-insemination. Blastocyst production rates were recorded on day 8 after IVF. In addition, intra-oocyte glutathione (GSH) and reactive  species (ROS) content for each treatment were tested at 0 h and 24 h of IVM.No differences were observed between the CNP pre-IVM treatment and control groups in the rate of bovine oocytes maturing to the M II stage, cleavage and blastocysts production rates after IVF, and intra-oocyte GSH levels. Notably, the presence of cysteamine during pre-IVM culture with CNP significantly improved the rate of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage after  maturation and fertilization, moreover, it increased the levels of GSH and reduced the levels of ROS in bovine oocytes.The improvement to IVM bovine oocyte developmental competence through pre-IVM with CNP combined with cysteamine may be associated with an increased antioxidant defense. Therefore, such an approach may be a good option for establishing a pre-IVM system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657429>A unipolar nonvolatile resistive switching behavior in a layered transition metal oxide.</a></h2><p>Two-dimensional layered materials have been considered as promising candidates for resistive random access memory, one of the most promising next-generation nonvolatile memories. However, due to the types of defects, most of the devices still suffer from poor environmental stability, defects inducing complexity, and uncontrollability. Here, we fabricate memory cells based on synthesized high-quality two-dimensional layered transition-metal oxide (α-MoO3) nanosheets which can be thinned to 8.68 nm (∼6 layers) and find a unipolar nonvolatile resistive switching behavior. Driven by the migration of intrinsic  vacancies, the devices show a large memory window (∼105), good memory voltage stability, long-term endurance (for durations of over 3 days and 50 manual DC switching cycles) and multi-bit memory states. Furthermore, we find the devices with an excellent temperature tolerance of lower SET/RESET voltages and a larger memory window (>104 at 380 K) at higher temperatures, suggesting their potential in practical applications. Finally, all 2D memory devices are demonstrated using graphene/α-MoO3/graphene heterostructures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656079>MicroRNA Targeting NADPH Oxidases in Cancer.</a></h2><p>Reactive  species (ROS) production occurs primarily in the mitochondria as a byproduct of cellular metabolism. ROS are also produced by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling pathways. NADPH oxidase, a member of NOX family, utilizes molecular  (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Molecules such as Keap1/Nrf2, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDRs), NF-κB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19 and deregulated metabolic pathways are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor miRNAs viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDRs involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here we discuss the structure, function and metabolic role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other pathways and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase-associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications. Targeting NADPH oxidases through miRNAs appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of ROS driven cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658733>20(S)-Ginsenoside Rg3 Promotes HeLa Cell Apoptosis by Regulating Autophagy.</a></h2><p>20()-Ginsenoside Rg3 (GRg3) has various bioactivities including anti-cancer effects and inhibition of autophagy. However, no reports have investigated the appearance of autophagy or the connection between autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells treated with 20()-GRg3. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assays. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Apoptotic pathways were examined by ROS (reactive  species) determination and rhodamine 123 assays. Western blot analysis was used to determine changes in protein levels. Autophagy induction was monitored by acidic vesicular organelle staining and EGFP-LC3 transfection. 20()-GRg3 inhibited autophagy of cells in a starved state, making it impossible for cells to maintain a steady state through autophagy, and then induced apoptosis. 20()-GRg3 blocked the late stage of autophagy (fusion of lysosomes and degradation of autophagic lysosomes), including a decrease in acidic vesicular organelle fluorescence, increased LC3 I-II conversion, accumulation of EGFP-LC3 fluorescence, GFP-mRFP-LC3 red-green fluorescence ratio, degradation of the substrate p62, and loss of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis, which induced apoptosis. ROS increased, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, apoptotic inducer AIF was released from mitochondria, and nuclear transfer occurred, triggering a series of subsequent apoptotic events. Autophagy inducer rapamycin inhibited the apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3, whereas autophagy inhibitor BA1 promoted apoptosis induced by 20()-GRg3. Therefore, 20()-GRg3 promoted HeLa cell apoptosis by regulating autophagy. In the autophagic state, 20()-GRg3 can be used as a novel autophagy inhibitor in synergy with tumor-blocking therapies such as chemotherapy, which supports its application in the medical field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653882>Anthracene phytotoxicity in the freshwater flagellate alga Euglena agilis Carter.</a></h2><p>The freshwater flagellate alga Euglena agilis Carter was exposed to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) anthracene for 96 h under optimal photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and responses of growth, photosynthetic pigment production, and photosynthetic efficiency were assessed. Anthracene reduced the growth rate (μ) and levels of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), and total carotenoids. The growth rate was more sensitive than photosynthetic parameters, with a median effective concentration (EC) of 4.28 mg L. Between 5 and 15 mg L, anthracene inhibited the maximum quantum yield (F/F) of photosystem II (PSII) and the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate through PSII (rETR) with EC values of 14.88 and 11.8 mg L, respectively. At all anthracene concentrations, intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were elevated, indicating increased oxidative stress. Anthracene presumably reduced the PSII efficiency of photochemical energy regulation and altered the photochemistry through intracellular ROS formation. Acute exposure to PAHs may induce severe physiological changes in phytoplankton cells, which may influence vital ecological processes within the aquatic environments. Additionally, growth and Chl a content may serve as sensitive risk assessment parameters of anthracene toxicity in water management since EC values for both overlap with anthracene levels (8.3 mg L) permitted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654874>A new liquid-phase method and its comparison to two solid-phase microbial respiration activity methods to assess organic waste stability.</a></h2><p>Goal of the work was to compare the respiration activities, as measured via  consumption with three different organic waste stability methods so that to propose the optimal one. The novelty of the work is that there exists no comparison of solid-phase with liquid-phase stability assessment techniques in the literature. The respiration activities were assessed using two solid-phase methods and a manometric liquid-phase method (MANLIQ) performed on twenty-seven organic substrates. The methods rely on measuring  consumption (uptake) via pressure drops (liquid-phase test, static solid-phase test) or via direct O measurements on the gaseous phases at the inlet and outlet of the respirometer (solid-phase dynamic test). A positive statistically significant correlation was calculated between the MANLIQ and the static solid-phase indices. The maximum rate MANLIQ index for the raw substrates was 2900 mg O kg VS h, while most of the processed substrates had cumulative MANLIQ indices below 160 g O kg VS. The ratio of the liquid indices to the static solid-phase indices ranged from 1.6 to 2.7 and the ratio of the liquid indices to the dynamic solid-phase indices ranged from 0.2 to 0.4. The MANLIQ method failed to result in a good correlation of the processing time with the respiration indices. On the other hand, a correlation was more visible in the two solid-phase tests, despite the large variability of the types and sources of the substrates. Therefore, the solid-phase methods should be preferred over the liquid-phase method to assess stability for various organic substrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lung dynamic compliance was also ameliorated (mean improvement: 41.9 to 60.7 mL/cmH2O). Radiography revealed improved elevation of the diaphragm (mean improvement of 1.8 intercostal spaces, range, 1-2). Mean hospital stay after DP was 65.5 days (range, 25-187 days).

Failure of myocardial recovery has life-altering consequences: transition to durable mechanical circulatory support (dMCS), urgent heart transplantation, or withdrawal of support. Clinical factors controlling myocardial recovery under these circumstances remain largely unknown.Using a retrospective cohort, we developed a model for early prediction of transition to dMCS in patients undergoing pVA-ECMO for cCS. To promote myocardial recovery, our clinical management centered around left-ventricular pressure unloading, i.e. targeting pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) ≤18mmHg. We collected demographic data, laboratory findings, inotrope use, and 2D-transthoracic echocardiography measurements, all limited to the first 72h of pVA-ECMO (D1-3).Out of 70 patients who were alive after pVA-ECMO, 27 patients underwent implantation of dMCS. There was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge between patients with or without transition to dMCS. Ejection fraction [per 10% increase, OR 0.37 (0.17-0.79)] and amount of inotropic support [OR 4.77 (1.6-14.18)] but neither myocardial wall tension nor PCWP emerged as significant predictors of transition to dMCS. Optimism-corrected c-index [0.90 (0.89-0.90)] revealed excellent discriminative ability of our model.Our model for early prediction of transition to dMCS in patients with cCS undergoing pVA-ECMO identifies indicators of inotropic state as relevant factors. Absence of markers for myocardial  consumption or left ventricular pressure loading allows us to hypothesize sufficient cardiac unloading in our cohort with PCWP-targeted management.© 2019 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654556>PINK1 overexpression protects against cerebral ischemia through Parkin regulation.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dynamics and function are important for cell survival regulation under stress.

PINK1 overexpression mice significantly improved mitochondrial function by increased mitochondrial complex I, II, and III activities and ATP levels with concomitant decline in reactive  species levels. PINK1 overexpression mice after I/R injury significantly reduced apoptosis through downregulation of cytochrome c, p53 expressions compared to cerebral I/R injury rats. Furthermore, we showed from parkin siRNA studies that PINK1 regulated phosphorylation parkin is critical to the protection against cerebral I/R injury.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the cardiorespiratory and thermal responses to hypercapnia in chicks that were exposed to CO during embryonic development, i.e., incubation. Embryos were incubated without and with a gradual increase in CO concentration up to 1% during the first ten days of incubation. Ten-day-old chicks (males and females) were again acutely exposed to hypercapnia (7% CO), or to room air (normocapnia) and pulmonary ventilation, arterial pH and blood gases, arterial blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature (Tb) and  consumption (V⋅O) were measured. Compared to control animals, male chicks incubated with 1% CO presented an attenuated ventilatory response to hypercapnia (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was found in the hypercapnic ventilatory response in both female chick groups (0% vs 1% CO incubation). Hypercapnia induced bradycardia in all groups (P < 0.001). The CO exposure during incubation did not alter the cardiovascular responses to hypercapnia in post-hatch animals. There were no significant effects of incubation treatment (0% vs 1% CO) or sex in the mean arterial pressure, Tb, and V⋅O of animals in normocapnia and hypercapnia. As for the V⋅/V⋅O, hypercapnia caused an increase in both groups (P < 0.05), regardless of incubation treatment. In conclusion, among cardiorespiratory and metabolic variables, the ventilatory response to hypercapnia can be attenuated by pre-exposure to 1% CO during embryonic development, especially in male chicks up to 10 days.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, it has been discovered that ultra-high dose rates of ionizing radiation may preferentially spare normal tissue over tumor tissue. This effect, referred to as FLASH radiotherapy, has been observed in various animal models as well as, more recently, in a human patient. This effect may be related to the cell sparing found  at ultra-high dose rates of photons and electrons dating back to the 1960s. Conditions representative of physiologic  were found to be essential for this process to occur. However, there is no conclusive data on whether this effect occurs with protons, as all results to date have been in cells irradiated at ambient  conditions. There have been no ultra-high dose-rate experiments with heavy ions, which would be relevant to the implementation of FLASH to carbon-ion therapy. These basic science results are critical in guiding this rapidly advancing field, since clinical particle therapy machines capable of FLASH dose rates have already been promoted for protons. To help ensure FLASH radiotherapy is reliable and maximally effective, the radiobiology must keep ahead of the clinical implementation to help guide it. In this context,  and  proton and heavy ion experiments involving FLASH dose rates need to be performed to evaluate not only short-term consequences, but also sequelae related to long-term health risks. Critical to these future studies is consideration of relevant  tensions at the time of irradiation, as well as appropriate  modeling to assist in understanding the initial physicochemical events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661473>[How Methods of Molecular Biology Shape Our Understanding of the Hematopoietic System].</a></h2><p>Blood is extremely important for a multicellular organism: it connects all organs and tissues, supplies them with nutrients and , removes carbon dioxide and metabolic products, maintains homeostasis, and provides protection against infections.

NOA underwent testicular sperm extraction (TeSE). ROS production (in Lymphocytes, Monocytes and Granulocytes) was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Plasma oxidative stress was evaluated by lipid peroxidation markers (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) both assessed by fluorometric techniques.Mean lymphocyte ROS production resulted 967.0 ± 224.5 vs 728.0 ± 98.0 (NOA vs Controls, p<0.001), monocyte ROS resulted 2102.5 ± 517.5 vs 1253 ± 171 (p<0.001), granulocyte ROS were 2366.5 ± 595.4 vs 1751.0 ± 213.0 (p<0.001). Significant increases plasma lipid peroxidation markers were found in NOA patients compared to controls (2.7 ± 0.8 vs 0.37 ± 0.2 nmol/ml, p<0.001). Significant decreased TAC was evident in NOA compared to controls (13.4 ± 3.9 vs 3.0 ± 0.2 µmol/ml Trolox equivalents, p<0.001). No significant differences were found in blood leukocyte subpopulations ROS production, plasma lipid peroxidation and TAC comparing groups (positive vs negative sperm retrieval, p > 0.05).ROS production can be directly related to disorders of spermatogenesis, leading to severe conditions of male infertility, including azoospermia.© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654225>Dexmedetomidine Protects Against -Glucose Deprivation-Induced Injury Through Inducing Astrocytes Autophagy via TSC2/mTOR Pathway.</a></h2><p>Although there is an increment in stroke burden in the world, stroke therapeutic strategies are still extremely limited to a minority of patients. We previously demonstrated that dexmedetomidine (DEX) protects against focal cerebral ischemia via inhibiting neurons autophagy. Nevertheless, the role of DEX in regulating astrocytes autophagic status in -glucose deprivation, a condition that mimics cerebral ischemia, is still unknown. In this study, we have shown that DEX and DEX + RAPA (autophagy inducer) increased viability and reduced apoptosis of primary astrocytes in -glucose deprivation (OGD) model compared with DEX + 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (autophagy inhibitor). DEX induced the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin 1, while reduced the expression of p62 in primary cultured astrocytes through induction of autophagy. In addition, DEX enhanced the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) in primary cultured astrocytes, while reduced the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In conclusion, our study suggests that DEX exerts a neuroprotection against OGD-induced astrocytes injury via activation of astrocytes autophagy by regulating the TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a new insight into the mechanisms of DEX treatment for acute ischemic injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658386>Evidence for a Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Mechanism in a Biomimetic System for Monoamine Oxidase B Catalysis.</a></h2><p>Mechanistic studies with 5-ethyl-3-methyllumiflavinium (Fl+) perchlorate, a biomimetic model for flavoenzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) catalysis, and the tertiary, allyl amine 1-methyl-4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MMTP) reveal that proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) may be an important pathway for MAO catalysis. The first step involves single electron transfer (SET) leading to the free radicals Fl•and MMTP•, the latter produced by deprotonation of the initially formed and highly acidic MMTP•+. Molecular  (O2) is found to play a hitherto unrecognized role in the early steps of the oxidation. MMTP and several structurally similar tertiary amines are the only tertiary amines oxidized by MAO, and their structural/electronic properties provide the key to understanding this behavior. A general hypothesis about the role of SET in MAO catalysis, and the recognition that PCET occurs with appropriately substituted substrates is presented.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal obesity and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659918>NADPH oxidase: a therapeutic target for hyperoxaluria-induced oxidative stress - an update.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661288>Photolyase-like catalytic behavior of CeO2.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics exhibit their great potentials as alternatives of natural enzymes. Among various enzymes, the finding of substitutes of DNA photolyases, a family of photoenzymes for repairing the ultraviolet (UV) induced DNA damage by forming cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) between two adjacent thymines in a DNA strand, is still unsuccessful. CPDs raise significant health concerns in various skin diseases. Essentially, DNA photolyases selectively split dimers into monomers by photoelectrons under visible light irradiation is a photocatalytic process. However, majority of semiconductors are unprosperous due to the accompanied photogenerated reactive  species (ROS), which decompose CPDs into fragments and thereby lead to a nonselective photocatalysis. Fortunately, CeO2 as semiconductor might deliver the selectively photocatalytic repair of UV-induced DNA damages, where the photoelectrons are used for the CPD cleavage and the photogenerated ROS are locally suppressed for its anti-oxidant nature. Herein, we reported the defective porous CeO2 delivered the photolyase-like activity by enhancing visible light absorption, enabling the effective interaction between CPDs and catalysts, and subsequently triggering the selective photocleavage of CPDs into monomers. Further in vitro cellular and in vivo animal evaluations illustrated its high potentials as alternatives of DNA photolyases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655924>Recombinant human Cyclophilin A stimulates hair follicle cells via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>To explore potential effects of recombinant peptidyl-prolyl isomerase human Cyclophilin A (CypA) in the growth of mouse hair and human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HDP).The hair growth of 8-weeks C57BL/6 mouse was significantly stimulated by recombinant human CypA protein.

In this work, we used high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the OER performance of thirty kinds of isolated transition metal atoms-doped ultrathin MoS nanosheets (M-UMONs). The results showed that the OER activity could be a function of the decorated transition metal-sulfur (M-S) bond orders with a volcanic-shaped correlation, and a strong correlation could be found when the difference of the M-S bond orders and corresponding metal- (M-O) bond orders were taken into consideration, implying that the difference in M-S and M-O bond orders could be a predictive descriptor of OER activity for M-UMON system. This successful result also implies this calculation-based method for the exploring of descriptors would also provide a new promising avenue for the discovery of high-performance OER catalysts.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In particular, a strong intermolecular force, negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding ((-)CAHB), was recently identified, which explains the unusually strong adsorption of negatively charged compounds on carbon nanotubes with -containing functional groups. However, most previous studies only probed molecules with one benzene ring. The adsorption of ionizable compounds with more than one benzene ring and additional functional groups has not been examined. This study investigated the effect of surface functionalization, molecular size and structure of six aromatic carboxylic acids on their adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in batch reactors. In addition, the short-range interactions of the neutral acids with MWNTs were calculated to evaluate the effect of aromaticity and bulkiness. Hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions dominate the intermolecular forces between ionized contaminants and MWNT surfaces. pH dependent octanol/water partitioning coefficient (Dow) is a more precise indicator of the adsorption of ionizable compounds on MWNTs. (-)CAHB is a significant force only for compounds with one benzene ring. Hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups displayed similar capacity to form (-)CAHB, as indicated by the release of hydroxide ions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655299>Survival of silk worm, Bombyx mori in azaserine induced oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Cells under stress generate reactive  species (ROS) in excess, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction and stimulates the apoptotic cascade. However, mild stress or pre-conditioning lead to the evasion of apoptosis by activating mitogenic signaling, including the signaling of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), or by inactivating certain apoptotic molecules. The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is an important economic insect which serves as a model organism in biological research. Bombyx mori apoptotic protease inducing factor (BmApaf1), a death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (BmDredd), and BmSurvivin-2 (Bm-Svv2) are known to play significant roles in metamorphosis. Azaserine is an analogue of glutamine and irreversibly inhibits glutamine-utilizing enzymes and cysteine-glutamate transporter genes EAAT2. In the present study, we experimentally demonstrated stress induced by azaserine along with the capacity of antioxidants to modulate apoptotic/anti-apoptotic gene expression in determining the fate of the larvae. We observed higher larval survival with higher azaserine dosages and attributed this to the quantum of ROS generated and AOEs response, which favoured the BmSvv2 expression. Higher levels of ROS with concomitant changes in AOEs were found to be responsible for BmApaf1 and BmDredd expression, which reflected a higher mortality rate.Copyright © 2019.

The placenta provides the fetus with the necessary nutrition and  and takes away the metabolic waste. Patients with GDM are diagnosed and treated merely on the basis of the blood glucose level; this approach does nothing to help evaluate the status of the placenta, which is worth noting in GDM. The purpose of this research was to clarify the relation between thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and reactive  species (ROS) in the placenta of patients with GDM, which has thus far remained unclear.The expression of TXNIP in the placentas of 10 patients with GDM and 10 healthy puerperae (control group) was investigated via immunofluorescence. The relation among TXNIP, ROS, and the function of mitochondria was explored in HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated by high glucose (HG).The results showed the expression of TXNIP in the placentas of patients with GDM was higher than that in the control group, and the expression of TXNIP in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with HG was higher than that in the control group, causing the accumulation of ROS and changes of mitochondria, promoting apoptosis and inhibition of migration.High expression of TXNIP caused by HG mediates the increasing ROS and the mitochondria dysfunction in GDM; this impairs the function of the placenta and is the basis for the prediction of perinatal outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658232>Corneal Endothelial Blebs Induced in Scleral Lens Wearers.</a></h2><p>In the bleb phenomenon, some endothelial cells transiently lose their specular reflection. This has been reported during contact lens wear and goggle-induced hypoxia or hypercapnia.The purposes of this study were to determine whether blebs appear after scleral lens wear and if their appearance is influenced by lens clearance and to compare bleb and cell sizes.Twenty-one subjects were fitted with two similar scleral lenses with different targeted clearances of 200 and 400 μm (the SL200 and SL400, respectively). Each lens was worn unilaterally for 25 minutes, whereas the other eye served as a control. Before and after lens wear, the endothelium was photographed using specular microscopy. The number of blebs and measurements of the areas of cells and blebs were analyzed. Paired t tests compared differences in the areas of cells and blebs. Differences in median bleb number were evaluated using the Wilcoxon test.After wearing the SL200 and SL400 lenses, respectively, 9 and 14 subjects had at least one bleb. The median bleb number after wearing lenses was significantly different (SL200, 0.00; SL400, 1.00; P = .02). Bleb and cell areas were significantly different (blebs, 293 ± 28; cells, 370 ± 32 μm; P < .0001).After 25 minutes of wearing scleral lenses with each of the two targeted clearances, SL400 induced significantly more blebs than did SL200, suggesting evidence of reduced  and/or increased carbon dioxide levels under scleral lenses fitted with excessive clearance. Blebs may occur more in smaller cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661289>Enhanced Reactive  Species Levels by Active Benzothiazole Complex mediated Fenton Reaction for Highly Effective Anti-tumor Therapy.</a></h2><p>Breaking the threshold of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels can cause non-specific oxidative damage to proteins, and lead to the Fenton reaction-mediated exogenous ROS production to be a new promising anticancer strategy. However, the problems including the inefficient transport of metal catalysts and insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in cells still need to be improved. In this study, functional nanosystem encapsulated with benzothiazole complexes (FeTB2) and the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was designed for highly effective antitumor therapy. The surface of the nanocarriers was modified with dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-grafted polyglutamic acid. The induced hyperthermia enables the lipid-polymer shell to depolymerize, releasing FeTB2. The released FeTB2 could kill tumor cells in two different ways by inhibiting DNA replication and catalyzing H2O2 to produce active •OH. Moreover, the conjugated DHA could increase the amount of peroxides in tumor cells and significantly enhance ROS yield. This work has provided solid evidence that the present nanosystem enables significant effect on tumor killing through the combined inhibition of DNA replication and ROS mediated oxidative damage by regulation of tumor microenvironment, providing a ROS-mediated high efficiency antitumor strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655474>The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in reactive  species metabolism in apple exocarp induced by acibenzolar-S-methyl.</a></h2><p>Apple exocarp was used to investigate the effect of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatments on reaction  species (ROS) metabolism. The results indicated that ASM enhanced the hydrogen peroxide (HO) content, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). ASM also increased the contents of ascorbic acid (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide ademine dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH), MdSOD and MdAPX expression, but decreased MdMDHAR and dehydroascorbate reductase (MdDHAR) expression. DHEA suppressed HO accumulation and POD, APX, MDHAR, G6PDH activities, but increased SOD, CAT and GR activities compared to the control. ASM and DHEA treatments suppressed the contents of AsA, GSH and NADPH, and expression of MdSOD, MdAPX and MdMDHAR. These results suggest that DHEA treatment prevented ROS metabolism induced by ASM which showed the important role of G6PDH in maintaining redox homeostasis in apple exocarp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various oxygenation strategies including noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and conventional  therapy in patients with de novo hypoxemic respiratory failure.We performed electronic database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to December 2018 to include randomized controlled trials that compared various oxygenation strategies in cases of de novo hypoxemic respiratory failure occurring in adult subjects without a preexisting chronic lung disease and excluding respiratory failure in the immediate postoperative or postextubation periods. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to calculate odds ratio (OR) and Bayesian 95% credible intervals (CrI).16 studies were included, involving 2,180 subjects with a mean age of 61 ± 17 y (66% were male; 46% of the included subjects were treated with conventional , 27.8% were treated with NIV, and 25.8% were treated with HFNC). Compared to conventional , NIV was associated with reduced intubation rates (OR 0.42, 95% CrI 0.26-0.62) but no significant reduction in short-term (OR 0.73, 95% CrI 0.47-1.02) or long-term mortality (OR 0.60, 95% CrI 0.29-1.06). There was no significant difference between NIV and HFNC or between HFNC and conventional  regarding all outcomes. In a sensitivity analysis, the results remained consistent after exclusion of studies that included subjects with respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.Among subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure, NIV was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rates but not short- or long-term mortality when compared to conventional  therapy.

The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the induction of inhalation injury further, the tissues of larynx, trachea, and lungs were collected for the histological, hematological, myeloperoxidase, and malondialdehyde analysis. The obtained results showed that treatment with CARV+SLN minimized the inhalation injury, since it reduced malondialdehyde significantly, when compared to the negative control group and minimized the histological changes which proves the absence of pulmonary emphysema and exudate in laryngeal and tracheal lumen in the CARV+SLN-treated group.

Naturally occurring OM seems to have a negligible effect on the bulk isotopic composition of carbonates compared with changes induced by pre-treatments. This study provides further insights into the possible effects induced by commonly used pre-treatments on natural lacustrine carbonates.Sixteen samples from the Fucino F1-F3 lacustrine succession (Abruzzo, central Italy) were characterised for their mineralogical and geochemical composition and split in three identical aliquots. One aliquot was left untreated while the remaining two were treated with NaOCl and H O dilutions. The same treatment was applied to an internal standard consisting of pure Carrara marble. The treated and untreated samples were analysed for their carbon (δ C values) and  (δ O values) isotope compositions using an Analytical Precision AP2003 isotope ratio mass spectrometer.The samples had variable proportions of endogenic and detrital components, the detrital portion being more (less) abundant during colder (warmer) climate phases. We observed that neither the NaOCl nor the H O treatment were able to completely remove OM and therefore there was selective removal of compounds within the OM pool. A possible effect of pre-treatment is the loss of carbonates intimately interspersed within the OM, as suggested by the evolution of isotopic ratios towards the local detrital array.Our study highlights sample-specific changes in geochemistry associated with sample pre-treatments; however, such changes do not seem to lead to either systematic and/or predictable isotopic shifts. We suggest that the suitability of NaOCl or H O pre-treatments for OM removal should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In the specific case of lacustrine marls from palaeo-lake Fucino containing relatively low amounts of OM and in which both detrital and endogenic carbonates occur, both pre-treatments should be avoided.This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we report a highly efficient photocatalyst by assembling single Pt atoms on defective TiO 2 support (Pt 1 /def-TiO 2 ). Except as proton reduction sites, single Pt atoms promote the neighboring TiO 2 units to generate surface  vacancies and form Pt-O-Ti 3+ atomic interface. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Pt-O-Ti 3+ atomic interface effectively facilitates photogenerated electrons to transfer from Ti 3+ defective sites to single Pt atoms, thereby enhancing the separation of electron-hole pairs.

From February 2017 to May 2018, 30 patients admitted to Burn Department of our hospital with severe burns who met the criteria for inclusion and needed escharectomy and skin grafting were enrolled in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into group GDFM of 15 cases [14 males and 1 female, (45±14) years old] and conventional liquid management group of 15 cases [12 males and 3 females, (42±10) years old] according to the random number table. During escharectomy and skin grafting, volume of patients in group GDFM was managed according to the GDFM scheme, based on cardiac output index, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, hemoglobin, central venous  saturation (ScvO(2)), and other parameters; volume of patients in conventional liquid management group was managed according to clinical experience and conventional liquid management scheme, based on mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, hemoglobin, and other parameters.

Previous studies have documented the antioxidative effects of triazophos to mammals, however, the oxidative toxicity of triazophos to fish has not been adequately studied to date. Thus, an acute exposure (96 h) to triazophos at different concentrations of 0.06, 0.3 and 1.5 mg/L (corresponding to 1/50th, 1/10th and 1/2th of 96 h-LC, respectively), was conducted to investigate the triazophos-induced oxidative stress in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results showed that the time- and dose-dependent induction of oxidative stress except for the ROS level in liver after 24 and 48 h exposure, as indicated by increased reactive  species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level and a compromised antioxidant defense system, including increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione (GSH) content as well as the increased at first and decreased afterwards genes expression (Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx) in brain. Simultaneously, ROS and MDA showed an increased trend, SOD activity, CAT activity and GSH content showed a trend of increasing at 24 h and decreasing at 48 h, and then increasing at 96 h and Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx gene showed decreasing at first and then increasing in liver tissue. The present study concluded that the damage of the antioxidant system by triazophos induced oxidative stress in the brain and liver of zebrafish with concomitant lipid peroxidation, which is an important mechanism underlying the triazophos-induced acute toxicity.Copyright © 2019.

The theoretical exploration predicts that all investigated clusters contain a rhombus-like Mn2O2 core with up to four, terminally bound,  atoms. The short Mn-O bond length of the terminal  atoms of ≤1.58 Å indicates triple bond character instead of oxyl radical formation. However, the IR-MPD spectra reveal that higher energy isomers with up to two O2 molecules η2-coordinated to the cluster core can be kinetically trapped under the given experimental conditions. In these complexes, all O2 units are activated to superoxide species. In addition, the sequential increase of the  content in the cluster allows for a controlled increase of the positive charge localized on the Mn atoms reaching a maximum for Mn2O7+.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656964>Nanotubols under HO exposure: is it possible to poly-hydroxylate carbon nanotubes?</a></h2><p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study dedicated to analyze the variations in the surface chemistry of hydroxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), so called nanotubols, when exposed to H2O2 at high temperatures. The formation, surface density, and distribution of -containing functional groups are studied by infrared (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on model functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). After H2O2 exposure, the initial composition of -OH, -C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, and -COOH substituents notably changes, with carbonyl -C[double bond, length as m-dash]O groups being the ones that show the most notable increase on the carbon surface. Our highly oxidized MWCNTs are partially soluble and form complex two-dimensional patterns at the air-water interface, as evidenced by Brewster angle microscopy. In a second step, these films can be transferred to solid substrates to form porous multilayered carbon nanostructures with complex morphologies. In particular, and for the first time, we report the synthesis of "stadium-like" configurations made of MWCNT units whose formation and stability are a direct consequence of the self-assembly process occurring at the air/water interface. DFT calculations suggest the formation of molecular islands of -containing functional groups on the CNT surface. In addition, nudged elastic band studies reveal that, for these adsorbed phases, the reaction between two neighboring OH groups to produce atomic  and a physisorbed water molecule is characterized by energy barriers of ∼0.2 eV. These small values could be at the origin of the sizable increase in chemisorbed single- species determined by XPS data after H2O2 treatment at 60 °C. The simulation of the C 1s binding energies (BE) allows us to more clearly identify the different -containing functionalities as well as to reveal how the local atomic environment affects their characteristic BEs. Even if we were unable to polyhydroxylate our carbon nanotubes, we believe that H2O2-treated MWCNTs are interesting materials for more complex post-functionalization procedures that might lead to the fabrication of novel carbon nanostructures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658237>Hypoxia/reoxygenation decreases endothelial glycocalyx via reactive  species and calcium signaling in a cellular model for shock.</a></h2><p>Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) has been shown to cause endothelial glycocalyx (EG) damage.Whether the hypoxic/ischemic insult or the oxidative and inflammatory stress of reperfusion plays a greater part in glycocalyx damage is not known. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which IRI causes EG damage have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine if hypoxia alone or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) caused greater damage to the glycocalyx, and if this damage was mediated by reactive  species (ROS) and Ca signaling.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured to confluence and exposed to either normoxia (30 minutes), hypoxia (2% O2 for 30 minutes), or H/R (30 minutes hypoxia followed by 30 minutes normoxia). Some cells were pretreated with ROS scavengers TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, Febuxostat, or Apocynin, or with the Ca chelator BAPTA or Ca channel blockers 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, A967079, Pyr3, or ML204. Intracellular ROS was quantified for all groups. Endothelial glycocalyx was measured using fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin and imaged with fluorescence microscopy.Glycocalyx thickness was decreased in both hypoxia and H/R groups, with the decrease being greater in the H/R group. TEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL, BAPTA, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate prevented loss of glycocalyx in H/R. The ROS levels were likewise elevated compared with normoxia in both groups, but were increased in the H/R group compared with hypoxia alone. BAPTA did not prevent ROS production in either group.In our cellular model for shock, we demonstrate that although hypoxia alone is sufficient to produce glycocalyx loss, H/R causes a greater decrease in glycocalyx thickness. Under both conditions damage is dependent on ROS and Ca signaling. Notably, we found that ROS are generated upstream of Ca, but that ROS-mediated damage to the glycocalyx is dependent on Ca.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652915>Quantification of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Metabolic Disease: Application to Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing health concern with nearly 400 million affected worldwide as of 2014. T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited  supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659840>The effects of different positions on saturation and vital signs in patients.</a></h2><p>Patient positioning is an independent nursing intervention and may increase peripheral oxygenation for patients with lung disease. Few studies have been conducted on the effect of body positions on oxygenation in patients with lung disease.To investigate the effects of five different positions on peripheral  saturation (SpO ) and vital signs in patients with lung disease.A semi-experimental study was conducted.Consecutive samples were recorded from critical care patients followed in the chest clinic of a university hospital. A total of 109 patients with lung disease were recruited. Patients who were able to lie in all positions, and who had unilateral or bilateral lung disease documented by a medical diagnosis by a physician were included in this study. The SpO and vital signs were measured at each position three times.For patients with right, left, and bilateral lung disease, lying on the right side of the body at 45 in bed, the SpO was higher, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant difference at 40 minutes between the pulse rate in patients with left and bilateral lung disease, but not in patients with right lung disease. No significant differences were found between respiratory rates and body temperature in patients in any of the three groups at 10, 25, and 40 minutes.Although this difference was not statistically significant, lying on the right side of the body at 45 in bed can be an effective position for improving oxygenation in all patients with lung disease.As there is insufficient evidence to suggest a specific position, further studies are needed. This study provides evidence that the best oxygenation in patients with unilateral and bilateral lung disease can be obtained by determining the appropriate position for critical care nurses.© 2019 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655897>Cytotoxic platinum(II) complexes derived from saccharinate and phosphine ligands: synthesis, structures, DNA cleavage, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>A series of the structurally related platinum(II) saccharinate (sac) complexes with alkylphenylphosphines, namely cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhMe)]·DMSO (1), cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhMe)] (2), cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhEt)] (3), and cis-[Pt(sac)(PPhEt)]·2DMSO (4), were synthesized and fully characterized; their structures were determined by X-ray crystallography.

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive  species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associatedwithPD pathogenesis and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

To investigate the potential removal of nitrate (NO) from surface and ground water sources, the spatial variations in dinitrogen (N) gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential (DNP), with amended NO and carbon (C) treatments, were investigated in the summer along a 95-km reach of the San Joaquin River. Excess N in hyporheic porewaters ranged from <0.1 to 8.65 mg L and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1.3 m (ground water source) versus 0.3 m (mixed surface and ground water) depths. In deep groundwater wells (3-7 m), median excess N concentration was 5.39 mg L (range = <0.1-14.6 mg L). Excess N concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved  and NO concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments. Hyporheic porewater NO concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0.01 mg L in only 20% of the hyporheic porewaters, in spite of high NO concentrations measured in both surface waters (mean = 2.25 mg N L) and surrounding groundwaters. Sediment DNP rates averaged 253 and 297 μg N kg hr for NO amended, and NO + C amended sediments, respectively, supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments. Our results indicate that the hyporheic/riparian zones act as an anoxic barrier to nitrate transport from regional groundwater and as a location to remove NO from surface waters exchanging with the hyporheic zone.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying traumatic brain injury is complicated and the protective role of HS is not yet fully known. Therefore, we combined the mechanical injury (scratch) with secondary injury including metabolic impairment (no glucose) together to investigate the underlying cellular mechanism of hydrogen sulfide in vitro models of traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we found that HS could prevent the scratch-induced decrease in the expression of cystathionine-β-synthetase, a key enzyme involved in the source of hydrogen sulfide, and endogenous hydrogen sulfide generation in PC12 cells. We also found that hydrogen sulfide could prevent scratch-induced cellular injury, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular accumulation of reactive  species and cell death (autophagic cell death and apoptosis) in PC12 cells. It was also found that blocking PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002, abolished the protection of HS against scratch-induced cellular reactive  species level and NRF2 accumulation and function in the nucleus. These results suggest that hydrogen sulfide protects against cell damage induced by scratch injury through modulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. This study raises the possibility that hydrogen sulfide may have therapeutic efficacy in traumatic brain injury.Copyright © 2019.

The incorporation of iron ions into the zeolite framework, which was achieved by solid state ion exchange, imparts catalytic properties to the microporous structures. The coreagent for Fenton oxidation, hydrogen peroxide, also works as the fuel to propel the motion of the Fe-zeolite micromotors. Asymmetrically deposited platinum layer on the Fe-zeolites catalyzes the fuel decomposition, generating  bubbles to propel the autonomous motion of the heterogeneous catalysts. The self-propelled motion together with the bubble formation leads to effective fluid mixing and consequent improvement in the degradation efficiency, making up the low diffusivity of heterogenous catalysts. The advantage of micromotor-based degradation strategy was verified by Fenton oxidation of phenol performed with a small percentage of Fe-zeolite micromotors. Able to be collected and reused, the Fe-zeolite micromotors avoid secondary contamination and wastage. Combing the advantages of both homogenous and heterogenous catalysts, the self-propelled Fe-zeolite micromotors provide a highly efficient and environmentally friendly strategy for degradation of organic contaminants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660812>Thiosemicarbazones as a Potent Anticancer Agents and Their Modes of Action.</a></h2><p>Thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) are a class of Schiff bases usually obtained by the condensation of thiosemicarbazide with a suitable aldehyde or ketone. TSCs have been focus of chemists and biologists due to their wide range of pharmacological effects. One of the promising areas in which these excellent metal chelators are being developed is their use against cancer. TSCs have a wide clinical antitumor spectrum with efficacy in various tumor types such as leukemia, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. To obtain better activity different series of TSCs have been developed by modifying the heteroaromatic system in their molecules. These compounds possessed significant antineoplastic activity when the carbonyl attachment of the side chain was located at a position α to the ring nitrogen atom, whereas attachment of the side chain β or γ to the heterocyclic N atom resulted in inactive antitumor agents. In addition, replacement of the heterocyclic ring N with C also resulted in a biologically inactive compound suggesting that a conjugated N,N,S-tridentate donor set is essential for the biological activities of thiosemicarbazones.

HAP supported cobalt-based catalyst (Co-HAP) was synthesized via a facile ion exchange-calcination method to reduce the Co leaching. The synthesized Co-HAP was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cobalt ions were incorporated into HAP structure and CoO on HAP surface. Co-HAP showed satisfactory performance in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation for eliminating Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution. Co-HAP even revealed a better activity than that of CoFeO. •OH, SO and O were all involved in RhB degradation and O played a leading role. High content of surface  groups could be found on Co-HAP after RhB degradation, which might be resulted from the high amounts of hydroxyl groups.

Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige fat biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6 N mice and in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6 N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige fat markers, a reduced rate of  consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige fat formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible fat-specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis. This offers a unique target for improving energy homeostasis and treating obesity.Copyright © 2019.
