However, the mechanism of dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, we examined mitochondrial function in the mechanistic study in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to establish the DIO model for GLP-1 reduction. The mice were then treated with berberine (BBR) (100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks to test the impact on GLP-1 expression. Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice. In the cellular model, an increase in ATP abundance, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevation of apoptosis were induced by PA. All of the alterations in DIO mice and the cellular model were attenuated by BBR.The mitochondrial stress responses were observed in the colon enterocytes of DIO mice for GLP-1 reduction. The stress was prevented by BBR in the restoration of GLP-1 expression, in which BBR may act through direct and indirect mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483636>Gut  and Metabolome Response of  Seed Oil on Metabolism Disorder Induced by Excess Alcohol Consumption.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the modulatory effects of  seed oil (DISO), which was rich in palmitoleic  (55.25%),  (12.25%), and oleic  (28.74%), on alcohol-induced metabolism disorder in mice. Fifty mice were orally administered with 38% alcohol (0.4 mL/day) and without or with DISO (3, 6, and 12 g/kg) for consecutive 12 weeks. DISO inhibited the alcohol-induced weight loss and liver function abnormality ( < 0.01) and shifted the profiles of cecal microbiome: elevating the abundance of , __004 ( < 0.05) and decreasing abundance of  ( < 0.05). This treatment also regulated metabolome response of amino  and lipid metabolism in cecal content: upregulating 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic  ( < 0.05), 6-hydroxynicotinic , 5-methoxytryptamine, nicotinamide, and nicotinic  ( < 0.1) and downregulating androsterone, tryptophan, and indole-3-acetamide ( < 0.05). DISO protected against alcoholic liver injury and gut  dysbiosis by enriching the relative abundance of , which was positively associated with the improvement of intestinal permeability and tryptophan metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065507>Fatty Acids Consumption: The Role Metabolic Aspects Involved in Obesity and Its Associated Disorders.</a></h2><p>Obesity and its associated disorders, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, metabolic inflammation, dysbiosis, and non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, are involved in several molecular and inflammatory mechanisms that alter the metabolism. Food habit changes, such as the quality of fatty acids in the diet, are proposed to treat and prevent these disorders. Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters. On the other hand, a high intake of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids may promote positive effects, especially on triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are effective at limiting the hepatic steatosis process through a series of biochemical events, such as reducing the markers of non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, increasing the gene expression of lipid metabolism, decreasing lipogenic activity, and releasing adiponectin. This current review shows that the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids, MUFA, and PUFA, and especially EPA and DHA, which can be applied as food supplements, may promote effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as on metabolic inflammation, gut , and hepatic metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133508>Vaginal lipidomics of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and cytolytic vaginosis: A non-targeted LC-MS pilot study.</a></h2><p>To characterize the lipid profile in vaginal discharge of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis, cytolytic vaginosis, or no vaginal infection or dysbiosis.Cross-sectional study.Genital Infections Ambulatory, Department of Tocogynecology, University of Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo-Brazil.Twenty-four women were included in this study: eight with vulvovaginal candidiasis, eight with cytolytic vaginosis and eight with no vaginal infections or dysbiosis (control group).The lipid profile in vaginal discharge of the different study groups was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and further analyzed with MetaboAnalyst 3.0 platform.Vaginal lipids concentration and its correlation with vulvovaginal candidiasis and cytolytic vaginosis.PCA, PLS-DA and hierarchical clustering analyses indicated 38 potential lipid biomarkers for the different groups, correlating with oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and integrity of the vaginal epithelial tissue. Among these, greater concentrations were found for Glycochenodeoxycholic -7-sulfate, O-adipoylcarnitine, 1-eicosyl-2-heptadecanoyl-glycero-3-phosphoserine, undecanoic , formyl dodecanoate and lipoic  in the vulvovaginal candidiasis group; N-(tetradecanoyl)-sphinganine, DL-PPMP, 1-oleoyl-cyclic phosphatidic,  and 5-aminopentanoic  in the cytolytic vaginosis group; and 1-nonadecanoyl-glycero-3-phosphate, eicosadienoic , 1-stearoyl-cyclic-phosphatidic , 1-(9Z,12Z-heptadecadienoyl)-glycero-3-phosphate, formyl 9Z-tetradecenoate and 7Z,10Z-hexadecadienoic  in the control group.Lipids related to oxidative stress and apoptosis were found in higher concentrations in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and cytolytic vaginosis, while lipids related to epithelial tissue integrity were more pronounced in the control group. Furthermore, in women with cytolytic vaginosis, we observed higher concentrations of lipids related to bacterial overgrowth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930468>Dynamic alterations in the gut  and metabolome during the development of methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>To investigate changes in gut  and metabolism during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development in mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet.Twenty-four male C57BL/6J mice were equally divided into four groups and fed a methionine-choline-sufficient diet for 2 wk (Control 2w group,  = 6) or 4 wk (Control 4w group,  = 6) or the MCD diet for 2 wk (MCD 2w group,  = 6) or 4 wk (MCD 4w group,  = 6). Liver injury, fibrosis, and intestinal barrier function were evaluated after 2 and 4 wk of feeding. The fecal microbiome and metabolome were studied using 16s rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.The mice fed the MCD diet presented with simple hepatic steatosis and slight intestinal barrier deterioration after 2 wk. After 4 wk of feeding with the MCD diet, however, the mice developed prominent NASH with liver fibrosis, and the intestinal barrier was more impaired. Compared with the control diet, the MCD diet induced gradual gut  dysbiosis, as evidenced by a marked decrease in the abundance of  and the ()  group ( < 0.001 and  < 0.05, respectively) and a significant increase in Ruminococcaceae UCG 014 abundance ( < 0.05) after 2 wk. At 4 wk, the MCD diet significantly reduced the promising probiotic  levels and markedly promoted  abundance ( < 0.05, and  < 0.01, respectively). The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially altered by the MCD diet: At 2 wk, arachidic , hexadecane, , and tetracosane were selected as potential biomarkers that were significantly different in the corresponding control group, and at 4 wk, cholic , cholesterol, arachidic , tetracosane, and stearic  were selected.The MCD diet induced persistent alterations in the gut  and metabolome.</p></html>
