The association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and hepatocyte  disorders prompted us to characterize ER stress-induced hepatic  dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hiPSC-Hep), to explore regulatory  and validate a phenotypic  model for progression of liver steatosis. We treated hiPSC-Hep with a ratio of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the presence of an inducer of ER stress to synergistically promote triglyceride accumulation and dysregulate lipid . We monitored lipid accumulation by high-content imaging and measured gene regulation by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses. Our results show that ER stress potentiated intracellular lipid accumulation by 5-fold in hiPSC-Hep in the absence of apoptosis. Transcriptome pathway analysis identified ER stress  as the most significantly dysregulated of all  affected. Obeticholic  dose dependently inhibited lipid accumulation and modulated gene expression downstream of the farnesoid X receptor. We were able to identify modulation of hepatic markers and gene  known to be involved in steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in support of a hiPSC-Hep disease model that is relevant to clinical data for human NASH. Our results show that the model can serve as a translational discovery platform for the understanding of molecular  involved in NAFLD, and can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic molecules based on high-throughput screening strategies.© 2018.

Here, we summarize the effect of obesity on NASH and how it has a cascading effect on cardiovascular dysfunction. We also review the current and emerging treatment options for NASH.The link between NASH and cardiac dysfunction has been further delineated in recent studies demonstrating endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and increased coronary artery calcification in patients with known NASH. Standard treatment of obesity with lifestyle interventions including diet, exercise, and behavioral modification has been shown to improve NASH as well as reduce cardiovascular dysfunction. In addition to FDA-approved drugs like vitamin E and pioglitazone, several agents including NGM282, obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential in NASH. Recent studies show that bariatric surgery results in significant improvement or resolution of NASH.Obesity is a major factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to steatohepatitis. Patients with NAFLD have a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. For biopsy-proven NASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone are the recommended medical treatments in addition to lifestyle modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221552>Steroids interfere with human carbonic anhydrase activity by using alternative binding mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Bile acids have been shown to inhibit human (h) carbonic anhydrases (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) along the gastrointestinal tract, including hCA II. The elucidation of the hormonal inhibition mechanism of the bile  cholate to hCA II was provided in 2014 by X-ray crystallography. Herein, we extend the inhibition study to a wealth of steroids against four relevant hCA isoforms. Steroids displaying pendants and functional groups of the carboxylate, phenolic or sulfonate types appended at the tetracyclic ring were shown to inhibit the cytosolic CA II and the tumor-associated, transmembrane CA IX in a medium micromolar range (38.9-89.9 µM). Docking studies displayed the different chemotypes CA inhibition mechanisms. Molecular dynamics (MD) gave insights on the stability over time of hyocholic  binding to CA II.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30542709>Apoptosis induced by ursodeoxycholic  in human melanoma cells through the mitochondrial pathway.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a type of hydrophilic bile  extracted from animal bile with a wide range of biological functions. The present results demonstrated that UDCA could effectively inhibit the proliferation of two human melanoma cell line (M14 and A375) with time‑ and concentration‑dependence. Following exposure to various concentrations of UDCA, M14 cells exhibited typical morphological changes and weaker ability of colony forming. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that UDCA could induce a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in M14 cells. The cell cycle was arrested in the G2/M phase, which was confirmed by the decrease of cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 and cyclinB1 at the protein level. However, when M14 cells were treated with UDCA and Z‑VAD‑FMK (caspase inhibitor) synchronously, the apoptosis rate of the cells was reduced significantly. In addition, it was demonstrated that UDCA induced apoptosis of human melanoma M14 cells through the ROS‑triggered mitochondrial‑associated pathway, which was indicated by the increased expression of cleaved‑caspase‑3, cleaved‑caspase‑9, apoptotic protease activating factor‑1, cleaved‑poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 and the elevation of B cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) associated X protein/Bcl‑2 ratio associated with apoptosis. Therefore, UDCA may be a potential drug for the treatment of human melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038332>Discovery of glycocholic  and taurochenodeoxycholic  as phenotypic biomarkers in cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Although several biomarkers can be used to distinguish cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) from healthy controls, differentiating the disease from benign biliary disease (BBD) or pancreatic cancer (PC) is a challenge. CCA biomarkers are associated with low specificity or have not been validated in relation to the biological effects of CCA. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed 15 biliary bile acids in CCA (n = 30), BBD (n = 57) and PC (n = 17) patients and discovered glycocholic  (GCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA) as specific CCA biomarkers. Firstly, we showed that the average concentration of total biliary bile acids in CCA patients was quantitatively less than in other patient groups. In addition, the average composition ratio of primary bile acids and conjugated bile acids in CCA patients was the highest in all patient groups. The average composition ratio of GCA (35.6%) in CCA patients was significantly higher than in other patient groups. Conversely, the average composition ratio of TCDCA (13.8%) in CCA patients was significantly lower in all patient groups. To verify the biological effects of GCA and TCDCA, we analyzed the gene expression of bile  receptors associated with the development of CCA in a CCA cell line. The gene expression of transmembrane G protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in CCA cells treated with GCA was 8.6-fold and 3.4-fold higher compared with control (untreated with bile acids), respectively. Gene expression of TGR5 and S1PR2 in TCDCA-treated cells was not significantly different from the control. Taken together, our study identified GCA and TCDCA as phenotype-specific biomarkers for CCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669332>Spirulina Liquid Extract Protects against Fibrosis Related to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Increases Ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by an excess of lipids and oxidative stress in the liver. Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract NASH development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid , and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic . Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced NASH that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891454>[Role of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis of trophoblasts in intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy].</a></h2><p>To investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced trophoblast apoptosis in the development of intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy (ICP).Twenty pregnant women with ICP and 20 normal pregnant women undergoing cesarean section were enrolled in this study. The number of placenta syncytial knots in these women was determined using HE staining. The mRNA expressions of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-3, and caspase-7 were detected using RT-PCR in the placental tissues of the women and also in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with different doses of  (DCA). Caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities were also detected in DCA-treated HTR-8/SVneo cells using commercial assay kits, and the presence of apoptotic bodies in the cells were detected with electron microscopy.Compared with normal placental tissues, the placenta from women with ICP showed significantly increased syncytial knots (P<0.01) and obviously enhanced mRNA expressions of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-3, and caspase-7 (P<0.05). In HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with different doses of DCA (0, 10, 50, and 100 µmol/L), the mRNA expressions of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-3 and caspase-7 were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05) and the protein levels of GRP78 and CHOP were also increased dose-dependently. Treatment with DCA at 50 µmol/L for 24 h significantly upregulated caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity in the cells (P<0.05), and the cells treated with 50 µmol/L DCA for 12 h showed the presence of apoptotic bodies.The activation of ERS and enhanced apoptosis of the trophoblasts occur in the placenta of women with ICP. DCA can significantly increase the expressions of ERS markers and thus lead to trophoblast apoptosis, suggesting that ERS-induced trophoblasts apoptosis may play a key role in the development of ICP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844268>Synthesis of 2-Deoxybrassinosteroids Analogs with 24-nor, 22()-23-Dihydroxy-Type Side Chains from Hyodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Natural brassinosteroids are widespread in the plant kingdom and it is known that they play an important role in regulating plant growth. In this study, two new brassinosteroid analogs with shorter side chains but keeping the diol function were synthesized. Thus, the synthesis of 2-deoxybrassinosteroids analogs of the 3α-hydroxy-24-nor, 22,23-dihydroxy-5α-cholestane side chain type is described. The starting material is a derivative from hyodeoxycholic  (), which was obtained with an overall yield of 59% following a previously reported five step route. The side chain of this intermediate was modified by oxidative decarboxylation to get a terminal olefin at the C22-C23 position (compound ) and subsequent dihydroxylation of the olefin. The resulting epimeric mixture of ,  was separated and the absolute configuration at the C22 carbon for the main product  was elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the benzoylated derivative . Finally, lactonization of  through a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of triacetylated derivative , using CF₃CO₃H/CHCl₃ as oxidant system, leads to lactones  and  in 35% and 14% yields, respectively. Deacetylation of these compounds leads to 2-deoxybrassinosteroids  and  in 86% and 81% yields.

Lipophilicity of enzyme was increased by hydrophobic ion pairing (HIP) with the anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium taurocholate (ST) and sodium deoxycholate (SDO) to facilitate its incorporation in SEDDS. Blank SEDDS and trypsin decorated SEDDS were characterized regarding droplet size, polydispersity index (PI), zeta potential and proteolytic activity using Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE) assay. Log D of each complex was determined to assess its affinity towards SEDDS oily droplet upon emulsification. Ability of trypsin decorated SEDDS to enhance mucus permeation was studied on mucus gel from porcine small intestine for the period of 4 h at 37 °C. Degree of enzyme precipitation via HIP was 94.5%, 85.7% and 48.2% for SDS, ST and SDO complex, respectively. SEDDS composed of 50% (w/w) cremophor EL, 20% (w/w) captex 300, and 30% (w/w) propylene glycol with a complex payload of 1% (w/w) exhibited a droplet size in the range of 29.92 ± 0.09 nm to 39.15 ± 0.37 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.116-0.265 and zeta potential in the range of -2.36 mv to -4.25 mv. The enzymatic activity of trypsin complexed with SDO, SDS and ST in SEDDS was 51.9%, 44.8%, and 40.7% respectively, of the corresponding activity of free trypsin. Log D values of trypsin, SDS, ST and SDO complex were -2.73, 1.97, 1.89 and 1.68, respectively, suggesting higher lipophilicity of trypsin complexes as compare to free trypsin and ability to reside on SEDDS droplets. Enzyme decorated SEDDS improved mucus permeation 1.6- to 2.6-fold in comparison to blank SEDDS. Results demonstrated that decorating SEDDS with trypsin can be a promising technique to improve their mucus permeating properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the combined effect of these drugs (UDCA + GC) is little understood.This meta-analysis specifically evaluated the effect of UDCA + GC after the Kasai procedure in patients with BA. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for all relevant articles in the electronic databases Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database on Disc (CBM-disc), and Vendor Information Pages (VIP).Eight studies with BA patients were finally included in our meta-analysis. The 8 identified studies consisted of 3 case-control, 3 cohort, and 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with overall 530 subjects (144, 152, and 234 subjects, respectively). Among them, 312 patients were treated with UDCA + GC, while 218 received placebo or other intervention. The meta-analysis indicated that groups that received UDCA + GC had significantly lower rates of postoperative jaundice relative to the controls (pooled, odds ratio [OR] = 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-4.04; Z = 3.34; P = .0008), while rates of cholangitis were similar (pooled, OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.43-1.74; Z = 0.40; P = .69).Combined UDCA and GC intervention was superior to that of the control in accelerating the clearance of serum bilirubin in patients with BA after the Kasai procedure.

Serum BAs were assayed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.At 24 weeks, HbA1c was significantly reduced in both groups, but the HbA1c levels were lower in the OW/OB than NW group. Moreover, significant decreases were seen at 24 weeks in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure in the OW/OB group. Interestingly, cholic , glycocholic , glycochenodeoxycholic , glycodeoxycholic  (GDCA), and glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) were increased in both groups after treatment, whereas chenodeoxycholic  and  (DCA) were specifically increased in the OW/OB group. Increased DCA and GDCA concentrations were significantly associated with decreased HbA1c or fasting blood glucose and CRP levels, whereas increased GDCA and GUDCA concentrations were associated with decreased waist circumference in the OW/OB group during treatment. In the NW group, increased GUDCA concentrations were significantly associated with a decrease in HbA1c.Type 2 diabetes patients with OW/OB exhibited greater improvement in glycemic control and additional  benefits after saxagliptin treatment. Saxagliptin significantly increased the BA pool, and DCA and GDCA were associated with  improvements in OW/OB T2D patients.© 2019 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036524>Phenotypic variability in Tunisian PFIC3 patients harboring a complex genotype with a differential clinical outcome of UDCA treatment.</a></h2><p>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a chronic autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical severity generally related to the degree of pathogenicity of the causal sequence variation in ABCB4 gene.The present study reports the molecular investigation by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of five related patients with PFIC3 disease followed by bioinformatic analysis.

Fifteen acetyl and ester derivatives, twelve of them new, were obtained through an enzymatic strategy in a fully regioselective way and in very good to excellent yield. In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of several parameters such as enzyme source, alcohol or acylating agent:substrate ratio, enzyme:substrate ratio, temperature and reaction solvent was considered. The excellent results obtained made this procedure very efficient, particularly considering the low amount of enzyme required. In addition, this methodology uses mild reaction conditions and has reduced environmental impact, making biocatalysis a suitable way to obtaining these bile acids derivatives.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We studied the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist, on the intestinal microbiomes of humans and mice.We performed a phase I study in 24 healthy volunteers given OCA (5, 10, or 25 mg/d for 17 days). Fecal and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (day 0) and on days 17 (end of dosing) and 37 (end of study). The fecal specimens were analyzed by shotgun meta-genomic sequencing. A Uniref90 high-stringency genomic analysis was used to assign specific genes to the taxonomic signature of bacteria whose abundance was associated with OCA. Male C57BL/6 mice were gavage fed daily with water, vehicle, or OCA (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Small intestine luminal contents were collected by flushing with saline and fecal pellets were collected at baseline and day 14. Mouse samples were analyzed by 16S-tagged sequencing. Culture experiments were performed to determine the taxonomic-specific effects of bile acids and OCA on bacterial growth.Suppression of endogenous bile  synthesis by OCA in subjects led to a reversible induction of gram-positive bacteria that are found in the small intestine and are components of the diet and oral microbiota. We found that bile acids decreased proliferation of these bacteria in minimum inhibitory concentration assays. In these organisms, there was an increase in the representation of microbial genomic  involved in DNA synthesis and amino   with OCA treatment of subjects. Consistent with these findings, mice fed OCA had lower endogenous bile  levels and an increased proportion of Firmicutes, specifically in the small intestine, compared with mice fed water or vehicle.In studying the effects of OCA in humans and mice, we found evidence for interactions between bile acids and features of the small intestinal microbiome. These findings indicate that farnesoid X receptor activation alters the intestinal microbiota and could provide opportunities for microbiome biomarker discovery or new approaches to engineering the human microbiome.

UDCA has been developed as the only accepted therapy by the US FDA for primary biliary cholangitis. Recently, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to obeticholic  (OCA), a semisynthetic bile  derivative from chenodeoxycholic , for primary biliary cholangitis. However, some perplexing toxicities of UDCA have been reported in the clinic. The present work aimed to investigate the difference between UDCA and OCA in regard to potential  activation through acyl glucuronidation and hepatic accumulation of consequent acyl glucuronides. Our results demonstrated that the  fates of UDCA and OCA were similar. Both UDCA and OCA were predominantly metabolically activated by conjugation to the acyl glucuronide in human liver microsomes. UGT1A3 played a predominant role in the carboxyl glucuronidation of both UDCA and OCA, while UGT2B7 played a major role in their hydroxyl glucuronidation. Further uptake studies revealed that OATP1B1- and 1B3-transfected cells could selectively uptake UDCA acyl glucuronide, but not UDCA, OCA, and OCA acyl glucuronide. In summary, the liver disposition of OCA is different from that of UDCA due to hepatic uptake, and liver accumulation of UDCA acyl glucuronide might be related to the perplexing toxicities of UDCA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examined whether manual acupuncture (MA) at particular acupoints represses  (DCA)-induced scratching behavior and microglial activation and compared these effects with those induced by another pruritogen, 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist). MA at Hegu (LI4) and Quchi (LI11) acupoints significantly attenuated DCA- and GNTI-induced scratching, whereas no such effects were observed at the bilateral Zusanli acupoints (ST36). Interestingly, GNTI-induced scratching was reduced similarly by both MA and electroacupuncture (EA) at the LI4 and LI11 acupoints. MA at non-acupoints did not affect scratching behavior. Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline (a microglial inhibitor) reduced GNTI- and DCA-induced scratching behavior. In Western blot analysis, subcutaneous DCA injection to the back of the neck increased spinal cord expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as compared with saline injection, while MA at LI4 and LI11 reduced these DCA-induced changes. Immunofluorescence confocal microcopy revealed that DCA-induced Iba1-positive cells with thicker processes emanated from the enlarged cell bodies, while this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with MA. It is concluded that microglia and TNF-α play important roles in the itching sensation and MA reduces DCA-induced scratching behavior by alleviating spinal microglial activation. MA may be an effective treatment for cholestatic pruritus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696534>Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Cadmium and Its Regulation on Nrf2 Signaling Pathway in Kidneys of Rats.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress on Nrf2 signaling pathway in the kidneys of rats.Rats were divided into twelve groups of six animals each. Some groups were pre-administered with bacitracin or tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and all of them were treated with 5-20 μmol/kg cadmium (Cd) for 48 h. The oxidative stress levels were analyzed using kits. The mRNA and protein expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related factors and Nrf2 signaling pathway-related factors were determined using RT-PCR and western blot.Cd exposure resulted in oxidative stress in the kidneys of rats and upregulated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors and Nrf2 signaling pathway-related factors, especially at doses of 10 and 20 μmol/kg Cd, and the expression changes were particularly obvious. Moreover, after pretreatment with bacitracin, Cd upregulated the expression of ERS-related factors to a certain extent and, at higher doses, increased the mRNA expression of Nrf2. After pretreatment with TUDCA, Cd reduced the level of ERS to a certain extent; however, at these doses, there were no significant changes in the expression of Nrf2.Cadmium can result in ERS and oxidative stress in the kidneys of rats, activate Nrf2, and upregulate the transcriptional expression of phase II detoxification enzymes under these experimental conditions. ERS has a positive regulation effect on Nrf2 signaling pathway but has little effect on the negative regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in cadmium toxicity.Copyright © 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

Gliclazide is a drug characterized by large inter-individual differences in therapeutic response; however, the causes of these differences are not fully explained and may be the outcome of microbial biotransformation. Recently, great attention has been paid to studies on bile  (BA) interactions with gut microflora and the role of BAs in the modification of drug transport through biological membranes.  Considering the assumption of gliclazide-probiotic-BAs interactions, the aim of the study was to investigate the transport and biotransformation of gliclazide in probiotic bacteria, as well as the effects of  (DCA) on gliclazide transport into bacterial cells.  Probiotics were incubated with gliclazide with or without DCA for 24 h at 37°C. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were determined at seven time points by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gliclazide biotransformation by the enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria was examined using appropriate software packages.  During the 24 h incubation with probiotic bacteria, significantly lower extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were observed at all time points compared to controls, while in the group with DCA, the decrease in concentration was noticed only at 24 h. The total concentration of gliclazide throughout the whole period was significantly lower compared to control. Proposed  of gliclazide biotransformation by probiotic bacteria involve reactions of hydrolysis and hydroxylation.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there are interactions of gliclazide-probiotics-DCA, at both the level of active and passive transport into the cells, and at the level of drug biotransformation by enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria. The effect of these interactions on the final therapeutic response of gliclazide should be further studied and confirmed in  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Ðanić, Stanimirov, Pavlović, Vukmirović, Lazić, Al-Salami and Mikov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628911>Association between the perturbation of bile  homeostasis and valproic -induced hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Valproic  (VPA), a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, is known to induce hepatotoxicity.

Based on these findings, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize bile  profiles and further determined the effects of VPA on the synthesis, transport, and regulation of bile acids in mice. The bile  metabolomic profiles of the livers of mice treated with VPA indicated an increase in most bile acids, especially chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (DCA), as well as unconjugated bile acids. The upregulation of genes related to bile  synthesis (CYP7A1and CYP8B1) and the downregulation of genes related to conjugation (BAAT and BACS) and regulation (FXR and SHP) were detected in the liver, suggesting that hydrophobic bile  production was increased and FXR signaling was impaired. Our results suggest that the perturbation of bile  homeostasis and impaired FXR signaling are involved in VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, providing a novel insight into VPA hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty three monoacetyl, diacetyl, and ester derivatives of , chenodeoxycholic, lithocholic, and cholic acids, 15 of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase-catalyzed acetylation, esterification, and alcoholysis reactions in very good to excellent yield and a highly regioselective way. Among them, acetylated ester products, in which the lipase catalyzed both reactions in one pot, were obtained. The influence of various reaction parameters in the enzymatic reactions, such as enzyme source, nucleophile/substrate ratio, enzyme/substrate ratio, solvent, and temperature, was studied. Some of the reported products are novel, and it is not possible to obtain them satisfactorily by following traditional synthetic procedures. Due to its singular structure containing three hydroxyl groups, cholic  showed a different behavior in the enzymatic reactions, from that observed for the other three bile acids studied. In order to shed light to different behaviors of bile acids in the enzymatic reactions, molecular modeling was applied to substrates and some derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703498>Safety investigation of Pulsatilla chinensis saponins from chronic metabonomic study of serum biomedical changes in oral treated rat.</a></h2><p>Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) which is widely used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, inflammatory, bacterial infections. In recent years, P chinensis has been reported to exhibit antitumor activities. However, the mechanisms underlying its toxic effects remain largely unresolved. This paper is designed to investigate the damage of long-term oral P. chinensis saponins (PRS) and to explore its potential damage mechanisms by serum metabonomics approach.The serum samples from control and PRS treated rats were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) in positive ionization mode and negative ionization mode. Liver function index of ALT, AST and ALP, blood biochemistry and biomarkers were examined to identify specific changes of injury. Acquired data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for differentiating the control and PRS treated groups. Then, serum  profiling was analyzed and pathway analysis performed on the biomarkers reversed after PRS treated and further integration of  .The results suggested that serum liver function indexes of ALT had significantly changed and stage increased. AST, ALP detection content show volatility changes. Changes in the 15 biomarkers found in the serum, such as acetaminophen glucuronide, 9 E, 11 E-linoleic , chenodeoxycholic , monoacylglycerides, sphingomyelin (SM), 7-ketodeoxycholic  and 12-keto-, which were closely related to changes in liver injury. It could be seen clearly that with the change of the dosing time, the biomarkers in the serum have undergone obvious, regular and progressive changes through the score plot and corresponding loading plot. The underlying regulations of PRS-perturbed   were discussed according to the identified metabolites.The present study proves the potential of UPLC-QTOF-MS based metabonomics in mapping  response. Long-term oral administration of P. chinensis saponins can cause chronic liver injury, and its safety needs further attention. It is of great significance in safeguarding human health to explore the damage mechanism of Pulsatilla chinensis saponins on liver by serum metabolomics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of UDCA-LPE on pro-fibrogenic integrin signalling. UDCA-LPE treatment of human embryonic liver cell line CL48 and primary human hepatic stellate cells induced a non-classical internalization of integrin β1 resulting in dephosphorylation and inhibition of SRC and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Signalling analyses suggested that UDCA-LPE may act as a heterobivalent ligand for integrins and lysophospholipid receptor1 (LPAR1) and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the bridging effect of UDCA-LPE on integrin β1 and LPAR1. The disruption of either the UDCA-moiety binding to integrins by RGD-containing peptide GRGDSP or the LPE-moiety binding to LPAR1 by LPAR1 antagonist Ki16425 reversed inhibitory functions of UDCA-LPE. The lack of inhibitory functions of UDCA-PE and UDCA-LPE derivatives (14:0 and 12:0, LPE-moiety containing shorter fatty  chain) as well as the consistency of the translocation of UDCA-LPE and integrins, which co-fractionated with LPE but not UDCA, suggested that the observed UDCA-LPE-induced translocation of integrins was mediated by LPE endocytic transport pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554587>[Up-regulation of circulating miR-29a in patients with acute pancreatitis and is positively correlated with disease severity and poor prognosis].</a></h2><p>Objective To investigate the clinical application value of circulating miR-29a in diagnosis and prognosis monitoring in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients, and to preliminary explore the molecular pathology significance of high expression of miR-29a. Methods 30 cases of mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) patients (MAP group) and 30 cases of moderately serve acute pancreatitis (MSAP) or serve acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients ( M-SAP group) were randomly selected, and 30 cases of healthy adults were used as control group. The general clinical data of each group were compared, and miR-29a levels in peripheral blood were measured by real tome quantitative PCR, then the correlation between miR-29a levels and Ranson score or APACHEIIscore were analyzed. The clinical usefulness of miR-29a for AP patients was assessed by ROC curve analysis. AR42J cells were treated with  (DCA) to establish AP cell model, the expression levels of miR-29a and caspase-3 were detected. AR42J cells were transfected by lentiviral vector contain miR-29a mimic or miR-29a AMO and measured of expression levels of miR-29a and caspase-3. Results In acute phase, the expression of circulating miR-20a was up-regulated in MAP and M-SAP group patients, and miR-20a levels of M-SAP group patients were higher than MAP group patients. In same group, miR-20a levels in acute phase were higher than recovery phase. Correlation analysis indicated the positive correlation between miR-20a levels and Ranson score or APACHEII score. ROC curve analysis indicated that the AUC of miR-29a for diagnosis MAP patients was 0.961 ( 95%CI: 0.921~ 1.002), cut-off value was 1.460. The AUC of miR-29a for diagnosis M-SAP patients was 0.972 ( 95%CI: 0.939 ~ 1.004), cut-off value was 1.340. The expression levels of miR-29a and caspase 3 were increased in AP cell model. Moreover, caspase 3 levels in AP cell model were increased than vector control after overexpression of miR-29a, and caspase-3 levels were reduced than vector control after suppressing of miR-29a expression. Conclusion Circulating miR-29a is high expression in MAP and M-SAP patients, and high expression of miR-29a may relate to pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis, and this biomarkers has high clinical value in AP diagnosis and prognosis monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147381>Donor  characteristics drive effects of faecal microbiota transplantation on recipient insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and intestinal transit time.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery improves glucose . Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose  and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose , intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In the present study, primary and secondary BAs including their glycine and taurine-conjugated forms were quantified in serum of Apoe-/- mice by protein precipitation followed by reversed phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and QTOF mass spectrometry. The mice were fed different lingonberry fractions (whole, insoluble and soluble) in a high-fat setting or cellulose in a high and low-fat setting. Serum concentrations of BAs in mice fed cellulose were higher with the high-fat diet compared to the low-fat diet (20-70%). Among the lingonberry diets, the diet containing whole lingonberries had the highest concentration of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), tauro-ursodeoxycholic  (T-UDCA), α and ω-muricholic acids (MCA) and tauro-α-MCA (T-α-MCA), and the lowest concentration of tauro-cholic  (T-CA),  (DCA) and tauro- (T-DCA).

Although, FXR is expressed in male reproductive tissue, the relevance of the receptor on reproduction is scarcely known. Here, we demonstrated the FXR presence and its action on several human sperm features. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays evidenced the FXR expression in human spermatozoa and the localisation in the middle piece. CDCA increasing concentrations and GW4064, synthetic ligand of FXR, were used to study the FXR influence on sperm motility, survival, capacitation, acrosome reaction and on glucose as well as lipid . Interestingly, our data showed that increasing concentrations of CDCA negatively affected sperm parameters, while the receptor blockage by (Z)-Guggulsterone and by the anti-FXR Ab reversed the effects. Intriguingly, elevated CDCA levels increased triglyceride content, while lipase and G6PDH activities were reduced with respect to untreated samples, thus impeding the  reprogramming typical of the capacitated sperm. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated for the first time a novel target for FXR and that the activated receptor alters the acquisition of sperm fertilising ability. We showed that sperm itself express the FXR and it is responsive to specific ligands of the receptor; therefore, bile acids influence this cell both in male and in female genital tracts. It might be hypothesized that bile  levels could be involved in infertility with idiopathic origin as these compounds are not systematically measured in men undergoing medically assisted procreation.© 2018 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881241>Obeticholic  for severe bile  diarrhea with intestinal failure: A case report and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>Bile  diarrhea results from excessive amounts of bile acids entering the colon due to hepatic overexcretion of bile acids or bile  malabsorption in the terminal ileum. The main therapies include bile  sequestrants, such as colestyramine and colesevelam, which may be given in combination with the opioid receptor agonist loperamide. Some patients are refractory to conventional treatments. We report the use of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  in a patient with refractory bile  diarrhea and subsequent intestinal failure. A 32-year-old woman with quiescent colonic Crohn's disease and a normal terminal ileum had been diagnosed with severe bile  malabsorption and complained of watery diarrhea and fatigue. The diarrhea resulted in hypokalemia and sodium depletion that made her dependent on twice weekly intravenous fluid and electrolyte infusions. Conventional therapies with colestyramine, colesevelam, and loperamide had no effect. Second-line antisecretory therapies with pantoprazole, liraglutide, and octreotide also failed. Third-line treatment with obeticholic  reduced the number of stools from an average of 13 to an average of 7 per 24 h and improved the patient's quality of life. The fluid and electrolyte balances normalized. The effect was sustained during follow-up for 6 mo with treatment at a daily dosage of 25 mg. The diarrhea worsened shortly after cessation of obeticholic . This case report supports the initial report that obeticholic  may reduce bile  production and improve symptoms in patients with bile  diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30517939>Tauroursodeoxycholic  Ameliorates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Depression Like Behavior in Mice via the Inhibition of Neuroinflammation and Oxido-Nitrosative Stress.</a></h2><p>Depression is a mental disease that causes severe economic and social burdens. The mechanism for the onset of depression remains largely unknown. Recently, more and more attention is being given to the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in depression. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a clinically available agent used to treat cholesterol gallstone and protect neurons against neurodegeneration, has been reported to prevent neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of TUDCA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative stress in mice. Results showed that TUDCA pretreatment (once daily for 7 consecutive days) at the dosage of 200 and 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, markedly attenuated LPS (0.83 mg/kg)-induced behavioral abnormalities in the tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test. Further analysis showed that the TUDCA pretreatment (200, 400 mg/kg) not only inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS stimulation, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, but attenuated LPS-triggered oxido-nitrosative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results provide evidence to show that the TUDCA could be a potential antidepressant, and its antidepressive mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response and oxido-nitrosative stress in the brain.© 2018 S.

Therefore, we tried to establish a multifactorial approach for reliable aortic wall decellularization.Porcine aortic walls were decellularized according to different procedures. Decellularization was performed for 24 (G1), 48 (G2), and 72 h (G3) with a solution of 0.5% desoxycholate and 0.5% dodecyl sulfate. The procedure was characterized using intermittent washing steps, the inclusion of sonication as well as DNase and α-galactosidase treatment. The decellularization efficiency was measured by the evaluation of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and hematoxylin and eosin staining and quantitative DNA assays. Pentachrome and picrosirius red staining, scanning electron microscopy as well as glycosaminoglycan assays were performed to evaluate the effect of the procedure on the extracellular matrix.4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a large amount of remaining nuclei in all groups. However, consecutive DNase treatment had a significant effect. While the remaining DNA was detected in some samples of G1 and G2, samples of G3 were fully decellularized. Glycosaminoglycan content was significantly reduced to 50% after 24 h (G1) but remained constant for G2 and G3. Picrosirius red staining revealed an intact and stable collagen network without any visible defects. Pentachrome staining substantiated these results. Nonetheless, the fiber network remains intact, which could be confirmed by reflection electron microscopy analysis.In this study, we developed a procedure that grants successful decellularization of porcine aortic wall while maintaining the fibrous microstructure. We highlighted the significant effect of DNase and α-galactosidase treatment.

High-fat diet-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota and bile  dysregulation may be involved in the pathology of steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenolic catechin in green tea, has been widely investigated for its inhibitory or preventive effects against fatty liver. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of EGCG on the abundance of gut microbiota and the composition of serum bile acids in high-fat diet-fed mice and determine the specific bacterial genera that can improve the serum bile  dysregulation associated with EGCG anti-hepatic steatosis action. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed with the control diet, high-fat diet, or high-fat diet + EGCG at a concentration of 0.32% for 8 weeks. EGCG significantly inhibited the increases in weight, the area of fatty lesions, and the triglyceride content in the liver induced by the high-fat diet. Principal coordinate analysis revealed significant differences in microbial structure among the groups. At the genus level, EGCG induced changes in the microbiota composition in high-fat diet-fed mice, showing a significantly higher abundance of , ,  and a significantly lower abundance of . EGCG significantly reversed the decreased population of serum primary cholic  and β-muricholic  as well as the increased population of taurine-conjugated cholic , β-muricholic  and  in high-fat diet-fed mice. Finally, the correlation analysis between bile  profiles and gut microbiota demonstrated the contribution of  and  in the improvement of bile  dysregulation in high-fat diet-fed mice by treatment with EGCG.

Therefore, inhibiting these enzymes offer the potential to block production of more inflammatory substances and decrease the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate some potent, bioavailable and selective inhibitors of some catalytic proteins implicated to  syndrome and their antioxidant effects from various solvent extracts of R. frangula leaves. The anti-inflammatory, obesity, diabete and XO potentials were evaluated through analyses of inhibition activities of corresponding metabolites.The water extract exhibited an important inhibitory effect on human, dromedary and stingray sPLA2-G IIA achieved an IC50 of 0.16±0.06, 0.19±0.05 and 0.07±0.01 mg/mL, respectively. Likewise, the same fraction demonstrated the highest pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity using two different substrates. Indeed, 50% of dromedary pancreatic lipase inhibition was demonstrated for 5 min and 15 min using olive oil and TC4 substrates, respectively. Besides, it was established that methanolic extract had more effective inhibitory lipase activity than ORLISTAT used as a specific inhibitor of gastric, pancreatic and carboxyl ester lipase for treating obesity, with an IC50 of 5.51±0.27 and 91.46±2.3 µg/mL, respectively.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a principal cell organelle involved in proteosynthesis, but also integrating various stress signals. ER stress evokes a conserved signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to cell death or adaptation to stress conditions. In this work, we document that mouse OSE suffers from ER stress during replicative senescence in vitro, develops abnormalities in ER and initiates UPR. Attenuation of ER stress in senescent OSE by tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) reconditions ER architecture and leads to delayed onset of senescence. In summary, we show for the first time a mutual molecular link between ER stress response and replicative senescence leading to phenotypic changes of non-malignant ovarian surface epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802399>Obeticholic  protects against hepatocyte death and liver fibrosis in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has suggested that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, such as obeticholic  (OCA) are therapeutically useful for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, it is still unclear how FXR agonists protect against NASH and which cell type is the main target of FXR agonists. In this study, we examined the effects of OCA on the development of NASH using melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice that progressively developed hepatic steatosis and NASH on Western diet (WD). Treatment with OCA effectively prevented chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice with only marginal effect on body weight and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) is a unique histological structure characteristic of NASH, which triggers hepatocyte death-induced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, treatment with OCA markedly reduced hCLS formation even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH, thereby inhibiting the progression of liver fibrosis. As its mechanism of action, OCA suppressed  stress-induced p53 activation and cell death in hepatocytes. Our findings in this study highlight the role of FXR in hepatocytes in the pathogenesis of NASH. Collectively, this study demonstrates the anti-fibrotic effect of OCA in a murine model of NASH with obesity and insulin resistance, which suggests the clinical implication for human NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896855>Activation of FXR by obeticholic  induces hepatic gene expression of SR-BI through a novel mechanism of transcriptional synergy with the nuclear receptor LXR.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is known to regulate the gene expression of SR‑BI, which mediates plasma high‑density lipoprotein (HDL)‑cholesterol uptake. Our previous study demonstrated that the activation of FXR by obeticholic  (OCA) lowered plasma HDL‑cholesterol levels and increased the hepatic mRNA and protein expression levels of SR‑BI in hypercholesterolemic hamsters, but not in normolipidemic hamsters, suggesting that dietary cholesterol may be involved in the OCA‑induced transcription of SR‑BI. In the present study, a functional 90‑base‑pair regulatory region was identified in the first intron of the SR‑BI gene of hamster and mouse that contains a FXR response element (IR‑1) and an adjacent liver X receptor (LXR) response element (LXRE). By in vitro DNA binding and luciferase reporter gene assays, it was demonstrated that FXR and LXR bind to their recognition sequences within this intronic region and transactivate the SR‑BI reporter gene in a synergistic manner. It was also shown that mutations at either the IR‑1 site or the LXRE site eliminated OCA‑mediated gene transcription. Utilizing chow‑fed hamsters as an in vivo model, it was demonstrated that treating normolipidemic hamsters with OCA or GW3965 alone did not effectively induce levels of SR‑BI, whereas their combined treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of SR‑BI in the liver. The study further investigated effects of FXR and LXR coactivation on the gene expression of SR‑BI in human liver cells. The intronic FXRE and LXRE regulatory region was not conserved in the human SR‑BI genomic sequence, however, higher mRNA expression levels of SR‑BI were observed in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells exposed to combined treatments of FXR and LXR agonists, compared with those in cells exposed to individual ligand treatment. Therefore, these results suggest that human SR‑BI gene transcription may also be subject to concerted activation by FXR and LXR, mediated via currently unidentified regulatory sequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30232879>Cross-Species Molecular Imaging of Bile Salts and Lipids in Liver: Identification of Molecular Structural Markers in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>The liver is the primary organ involved in handling of bile salts, a class of amphipathic molecules with signaling activities as well as desired and detrimental detergent actions. To allow in-depth investigation of functions of bile salts in healthy and diseased liver, the spatial distribution of bile salt species within the liver needs to be studied. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine hepatic bile salt distribution and identify specific lipid markers that define the structural elements of the liver. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to monitor the spatial distribution of bile salts and lipids in liver sections of rat, dog, and patients with unaffected and cholestatic parenchyma. MALDI-MSI in negative ion mode showed the local presence of a variety of bile salts, predominantly taurine-conjugates, as localized patches of varying sizes (representing the bile ducts) throughout the liver tissue. Specific molecular markers were identified for the connective tissue (phosphatidic acids, e.g., [PA (18:0_18:1)-H]), the liver parenchyma (phosphatidylinositols, e.g., [PI (18:0_20:4)-H]), and the bile ducts (hydroxylated-sulfatides, e.g., [ST-OH (18:1_24:0)-H]). One of these sulfatides (at m/ z 906.6339) was found to be uniquely localized in a thin lining on the inside of the bile duct, colocalized with cytokeratins, and encased luminal bile salts. A similar distribution of the aforementioned sulfatide was observed, albeit in constricted ductular structures, in the liver of a patient with a mild clinical phenotype of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In contrast, sulfatides were virtually absent in the liver of patients with PSC and a severe clinical phenotype, with (atypical) cholanoids (e.g., the bile alcohol 5-cyprinolsulfate) abundant in the extra-ductular space and glyco(cheno)-3-sulfate localized to fibrotic connective tissue. The latter two molecular species were able to discriminate between healthy liver tissue ( n = 3) and tissue from PSC patients with a severe clinical phenotype ( n = 3). In conclusion, the distinct structural elements of the mammalian liver are characterized by specific classes of lipids. We propose that (hydroxylated-)sulfatides are specific molecular markers of the bile duct.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29894700>Neuronal loss in anterior cingulate cortex in spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30143751>Ursodeoxycholate inhibits mast cell activation and reverses biliary injury and fibrosis in Mdr2 mice and human primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is used to treat biliary disorders; and, bile acids alter mast cell (MC) histamine release. MCs infiltrate Mdr2 mice liver (model of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)). MC-derived histamine increases inflammation, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and fibrosis. The objective was to determine the effects of UDCA treatment on MC infiltration, biliary damage, inflammation and fibrosis in Mdr2 mice and human PSC. Wild-type and Mdr2 mice were fed bile  control diet or UDCA (0.5% wt/wt). Human samples were collected from control and PSC patients treated with placebo or UDCA (15 mg/kg/BW). MC infiltration was measured by immunhistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for c-Kit, chymase, and tryptase. The HDC/histamine/histamine receptor (HR)-axis was evaluated by EIA and qPCR. Intrahepatic bile duct mass (IBDM) and biliary proliferation was evaluated by CK-19 and Ki-67 staining. Fibrosis was detected by immunostaining and qPCR for fibrotic markers. Inflammatory components were measured by qPCR. HSC activation was measured by SYP-9 staining. Inflammation was detected by qPCR for CD68. In vitro, MCs were treated with UDCA (40 μM) prior to HA secretion evaluation and coculturing with cholangiocytes or HSCs. BrDU incorporation and fibrosis by qPCR was performed. UDCA reduced MC number, the HDC/histamine/HR-axis, IBDM, HSC activation, inflammation, and fibrosis in Mdr2 mice and PSC patients. In vitro, UDCA decreases MC-histamine release, which was restored by blocking ASBT and FXRβ. Proliferation and fibrosis decreased after treatment with UDCA-treated MCs. We conclude that UDCA acts on MCs reducing histamine levels and decreases the inflammatory/hyperplastic/fibrotic reaction seen in PSC. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is used to treat biliary disorders; and, bile acids alter mast cell (MC) histamine release. Following liver injury like primary sclerosing cholangitis in mice and humans, MCs infiltrate. MC-derived histamine increases biliary damage, fibrosis, and inflammation. UDCA treatment decreases these parameters via reduced MC activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279688>Taurodeoxycholate Increases the Number of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells That Ameliorate Sepsis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) control  and inflammation by interacting with several receptors. Here, we report that intravenous infusion of taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) decreases serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalizes hypotension, protects against renal injury, and prolongs mouse survival during sepsis. TDCA increases the number of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) distinctive from MDSCs obtained without TDCA treatment (MDSC) in the spleen of septic mice. FACS-sorted MDSC cells suppress T-cell proliferation and confer protection against sepsis when adoptively transferred better than MDSC. Proteogenomic analysis indicated that TDCA controls chromatin silencing, alternative splicing, and translation of the immune proteome of MDSC, which increases the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules such as oncostatin, lactoferrin and CD244. TDCA also decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as neutrophil elastase. These findings suggest that TDCA globally edits the proteome to increase the number of MDSC cells and affect their immune-regulatory functions to resolve systemic inflammation during sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic , endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948912>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates hepatic lipid  in LO2 cells by regulating the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease, can progress into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid . UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid .To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an oleic  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941869>Magnesium lithospermate B improves the gut microbiome and bile   profiles in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is a new drug marketed in China to treat angina, but its low oral bioavailability limits its clinical application to the intravenous route. Paradoxically, orally administered low-dose MLB was found to alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In recent years, the kidney-gut axis has been suspected to be involved in kidney damage pathogenesis, potentially representing a non-classical pathway for pharmacologic intervention. To ascertain whether MLB targets the kidney-gut axis, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were prepared as a mouse model of DN. The STZ mice were treated with MLB (50 mg kg d, p.o.) for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour urinary albumin was detected to mirror kidney function. At week 4, 6, 8, feces were collected; bile acids (BAs) were quantified to examine the alterations in the BA  profiles, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced to identify alterations in gut microbial composition. In STZ mice, 24-h urinary albumin levels and total fecal BAs, especially cholic acids (CAs) and  acids (DCAs) were greatly increased, and the gut microbiome was dramatically shifted compared with control mice. Oral administration of MLB significantly decreased 24-h urinary albumin levels and total BAs, CAs and DCAs, and reversed CA:TCA (taurocholic ) and DCA:CA ratios. It also changed the microbiome composition in STZ mice based on operational units. Thus the therapeutic effect of MLB on kidney injury might be attributed (at least partially) to its ability to modulate the disordered gut microbiome and BA .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267167>Chenodeoxycholic : An Update on Its Therapeutic Applications.</a></h2><p>Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic , is a primary bile  generated in the liver from cholesterol. In liver cells CDCA is conjugated with glycine or taurine to form two bile salts, Glyco-CDCA and Tauro-CDCA, before being released into the bile ducts. In the intestine, CDCA is further metabolized to generate a 7β epimer, i.e., the ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), or dehydroxylate to generate lithocolic  (LCA). In humans, CDCA is the physiological ligand for the bile  sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR), while LCA is a potent agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor, known as GPBAR1 (TGR5). Along with UDCA, CDCA has been clinically used for the dissolution of gallbladder stones at doses ranging from 375 to 750 mg/day, with a success rate of 8 to 18%. Because the efficacy of CDCA was significantly lower than that of UDCA and 18-30% of patients developed significant side effects, the most frequent being diarrhea and a reversible increase in aminotransferases plasma levels, this application has lost its therapeutic relevance. Additionally, the combination of CDCA with UDCA, generally at doses of 5-10 mg/kg each, has failed to provide significant advantages over UDCA alone. In 2017, CDCA has been approved as an orphan indication for the treatment of patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) gene. Since CYP27A1 is essential for cholesterol breakdown, CTX patients develop abnormal lipid storage with increased plasma and tissue levels of cholestanol and very low/absent production of CDCA. CDCA is a potent inhibitor of CYP27A1, and early initiation of CDCA therapy, at doses up to 750 mg/day, is considered the standard medical therapy for CTX resulting in decreased plasma levels of cholestanol and stabilization of neurologic symptoms. Studies in CTX patients have also shown that CDCA might suppress the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase in the liver. Furthermore, CDCA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in diabetic patients, likely by activating GPBAR1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31255699>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and their interaction with physiological compounds.</a></h2><p>Organic anion transporters (OATs) are membrane proteins within the Solute carrier family 22 (SLC22). They play important roles in cellular uptake of various organic compounds, and due to their expression in barrier tissues of major excretory and non-excretory organs are considered as crucial elements in absorption and distribution of a wide range of endobiotic and xenobiotic compounds. Based on our previous work and initial insights on SLC22 members in zebrafish (Danio rerio), in this study we aimed at in vitro characterization of Oat1 and Oat3 transporters and understanding of their interaction with potential physiological substrates. We first performed synteny analysis to describe in more detail orthological relationship of zebrafish oat1 and oat3 genes. We then developed stable cell lines overexpressing Oat1 and Oat3, and identified Lucifer yellow as Oat1 model fluorescent substrate (Km = 11.4 μM) and 6-carboxyfluorescein as Oat3 model substrate (Km = 5.8 μM). Initial identification performed using the developed assays revealed Kreb's cycle intermediates, bilirubin, bile salts and steroid hormones as the most potent of Oat1 and Oat3 interactors, with IC50 values in micromolar range. Finally, we showed that bilirubin, , α-ketoglutarate, pregnenolone, estrone-3-sulfate and corticosterone are in vitro substrates of zebrafish Oat1, and bilirubin and  are Oat3 substrates. In conclusion, using the approach described, structural and functional similarities of both transporters to human and mammalian orthologs are revealed, their broad ligand selectivity confirmed, potent interactors among endobiotic compounds identified, and first indications of their potential physiological role(s) in zebrafish obtained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the  benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the  benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various  endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve  dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078101>Reno-protective effects of ursodeoxycholic  against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity through modulation of NF-κB, eNOS and caspase-3 expressions.</a></h2><p>Gentamicin (GNT) is a potent aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. We aim to investigate the potential protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) against GNT-induced nephrotoxicity. In this study, 24 male Wistar rats were used and randomly divided into four groups of six animals each. Control group received 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose orally for 15 days, GNT group received GNT 100 mg/kg/day i.p. for 8 days, UDCA group received UDCA orally for 15 consecutive days at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose and UDCA-pretreated group received UDCA orally for 7 days then co-administered with GNT i.p. for 8 days at the same fore-mentioned doses. Serum levels of kidney function parameters (urea, creatinine, uric  and albumin) were measured. Renal tissues were used to evaluate oxidative stress markers; malonaldehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and the anti-oxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and caspase-3 and histological and ultrastructural examination were performed. Treatment with GNT increased the serum levels of renal function parameters and renal MDA, NF-κB and KIM-1 mRNA levels, while it decreased GSH and SOD activities. Marked immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 was observed after GNT administration while it decreased eNOS expression. Histological and ultrastructural alterations were also evident in renal corpuscles and tubules. In contrast, pretreatment with UDCA reversed changes caused by GNT administration. These results suggest that UDCA ameliorates GNT-induced kidney injury via inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567573>Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-induced atherosclerosis is associated with bile  .</a></h2><p>Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) plasma levels have been proved to be associated with atherosclerosis development. Among the targets aimed to ameliorating atherosclerotic lesions, inducing bile  synthesis to eliminate excess cholesterol in body is an effective way. Individual bile  as endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor has differential effects on regulating bile  . It is unclear whether bile  profiles are mechanistically linked to TMAO-induced development of atherosclerosis.Male apoE mice were fed with control diet containing 0.3% TMAO for 8 weeks. Aortic lesion development and serum lipid profiles were determined. Bile  profiles in bile, liver and serum were measured by liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). Real-time PCRs were performed to analyze mRNA expression of genes related to hepatic bile  .The total plaque areas in the aortas strongly increased 2-fold (P < 0.001) in TMAO administration mice. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in TMAO group were also significantly increased by 25.5% (P = 0.044), 31.2% (P = 0.006), 28.3% (P = 0.032), respectively. TMAO notably changed bile  profiles, especially in serum, the most prominent inductions were tauromuricholic  (TMCA),  (DCA) and cholic  (CA). Mechanically, TMAO inhibited hepatic bile  synthesis by specifically repressing the classical bile  synthesis pathway, which might be mediated by activation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).These findings suggested that TMAO accelerated aortic lesion formation in apoE mice by altering bile  profiles, further activating nuclear receptor FXR and SHP to inhibit bile  synthesis by reducing Cyp7a1 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29897551>Aflatoxin B1 Disrupts Gut-Microbial Metabolisms of Short-Chain Fatty Acids, Long-Chain Fatty Acids, and Bile Acids in Male F344 Rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, male F344 rats were orally exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) at 0, 5, 25, and 75 μg/kg for 4 weeks. Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut-microbiota-dependent metabolites. Gut-microbiota-related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control, oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 (25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic  (2.18-fold), linoleic  (cis-9, cis-12-18:2) (11.3-fold), pentadecanoic  (15: 0) (3.68-fold), pyruvic  (4.56-fold), and 3-phenyllactic  (3.74-fold), but  level was reduced by 41% in the low-dose group (5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut-microbiota  , including the synthesis of SCFAs, pyruvic  related , metabolisms of amino acids, bile acids and long-chain fatty acids, which may further affect host digestive efficiency, energy supply, intestinal immunity, production of neurotransmitters, and enterohepatic cross-talk.

Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is known to have cardiovascular protective effects by decreasing ER stress. This study aimed to assess the ability of TUDCA to decrease ER stress, inhibit dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and reduce in-stent restenosis.The effect of TUDCA on dedifferentiation of VSMCs and ER stress was investigated in vitro using wound-healing assays, MTT assays, and western blotting. For in vivo studies, 18 rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet to induce atheroma formation. Bare metal stents (BMS), BMS+TUDCA or Firebird stents were implanted in the left common carotid artery. Rabbits were euthanized after 28 days and processed for scanning electron microscope (SEM), histological examination (HE), and immunohistochemistry.In vitro TUDCA (10-1000 μmol/L) treatment significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferation and migration in VSMCs in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased ER stress markers (IRE1, XBP1, KLF4, and GRP78). In vivo, we confirmed no significant difference in neointimal coverage on three stents surfaces; neointimal was significantly lower with BMS+TUDCA (1.6 ± 0.2 mm) compared with Firebird (1.90 ± 0.1 mm) and BMS (2.3 ± 0.1 mm). Percent stenosis was lowest for BMS+TUDCA, then Firebird, and was significantly higher with BMS (28 ± 4%, 35 ± 7%, 40 ± 1%; respectively; P < 0.001). TUDCA treatment decreased ER stress in the BMS+TUDCA group compared with BMS.TUDCA inhibited dedifferentiation of VSMCs by decreasing ER stress and reduced in-stent restenosis, possibly through downregulation of the IRE1/XBP1 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954082>Impact of ursodeoxycholic  on circulating lipid concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.</a></h2><p>The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials was to examine whether ursodeoxycholic  treatment is an effective lipid-lowering agent.PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched in order to find randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of ursodeoxycholic  on lipid profile. A random-effect model and the generic inverse variance weighting method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A random-effects meta-regression model was performed to explore the association between potential confounders and the estimated effect size on plasma lipid concentrations.Meta-analysis of 20 treatment arms revealed a significant reduction of total cholesterol following ursodeoxycholic  treatment (WMD: - 13.85 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.45, - 6.25, p < 0.001). Nonetheless, LDL-C (WMD: -6.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -13.99, 0.67, p = 0.075), triglycerides (WMD: - 1.42 mg/dL, 95% CI: -7.51, 4.67, p = 0.648) and HDL-C (WMD: -0.18 mg/dL, 95% CI: -5.23, 4.87, p = 0.944) were not found to be significantly altered by ursodeoxycholic  administration. In the subgroup of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, ursodeoxycholic  reduced total cholesterol (WMD: - 29.86 mg/dL, 95% CI: -47.39, - 12.33, p = 0.001) and LDL-C (WMD: -37.27 mg/dL, 95% CI: -54.16, - 20.38, p < 0.001) concentrations without affecting TG and HDL-C.This meta-analysis suggests that ursodeoxycholic  therapy might be associated with significant total cholesterol lowering particularly in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025704>Inhibiting Growth of Clostridioides difficile by Restoring Valerate, Produced by the Intestinal Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but there are concerns about its long-term safety. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of FMT could help us design safer, targeted therapies. We aimed to identify microbial metabolites that are important for C difficile growth.We used a CDI chemostat model as a tool to study the effects of FMT in vitro. The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile  profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh fecal samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = 5) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and  concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic , and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile acids and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile acids were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic  was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT. Valerate is a target for a rationally designed recurrent CDI therapy.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to establish a score model that can be used for predicting the biochemical response.A total of 218 patients in the derivation group and 66 patients in the verification group were enrolled. Response endpoints were based on the Barcelona criteria combined with the Paris I criteria. We determined independent factors of the biochemical response by univariate and multivariate analyses. Then, we established a predictive score model on the basis of regression coefficients after adjusted multivariate analyses.The median follow-up duration in the derivation and the verification group was 12.9 and 12.2 months, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex and age indicated that First-UDCA treatment [odds ratio (OR)=2.543, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.234-5.240, P=0.011], baseline alanine aminotransferase level (OR=1.265, 95% CI: 1.089-1.471, P=0.002), and baseline total bilirubin level (OR=0.571, 95% CI: 0.420-0.776, P<0.001) were independent factors that influenced the biochemical response in PBC patients after 1 year of UDCA treatment. Therefore, the resulting biochemical response prediction score model represented the sum of the points corresponding to these three variables.

Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol  and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic  [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, , and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of :CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and vitamin E against liver dysfunction using metabolomics and metagenomic analysis. In this study, we analysed blood and urine samples from patients with obesity and liver dysfunction. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (300 mg twice daily), and 10 subjects received vitamin E (400 IU twice daily) for 8 weeks. UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic  and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric , p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway. Furthermore, microbiome involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles. Meanwhile, vitamin E treatment did not result in such alterations, except that it reduced uremic toxins and liver dysfunction. Our findings suggested that both treatments were effective in improving liver function, albeit via different mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224065>ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress and aggravates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes, and the dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in its pathogenesis. ERp44, an ER resident chaperone protein, has been implicated in the modulation of ER stress, however, its role and mechanism in DN are not determined. Here, we show that ERp44 expression is upregulated in the glomeruli of db/db mice, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes. When ERp44 is depleted by in vivo shRNA-mediated knockdown, the features associated with DN including albuminuria level and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness are aggravated, therefore suggesting a detrimental role of ERp44 depletion in DN progression. We further show that ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress in DN in db/db mice, and that attenuating ER stress with the chemical chaperone TUDCA remarkably diminishes the aggravated DN features caused by ERp44 depletion. These results suggest that the exacerbated ER stress is a critical factor for the detrimental effect of ERp44 depletion on DN progression in db/db mice.

The present study investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on renal inflammation and oxidative stress in a model of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.0 mg/kg). In the OCA + LPS group, mice were orally pretreated with three doses of OCA (5 mg/kg) at 48, 24 and 1 h before LPS injection. Interestingly, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced renal dysfunction and pathological damage. Moreover, OCA pretreatment repressed renal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In addition, OCA blocked nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and p50 subunits in tubular epithelial cells of renal cortex. Additional experiment showed that OCA pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced renal glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Moreover, OCA pretreatment inhibited the upregulation of renal NADPH oxidase and inos genes during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In conclusion, OCA pretreatment protects against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting renal inflammation and oxidative stress. These results provide evidence for roles of FXR as an important regulator of inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney.Copyright © 2018.

However, approximately 40% of patients are not sensitive to UDCA. In recent years, obeticholic  (OCA) combined with UDCA has been used in the PBC patients who were not sensitive to UDCA, or as monotherapy for PBC adult patients who are intolerant to UDCA.To develop and validate a specific, sensitive and reliable tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of obeticholic  (OCA) in rat plasma.Plasma samples were treated with liquid-liquid extraction. Diazepam was selected as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was achieved by an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and ultrapure water (containing 0.1% formic ). The analyte was detected in positive ion mode by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods were used to detect specific precursor and product ions. The target ion pair of OCA was 419.38 → 401.22, and the IS was 285.05 → 193.02.The linear range of OCA in rat plasma was 0.05-50 μg/mL (R = 0.992); the recovery rate was 91.34%-97.37%. This assay showed good intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. No significant matrix effects in this study.A specific, sensitive and reliable quantitative analysis method was established to detect OCA after oral/intravenous administration in rat plasma via UPLC-MS/MS.

The underlying signaling events were investigated by Western blotting and inhibitor studies.GCDC (20 µmol/l) induced within 60 min a retrieval of Ntcp from the basolateral membrane into the cytosol, which was accompanied by an activating phosphorylation of the Src kinases Fyn and Yes. Both, Fyn activation and the GCDC-induced Ntcp retrieval from the plasma membrane were sensitive to the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the Src family kinase inhibitors SU6656 and PP-2, whereas PP-2 did not inhibit GCDC-induced Yes activation. Internalization of Ntcp by GCDC was also prevented by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö6850. TUDC (20 µmol/l) reversed the GCDC-induced retrieval of Ntcp from the plasma membrane and prevented the activation of Fyn and Yes in GCDC-perfused rat livers. Reinsertion of Ntcp into the basolateral membrane in GCDC-perfused livers by TUDC was sensitive to the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 and the integrin-inhibitory peptide GRGDSP, whereas the control peptide GRADSP was ineffective. Ex posure of cultured rat hepatocytes to GCDC (50 µmol/l, 15min) increased the fluorescence intensity of the reactive oxygen fluorescent indicator DCF to about 1.6-fold of untreated controls in a TUDC (50 µmol/l)-sensitive way. GCDC caused a TUDC-sensitive canalicular dilatation without evidence for Bsep retrieval from the canalicular membrane.The present study suggests that GCDC triggers the retrieval of Ntcp from the basolateral membrane into the cytosol through an oxidative stress-dependent activation of Fyn. TUDC prevents the GCDC-induced Fyn activation and Ntcp retrieval through integrin-dependent activation of PKA.© Copyright by the Author(s).

However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal barrier function remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in tight junction protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial barrier function impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of tight junction protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal barrier impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier function via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30917485>Enhanced Liver Targeting of Camptothecin via Conjugation with .</a></h2><p>Camptothecin (CPT) shows potent anticancer activity through inhibition of topoisomerase I. However, its water insolubility and severe toxicity limit its clinical application. Coupling with bile  moieties is a promising method for liver-targeted drug delivery, which takes advantage of the bile  receptors on hepatocytes. In this study, we evaluated the potential liver targeting and stability of a -CPT conjugate (). The competitive inhibition of antitumor activity experiment based on bile  transporters was performed using the MTT method. The effects of  on uptake of  and CPT were assessed in 2D and 3D HepG2 cell models. The stability of  and CPT was evaluated in vitro (in simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid, and fresh rat plasma). Finally, biodistribution of  and CPT was investigated in Kunming mice following oral administration. The results showed that  pretreatment could significantly reduce the antitumor activity and cellular uptake of  in HepG2 cells, but had no distinct effects on CPT. Meanwhile,  exhibited better stability compared with CPT. More importantly, biodistribution study in mice demonstrated that the liver targeting index of  increased 1.67-fold than that of CPT.

UDCA is the main effective component of bear bile powder that is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of human cholesterol gallstones. 7α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7α-HSDH) is the key enzyme used in the industrial production of 7-KLCA. Unfortunately, the natural 7α-HSDHs reported have difficulty meeting the requirements of industrial application, due to their poor activities and strong substrate inhibition. In this study, a directed evolution strategy combined with high-throughput screening was applied to improve the catalytic efficiency and tolerance of high substrate concentrations of NADP+-dependent 7α-HSDH from Clostridium absonum. Compared with the wild type, the best mutant (7α-3) showed 5.5-fold higher specific activity and exhibited 10-fold higher and 14-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and NADP+, respectively. Moreover, 7α-3 also displayed significantly enhanced tolerance in the presence of high concentrations of substrate compared to the wild type. Owing to its improved catalytic efficiency and enhanced substrate tolerance, 7α-3 could efficiently biosynthesize 7-KLCA with a substrate loading of 100 mM, resulting in 99% yield of 7-KLCA at 2 h, in contrast to only 85% yield of 7-KLCA achieved for the wild type at 16 h.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29956790>Effects of isomaltulose on insulin resistance and metabolites in patients with non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease: A metabolomic analysis.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is associated with a poor prognosis in non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Isomaltulose, a naturally‑occurring disaccharide, is reported to improve glucose and lipid metabolisms in obese patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isomaltulose on insulin resistance and various metabolites in NAFLD patients. Five male patients with NAFLD consumed 20 g isomaltulose or sucrose (control). Changes in insulin resistance and metabolites were evaluated by alterations of serum C‑peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) and metabolomic analysis from baseline to 15 min after the administration, respectively. There was no significant difference in changes of blood glucose level; however, the CPR level was significantly decreased in the Isomaltulose group compared to the control group (0.94±0.89 vs. ‑0.12±0.31, P=0.0216). In a metabolomic analysis, a significant alteration was seen in 52 metabolites between the control and Isomaltulose groups. In particular, the taurodeoxycholic  level significantly increased approximately 12.5‑fold, and the arachidonic  level significantly decreased approximately 0.01‑fold. Together, it present study demonstrated that isomaltulose improved insulin resistance in NAFLD patients. It was also revealed that isomaltulose affects taurodeoxycholic  and arachidonic . Thus, isomaltulose may have a beneficial effect on insulin resistance through alterations of bile  and fatty  metabolisms in NAFLD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259853>Natural History of Primary Biliary Cholangitis in the Ursodeoxycholic  Era: Role of Scoring Systems.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic disease that progresses to end-stage liver disease.

Ursodeoxycholic  is widely used as a treatment without an adequate evidence base. We aimed to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic  reduces adverse perinatal outcomes in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial at 33 hospital maternity units in England and Wales. We recruited women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, who were aged 18 years or older and with a gestational age between 20 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days, with a singleton or twin pregnancy and no known lethal fetal anomaly. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to ursodeoxycholic  or placebo, given as two oral tablets a day at an equivalent dose of 500 mg twice a day. The dose could be increased or decreased at the clinician's discretion, to a maximum of four tablets and a minimum of one tablet a day. We recommended that treatment should be continued from enrolment until the infant's birth. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal death (in-utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7 days after birth), preterm delivery (<37 weeks' gestation), or neonatal unit admission for at least 4 h (from birth until hospital discharge). Each infant was counted once within this composite. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 91918806.Between Dec 23, 2015, and Aug 7, 2018, 605 women were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive ursodeoxycholic  (n=305) or placebo (n=300). The primary outcome analysis included 304 women and 322 infants in the ursodeoxycholic  group, and 300 women and 318 infants in the placebo group (consent to use data was withdrawn for 1 woman and 2 infants). The primary composite outcome occurred in 74 (23%) of 322 infants in the ursodeoxycholic  group and 85 (27%) of 318 infants in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·62-1·15]). Two serious adverse events were reported in the ursodeoxycholic  group and six serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group; no serious adverse events were regarded as being related to treatment.Treatment with ursodeoxycholic  does not reduce adverse perinatal outcomes in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

In a murine CKD model, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the hippocampus. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the candidates for cell-based therapy for CKD; however severe pathophysiological conditions can decrease their therapeutic potential. To address these issues, we established tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA)-treated MSCs using MSCs isolated from patients with CKD (CKD-hMSCs) and assessed the survival and ROS generation of neural cell line SH-SY5Y cells by co-culturing with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs. In the presence of the uremic toxin -cresol, the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced by ROS-mediated ER stress. Co-culture with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs increased anti-oxidant enzyme activities in SH-SY5Y cells through the upregulation of the cellular prion protein (PrP) expression. Upregulated PrP expression in SH-SY5Y cells protected against CKD-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. In an adenine-induced murine CKD model, injection with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs suppressed ROS generation and ER stress in the hippocampus. These results indicate that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs prevent the CKD-mediated cell death of SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ER stress. Our study suggests that treatment with TUDCA could be a powerful strategy for developing autologous MSC-based therapeutics for patients with CKD, and that PrP might be a pivotal target for protecting neural cells from CKD-mediated ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150987>Bile Acids Activated Receptors Regulate Innate Immunity.</a></h2><p>Once known exclusively for their role in nutrients absorption, primary bile acids, chenodeoxycholic and cholic , and secondary bile acids,  and lithocholic , are signaling molecules, generated from cholesterol breakdown by the interaction of the host and intestinal microbiota, acting on several receptors including the G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1 or Takeda G-protein receptor 5) and the Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR). Both receptors are placed at the interface of the host immune system with the intestinal microbiota and are highly represented in cells of innate immunity such as intestinal and liver macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer T cells.

In patients with PBC, in particular at the level of the portal areas of diseased livers, MIG expression and CXCR3+ cells have been found. MIG is positively associated with the severity of liver fibrosis. In PBC, circulating MIG levels and CXCR3+ cells are related with the progression of the disease; in fact, their expression increases significantly in PBC patients with respect to controls. Furthermore, it has been shown a significant reduction of these chemokines in the serum of PBC patients after treatment with ursodeoxycholic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30119174>Novel steroid derivatives: synthesis, antileishmanial activity, mechanism of action, and in silico physicochemical and pharmacokinetics studies.</a></h2><p>The search for new drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis is an important strategy for improving the current therapeutic arsenal for the disease. There are several limitations to the available drugs including high toxicity, low efficacy, prolonged parenteral administration, and high costs. Steroids are a diverse group of compounds with various applications in pharmacology. However, the antileishmanial activity of this class of molecules has not yet been explored. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the antileishmanial activity and cytotoxicity of novel steroids against murine macrophages with a focus on the derivatives of cholesterol (CD), cholic  (CA), and  (DA). Furthermore, the mechanism of action of the best compound was assessed, and in silico studies to evaluate the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were also conducted. Among the sixteen derivatives, schiffbase2, CD2 and  derivatives (DOCADs) were effective against promastigotes of Leishmania species. Despite their low toxicity to macrophages, the majority of DOCADs were active against intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis, and DOCAD5 exhibited the best biological effect against these parasitic stages (IC = 15.34 μM). Neither the CA derivatives (CAD) nor DA alone inhibited the intracellular parasites. Thus, the absence of hydroxyl in the C-7 position of the steroid nucleus, as well as the modification of the  group in DOCADs were considered important for antileishmanial activity. The treatment of L. amazonensis promastigote forms with DOCAD5 induced biochemical changes such as depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production and cell cycle arrest. No alterations in parasite plasma membrane integrity were observed. In silico physicochemical and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that DOCAD5 could be a good candidate for an oral drug. The data demonstrate the potential antileishmanial effect of certain steroid derivatives and encourage new in vivo studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Current prognostic models in PBC are based on treatment response to ursodeoxycholic  because of the well-established relationship between alkaline phosphatase on treatment and long-term outcome. In addition, serum alkaline phosphatase correlates with ductular reaction and biliary metaplasia, which are hallmark of biliary injury. Considering the waiting time for treatment failure in high-risk patients is not inconsequential, efforts are focused on bringing forward risk stratification at diagnosis by predicting treatment response at onset. There is a need for better prognostic variables that are central to the disease process. We should take an integrative approach that incorporates multiple layers of information including genetic and environmental influences, host characteristics, clinical data, and molecular alterations for risk assessments. Biomarker discovery has an accelerated pace taking advantage of the emergence of large-scale omics platforms (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and others) and whole-genome sequencing. In the digital era, applications of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, can support the computing power required to analyse the vast amount of data produced by omics. The information is then used for the development of personalised risk prediction models that through clinical trials and hopefully industry partnerships can guide risk management strategies.

Nowadays, their role in glucose regulation and energy homeostasis are widely reported. BAs are involved in various cellular signaling , such as protein kinase cascades, cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis, and calcium mobilization. They are ligands for several nuclear hormone receptors, including farnesoid X-receptor (FXR). Recently, BAs have been shown to bind to muscarinic receptor and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), both G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), independent of the nuclear hormone receptors. Moreover, BA signals have also been elucidated in other nonclassical BA , such as sphingosine-1-posphate and BK (large conductance calcium- and voltage activated potassium) channels. Hydrophobic BAs have been proven to affect heart rate and its contraction. Elevated BAs are associated with arrhythmias in adults and fetal heart, and altered ratios of primary and secondary bile  are reported in chronic heart failure patients. Meanwhile, in patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction has been strongly linked to the increase in serum bile  concentrations. In contrast, the most hydrophilic BA, known as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has been found to be beneficial in improving peripheral blood flow in chronic heart failure patients and in protecting the heart against reperfusion injury. This review provides an overview of BA signaling, with the main emphasis on past and present perspectives on UDCA signals in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354219>Vascular Bed Molecular Profiling by Differential Systemic Decellularization In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Objective- Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key component of several major human diseases, but the molecular basis of this complex disorder has been difficult to determine in vivo. Previous attempts to identify key mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction in experimental models have been limited by the lack of suitable methods for system-wide analyses of vascular bed biology. Here, we aimed to develop a novel method for investigating vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis that enables system-wide analyses of molecular interactions between endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in murine. Approach and Results- We developed a new technique using whole-body differential perfusion with increasing concentrations of detergent buffer to selectively solubilize distinct layers of vascular bed tissue in rodents. When combined with proteomics techniques, our novel approach of differential systemic decellularization in vivo enabled quantitative profiling of vascular beds throughout the body. Initial perfusion with phosphate buffer was used to obtain the endothelial glycocalyx, followed by subsequent extraction of endothelial cell components, and finally by smooth muscle cell constituents with increasing concentrations of detergent. Differential systemic decellularization in vivo has also been successfully applied to characterize molecular events in the vascular bed pathology of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice. Conclusions- Together, these data indicate that differential systemic decellularization in vivo permits system-wide molecular characterization of vascular bed proteomes in rodent models and can be used to advance our current understanding of vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis and progression in a wide range of disease settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828892>Interplay between bile acids and the gut microbiota promotes intestinal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota and the bile  pool play pivotal roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Bile acids are produced in the liver from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. However, the interplay between bile   and the gut microbiota during intestinal carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of bile acids and the gut microbiota in the cholic  (CA; a primary bile )-induced intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Apc  mice, which spontaneously develop intestinal adenomas, were fed a diet supplemented with 0.4% CA for 12 weeks. Mice that were fed a normal diet were regarded as untreated controls. In CA-treated Apc  mice, the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly altered, and CA was efficiently transformed into  (a secondary bile ) by the bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation reaction. The intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence was observed in CA-treated Apc  mice and was accompanied by an impaired intestinal barrier function and IL-6/STAT3-related low-grade inflammation. More importantly, microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail globally compromised CA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, suggesting a leading role for the microbiota during this process. Overall, our data suggested that the crosstalk between bile acids and the gut microbiota mediated intestinal carcinogenesis, which might provide novel therapeutic strategies against intestinal tumor development.© 2019 The Authors.

Bile acids (BAs) are involved in the activation of HSCs, but the detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive DNA microarray study of the human HSC line LX-2 treated with  (DCA), a secondary unconjugated BA. Additionally, LX-2 cells were exposed to nine BAs and studied using immunofluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry to examine the mechanisms of HSC activation. We focused on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway and revealed upregulation of genes related to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was highly expressed in cells treated with secondary unconjugated BAs, including DCA, and a morphological change associated with radial extension of subendothelial protrusion was observed. Interleukin-6 level in culture supernatant was significantly higher in cells treated with secondary unconjugated BAs. Flow cytometry showed that the proportion of cells highly expressing α-SMA was significantly increased in HSCs cultured with secondary unconjugated BAs.

The pathogenesis of FM remains unclear. No specific biomarkers are available. Animal models of FM may provide an opportunity to explore potential biomarkers in a relative homogenous disease condition. Here, we probed the metabolomics profiles of serum and urine in a mouse model of FM induced by intermittent cold stress (ICS). We focused on the role of -sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) in the metabolomics profiling because ICS treatment induced chronic widespread muscle pain lasting for 1 month in wild-type (Asic3) but not Asic3-knockout (Asic3) mice. Serum and urine samples were collected from both genotypes at different ICS stages, including before ICS (basal level) and post-ICS at days 10 (middle phase, P10) and 40 (recovery phase, P40). Control naïve mice and ICS-induced FM mice differed in H-NMR- and LC-MS-based metabolomics profiling. On pathway analysis, the leading regulated  in Asic3 mice were taurine and hypotaurine, cysteine and methionine, glycerophospholipid, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolisms, and the major  in Asic3 mice involved amino -related . Finally, we developed an algorithm for the impactful metabolites in the FM model including cis-aconitate, kynurenate, taurine, pyroglutamic , pyrrolidonecarboxylic , and 4-methoxyphenylacetic  in urine as well as carnitine, , lysoPC(16:0), lysoPC(20:3), oleoyl-L-carnitine, and trimethylamine N-oxide in serum. Asic3 mice were impaired in only muscle allodynia development but not other pain symptoms in the ICS model, so the ASIC3-dependent metabolomics changes could be useful for developing diagnostic biomarkers specific to chronic widespread muscle pain, the core symptom of FM. Further pharmacological validations are needed to validate these metabolomics changes as potential biomarkers for FM diagnosis and/or treatment responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409782>TGR5 Activation Promotes Stimulus-Secretion Coupling of Pancreatic β-Cells via a PKA-Dependent Pathway.</a></h2><p>The Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) mediates physiological actions of bile acids. Since it was shown that TGR5 is expressed in pancreatic tissue, a direct TGR5 activation in β-cells is currently postulated and discussed. The current study reveals that oleanolic  (OLA) affects murine β-cell function by TGR5 activation. Both a G inhibitor and an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (AC) prevented stimulating effects of OLA. Accordingly, OLA augmented the intracellular cAMP concentration. OLA and two well-established TGR5 agonists, RG239 and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), acutely promoted stimulus-secretion coupling (SSC). OLA reduced K current and elevated current through Ca channels. Accordingly, in mouse and human β-cells, TGR5 ligands increased the cytosolic Ca concentration by stimulating Ca influx. Higher OLA concentrations evoked a dual reaction, probably due to activation of a counterregulating pathway. Protein kinase A (PKA) was identified as a downstream target of TGR5 activation. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase did not prevent stimulating effects of OLA. Involvement of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR2) was ruled out by experiments with knockout mice. The proposed pathway was not influenced by local glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion from α-cells, shown by experiments with MIN6 cells, and a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. In summary, these data clearly demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in β-cells stimulates insulin secretion via an AC/cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway, which is supposed to interfere with SSC by affecting K and Ca currents and thus membrane potential.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30351956>Effect of Surfactant-Bile Interactions on the Solubility of Hydrophobic Drugs in Biorelevant Dissolution Media.</a></h2><p>Biorelevant dissolution media (BDM) methods are commonly employed to investigate the oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Despite the significant progress in this area, the effect of commonly employed pharmaceutical excipients, such as surfactants, on the solubility of drugs in BDM has not been characterized in detail. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of surfactant-bile interactions on drug solubility by using a set of 12 surfactants, 3 model hydrophobic drugs (fenofibrate, danazol, and progesterone) and two types of BDM (porcine bile extract and sodium taurodeoxycholate). Drug precipitation and sharp nonlinear decrease in the solubility of all studied drugs is observed when drug-loaded ionic surfactant micelles are introduced in solutions of both BDM, whereas the drugs remain solubilized in the mixtures of nonionic polysorbate surfactants + BDM. One-dimensional and diffusion-ordered H NMR spectroscopy show that mixed bile salt + surfactant micelles with low drug solubilization capacity are formed for the ionic surfactants. On the other hand, separate surfactant-rich and bile salt-rich micelles coexist in the nonionic polysorbate surfactant + bile salt mixtures, explaining the better drug solubility in these systems. The nonionic alcohol ethoxylate surfactants show intermediate behavior. The large dependence of the drug solubility on surfactant-bile interactions (in which the drug molecules do not play a major role per se) highlights how the complex interplay between excipients and bile salts can significantly change one of the key parameters which governs the oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs, viz. the drug solubility in the intestinal fluids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189365>Green tea polyphenols modify gut-microbiota dependent metabolisms of energy, bile constituents and micronutrients in female Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Our recent metagenomics analysis has uncovered remarkable modifying effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) on gut-microbiota community structure and energy conversion related gene orthologs in rats. How these genomic changes could further influence host health is still unclear. In this work, the alterations of gut-microbiota dependent metabolites were studied in the GTP-treated rats. Six groups of female SD rats (n=12/group) were administered drinking water containing 0%, 0.5%, and 1.5% GTP (wt/vol). Their gut contents were collected at 3 and 6 months and were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). GC-MS based metabolomics analysis captured 2668 feature, and 57 metabolites were imputatively from top 200 differential features identified via NIST fragmentation database. A group of key metabolites were quantitated using standard calibration methods. Compared with control, the elevated components in the GTP-treated groups include niacin (8.61-fold), 3-phenyllactic  (2.20-fold), galactose (3.13-fold), mannose (2.05-fold), pentadecanoic  (2.15-fold), lactic  (2.70-fold), and proline (2.15-fold); the reduced components include cholesterol (0.29-fold), cholic  (0.62-fold),  (0.41-fold), trehalose (0.14-fold), glucose (0.46-fold), fructose (0.12-fold), and alanine (0.61-fold). These results were in line with the genomic alterations of gut-microbiome previously discovered by metagenomics analysis. The alterations of these metabolites suggested the reduction of calorific carbohydrates, elevation of vitamin production, decreases of bile constituents, and modified  pattern of amino acids in the GTP-treated animals. Changes in gut-microbiota associated  may be a major contributor to the anti-obesity function of GTP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we investigated whether TGR5-mTORC1 signaling mediates the RYGB-induced alteration in GLP-1 production in mice and human beings.Circulating bile acids, TGR5-mTORC1 signaling, GLP-1 synthesis and secretion were determined in lean or obese male C57BL/6 mice with or without RYGB operation, as well as in normal glycemic subjects, obese patients with type 2 diabetes before and after RYGB.Positive relationships were observed among circulating bile acids, ileal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and GLP-1 during changes in energy status in the present study. RYGB increased circulating bile acids, ileal Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and mTORC1 signaling activity, as well as GLP-1 production in both mice and human subjects. Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile  secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma  (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA. DCA increased interaction between mTOR-regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Raptor) and TGR5 in STC-1 cells.-TGR5-mTORC1 signaling contributes to the up-regulation of GLP-1 production after RYGB.Copyright © 2018.

Consequently, analytical methods and biosensors have been developed to detect these types of contaminates in feeds. Here we have evaluated whether the expression of TolC, a promiscuous component of several ATP-dependent efflux pumps in E. coli, up-regulated in response to chemical stress, could be a useful biomarker for this aim. Changes in TolC expression in response to toxic compounds, with different abilities to induce DNA damage, were determined using two E. coli strains with (DH5α) and without (BL21(DE3)) inactivating mutation in RecA gene.  and potassium dichromate up-regulated TolC in both strains. In contrast, cisplatin-induced TolC up-regulation was abolished in the absence of a functional RecA. When the effect of several insecticides, herbicides, antibiotics and common soil pollutants on TolC expression was analyzed, a relationship between toxicity and their ability to up-regulate TolC was observed. However, this was not a general event because the insecticide α-cipermetrin induced a reduction in cell viability, which was not accompanied by TolC up-regulation. In contrast, the soil pollutant benzene was able to stimulate TolC expression at non-toxic concentrations. When this test was used to analyze aqueous extracts from different feedstuffs, up-regulation of TolC was found in the absence of cell toxicity and was even accompanied by enhanced cell viability. In conclusion, TolC expression is partly dependent on the integrity of the RecA/LexaA system. Although toxic compounds up-regulate TolC in a dose-dependent manner, this response is also activated by non-toxic agents. Thus, owing to its poor specificity regardless of its sensitivity, the use of TolC up-regulation in E. coli to detect the presence of toxic pollutants in conventional and unconventional sources of nutrients for ruminant feeding requires supplementary biomarkers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ursodeoxycholic  exerts cytoprotective activities in hepatocytes and is believed to suppress tumorigenesis through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The present study examined whether co‑treatment with ursodeoxycholic  has a synergistic effect on the antitumor activity of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Notably, co‑treatment with both agents more effectively inhibited cell proliferation than sorafenib or ursodeoxycholic  alone. Furthermore, co‑treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and activated extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK), a mitogen‑activated protein kinase, accompanied by excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Thus, chemotherapy with sorafenib and ursodeoxycholic combination may be efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis through reactive oxygen species‑dependent activation of ERK and dephosphorylation of STAT3. The present findings may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29953016>IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis overlapping with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary Sjögren's syndrome: A case report.</a></h2><p>IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disorder which is characterized by elevated levels of serum IgG4 and infiltration of IgG4-bearing plasma cells in the involved organs.

Increasingly, research is focusing on the association between molecular chaperones and micronutrients. This study established and characterized a mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and investigated the effect of PBA and TUDCA on Mg and Ca  in these mice. T1D was established in Friend virus B-type mice using multiple low doses of streptozotocin. Mice were administered chaperones. Mgand Ca levels in tissues and serum were detected using  digestion and ICP-MS. At 2 weeks and 2 months after chaperone administration was initiated, Mg levels in the heart, liver, kidney, and serum and Ca levels in spleen and serum of T1D mice were significantly decreased compared with controls; Ca levels in the kidney and muscle of T1D mice were significantly increased; Mg and Ca levels in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, and serum were positively correlated in control and T1D mice; and PBA restored renal Mg levels to normal values and TUDCA restored hepatic, renal, and serum Mg levels and renal and serum Ca levels to normal values in T1D mice. PBA restored muscular Ca levels to normal values in T1D mice at 2 months after chaperone or vehicle administration was initiated.

It suppresses hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, aids in the desaturation of biliary cholesterol, and aids in the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. Ursodiol is commercially available as a 300-mg capsule and a 250-mg tablet. However, no commercial liquid dosage form of ursodiol exists. An extemporaneously compounded suspension from pure drug powder or commercial tablets/capsules would provide an alternative option to meet unique patient needs. The purpose of this study was to determine the physicochemical stability of extemporaneously compounded ursodiol suspensions in PCCA base SuspendIt. This base is a sugar-free, paraben-free, dye-free, and gluten-free thixotropic vehicle containing a natural sweetener obtained from the monk fruit. It thickens upon standing to minimize settling of any insoluble drug particles and becomes fluid upon shaking to allow convenient pouring during administration to the patient. The study design included two ursodiol concentrations to provide stability documentation over a bracketed concentration range for eventual use by compounding pharmacists. A robust, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the determination of the chemical stability of ursodiol in SuspendIt was developed and validated. Suspensions of ursodiol were prepared in SuspendIt at 50-mg/mL and 100-mg/mL concentrations, selected to represent a range within which the drug is commonly dosed. Samples were stored in plastic amber prescription bottles at two temperature conditions (5°C and 25°C). Samples were assayed initially and at the following time points: 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 42 days, 59 days, 91 days, 120 days, and 181 days. Physical data such as pH, viscosity, and appearance were also noted. All measurements were obtained in triplicate. A stable extemporaneous product is defined as one that retains at least 90% of the initial drug concentration throughout the sampling period. The study showed that ursodiol concentration did not go below 97% of the label claim (initial drug concentration) at both temperatures studied. Viscosity and pH values also did not change significantly. This study demonstrates that ursodiol is physically and chemically stable in SuspendIt for 181 days in the refrigerator and at room temperature, thus providing a viable, compounded alternative for ursodiol in a liquid-dosage form, with an extended beyond-use-date to meet patient needs.Copyright© by International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237451>Differential effects of a 40-hour fast and bile  supplementation on human GLP-1 and FGF19 responses.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) play an important role in postprandial .

Approach and Results- Administration of OCA to chow-fed mice increased mRNA and protein levels of LDLR in the liver without affecting the sterol-regulatory element binding protein pathway. Profiling of known LDLR mRNA-binding proteins demonstrated that OCA treatment did not affect expressions of mRNA degradation factors hnRNPD (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D) or ZFP36L1 but increased the expression of Hu antigen R (HuR) an mRNA-stabilizing factor. Furthermore, inducing effects of OCA on LDLR and HuR expression were ablated in Fxr mice. To confirm the post-transcriptional mechanism, we used transgenic mice (albumin-luciferase-untranslated region) that express a human LDLR mRNA 3' untranslated region luciferase reporter gene in the liver. OCA treatment led to significant rises in hepatic bioluminescence signals, Luc-untranslated region chimeric mRNA levels, and endogenous LDLR protein abundance, which were accompanied by elevations of hepatic HuR mRNA and protein levels in OCA-treated transgenic mice. In vitro studies conducted in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA and other agonists elicited the same inducing effect on LDLR expression as in the liver of normolipidemic mice. Furthermore, depletion of HuR in HepG2 cells by short interfering RNA transfection abolished the inducing effect of OCA on LDLR expression. Conclusions- Our study is the first to demonstrate that FXR activation increases LDLR expression in liver tissue by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving LDLR mRNA-stabilizing factor HuR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148855>Optimizing treatment of tauroursodeoxycholic  to improve embryonic development after in vitro maturation of cumulus-free oocytes in mice.</a></h2><p>Cumulus-free in vitro maturation (IVM) provides a powerful tool to manipulate immature oocytes, but IVM oocytes lead to poor development after fertilization. Supplementation of the culture medium with tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a bile , has been reported to improve the development of embryos derived from in vivo fertilized (IVF) embryos after in vitro culture (IVC) by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, it remains unclear if TUDCA can improve development of IVM-IVF embryos. Here, we examined whether TUDCA treatment could improve embryonic development during or after IVM. Immature GV oocytes collected from ovaries of ICR female mice that were free from cumulus cells were subjected to IVM in αMEM containing 5% FBS for 16 h. TUDCA was added to the media at varying concentrations (0-1000 μM) during IVM and IVC. TUDCA treatment during IVM reduced both MII and pronuclear (PN) rates but did not affect blastocyst rates of fertilized embryos. In contrast, TUDCA treatment during IVC significantly increased blastocyst formation rates in a concentration dependent manner. Finally, embryo transfer after TUDCA treatment revealed a significant improvement in the rates of offspring production (15% with 1000 μM TUDCA vs. 6.0% control). These results show that treatment with 1000 μM of TUDCA significantly can improve poor embryonic development of cumulus-free IVM-IVF embryos.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171839>Ursodeoxycholic  Improves Mitochondrial Function and Redistributes Drp1 in Fibroblasts from Patients with Either Sporadic or Familial Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified in many cell types in AD, with deficits preceding the development of the classical pathological aggregations. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, improves mitochondrial function in fibroblasts derived from Parkinson's disease patients as well as several animal models of AD and Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we investigated both mitochondrial function and morphology in fibroblasts from patients with both sporadic and familial AD. We show that both sporadic AD (sAD) and PSEN1 fibroblasts share the same impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential and alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondrial respiration, however, was decreased in sAD fibroblasts and increased in PSEN1 fibroblasts. Morphological changes seen in AD fibroblasts include reduced mitochondrial number and increased mitochondrial clustering around the cell nucleus as well as an increased number of long mitochondria. We show here for the first time in AD patient tissue that treatment with UDCA increases mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration as well as reducing the amount of long mitochondria in AD fibroblasts. In addition, we show reductions in dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) level, particularly the amount localized to mitochondria in both sAD and familial patient fibroblasts. Drp1 protein amount and localization were increased after UDCA treatment. The restorative effects of UDCA are abolished when Drp1 is knocked down.

Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of lithocholic  (LCA),  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914943>Population Pharmacokinetics and Cerebrospinal Fluid Penetration of Fluconazole in Adults with Cryptococcal Meningitis.</a></h2><p>Robust population pharmacokinetic (PK) data for fluconazole are scarce.

The diagnosis is based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. In children, it may be associated to a variety of systemic and hepatic conditions: thus, the term "primary" sclerosing cholangitis should be reserved for the rare cases without a known cause. Small duct disease is diagnosed in the presence of histological features diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis and normal cholangiography. Autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) is a form of sclerosing cholangitis with strong autoimmune features overlapping with those of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). It is a well-recognized nosological entity in paediatrics, where it accounts for the majority of sclerosing cholangitis cases. It is as prevalent as AIH in children, is equally frequent in males and females, half of the patients have concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, virtually all patients have raised immunoglobulin G levels and positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Half of the ASC patients respond well to standard immunosuppressive treatment for AIH with the addition of ursodeoxycholic , but the transplant rate is higher than in AIH, and post-transplant recurrence is frequent. A number of open questions remain: are ASC and AIH distinct entities or different manifestations of the same condition? What is the role of histology? Is small duct disease a specific entity?

As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA  pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA  and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic  in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as  in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12α-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative energy intake, visceral adipose tissue weight, and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202993>Identify liver X receptor β modulator building blocks by developing a fluorescence polarization-based competition assay.</a></h2><p>The liver X receptors (LXRs) of the nuclear receptor family are promising therapeutic targets of multiple diseases like lipid disorders, chronic inflammation, as well as different human cancers. To date, no LXR agonists or antagonists can be used in clinics, emphasizing the importance for discovering new LXR modulators. Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) is powerful for designing new scaffolds and new mechanistic drugs, but fragment screening has not been applied to LXRs yet, which might be due to the lack of a specific fragment screening method against the dynamic and hydrophobic ligand binding domain (LBD) of LXRs. Herein, a series of fluorescent tracers were designed, synthesized and tested. The tracer based on hyodeoxycholic  exhibited a good capability for competitively detecting the ligand binding of LXRβ using a fluorescence polarization approach. Then, 1074 fragments were screened against the LBD of LXRβ (LXRβ-LBD), resulting in 27 binding hits. These fragment hits were further tested using the co-activator recruitment assay and reporter gene assay, and efforts in X-ray crystallography fortunately solved a co-crystal structure of LXRβ-LBD with the fragment F3 (tert-butyl-7-amino-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate). The fluorescence-based fragment screening tool and the newly identified LXRβ binding fragments provide the basis for developing novel LXRβ modulators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Autophagy may be a key pathogenesis for aetiology of primary biliary cholangitis. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses were used for the evaluation of autophagy in human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HiBECs) at various time points. Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induced autophagy in HiBECs; the ratio of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II/microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-I (LC3-II/LC3-I) expression markedly increased at 48 hours, and then declined. However, compared with cells treated with GCDC alone, the expression of LC3-II increased and the clearance of autophagosome enhanced in GCDC-treated cells cocultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Furthermore, the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) decreased in HiBECs cocultured with MSCs relative to those cultured without MSCs. Following STAT3 silencing, decreased expression of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α was consistently observed. The present data suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may enhance autophagic flux of HiBECs through the inhibition of STAT3 activity.The present findings constitute the first report that human umbilical cord-derived MSCs enhance autophagic flux in HiBECs through a STAT3-dependent way: MSCs enhance the autophagic flux by increasing the formation of autophagosome and autolysosome in GCDC-treated HiBECs. MSCs decrease the STAT3 activity and the expression of eIF2α in GCDC-treated HiBECs; in addition, MSCs increase the expression of PKR. With STAT3 silencing, MSCs enhance neither the levels of LC3II nor the expression of PKR in GCDC-treated HiBECs.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts  and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose . Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925342>Ursodeoxycholic  versus phenobarbital for cholestasis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.</a></h2><p>Although neonates and young infants with cholestasis are commonly treated with either phenobarbital or ursodeoxycholic  (ursodiol), there is no evidence that phenobarbital is effective for this indication. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of ursodiol and phenobarbital for the treatment of cholestasis in a diverse NICU population.This is a retrospective cohort study including infants with cholestasis who were admitted to a Level IV NICU between January 2010 and December 2015. Drug courses of phenobarbital and ursodiol were identified within the medical record, and medical, demographic, and drug information were extracted. The primary outcome was reduction in direct bilirubin.Sixty-eight infants provided a total of 112 courses of drug therapy for comparison. Diverse medical diagnoses were captured in the patient cohort. Ursodiol was significantly more effective in reducing direct bilirubin than was phenobarbital (- 1.89 vs + 0.76 mg/dL; - 33.33 vs + 13.0 umol/L, p-value 0.03), even after controlling for baseline cholestasis severity, intrauterine growth restriction status, and lipid lowering therapy (- 2.16 vs + 0.27 mg/dl; - 36.94 vs + 4.62 umol/L, p-value 0.03).

To date, there are few reports on the management and follow-up of patients with Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) deficiency. We hypothesized that a retrospective analysis of the responses to oral bile  replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in patients with this bile  synthesis disorder will increase our understanding of the disease progression and permit evaluation of this treatment regimen as an alternative to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug cholic , which is currently unavailable in China.To evaluate the therapeutic responses of patients with AKR1D1 deficiency to oral bile  therapy, specifically CDCA.Twelve patients with AKR1D1 deficiency, confirmed by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of urine and by gene sequencing for mutations in , were treated with differing doses of CDCA or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). The clinical and biochemical responses to therapy were monitored over a period ranging 0.5-6.4 years. Dose adjustment, to optimize the therapeutic dose, was based on changes in serum biochemistry parameters, notably liver function tests, and suppression of the urinary levels of atypical hepatotoxic 3-oxo-Δ4-bile acids measured by mass spectrometry.Physical examination, serum biochemistry parameters, and sonographic findings improved in all 12 patients during bile  therapy, except one who underwent liver transplantation. Urine bile  analysis confirmed a significant reduction in atypical hepatotoxic 3-oxo-Δ4 bile acids concomitant with clinical and biochemical improvements in those patients treated with CDCA. UDCA was ineffective in down-regulating endogenous bile  synthesis as evidenced from the inability to suppress the urinary excretion of atypical 3-oxo-Δ4-bile acids. The dose of CDCA required for optimal clinical and biochemical responses varied from 5.5-10 mg/kg per day among patients based on maximum suppression of the atypical bile acids and improvement in serum biochemistry parameters, and careful titration of the dose was necessary to avoid side effects from CDCA.The primary bile  CDCA is effective in treating AKR1D1 deficiency but the therapeutic dose requires individualized optimization.

Various batches of polyelectrolyte complexes with the molar ratio of  (DCA) and chitosan (CS) of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 were prepared, and were termed as CS-DCA, CS-DCA, and CS-DCA respectively. The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum (H NMR) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Particle sizes of synthesized polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles (PCNs) were found to be in the range of 280-310 nm, larger than those of uncoated nanoparticles (~150 nm). The PCNs have large zeta potentials (about 26 mV) which make them stable and no sizes' change was determined. DOX could be easily incorporated into the PCNs with encapsulation efficiency (56%) and kept a sustained release manner without burst effect when exposed to PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.

Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote barrier re-establishment; however, we found that persistently elevated PGE2 hinders subsequent repair phases. The bacterial metabolite deoxycholate (DCA) promotes transition through repair phases via PGE2 regulation. During barrier re-establishment, DCA levels are locally diminished in the wound, allowing enhanced PGE2 production and barrier re-establishment. However, during transition to the wound channel formation phase, DCA levels increase to inhibit PGE2 production and promote crypt regeneration. Altering DCA levels via antibiotic treatment enhances PGE2 levels but impairs wound repair, which is rescued with DCA treatment. DCA acts via its receptor, farnesoid X receptor, to inhibit the enzyme cPLA2 required for PGE2 synthesis. Thus, colonic wound repair requires temporally regulated signals from microbial metabolites to coordinate host-associated signaling cascades. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this prospective investigation was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effectiveness of oral ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (250-500 mg TID) administered to TB- or non-TB mycobacterial (NTM)-infected patients with drug-induced hepatotoxicity and ongoing therapy.Study population: During 2009-2017, 27 patients (11 women, 16 men, aged 19-90 years; median age 44 years, 16 Caucasians, 10 Africans, 1 Asian) out of 285 patients with active TB (24/261) or NTM infections (3/24) treated at our TB Center developed clinically relevant hepatotoxicity. Oral UDCA was administered to treat hepatotoxicity.Twenty-one out of 27 patients (77.8%) showed normalization of elevated enzymes (alanine transferase and aspartate aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin while continuing TB treatment and 5 patients demonstrated a significant reduction of liver enzymes (18.5%). No change was observed in 1 patient (3.7%). Drug dose was not reduced in all patients; they all showed radiological and clinical improvement.

DCA injection (ATX-101, Kybella [United States], Belkyra [Canada]; Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Westlake Village, CA, acquired by Allergan, Inc.), are proprietary formulations of synthetically derived DCA that is FDA approved for improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe convexity or fullness associated with SMF.As none of the aforementioned are available in India, we undertook this study to study the efficacy of generic DCA for SMF reduction in Indian patients.50 patients with confirmed Indian ethnicity and unwanted SMF were injected 3 mg/cm2 of generic DCA into their SMF, with a 12-week follow-up period. In each session, 5 ml of 30 mg /ml DCA was injected. The sessions were spaced approximately 2 months apart. All these patients with reductions in SMF were reported using Clinician Reported SMF Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS) and Patient Reported SMF Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS) using the Validated Rating Scale for improvement in the appearance of their chin, the neck, and the cervico-mental profile. Also, for objective assessment of improvement in SMF, caliper measurements were used.One session was required in 2 patients, 12 patients needed 2 sessions, 32 patients needed 3 sessions, and 4 patients needed 4 sessions. Altogether, 90% patients showed at least a decrease of 1 point in (CR-SMFRS). Reduction in SMF as confirmed by caliper measurements was statistically significant.The findings show generic  to be equally effective in the treatment for SMF in Indian patients.

It is, however, regrettable that effective medical therapies to ameliorate or reverse this cholestasis are limited. Fortunately, the novel insights now allow us to target crucial transporters, enzymes and their regulatory  therapeutically by restoring disrupted bile acids (BAs) transport and signaling thus ameliorating cholestasis. Additionally, it has been found that a compensatory effect could have been developed under the condition of estrogen-induced in cholestasis. Hence, exploring the molecular mechanism of the adaptive changes counteracting the cholestasis would be one of the approaches for development of new therapeutic targets.Parameters of BAs in different specimens, mRNA expressions of transporters, enzymes and farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) signaling  that relate to BAs homeostasis in liver and ileum were measured in rats with 7-day and 14-day 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE)-induced cholestasis, and the molecular docking and HepaRG cells studies for verification were also evaluated.It has been found that the depression of "ileal Fxr-Fgf15 (fibroblast growth factor 15)-hepatic Cyp7a1 pathway" in coordinated with activation of "hepatic Fxr-Shp (small heterodimer partner)-Cyp8b1 pathway" as well as up-regulation of Cyp27a1 expression synergistically promoting the hepatic biosynthesis of chenodeoxycholic acids (CDCAs) that are the potent agonists of Fxr, contribute to the Bsep up-regulation mediated the bile flow restoration to alleviate the cholestasis.These findings suggest that the adaptive regulation of Fxr-mediated ileum-liver signaling axis on Cyp7a1/Cyp8b1 might be the potentially novel targets for amelioration or treatment of estrogen-induced cholestasis, and we expect that this study would be of great value to provide a cue for patients with estrogen-induced cholestasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The mean particle size ranged from from 96.5 ± 11.31 to 405 ± 46.39 nm. All nanoparticles had good positive zeta potential values. Entrapment efficiency % ranged from 38.25 ± 3.25 to 94.89 ± 5.67. The agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the strong binding between plasmid and CS. The in vitro pDNA release from nanoparticles exhibited an initial burst effect followed by a sustained drug release over a period of 6 days. In vitro cytotoxicity against human Caco-2 cells showed low cell cytotoxicity of plain CS-DS nanoparticles, while pDNA-loaded CS-DS nanoparticles showed a cytotoxic effect with increasing nanoparticles' concentration. Gene transfection, analyzed by PCR and ELISA, showed a direct correlation between gene expression and concentration of pDNA. The highest expression of the gene was achieved with pDNA concentration of 9 µg/mL with 5.7 times increase compared to naked pDNA of the same concentration.  The obtained results were very encouraging and offer an alternative approach to enhancing the transfection efficiency of genetic material-loaded chitosan-based delivery systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30458302>Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress protected DOCA-salt hypertension-induced vascular dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Hypertension has complex vascular pathogenesis and therefore the molecular etiology remains poorly elucidated. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which is a condition of the unfolded/misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum, has been defined as a potential target for cardiovascular disease. In the present study, the effects of ERS inhibition on hypertension-induced alterations in the vessels were investigated. In male Wistar albino rats, hypertension was induced through unilateral nephrectomy, deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) injection (20 mg/kg, twice a week) and 1% NaCl with 0.2% KCI added to drinking water for 12 weeks. An ERS inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycolic  (TUDCA) (150 mg/kg/day, i.p.), was administered for the final four weeks. ERS inhibition in DOCA-salt induced hypertension was observed to have reduced systolic blood pressure, improved endothelial dysfunction, enhanced plasma nitric oxide (NO) level, reduced protein expressions of phosphorylated-double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pPERK), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), Inositol trisphosphate receptor1 (IPR1) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), increased expressions of endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase2 (SERCA2) and B cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) in vessels. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of ERS inhibition on hypertension may be related to protection of vessel functions through restoration of endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic and mitotic .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Under many undesirable conditions, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can be induced. However, the physiological and molecular responses of wheat to ER stress remain poorly understood. We used dithiothreitol (DTT) and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) to induce or suppress ER stress in wheat cells, respectively, with the aim to reveal the molecular background of ER stress responses using a combined approach of transcriptional profiling and morpho-physiological characterization.To understand the mechanism of wheat response to ER stress, three wheat cultivars were used in our pre-experiments. Among them, the cultivar with a moderate stress tolerance, Yunong211 was used in the following experiments. We used DTT (7.5 mM) to induce ER stress and TUDCA (25 μg·mL) to suppress the stress. Under three treatment groups (Control, DTT and DTT + TUDCA), we firstly monitored the morphological, physiological and cytological changes of wheat seedlings. Then we collected leaf samples from each group for RNA extraction, library construction and RNA sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq platform. The sequencing data was then validated by qRT-PCR.Morpho-physiological results showed DTT significantly reduced plant height and biomass, decreased contents of chlorophyll and water, increased electrolyte leakage rate and antioxidant enzymes activity, and accelerated the cell death ratio, whereas these changes were all remarkably alleviated after TUDCA co-treatment. Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed to determine the genes involved in regulating wheat response to stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 8204 genes were differentially expressed in three treatment groups. Among these genes, 158 photosynthesis-related genes, 42 antioxidant enzyme genes, 318 plant hormone-related genes and 457 transcription factors (TFs) may play vital roles in regulating wheat response to ER stress. Based on the comprehensive analysis, we propose a hypothetical model to elucidate possible mechanisms of how plants adapt to environmental stresses.We identified several important genes that may play vital roles in wheat responding to ER stress. This work should lay the foundations of future studies in plant response to environmental stresses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155263>Fatty -induced endoplasmic reticulum stress promoted lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, and endoplasmic reticulum stress existed in the liver of severe fatty liver cows.</a></h2><p>Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, often termed ER stress, is intrinsically linked with perturbation of lipid  in humans and mice. Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty  treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty  synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and lipid accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty -induced lipid accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty -induced ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows. However, the mechanistic relationship between ER stress and fatty liver in dairy cows remain to be determined.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanisms of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), an antioxidant enzyme, in luteal function for progesterone production in mice have not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional link between PRDX1 and progesterone production in the CL of Prdx1 knockout (K/O) mice in the functional stage of CL.The expression pattern of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis related genes and peroxiredoxins 1 (PRDX1) were investigated by western blotting analysis in CL tissue of 10 weeks mice during functional stage of CL. The protein levels of these genes after ER-stress inducer tunicamycin (Tm), ER-stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) stimulation by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection were also investigated in CL tissue of wild type (WT) mice. Finally, we examined progesterone production and UPR signaling related gene expression in CL tissue of Prdx1 K/O mice.We demonstrated that PRDX1 deficiency in the functional stage activates the UPR signaling  in response to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CL number, serum progesterone levels, and steroidogenic enzyme expression in Prdx1 K/O mice decreased significantly, compared to those in wild type mice. Levels of UPR signaling pathway markers (GRP78/BIP, P50ATF6, and phosphorylated (p)-eIF2) and ER-stress associated apoptotic factors (CHOP, p-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3) were dramatically increased in the CL tissue of Prdx1 K/O mice. In addition, administration of the NAC, reduced progesterone production and activated ER-stress-induced UPR signaling in the CL tissue obtained from the ovary of Prdx1 K/O mice. Taken together, these results indicated that reduction in serum progesterone levels and activation of ER-stress-induced UPR signaling are restored by NAC injection in the CL of Prdx1 K/O mice.These observations provide the first evidence regarding the basic mechanisms connecting PRDX1 and progesterone production in the functional stage of CL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29854830>-Mediated Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2 Signaling Exacerbates DSS-Induced Colitis through Promoting Cathepsin B Release.</a></h2><p>We recently have proved that excessive fecal DCA caused by high-fat diet may serve as an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and thus contributes to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Moreover, the effect of DCA on inflammasome activation is mainly mediated through bile  receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2); however, the intermediate process remains unclear. Here, we sought to explore the detailed molecular mechanism involved and examine the effect of S1PR2 blockage in a colitis mouse model. In this study, we found that DCA could dose dependently upregulate S1PR2 expression. Meanwhile, DCA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation is at least partially achieved through stimulating extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway downstream of S1PR2 followed by promoting of lysosomal cathepsin B release. DCA enema significantly aggravated DSS-induced colitis in mice and S1PR2 inhibitor as well as inflammasome inhibition by cathepsin B antagonist substantially reducing the mature IL-1 production and alleviated colonic inflammation superimposed by DCA. Therefore, our findings suggest that S1PR2/ERK1/2/cathepsin B signaling plays a critical role in triggering inflammasome activation by DCA and S1PR2 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for the management of intestinal inflammation in individuals on a high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772394>Obeticholic  differentially regulates hepatic injury and inflammation at different stages of D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide-evoked acute liver failure.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates genes involved in bile  . Accumulating data demonstrate that FXR has an anti-inflammatory activity. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on D-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked acute liver injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with GalN (300 mg/kg) plus LPS (2.5 μg/kg). Some mice were pretreated with OCA (10 mg/kg) 48, 24 and 1 h before GalN/LPS. As expected, pretreatment with OCA alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, pretreatment with OCA augmented hepatic injury and inflammatory cell infiltration at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Additional experiment found that OCA inhibited hepatic NF-κB activation at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Interestingly, OCA inhibited hepatic proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α and il-6 but upregulated hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 at early stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, OCA suppressed hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine tgf-β and il-10 at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver injury. These results suggest that FXR agonist OCA differentially regulates hepatic injury and inflammation at different stages of GalN/LPS-evoked acute liver failure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Factors typically associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes risk in Caucasians are not significant correlates in black African populations. Therefore, we aimed to identify circulating metabolite patterns that predict type 2 diabetes development in this high-risk, yet understudied SA population.We conducted a prospective cohort study in black SA women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Participants were followed for 13 years and developed (i) type 2 diabetes (n = 20, NGT-T2D), (ii) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n = 27, NGT-IGT), or (iii) remained NGT (n = 28, NGT-NGT). Mass-spectrometry based metabolomics and multivariate analyses were used to elucidate metabolite patterns at baseline and at follow-up that were associated with type 2 diabetes development.Metabolites of phospholipid, bile  and branched-chain amino  (BCAA) , differed significantly between the NGT-T2D and NGT-NGT groups. At baseline: the NGT-T2D group had i) a higher lysophosphatidylcholine:lysophosphatidylethanolamine ratio containing linoleic  (LPC(C18:2):LPE(C18:2)), ii) lower proliferation-related bile acids (ursodeoxycholic- and chenodeoxycholic ), iii) higher levels of leucine and its catabolic intermediates (ketoleucine and C5-carnitine), compared to the NGT-NGT group. At follow-up: the NGT-T2D group had i) lower LPC(C18:2) levels, ii) higher apoptosis-related bile acids (- and glycodeoxycholic ), and iii) higher levels of all BCAAs and their catabolic intermediates.Changes in lysophospholipid  and the bile  pool occur during the development of type 2 diabetes in black South African women. Further, impaired leucine catabolism precedes valine and isoleucine catabolism in the development of type 2 diabetes.

UDCA is also a long-established drug, largely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders. The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of cancer cells. The effects of UDCA on cancer cell migration, cancer stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against colon and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib. UDCA can also protect from damages induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The potential of UDCA in cancer, as a chemo-protecting or chemotherapeutic agent, is highlighted here as well as the design of tumour-active derivatives, including UDCA-drug conjugates.

Male Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with tauroursodeoxycholic  (400 mg/kg) or saline solution, once per day for 3 days before surgery, and then the model of hepatic I/R injury was established. Blood and liver samples were collected from each group at 3, 6, and 24 h after surgery. Liver pathological changes, liver function, hepatocyte apoptosis and proinflammatory factors were detected. KCs were extracted, cultured and treated with TUDCA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then viability and phagocytosis were examined. Additionally, IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity and AML cell apoptosis were detected. The results showed that TUDCA alleviated hepatic I/R injury, the level of liver function markers, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effects of KCs were suppressed by down-regulating IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vivo. TUDCA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vitro, consistent with the in vivo results. Therefore, TUDCA can effectively alleviate hepatic IR injury by down-regulating the activity of the IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway to suppress the function of KCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To overcome this obstacle, propidium monoazide (PMA) alone or with deoxycholate (DC) was used to prevent dead cell detection in qPCR. qPCR methods were used to detect strains of Escherichia coli O157, which can cause infection in humans with an infectious dose of less than 10 cells. A 5 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail was inoculated onto beef steaks and treated with interventions used in meat facilities (lactic  (5%), peroxyacetic  (200 ppm) or hot water (80 °C for 10 s)). Treatment of PMA or PMA + DC was applied to samples followed by DNA extraction and quantification in qPCR. RNA was also quantified in addition to conventional plating. For lactic  intervention, qPCR DNA quantification of E. coli O157:H7 yielded 6.59 ± 0.21 and 6.30 ± 0.11 log gene copy #/cm for control and lactic  samples, respectively and after treatment with PMA or PMA + DC this was further reduced to 6.31 ± 0.21 and 5.58 ± 0.38, respectively. This trend was also observed for peroxyacetic  and hot water interventions. In comparison, RNA quantification yielded 7.65 ± 0.13 and 7.02 ± 0.38 log reverse transcript/cm for rRNA control and lactic  samples, respectively, and for plating (LB), 7.51 ± 0.06 and 6.86 ± 0.32 log CFU/cm, respectively. Our research determined that treatment of PMA + DC in conjunction with qPCR prevented dead cell DNA detection. However, it also killed cells injured from intervention that may have otherwise recovered. RNA quantification was more laborious and results had higher variability. Overall, quantification with conventional plating proved to be the most robust and reliable method for live EHEC detection on beef.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The mean size of obtained GX1-DGC-DCT was 150.9 nm with a narrow size distribution and their shape was spherical with smooth surface texture. The in vitro drug release test revealed a sustained release manner and an  pH could accelerate the release compared with the neutral pH. Furthermore, GX1-DGC-DCT showed stronger cytotoxicity against co-cultured gastric cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (co-HUVEC) than DCT within 100 μM. In addition, GX1 efficiently enhanced the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in co-HUVEC cells as confirmed by confocal fluorescence scanning microscopy. Moreover, in vivo delivery of GX1-DGC-DCT was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in SGC791 tumor-bearing mice with tumor inhibition rate (TIR) of 67.05% and no weight loss of mice was observed. The anti-tumor effects were further confirmed by H&E and TUNEL analysis. Therefore, this new drug delivery system represents a potential strategy for gastric cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, bile acids stimulate many receptors and ion channels on the cell surface, the mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Membrane-associating proteins depend on the local spatial distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane (PM) for their function. Here, we report that the highly amphipathic secondary bile   (DCA), a major constituent in the human bile, at doses <1μM enhances the nanoclustering and the PM localization of phosphatidic  (PA) but disrupts the local segregation of phosphatidylserine in the basolateral PM of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. PA is a key structural component of the signaling nano-domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface. We show that DCA promotes the co-localization between PA and EGFR, the PA-driven EGFR dimerization/oligomerization and EGFR signaling. Depletion of PA abolishes the stimulatory effects of DCA on the EGFR oligomerization and signaling. This effect occurs in the cultured Caco-2 cells and the ex vivo human intestinal enteroids. We propose a novel mechanism, where the amphiphilic DCA monomers alter the nano-assemblies of anionic phospholipids and in turn change the dynamic structural integrity of the lipid-driven oligomerization of cell surface receptors and their signal transduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388019>Gut Microbiota-Mediated Bile  Transformations Alter the Cellular Response to Multidrug Resistant Transporter Substrates in Vitro: Focus on P-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Pharmacokinetic research at the host-microbe interface has been primarily directed toward effects on drug , with fewer investigations considering the absorption process. We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional expression of genes encoding intestinal transporters involved in lipid translocation are altered in germ-free and conventionalized mice possessing distinct bile  signatures. It was consequently hypothesized that microbial bile  , which is the deconjugation and dehydroxylation of the bile  steroid nucleus by gut bacteria, may impact upon drug transporter expression and/or activity and potentially alter drug disposition. Using a panel of three human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2, T84, and HT-29) that differ in basal transporter expression level, bile  conjugation-, and hydroxylation-status was shown to influence the transcription of genes encoding several major influx and efflux transporter proteins. We further investigated if these effects on transporter mRNA would translate to altered drug disposition and activity. The results demonstrated that the conjugation and hydroxylation status of the bile  steroid nucleus can influence the cellular response to multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates, a finding that did not directly correlate with directionality of gene or protein expression. In particular, we noted that the cytotoxicity of cyclosporine A was significantly augmented in the presence of the unconjugated bile acids  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in P-gp positive cell lines, as compared to their taurine/glycine-conjugated counterparts, implicating P-gp in the molecular response. Overall this work identifies a novel mechanism by which gut microbial metabolites may influence drug accumulation and suggests a potential role for the microbial bile -deconjugating enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in ameliorating multidrug resistance through the generation of bile  species with the capacity to access and inhibit P-gp ATPase. The physicochemical property of nonionization is suggested to underpin the preferential ability of unconjugated bile acids to attenuate the efflux of P-gp substrates and to sensitize tumorigenic cells to cytotoxic therapeutics in vitro. This work provides new impetus to investigate whether perturbation of the gut microbiota, and thereby the bile  component of the intestinal metabolome, could alter drug pharmacokinetics in vivo. These findings may additionally contribute to the development of less toxic P-gp modulators, which could overcome MDR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30222962>Factors Associated With Histologic Response in Adult Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of liver transplantation, and many trials are underway to evaluate potential therapies. The farnesoid X receptor ligand obeticholic  in the NASH treatment trial evaluated the effects of obeticholic  vs placebo on histologic response (defined as decrease in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS] by ≥2, with no worsening of fibrosis); 45% of patients had a histologic response to obeticholic  (25 mg), and 21% had a response to placebo (P < .01). We performed a secondary analysis of data from this trial to identify clinical parameters associated with a histologic response.We used a logistic regression model with a stepwise selection procedure to identify baseline and early on-treatment factors associated with a histologic response at 72 weeks. Baseline demographics, liver histology, medical history, concomitant medications, cardiometabolic parameters, and serum biochemistry, as well as the changes over the course of the trial (at weeks 12 and 24), were evaluated as potential predictors of a histologic response. The model was cross-validated by a jackknife method, and performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.The logistic regression model found that obeticholic  treatment, baseline NAS > 5, baseline triglyceride level ≤ 154 mg/dL, baseline international normalized ratio ≤ 1, baseline aspartate aminotransferase level ≤ 49 U/L, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level at week 24 by 17 U/L or more, to be significantly associated with histologic response (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.89; P < .0001).In a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of obeticholic  in patients with NASH, we identified routine clinical and laboratory parameters during the first 24 weeks of treatment (such as baseline NAS, triglyceride levels, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level) to significantly associate with histologic markers of response.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

However, its effects on the fetus are not clearly known. To better guide its clinical use, we aimed to study the mechanism underlying the placental transport of UDCA. The uptake and efflux of UDCA across placental apical membranes were studied using BeWo cells; effects of different exposure durations, UDCA concentrations, temperatures, and inhibitors of transporters were studied. A transwell assay was performed, and UDCA concentration in both fetal and maternal sides was measured using LC-MS/MS. Higher unidirectional transport of UDCA was observed in the basolateral-to-apical direction than in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Ko143 and verapamil, which are typical inhibitors of efflux transporters, significantly increased UDCA transport from different directions. UDCA uptake from the apical membrane of BeWo cells was time-dependent, but sodium-independent. It was inhibited by inhibitors of energy  and of organic anion transporters, indicating an active transport mechanism. UDCA uptake from the apical membranes of BeWo cells could be mediated by organic anion-transporting polypeptides, whereas its efflux could be mediated by breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistant protein 3. The results of the present study may provide a basis for UDCA use in pregnancy.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912732>Ingestion of difructose anhydride III partially suppresses the deconjugation and 7α-dehydroxylation of bile acids in rats fed with a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Difructose anhydride III (DFAIII) is a prebiotic involved in the reduction of secondary bile acids (BAs).

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645370>Regulations of bile   in mouse models with hydrophobic bile  composition.</a></h2><p>The bile  (BA) composition in mice is substantially different from that in humans. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 , for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771505>Neurotoxic effects of MPTP on mouse cerebral cortex: Modulation of neuroinflammation as a neuroprotective strategy.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of intracellular inclusions, known as Lewy bodies. Despite SNpc being considered the primary affected region in PD, the neuropathological features are confined solely to the nigro-striatal axis. With disease progression other brain regions are also affected, namely the cerebral cortex, although the spreading of the neurologic damage to this region is still not completely unraveled. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is an endogenous bile  that has been shown to have antioxidant properties and to exhibit a neuroprotective effect in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model of PD. Moreover, TUDCA anti-inflammatory properties have been reported in glial cells, making it a prominent therapeutic agent in PD. Here, we used C57BL/6 mice injected with MPTP in a sub-acute paradigm aiming to investigate if the neurotoxic effects of MPTP could be extended to the cerebral cortex. In parallel, we evaluated the anti-oxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of TUDCA. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms elicited by TUDCA were further dissected in microglia cells. Our results show that MPTP leads to a decrease of ATP and activated AMP-activated protein kinase levels in mice cortex, and to a transient increase in the expression of antioxidant downstream targets of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and parkin. Notably, MPTP increases pro-inflammatory markers, while down-regulating the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein Annexin-A1 (ANXA1). Importantly, we show that TUDCA treatment prevents the deleterious effects of MPTP, sustains increased levels of antioxidant enzymes and parkin, and most of all negatively modulates neuroinflammation and up-regulates ANXA1 expression. Additionally, results from cellular models using microglia corroborate TUDCA modulation of ANXA1 synthesis, linking inhibition of neuroinflammation and neuroprotection by TUDCA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation and chemical chaperones have been known to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve β-cell function and survival. The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic -conjugated exendin-4 as a protective agent for pancreatic β-cells. Mono-tauroursodeoxycholic -Lys-exendin-4 conjugate (TUM1-Ex4) showed better receptor binding affinity than other conjugates with strong in vitro insulinotropic activity in rat pancreatic β-cells and in vivo hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In INS-1 cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by thapsigargin, TUM1-Ex4 promoted cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, TUM1-Ex4 reduced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker GRP78 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. These results reveal that TUM1-Ex4 accelerates translational recovery and contributes to β-cell protection and survival. The present study indicates that the chemical chaperone-coupled glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist is a feasible therapeutic strategy to enhance β-cell function and survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional experimental methods relied upon animal testing and are renowned for being time consuming and expensive as well as being ethically unfavourable. As a result, the development of alternative methods to evaluate a drug's pharmacokinetics is crucial. Micellar liquid chromatography is considered to be one of these methods that can replace the use of animals in the prediction of HIA. In this study, the combination of an aminopropyl column with the biosurfactant sodium deoxycholate bile salt was used in the experimental determination of micelle-water partition coefficients (log P ) for a group of compounds. Multiple linear regression was then used for the prediction of HIA using the experimentally determined log P along with other molecular descriptors, leading to the construction of a model equation of R  = 85% and a prediction power represented by R  = 72%. The use of micellar liquid chromatography with an aminopropyl column in combination with sodium deoxycholate was found to be a good method for the prediction of human intestinal absorption, providing data for a far wider range of compounds compared with previous studies.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862015>Secondary Bile Acids and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Colon: A Focus on Colonic Microbiome, Cell Proliferation, Inflammation, and Cancer.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids (BAs) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), two major types of bacterial metabolites in the colon, cause opposing effects on colonic inflammation at chronically high physiological levels. Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol , lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between ER stress and lipid  and to verify that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process.An atherosclerosis model was established in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a Western diet, and THP-1 derived macrophages were used in this study. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil Red O staining were used to quantify the atherosclerotic plaques. 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeled oxidized low-density lipoprotein binding assay and a Cholesterol Efflux Fluorometric Assay Kit were used to observe cholesterol uptake and efflux. The mRNA and protein levels of biomarkers associated with ER stress and cholesterol  in atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to observe alterations of ABCA1 localization. Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down CHOP and miR-33 in macrophages to alter CHOP and miR-33 expression.Atherosclerotic lesions and systemic lipid levels were ameliorated after inhibition of ER stress (tauroursodeoxycholic ) in vivo. In vitro studies confirmed that ER stress regulated the lipid catabolism of macrophages by promoting cholesterol uptake, inhibiting cholesterol efflux, and modulating the expression of related transporters. CHOP contributed to lipid  disorder following ER stress. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-33 was involved in ER stress that induced lipid  disorder in macrophages. These findings support a model of ER stress induction by oxidized low-density lipoprotein that affects macrophage lipid catabolism disorder.Our data shed new light on the relationship between ER stress and lipid  in vivo and in vitro, and confirm that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process.

UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, UDCA attenuates BRB breakdown during DR development via inhibiting retinal inflammation and reversing the reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) including claudin-1 and claudin-19.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, owing to divergent data, the objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of UDCA on glycemic parameters in clinical trials. Clinical trials investigating the impact of UDCA treatment on glycemic markers were searched in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases (from inception to April 16, 2018). A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A weighted random-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on glycemic parameters. Meta-analysis of seven studies comprising eight treatment arms revealed a significant reduction of fasting glucose levels following UDCA therapy (WMD: -3.30 mg/dL, 95% CI: -6.36, -0.24, p = 0.034; I = 28.95%). Also, meta-analysis of two treatment arms indicated a significant reduction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations (WMD: -0.41% mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.81, -0.01, p = 0.042; I = 0%). Additionally, meta-analysis of four treatment arms also revealed a significant reduction in plasma insulin levels (WMD: -1.50 mg/dL, 95% CI: -2.81, -0.19, p = 0.025; I = 67.90%) but not significant effect HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.20 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.01, p = 0.057; I = 85.34%). Results of this meta-analysis showed that UDCA significantly reduces fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and insulin concentrations suggesting a positive impact on glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Aim of the present study was to investigate whether the positive effects of OCA treatment are apparent also on ongoing bleomycin-induced PF, i.e., after 2 weeks of bleomycin administration.Bleomycin-induced PF rats were treated 2 weeks after bleomycin administration with OCA or pirfenidone for two additional weeks. Pulmonary function test was performed at 2 and 4 weeks in all experimental groups. At the same time points, lung morphological features and mRNA expression profile of genes related to fibrosis, inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were also assessed.After 2 weeks, bleomycin significantly increased the pressure at the airway opening (PAO), a functional parameter related to fibrosis-induced lung stiffness, and induced diffuse lung interstitium fibrosis, with upregulation of inflammation (IL1β, MCP1) and tissue remodeling (COL1A1, COL3A1, ET1, MMP7, PDGFa, αSMA, SNAI1) markers. At week four, a further increase of lung fibrosis and PAO was observed, accompanied by upregulation of extracellular matrix-related mRNA expression. OCA administration, even after the establishment of PF, significantly improved pulmonary function, normalizing PAO, and reverted the bleomycin-induced lung alterations, with significant reduction of markers of inflammation (CD206, COX2, HIF1, IL1β, MCP1), epithelial proliferation (CTGF, PDGFa) and fibrosis (COL1A1, COL3A1, ET1, FN1, MMPs, αSMA, SNAIs, TGFβ1, TIMPs). Results with OCA were similar or superior to those obtained with pirfenidone.In conclusion, our results demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect of OCA in already established PF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239660>Ocular anti-inflammatory activity of prednisolone acetate loaded chitosan-deoxycholate self-assembled nanoparticles.</a></h2><p> Conventional topical ophthalmic aqueous solutions and suspensions are often associated with low bioavailability and high administration frequency, pulsatile dose and poor exposure to certain ocular parts. The aim of this study was to develop an ophthalmic nanoparticles loaded gel, for delivering prednisolone acetate (PA), to increase dosing accuracy, bioavailability, and accordingly, efficiency of PA in treating inflammatory ocular diseases.  A novel formulation of self-assembled nanoparticles was prepared by the complexation of chitosan (CS) and, the counter-ion, sodium deoxycholate (SD), loaded with the poorly-water-soluble PA. Particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (LC) of prepared nanoparticles were assessed. Moreover, the nanoparticles were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release and eye anti-inflammatory potential of the prepared novel formulation was investigated.  Mean particle size of the nanoparticles have dropped from 976 nm ±43 (PDI 1.285) to 480 nm ±28 (PDI 1.396) when the ratio of CS-SD was decreased. The incorporation of 0.1-0.3% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), in the preparation stages, resulted in smaller nanoparticles: 462 nm ±19 (PDI 0.942) and 321 nm ±22 (PDI 0.454) respectively. DSC and FTIR results demonstrated the interaction between CS and SD, however, no interactions were detected between PA and CS or SD. Drug release of PA as received, in simulated tears fluid (pH 7.4), showed a twofold increase (reaching an average of 98.6% in 24 hours) when incorporated into an optimized nanoparticle gel formulation (1:5 CS-SD).  The anti-inflammatory effect of PA nanoparticles loaded gel on female guinea pig eyes was significantly superior to that of the micronized drug loaded gel ( < 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29863653>Sodium Deoxycholate for Contouring of the Jowl: Our Preliminary Experience.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30422681>Pharmacological effects of nanoencapsulation of human-based dosing of probucol on ratio of secondary to primary bile acids in gut, during induction and progression of type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>The ratio of secondary to primary bile acids changes during Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) development and these effects might be ameliorated by using cholesterol lowering drugs or hydrophilic bile acids. Probucol is a cholesterol-lowering drug, while ursodeoxycholic  is a hydrophilic bile . This study investigated whether nanoencapsulated probucol with ursodeoxycholic  altered bile  ratios and the development of diabetes.Balb/c mice were divided into three groups and gavaged daily with either free probucol, nanoencapsulated probucol or nanoencapsulated probucol with ursodeoxycholic  for seven days.

However, whether  of bile acids is involved in the  complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the effects of bile acids on the prognosis of ESRD remain obscure. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between altered bile  profile and the prognosis of ESRD patients.A targeted metabolomics approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine the changes in serum bile acids between ESRD patients ( = 77) and healthy controls ( = 30). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to screen the differential proportions of bile acids between the two groups.Six differentially expressed bile acids were identified as potential biomarkers for differentiating ESRD patients from healthy subjects. The decreased concentrations of chenodeoxycholic ,  and cholic  were significantly associated with dyslipidemia in ESRD patients. Subgroup analyses revealed that the significantly increased concentrations of taurocholic , taurochenodeoxycholic , taurohyocholic  and tauro α-muricholic  were correlated to the poor prognosis of ESRD patients.The serum bile  profile of ESRD patients differed significantly from that of healthy controls.

Glycyrrhizin (GL), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine liquorice, has potent hepatoprotective effects in both preclinical animal models and in humans. However, little is currently known about its effects and mechanisms in treating NASH. To explore the effects of GL on NASH, GL or its active metabolite glycyrrhetinic  (GA) was administered to mice treated with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model, and histologic and biochemical analyses were used to measure the degree of lipid disruption, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. GL significantly improved MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis and inhibited activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. GL significantly attenuated serum bile  accumulation in MCD diet-fed mice partially by restoring inflammation-mediated hepatic farnesoid X receptor inhibition. In Raw 264.7 macrophage cells, both GL and GA inhibited -induced NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation. Notably, both intraperitoneal injection of GL's active metabolite GA and oral administration of GL prevented NASH in mice, indicating that GL may attenuate NASH via its active metabolite GA. These results reveal that GL, via restoration of bile  homeostasis and inhibition of inflammatory injury, can be a therapeutic option for treatment of NASH.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30240471>Effect of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on liver biochemistry and quality of life in patients with primary biliary cholangitis treated with ursodeoxycholic .

The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of SAMe supplementation on liver biochemistry and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with PBC, treated with UDCA.In this prospective pilot, proof of the principle, non-randomized and open label study we enrolled 24 patients with PBC treated with UDCA for at least 6 months. They had received both UDCA in a standard dose of 13-15 mg/kg b.w. and SAMe in the dose of 1200 mg daily over a period of 6 months. A group of 24 patients with PBC treated with UDCA served as control for liver biochemistry (Study registered on the platform ClinicalTrials.gov under ID: ).We observed a significant decrease of ALP, GGT and total cholesterol in non-cirrhotic patients treated with SAMe. There was also a significant improvement of fatigue and pruritus in PBC-40 questionnaire and amelioration of anxiety in STAI 2 questionnaire in the SAMe group. Treatment with SAMe neither increased sulfation capacity of the liver nor had an effect on fibroblast growth factor-19 serum levels.Our pilot study demonstrates a positive effect of adding SAMe to UDCA in non-cirrhotic patients with PBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348664>Ceftriaxone Absorption Enhancement for Noninvasive Administration as an Alternative to Injectable Solutions.</a></h2><p>Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of infant mortality in developing countries because of delayed injectable treatment, making it urgent to develop noninjectable formulations that can reduce treatment delays in resource-limited settings. Ceftriaxone, available only for injection, needs absorption enhancers to achieve adequate bioavailability via nonparenteral administration. This article presents all available data on the nonparenteral absorption of ceftriaxone in humans and animals, including unpublished work carried out by F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) in the 1980s and new data from preclinical studies with rabbits, and discusses the importance of these data for the development of noninjectable formulations for noninvasive treatment. The combined results indicate that the rectal absorption of ceftriaxone is feasible and likely to lead to a bioavailable formulation that can reduce treatment delays in neonatal sepsis. A bile salt, chenodeoxycholate sodium salt (Na-CDC), used as an absorption enhancer at a 125-mg dose, together with a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone provided 24% rectal absorption of ceftriaxone and a maximal plasma concentration of 21 µg/ml with good tolerance in human subjects.

The expression of mutated lamin A, termed progerin, causes a rare genetic aging disorder, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, which shows abnormal bone formation with the decrease in a number of osteoblasts and osteocytes. However, exact molecular mechanism how progerin exerts depressive effects on osteogenesis has not been fully understood. Here, we created mouse lamin A dC50 cDNA encoding progerin that lacks 50 amino  residues at C-terminus, transfected it in mouse preosteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and examined the changes in osteoblast phenotype. When lamin A dC50-expressed cells were cultured with differentiation-inductive medium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mRNA levels of major osteoblast markers, type I collagen (Col1), bone sialoprotein (BSP), dentine matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and Runx2 were significantly decreased, and no mineralized nodules were detected as seen in control cells expressing empty vector. In the culture with mineralization-inductive medium, mRNA levels of BSP, osteocalcin, DMP1, Runx2, and osterix were strongly decreased parallel with loss of mineralization in lamin A dC50-expressed cells, while mineralized nodules appear at 21 days in control cells. Furthermore, lamin A dC50 expression was depressed nuclear localization of β-catenin with the decrease of GSK-3β phosphorylation level. These results suggest that lamin A dC50 depresses osteoblast differentiation in both early and late stages, and it negatively regulates β-catenin activity interacting with GSK-3β in cytoplasm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30093032>Enhanced cytotoxic and apoptotic potential in hepatic carcinoma cells of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with ginsenoside compound K.</a></h2><p>Ginsenoside compound K (CK) has been shown to exhibit anticancer properties.

Additionally, it acts as a cell protector with unclear mechanism but may be implicated in combating against inflammation, fibrosis and cancers. FXR is thus accepted as a promising target particularly for the enterohepatic diseases, and numerous FXR modulators have been patented and developed.This review provides an update on the development of FXR modulators for enterohepatic diseases and offers an in-depth perspective on new strategies for the development of novel FXR modulators.Despite the development of numerous FXR modulators, which culminated in the successful launch of obeticholic  (OCA), it remains a matter of debate on how the function of FXR should be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The improvement for obesity achieved by either FXR agonists or antagonists is still in confusion. Whether the side effect of pruritus induced by OCA could be exempted for non-steroidal FXR agonists needs further validation. Apart from the development of conventional FXR ligands, emerging evidence support that restoration of FXR protein level may represent a new strategy in targeting FXR for enterohepatic and  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511198>Disease Progression and Pharmacological Intervention in a Nutrient-Deficient Rat Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>There is a marked need for improved animal models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to facilitate the development of more efficacious drug therapies for the disease.Here, we investigated the development of fibrotic NASH in male Wistar rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino -defined (CDAA) diet with or without cholesterol supplementation for subsequent assessment of drug treatment efficacy in NASH biopsy-confirmed rats. The  profile and liver histopathology were evaluated after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of dieting. Subsequently, rats with biopsy-confirmed NASH were selected for pharmacological intervention with vehicle, elafibranor (30 mg/kg/day) or obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks.The CDAA diet led to marked hepatomegaly and fibrosis already after 4 weeks of feeding, with further progression of collagen deposition and fibrogenesis-associated gene expression during the 12-week feeding period. Cholesterol supplementation enhanced the stimulatory effect of CDAA on gene transcripts associated with fibrogenesis without significantly increasing collagen deposition. Pharmacological intervention with elafibranor, but not OCA, significantly reduced steatohepatitis scores, and fibrosis-associated gene expression, however, was unable to prevent progression in fibrosis scores.CDAA-fed rats develop early-onset progressive NASH, which offers the opportunity to probe anti-NASH compounds with potential disease-modifying properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29863796>Ursodeoxycholic  suppresses the formation of fructose/streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract in rats.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on fructose/streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract in rats. The diabetic model (DM) was induced through the administration of 10% fructose in drinking water for 2 weeks followed by streptozotocin injection (intraperitoneal). One week later, hyperglycemia was assisted and diabetic animals were treated with UDCA either as local eye drops (0.5% solution, four times/day) or orally (100 mg/kg b.w.). Cataract formation was monitored biweekly and scored into four stages. After 12 weeks of treatment, rats were subjected to ophthalmological examination, and then, their blood and lenses were prepared for biochemical analysis of glucose, insulin, reduced glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, caspase-12, and lenticular total proteins. In addition, tertiary structure and conformational changes of lenticular soluble proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and UV absorption while changes in lenticular α-crystallin structure were investigated using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Results demonstrated that both local and oral UDCA restored the normal levels of lens T-AOC, MDA, H O , and caspase-12 and improved noticeably the levels of the lens GSH and total proteins. In addition, conformational and tertiary structure changes of soluble lens proteins were significantly reduced in UDCA-treated groups. Morphological examination of lenses revealed decreased score of cataract progression in UDCA-treated groups compared to DM animals. It was concluded that UDCA decreased the incidence of diabetic cataract by maintaining the antioxidant status, reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress, and suppressing the structural changes of soluble lens proteins.© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593238>[Effect of fermentation on components of bile acids in Arisaema Cum Bile and determination of three kinds of free bile acids in Arisaema Cum Bile].</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to analyze the compositions of main bile acids in fermented and mixed processing products of arisame cum bile from pig bile, and to establish a method for content determination of bile acids in fermented Arisaema Cum Bile.

HFD was fed for 12 weeks. At the end of two-week HFD, FMT was carried out for two weeks. The gastrointestinal transit, serotonin concentration, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), and the levels of bile acids in intestinal contents were examined.Compared with the control group, the gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal serotonin concentration of HFD-fed rats were increased. In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group. After HFD-fed rats receiving FMT treatment, the gastrointestinal transit, small intestinal serotonin concentration, and TPH1 expression were decreased, while SERT expression was not affected. Moreover, the levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also decreased.FMT could alleviate small intestinal transit in the HFD-fed rats by regulating the serotonin biosynthesis.

No effective medical therapy is currently available for the disease. We previously found that norUDCA improves the α1AT deficiency associated liver disease by promoting autophagic degradation of α1ATZ protein in liver in a mouse model of the disease. The current study unravels the novel underlying cellular mechanism by which norUDCA modulates autophagy. HTOZ cells, modified from HeLa Tet-Off cells by transfection with the resulting pTRE1-ATZ plasmid and expressing mutant Z proteins, were studied in these experiments. The role of norUDCA in inducing autophagy, autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ and the role of AMPK in norUDCA-induced autophagy were examined in the current report. NorUDCA promoted disposal of α1ATZ via autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ in HTOZ cells. Activation of AMPK was required for norUDCA-induced autophagy and α1ATZ degradation. Moreover, mTOR/ULK1 was involved in norUDCA-induced AMPK activation and autophagy in HTOZ cells.

Our primary aim was to examine how the host adapts to the stress of microbe-derived secondary BAs by P450-mediated oxidative modifications on the steroid nucleus. Five unconjugated tri-hydroxyl BAs that were structurally and/or biologically associated with deoxycholate (DCA) were determined in human biologic samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with enzyme-digestion techniques. They were identified as DCA-19-ol, DCA-6-ol, DCA-5-ol, DCA-6-ol, DCA-1-ol, and DCA-4-ol based on matching in-laboratory synthesized standards.  inhibition assays in human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 assays revealed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 were responsible for the regioselective oxidations of both DCA and its conjugated forms, glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA). The modification of secondary BAs to tertiary BAs defines a host liver (primary BAs)-gut microbiota (secondary BAs)-host liver (tertiary BAs) axis. The regioselective oxidations of DCA, GDCA, and TDCA by CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 may help eliminate host-toxic DCA species.

However, there are currently no data to support the use of UDCA to improve pregnancy outcome as none of the trials performed to date have been powered to address this question.The PITCHES trial is a triple-masked, placebo-controlled randomised trial, to evaluate UDCA versus placebo in women with ICP between 20 + 0 to 40 + 6 weeks' gestation. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if UDCA treatment of women with ICP between 20 + 0 and 40 + 6 weeks' gestation reduces the primary perinatal outcome: a composite of perinatal death (as defined by in utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7 days) or preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or neonatal unit admission for at least 4 h (from infant delivery until hospital discharge). The secondary objectives of the trial are (1) to investigate the effect of UDCA on other short-term outcomes for both mother and infant and (2) to assess the impact of UDCA on health care resource use, in terms of the total number of nights for mother and infant, together with level of care.Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for the treatment of ICP is inconsistent, with some units routinely prescribing UDCA, others prescribing very little and the remainder offering it variably. Our previous pilot trial of UDCA in women with ICP demonstrated that the trial would be feasible, and the research question remains active and unanswered. Results are highly likely to influence clinical practice, through direct management and impact on national and international guidelines.ISRCTN registry, ID: ISRCTN91918806 .

Two enantiocomplementary hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (7α- and 7β-HSDHs) can carry out this transformation fully selectively by specific oxidation of the 7α-OH group of the substrate and subsequent reduction of the keto intermediate to the final product (7β-OH). With a view to developing robust and active biocatalysts, novel NADH-active 7β-HSDH species are necessary to enable a solely NAD -dependent redox-neutral cascade for UDCA production. A wild-type NADH-dependent 7β-HSDH from Lactobacillus spicheri (Ls7β-HSDH) was identified, recombinantly expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized. Using this novel NAD -dependent 7β-HSDH enzyme in combination with 7α-HSDH from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia permitted the biotransformations of CA and CDCA in the presence of catalytic amounts of NAD , resulting in high yields (>90 %) of UCA and UDCA.© 2018 The Authors.

Modifications (e.g., oxidation and 7-dehydroxylation) are predominantly exerted by the intestinal microbiota. Bile acids can be found in almost all living organisms, and their concentration and  can be used for the assessment of the pathological and nutritional status of an organism. Electrochemical oxidation is a rapid, relatively inexpensive approach to simulate natural  redox processes in vitro. This technique further allows the identification of oxidative degradation  of individual substances, as well as the demonstration of binding studies of generated oxidation products with biologically relevant molecules. When coupling an electrochemical and a high-resolution mass spectrometric system, oxidation products can be generated and identified directly by non-targeted ESI-MS. Here, a method for the generation of oxidation products of the primary bile acids cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  was exemplarily developed. Most products and the highest intensities were observed at a pH value of 6. For cholic , a high potential of 3 V was necessary, while for chenodeoxycholic , a potential of 2.4 V led to a higher number of oxidation products. In a second approach, a binding study with glutathione was performed to simulate phase II . It was possible to detect signals of free glutathione, free bile acids, and adducts of both reactants. As the resulting mass spectra also showed some new signals of the oxidized bile , which could not be observed without glutathione, it can be assumed that glutathione is able to bind reactive oxidation species before reacting with other products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026063>Identification of 4-methyl-5-oxo-octane-1,8-dioic  and the derivatives as metabolites of steroidal C,D-ring degradation in Comamonas testosteroni TA441.</a></h2><p>Comamonas testosteroni TA441 degrades steroids via 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic , which is presumed to be further degraded by β-oxidation.

Given the complexity of the mega-variate bacterial community residing in the gastrointestinal tract, studying associations between individual bacterial genera and bile  processing remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel  approach to determine the bacterial genera associated with the  of different primary bile acids and their potential to contribute to inter-individual variation in this processing. Anaerobic, pH-controlled batch cultures were inoculated with human fecal microbiota and treated with individual conjugated primary bile acids (500 μg/ml) to serve as the sole substrate for 24 h. Samples were collected throughout the experiment (0, 5, 10, and 24 h) and the bacterial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the bile  signatures were characterized using a targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach. Data fusion techniques were used to identify statistical bacterial- linkages. An increase in gut bacteria associated bile acids was observed over 24 h with variation in the rate of bile   across the volunteers ( = 7). Correlation analysis identified a significant association between the  genus and the deconjugation of glycine conjugated bile acids while the deconjugation of taurocholic  was associated with bacteria from the  and  genera. A positive correlation between  and  production suggest a potential role for this genus in cholic  dehydroxylation. A slower deconjugation of taurocholic  was observed in individuals with a greater abundance of  and . This work demonstrates the utility of integrating compositional (metataxonomics) and functional (metabonomics) systems biology approaches, coupled to  model systems, to study the biochemical capabilities of bacteria within complex ecosystems. Characterizing the dynamic interactions between the gut microbiota and the bile  pool enables a greater understanding of how variation in the gut microbiota influences host bile  signatures, their associated functions and their implications for health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666146>A pilot study of fecal bile  and microbiota profiles in inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to arise from an abnormal immune response to the gut microbiota. IBD is associated with altered intestinal microbial community structure and functionality, which may contribute to inflammation and complications such as colon cancer and liver disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with IBD and markedly increases the risk of colon cancer. We hypothesized that secondary bile acids, which are products of microbial , are increased in PSC patients.Here, we profiled the fecal bile  composition and gut microbiota of participants with IBD and PSC, as well as healthy participants. Additionally, we tested the effects of vancomycin, a proposed treatment for PSC, on gut microbiota and fecal bile  composition in participants with IBD and PSC.Fecal samples were collected from patients with IBD, IBD/PSC and healthy controls and fecal bile acids and DNA for microbiota analysis were extracted. Fecal bile acids were averaged over a seven-day period. For subjects with IBD/PSC, oral vancomycin 500mg twice a day was administered and fecal samples were collected for up to eleven weeks.Participants with IBD and PSC had less fecal microbial diversity at baseline relative to controls. While there was some evidence of altered conversion of cholic  to , no substantial differences were found in the fecal bile  profiles of patients with IBD and PSC (n=7) compared to IBD alone (n=8) or healthy controls (n=8). Oral vancomycin was a potent inhibitor of secondary bile  production in participants with IBD and PSC, particularly , although no changes in liver biochemistry patterns were noted over a two week period.In this pilot study, bile  profiles were overall similar among patients with IBD and PSC, IBD alone, and healthy controls.

However, the mechanism of immune signaling  linked to colitis-associated cancer (CAC) has not been fully elucidated. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TUDCA in the pathogenesis of CAC.Colitis-associated cancer was induced in mice using azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate administration, and TUDCA's effect on tumor development was evaluated. HCT 116 and COLO 205 were treated with TUDCA or vehicle and then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation was evaluated by immunoblot assay. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell viability assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF were performed.Tauroursodeoxycholic  significantly attenuated the development of CAC in mice. Exposure to TUDCA resulted in extensive epithelial apoptosis and reduced levels of phospho-IκB kinase in the colon. In HCT 116 cells stimulated with TNF-α, TUDCA significantly inhibited IL-8 and IL-1α expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, in both HCT 116 and COLO 205 cells, TUDCA reduced cell viability and downregulated the expression of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF.These results demonstrated that TUDCA suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates colitis-associated tumorigenesis, suggesting that TUDCA could be a potential treatment for CAC.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31151511>Angelica sinensis polysaccharide nanoparticles as a targeted drug delivery system for enhanced therapy of liver cancer.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the utilization of polysaccharides as targeted drug carriers has attracted considerable attention. Herein, Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a plant polysaccharide with good biocompatibility, excellent aqueous solubility and intrinsic liver-targeted capability, was modified with hydrophobic group () to fabricate amphiphilic conjugate (ASP-DOCA). Self-assembled nanoparticles were successfully developed for hepatoma-targeted delivery of therapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). The DOX loaded nanoparticles (DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs) were spherical in shape with a particle size of 228 nm and negatively charged around -17 mV. DOX was released from nanoparticles in a sustainable and pH-dependent manner. In vitro cellular uptake revealed that DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs were internalized into HepG2 cells through asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-mediated endocytosis, resulting in a higher anti-proliferation effect than DOX-loaded dextran derivative DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Additionally, DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs showed higher inhibition on the growth of HepG2 multicellular spheroids (MCs) than DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. In vivo imaging demonstrated that ASP-DOCA NPs specifically targeted HepG2 tumors via ASGPR, improving the accumulation of DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs in tumors and generating superior antitumor activity compared with free DOX and DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Taken together, ASP-DOCA NPs possess potential applications in drug delivery systems targeting liver cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are still some doubts about TCM because of the questionable TCM theories and unclear biological active compounds. In recent years, gut microbiota has emerged as an important frontier to understand the development and progress of diseases. Together with this trend, an increasing number of studies have indicated that drug molecules can interact with gut microbiota after oral administration. In this context, more and more studies pertaining to TCM have paid attention to gut microbiota and have yield rich information for understanding TCM. After oral administration, TCM can interact with gut microbiota: (1) TCM can modulate the composition of gut microbiota; (2) TCM can modulate the  of gut microbiota; (3) gut microbiota can transform TCM compounds. During the interactions, two types of metabolites can be produced: gut microbiota metabolites (of food and host origin) and gut microbiota transformed TCM compounds. In this review, we summarized the interactions between TCM and gut microbiota, and the pharmacological effects and features of metabolites produced during interactions between TCM and gut microbiota. Then, focusing on gut microbiota and metabolites, we summarized the aspects in which gut microbiota has facilitated our understanding of TCM. At the end of this review, the outlooks for further research of TCM and gut microbiota were also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current study, we aim to elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut microbiota during obesity development, employing high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in a rat model. We collected feces and plasma, liver tissues, and segments of intestinal tissues and a developed bile acids quantification method by employing an ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS) strategy. We then assessed bile acids fluxes in the biological matrixes collected. We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids were the dominant species in the liver whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma. However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acids pool and particularly the increases in the levels of  (DCA) (138.67 ± 37.225 nmol/L in control group, 242.61 ± 43.16 nmol/L in HFD group, p = 0.014) and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) (2.8 ± 0.247 nmol/g in control group, 4.5 ± 0.386 nmol/g in HFD group, p = 0.0018) in plasma and liver tissues, respectively, which were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. These changes are correlated to an increase in abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which statins induce myotoxicity have not been fully addressed. Recent reports showed that statins induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death in immune cells and myoblasts in vitro. Therefore, the goal of study is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which statins induce skeletal muscle cell death and myopathy via the regulation of ER stress. Biochemical data showed that TUDCA, an ER stress inhibitor, inhibited atorvastatin- and simvastatin-induced protein cleavages of PARP-1 and caspase-3, respectively. Actually, statin treatment activated marker proteins of unfolded protein responses (UPR) including ATF6, CHOP, and spliced XBP1 and these responses were inhibited by TUDCA. In addition, statin treatment induced mRNA levels of UPR marker genes, suggesting that statins activate ER stress in a transcriptional regulation. The physiological relevance of ER stress in statin-induced myopathy was demonstrated in a mouse model of myopathy, in which instillation of simvastatin and atorvastatin led to myopathy. Notably, the reduction of muscular endurance in response to statin instillation was significantly improved in TUDCA treating group compared to vehicle control group. Moreover, CHOP deficiency mice showed restoration of statin-induced reduction of muscular endurance, suggesting that statin induces myopathy via ER stress and in a CHOP-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings indicate that statins specifically induce myopathy in an ER stress-dependent manner, suggesting the therapeutic potential of ER stress regulation in preventing adverse effects of statin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

When a surfactant is introduced into a solution of DEC, changes of the spectral-fluorescent properties are observed due to decomposition of dye dimers into cis-monomers and cis-trans conversion of the resulting monomers. In the presence of SDS, both processes occur in parallel, caused by noncovalent interaction of dye monomers with micelles, and mainly occur near the critical micelle concentration (CMC). In contrast, upon the introduction of increasing concentrations of bile salts, decomposition of dye dimers into the monomers begins at lower concentrations than cis-trans conversion. The former process is almost completed at concentrations close to CMC of secondary micelles (CMC2), while the latter process occurs even at concentrations of bile salts much higher than CMC2. Hence, DEC can serve as a probe that permits estimating the value of CMC2 and is indicative of reorganization of secondary micelles upon an increase in bile salt concentration. Aggregation of DEC and Cyan 2 on bile salts is also observed. Since it is observed at relatively low concentrations of bile salts (<CMC2), the aggregation probably occurs on monomeric molecules of bile salts and their small associates and primary micelles. Decomposition of the aggregates formed begins at concentrations of bile salts above CMC2 (that is, upon the interaction with secondary micelles).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the intestinal membrane permeability and epithelial cell uptake of PMX were synergistically improved after HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/P188 was incorporated into a nanoemulsion with a size of 14.5±0.45 nm. The in vitro permeability of HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/P188-NE across a Caco-2 cell monolayer was 9.82-fold greater than that of free PMX, which might be attributable to the partitioning of PMX to the epithelial cells being facilitated via specific interaction of DCK with bile  transporters, as well as the enhanced lipophilicity accompanied by surfactant-induced changes in the intestinal membrane structure and fluidity. Therefore, the oral bioavailability of HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/P188-NE in rats was evaluated as 26.8%±2.98% which was 223% higher than that of oral PMX. Moreover, oral HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/P188-NE significantly suppressed tumor growth in Lewis lung carcinoma cell-bearing mice, and the tumor volume was maximally inhibited by 61% compared with that in the control group.These results imply that HP-beta-CD/PMX/DCK/P188-NE is an effective and promising delivery system for enhancing the oral absorption of PMX.

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA . To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants.

We investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), an agonist of FXR, on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice. Sixty male mice were randomly divided into six groups, and orally administered with or without OCA once daily for 3 consecutive days before LPS (1.0 mg/kg).

Additional experiment showed that OCA alleviated LPS-induced up-regulation of pulmonary pro-inflammatory and chemokine genes. Moreover, OCA also repressed LPS-induced the release of TNF-α and KC in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In contrast, OCA further up-regulated LPS-induced the expression of Il-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Further study showed that OCA inhibited LPS-evoked NF-κB signaling in the lungs.

Gpbar1 significantly activated caspase 8 and caspase 9 as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p<0.05). Gpbar1 significantly triggered apoptosis associated inflammatory factors as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p<0.05). Gpbar1 significantly induced calcium flux as compared to LV5-NC and LV3-NC (p<0.05). Gpbar1 up-regulated caspases and inflammatory factors in DCA treated pancreatic acinar cells. QYT reversed DCA induced apoptosis and inflammatory response. QYT significantly reduced Gpbar1 levels compared to no-QTY treated cells (p<0.05). In conclusion, QYT protects against DCA induced pancreatic acinar cell damage in ABP by inhibiting Gpbar1/NF-kB/p-RIP signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257812>Vitamin A can ameliorate fibrosis of liver in an established rat model of biliary atresia and Kasai portoenterostomy.</a></h2><p>Antifibrosis therapy may prevent progressive liver fibrosis after successful Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) in biliary atresia (BA) patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of antifibrosis therapy in a rat model of BA and KPE.BA model was created on three-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats by intrabiliary alcohol injection as previously described, and KPE was performed at postoperative week (POW) 5 by cystoenterostomy. Liver biopsies were performed at the time of BA creation, during KPE, POW 9, and at sacrifice (POW 17). Prednisolone (0.1 mg/100 g/day, group 1, n = 20), Vitamin A (0.5 mg/100 g/day, group 2, n = 20), and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA, 1.5 mg/100 g/day, group 3, n = 20) were respectively given to three groups after KPE and continued daily until sacrifice. Histological evaluation of fibrosis and immunohistochemistry stains for 8 fibrosis markers were compared to the control group (without medication, n = 10).Among the four markers, namely ɑ-smooth muscle actin (ɑ-SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tumor growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) receptors 1 and 2, which showed persistently high expression after successful KPE in the examined 8 markers, only the expression of ɑ-SMA was significantly reduced in all treatment groups at POW17. However, the fibrosis grade at POW 17 was only significantly reduced in group 2 in comparison with the control group (Vitamin A vs. control group, Ishak score 3 vs. 1.8, p < 0.05).In our rat model of BA with KPE, Vitamin A was effective in reducing liver fibrosis, and the mechanisms deserve further study.Basic science.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated  diseases.Copyright © 2018.

However, as a result, patients at the highest risk can wait the longest for effective treatment. We determined whether UDCA response can be accurately predicted using pretreatment clinical parameters.We did logistic regression analysis of pretreatment variables in a discovery cohort of patients in the UK with primary biliary cholangitis to derive the best-fitting model of UDCA response, defined as alkaline phosphatase less than 1·67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), measured after 12 months of treatment with UDCA. We validated the model in an external cohort of patients with primary biliary cholangitis and treated with UDCA in Italy. Additionally, we assessed correlations between model predictions and key histological features, such as biliary injury and fibrosis, on liver biopsy samples.2703 participants diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis between Jan 1, 1998, and May 31, 2015, were included in the UK-PBC cohort for derivation of the model. The following pretreatment parameters were associated with lower probability of UDCA response: higher alkaline phosphatase concentration (p<0·0001), higher total bilirubin concentration (p=0·0003), lower aminotransferase concentration (p=0·0012), younger age (p<0·0001), longer interval from diagnosis to the start of UDCA treatment (treatment time lag, p<0·0001), and worsening of alkaline phosphatase concentration from diagnosis (p<0·0001). Based on these variables, we derived a predictive score of UDCA response. In the external validation cohort, 460 patients diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis were treated with UDCA, with follow-up data until May 31, 2016. In this validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the score was 0·83 (95% CI 0·79-0·87). In 20 liver biopsy samples from patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the UDCA response score was associated with ductular reaction (r=-0·556, p=0·0130) and intermediate hepatocytes (probability of response was 0·90 if intermediate hepatocytes were absent vs 0·51 if present).We have derived and externally validated a model based on pretreatment variables that accurately predicts UDCA response. Association with histological features provides face validity.

While the hydrophilic bile  subtype, ursodeoxycholic , has been shown to attenuate hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and thereby improve glucose regulation in mice, the effect of hydrophobic bile  subtypes on ER stress and glucose regulation in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the hydrophobic bile  subtype,  (DCA), on ER stress and glucose regulation. Eight week old C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat diet supplemented with or without DCA. Glucose regulation was assessed by oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing. In addition, circulating bile  profile and hepatic insulin and ER stress signaling were measured. DCA supplementation did not alter body weight or food intake, but did impair glucose regulation. Consistent with the impairment in glucose regulation, DCA increased the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile  profile, decreased hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic ER stress signaling. Together, these data suggest that dietary supplementation of DCA impairs whole body glucose regulation by disrupting hepatic ER homeostasis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279683>Dietary Bile Salt Types Influence the Composition of Biliary Bile Acids and Gut Microbiota in Grass Carp.</a></h2><p>Lipid  can influence host's health. There is increasing evidence for interplay between two key regulating factors in lipid : bile acids (BAs) and gut microbiota. However, very little is known about how types of different diet-supplemented bile salts (BS) influence this interaction . We sought to explore these relationships using grass carp (), which often suffers functional disorder of liver and gallbladder. We studied fluctuations of BAs in the gall and changes of microbial communities in the gut in response to seven different diets: five different BS, chelating BS agent, and control. The BS comprised two primary BS [sodium taurochololate (TCAS) and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCAS)], sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCAS), and two secondary BS [sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCAS) and sodium taurolithocholate (TLCAS)]. Supplementation of primary BS caused a more significant fluctuation of biliary BAs than secondary BS, and TCAS caused a more prominent increase than TCDCAS and TUDCAS. For the gut microbiota, primary BS tended to increase their diversity and induce community succession, secondary BS resulted in a higher firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, while TUDCAS had no significant effects. Changes of the gut microbiota triggered by different types of BS caused alteration in BAs biotransformation. Two-obesity-associated families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with biliary cholic  (CA), taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA), and  (DCA). As both primary and secondary BS resulted in increased synthesis of toxic secondary Bas by the gut microbiota, future studies should pay closer attention to gut microbiota when considering BA treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664196>Expression of flTF and asTF splice variants in various cell strains and tissues.</a></h2><p>Tissue factor (TF) expressed at the protein level includes two isoforms: The membrane‑bound full‑length TF (flTF) and the soluble alternatively spliced TF (asTF). flTF is the major thrombogenic form of TF, whereas asTF is more closely associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and cell growth. In order to further investigate the different expression and functions of TF splice variants, the expression of these two splice variants were detected in numerous cell strains and tissues in the present study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the transcript levels of the TF variants in 11 human cell lines, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, hepatoblastoma, colorectal cancer and umbilical vein cells, and five types of tissue specimen, including placenta, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer (alongside normal cervical tissues) and non‑small cell lung cancer (alongside adjacent and normal tissues). Furthermore, the effects of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and apolipoprotein M (apoM) on the two variants were investigated. The results demonstrated that flTF was the major form of TF, and the mRNA expression levels of flTF were higher than those of asTF in all specimens tested. CDCA significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of the two variants. Furthermore, overexpression of apoM promoted the expression levels of asTF in Caco‑2 cells. The mRNA expression levels of asTF in cervical cancer tissues were significantly higher than in the corresponding normal tissues. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the expression of flTF and asTF in various samples. The results demonstrated that CDCA and apoM may modulate TF isoforms in different cell lines, and suggested that asTF may serve a role in the pathophysiological mechanism underlying cervical cancer development. In conclusion, the TF isoforms serve important and distinct roles in pathophysiological processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669471>Integrating 16S rRNA Sequencing and LC⁻MS-Based Metabolomics to Evaluate the Effects of Live Yeast on Rumen Function in Beef Cattle.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of live yeast on ruminal bacterial diversity and metabolome of beef steer. Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein steers were assigned randomly to one of two treatment sequences in a study with two 25-d experimental periods and a crossover design. The steers were housed in individual pens. The dietary treatments were control (CON) or yeast (YEA; CON plus 15 g/d of live yeast product). Bacterial diversity was examined by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The metabolome analysis was performed using a liquid chromatograph and a mass spectrometry system (LC⁻MS). Live yeast supplementation increased the relative abundance of eight cellulolytic bacterial genera as well as  and . , , and  were not detected in the YEA treatment. Live yeast supplementation increased the concentrations of 4-cyclohexanedione and glucopyranoside and decreased the concentrations of threonic , xanthosine, , lauroylcarnitine, methoxybenzoic , and pentadecylbenzoic . The  BS11,  R-7, and  showed positive correlations with the metabolites involved in amino  biosynthesis and the  of energy substrates; the functions of these bacteria are not fully understood in relation to the mode of action of yeast.

Bile  dysregulation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, that allows enterogenous pathogenic bacteria, including Gram‑negative bacteria and their products lipopolysaccharide (LPS), into the liver via the portal vein, triggering inflammation in the liver. The inflammasome serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects pathogens or danger signals and mediates innate immunity in the liver or gut. Specifically, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains‑containing protein (NLRP)6 inflammasome maintains intestinal microbial balance, by promoting interleukin (IL)‑18‑dependent antimicrobial peptide synthesis and mucus secretion from goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in contrast, primarily induces IL‑1β and aggravates inflammatory liver injury. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome affects the epithelial integrity of cholangiocytes by inducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. In addition, bile acids, including  and chenodeoxycholic , are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages; however, bile acids have the potential to exert the opposite role by interacting with the membrane‑bound Takeda G‑protein receptor 5 or by activating nuclear farnesoid‑X receptor. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammasome, involved in the gut‑liver axis, may provide important insights into the identification of a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver and gut diseases. The present review discusses the roles of the inflammasome in the gut‑liver axis, and the emerging associations between the inflammasome and the intestinal microbiota or the bile acids in the gut‑liver axis.</p></html>
