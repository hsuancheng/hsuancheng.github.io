<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322650>Specific  Markers Are Associated with Future Waist-Gaining Phenotype in Women.</a></h2><p>Our study aims to identify  markers associated with either a gain in abdominal (measured by waist circumference) or peripheral (measured by hip circumference) body fat mass.Data of 4 126 weight-gaining adults (-75 years) from three population-based, prospective German cohort studies (EPIC, KORA, DEGS) were analysed regarding a waist-gaining (WG) or hip-gaining phenotype (HG). The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing.Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Respective odds ratios (OR) ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 for tryptophan, the diacyl- (PC) C32:3, C36:0, C38:0, C38:1, C42:, C42:5, the acyl-alkyl-PCs C32:, C34:0, C36:0, C36:1, C36:, C38:0, C38:, C40:1, C40:, C40:5, C40:6, 42:, C42:3 and -PC C17:0.Both weight-gaining men and women showed a clear tendency to gain more abdominal than peripheral fat. Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial  state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women. Thus, higher levels of specific PCs may play a protective role in gaining waist circumference.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967146>Plasma metabolomic profiling of amino acids and polar lipids in Iranian obese adults.</a></h2><p>Obesity, widely recognized as a serious health concern, is characterized by profoundly altered . However, the intermediate metabolites involved in this change remain largely unknown.We conducted targeted metabolomics profiling to identify moieties associated with adult obesity.In this case-control study of Iranian adults, 200 obese patients were compared with 100 controls based on 104 metabolites profiled by a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis comprised acylcarnitines, diacyl- (PCaa), acyl-alkyl- (PCae), sphingomyelins (SM), -phospholipids (LPC) and amino acids. We performed multivariable linear regression to identify metabolites associated with obesity, adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, total physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.A pattern of 19 metabolites was significantly associated with obesity. Branched chain amino acids, alanine, glutamic acid, proline, tyrosine LPCa C16:1, PCaa C32:1, PCaa C32: and PCaa C38:3 were positively, while serine, asparagine, LPCa C18:1, LPCa C18:, LPCe C18:0, PCae C34:3, PCae C38:4 and PCae C40:6 were negatively associated with obesity (all p < 0.00048).A metabolomic profile containing 9 amino acids and 10 polar lipids may serve as a potential biomarker of adult obesity. Further studies are warranted to replicate these findings as well as investigate potential changes in this profile after weight reduction.</p></html>
