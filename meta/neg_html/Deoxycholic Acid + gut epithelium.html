<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9488329>Characterization and partial purification of a leucine aminopeptidase from Fasciola hepatica.</a></h2><p>An aminopeptidase activity capable of hydrolyzing different aminomethylcoumarin amino acids, but mainly leucine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Leu-NHMc), was detected in  soluble extracts from adult Fasciola hepatica. The enzyme (EC 3.4.11.1) was partially purified by gel filtration and EAH-Sepharose affinity chromatography using bestatin as a ligand. Results obtained by gel filtration, direct fluorogenic substrate analysis in polyacrylamide gel, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that in a native form the enzyme might be aggregated as a high molecular weight complex. By affinity chromatography on concanavalin A Sepharose, the enzyme did not bond to the column showing that it lacks mannose residues. The F. hepatica aminopeptidase was characterized as a metalloproteinase based on its activation by Mn2+ and Mg2+, and its inhibition by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and bestatin. It has an optimal activity at a pH between 8.0 and 8.5. Histochemical localization revealed strong leucine naphthylamidase activity at the cells lining the   of the parasite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3792915>Effects of calcium and pH on the mucosal damage produced by  in the rat colon.</a></h2><p>A single pass perfusion system was used in anaesthetised, restrained rats to examine the effect of changing the composition of the perfusion fluid on the damage caused to the colonic  by . Damage to the colonic surface was monitored with light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and with measurements of deoxyribonucleic  and carbohydrate in the perfusate. New scoring techniques for monitoring alterations in surface  of light microscopy sections were used. The damaging effect of 5 mM  to the colonic  is inhibited by lowering the pH of the perfusion fluid from 7.9 to 5.5, or by increasing the calcium concentration from 0 to 4 mM. This inhibition is shown to be because of a decreased amount of bile  in solution. Thus it is not the total concentration of  in the colon that is responsible for the colonic damage, but the concentration in solution. Although extrapolation to the human situation must be made with caution, the concentration of bile  in solution in the faecal water may be more relevant to colonic mucosal damage than total bile  concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18303091>Effects of bile acids on pancreatic ductal bicarbonate secretion in guinea pig.</a></h2><p>Acute pancreatitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Bile reflux into the pancreas is a common cause of acute pancreatitis and, although the bile can reach both acinar and ductal cells, most research to date has focused on the acinar cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of bile acids on HCO(3)(-) secretion from the ductal .Isolated guinea pig intralobular/interlobular pancreatic ducts were microperfused and the effects of unconjugated chenodeoxycholate (CDC) and conjugated glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and pH (pH(i)) were measured using fluorescent dyes. Changes of pH(i) were used to calculate the rates of /base transport across the duct cell membranes.Luminal administration of a low dose of CDC (0.1 mM) stimulated ductal HCO(3)(-) secretion, which was blocked by luminal H(2)DIDS (dihydro-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic ). In contrast, both luminal and basolateral administration of a high dose of CDC (1 mM) strongly inhibited HCO(3)(-) secretion. Both CDC and GCDC elevated [Ca(2+)](i), and this effect was blocked by BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic ), caffeine, xestospongin C and the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. BAPTA-AM also inhibited the stimulatory effect of low doses of CDC on HCO(3)(-) secretion, but did not modulate the inhibitory effect of high doses of CDC.It is concluded that the HCO(3)(-) secretion stimulated by low concentrations of bile acids acts to protect the pancreas against toxic bile, whereas inhibition of HCO(3)(-) secretion by high concentrations of bile acids may contribute to the progression of acute pancreatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4269724>Effects on small-intestinal function and structure induced by feeding a deconjugated bile salt.</a></h2><p>Feeding sodium deoxycholate orally to rats for three days caused inhibition of small-intestinal active sugar transport and ouabain-sensitive, sodium-potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity. At the same time, there was evidence of extensive ultrastructural damage to the microvillar and intracellular compartments of the small-intestinal  while its light microscopic appearance was essentially normal. These functional and morphological changes reverted towards normal over the subsequent four days when a normal diet, without added bile salt, was reintroduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672156>Ursodeoxycholic  protects against intestinal barrier breakdown by promoting enterocyte migration via EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The intestinal barrier is often disrupted in disease states, and intestinal barrier failure leads to sepsis. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a bile  that may protect the intestinal barrier. We hypothesized that UDCA would protect the intestinal  in injury models. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro wound-healing assay and a mouse model of intestinal barrier injury. We found that UDCA stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in vitro, and this migration was blocked by inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or ERK. Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX-2 induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX-2 and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of -origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase 2 upregulation in the small intestine. This provides a potential treatment for acute, -origin sepsis as seen in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3986431>Changed sensitivity to antigen in a   treated with bile salts.</a></h2><p>Colonic epithelia from guinea-pigs, sensitized by feeding with cow milk, responded to antigen (beta-lactoglobulin) challenge when applied to the serosal, but not the mucosal, side of the tissue. The response, under short circuit conditions, was an inwardly directed current due to chloride secretion. Two detergents, deoxycholate and Triton X-100, caused the basal short circuit current to decrease and transepithelial conductance to increase when applied to the mucosal surface. After removing detergents from the bathing solution tissues now responded to antigen challenge from the mucosal side, without impairment of the overall response. There was a correlation between the conductance change induced by detergents and the fraction of the total response which could be elicited form the mucosal side of the tissue. It was concluded that models of local hypersensitivity reactions to ingested foodstuffs require both development of immunological sensitivity plus increased permeability to antigen. The role of bile salts in inducing the latter is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9700940>Effect of a platelet-activating factor antagonist on pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction in rats.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) may play a critical and primary role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated distant organ injury. The present study evaluated the effect of a PAF antagonist, lexipafant (an (S)-4-methyl-2[methyl-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-1-ylmethyl)-benzene sulphonyl]-amino]pentanoic  ethyl ester, BB-882; British Biotech Ltd.), on the potential prevention of  barrier dysfunction, by measuring  origin sepsis, bidirectional permeability of the intestinal barrier, and pancreatic capillary endothelial barrier integrity, in acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 5% sodium taurodeoxycholate. Pancreatic endothelial permeability significantly increased in animals with acute pancreatitis, whereas pretreatment with lexipafant had a preventive effect (p < 0.05 vs. pancreatitis with saline). Similarly, alterations noted in hematocrit and plasma levels of lipase and calcium were counteracted by the PAF antagonist. It also prevented the increase in albumin leakage from blood to the mucosal interstitium and from blood to the intestinal lumen in acute pancreatitis. Albumin passage from the  lumen to blood in animals with pancreatitis pretreated with saline increased from 3 h and on, and lexipafant prevented alterations in mucosal epithelial permeability. Bacterial translocation was commonly seen in pancreatitis, whereas only a few positive cultures were observed in pancreatitis animals given lexipafant. Microthrombosis in intestinal villi seemed less frequent after lexipafant pretreatment. We conclude that (a) PAF may play a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis-associated intestinal dysfunction, (b) PAF may be involved in the development of distant organ dysfunction by triggering endothelial barrier dysfunction, and (c) PAF antagonists may provide potential agents for preventing pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15826603>Severity of pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction is reduced following treatment with the PAF inhibitor lexipafant.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effect of treatment with a platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, lexipafant (BB-882), on  endothelial and epithelial barrier dysfunction and leukocyte recruitment in rats with acute pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis was induced by the intraductal administration of 5% sodium taurodeoxycholate and pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction was characterized by increased exudation of radiolabelled albumin into the interstitium and alterations in bidirectional (over both the endothelial and epithelial barrier components) permeability of the intestine at the early stage of bile salt-induced acute pancreatitis. Levels of interleukin 1beta and 6, ileal and colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) content, clearance of radiolabelled albumin from blood to the  lumen or  lumen to blood, and leakage of radiolabelled albumin to the ileum or colon were measured 3 and 12h after induction of acute pancreatitis. Treatment with lexipafant 30 min and 6h after pancreatitis reduced severity of pancreatitis-associated intestinal dysfunction, associated with a diminish in systemic concentrations of IL-1 and local leukocyte recruitment. The findings imply that PAF plays a critical role in the development of pancreatitis-associated  barrier dysfunction and that PAF antagonist in some forms may represent potential candidates for future therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937377>Safety evaluation of naringenin upon experimental exposure on rat gastrointestinal  for novel optimal drug delivery.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of naringenin on the intestinal biochemical composition, function and histology for gastrointestinal toxicity since it has not yet been adequately exploited for safety through standard assays.Here, we describe naringenin (1 mM, 10 mM and 100 mM, respectively) or sodium deoxycholate (10 mM) effects on isolated brush border membrane from intestinal segments with single pass intestinal perfusion using lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and protein assays. MTT assay was used for cytotoxicity studies. Everted  sac studies were used for evaluating the transport of nutrients across the intestinal segments. Lucifer yellow was used for paracellular permeability, followed by histological changes and surface characteristic studies of intestinal sacs.The results indicated no significant alterations with naringenin, although significant (p < 0.01) changes were noticed with sodium deoxycholate in the activity of the rat intestinal brush border associated enzymes such as LDH, followed by intact cell viability with marked decrease in the villi height of the intestinal segments.These observations indicate that naringenin was harmless upon exposure to rat gastrointestinal , clearly demonstrating the potential use of naturally occurring bioflavonoid as safe and novel pharmaceutical adjuvant in oral dosage forms as P-gp inhibitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7239322>Effects of bile acids and hydrogen ion on the fine structure of oesophageal .</a></h2><p>Oesophageal mucosal biopsies were incubated in 20, 0, and 0.2mM solutions of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, ursodeoxycholic, and  bile acids. Both conjugated and unconjugated bile acids were studied at pH 1 and 7 singly and in combination. Observations were also made using 0.1 N hydrochloric  and human gastric juice at pH 1-3 and 7-8. After incubation for up to 15 minutes the mucosa was examined under transmission electron microscopy. We concluded that high and moderate concentration of all the common bile acids damaged the oesophagus irrespective of the pH, that low concentrations of bile acids were damaging only at high  levels, and that damage to the  did not occur when the pH of the gastric juice had been raised.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12698018>Intraperitoneal administration of oxygenated perfluorochemical inhibits bacterial translocation associated with severe acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Bacterial translocation from  has been assumed to be an infectious source in severe acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of intraperitoneal administration of oxygenated perfluorochemical on bacterial translocation associated with rat experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Severe necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of 3% sodium deoxycholate into the biliopancreatic ducts of male Wistar rats. Although mortality rate was not improved by the treatment, intraperitoneal administration of oxygenated perfluorochemical, perfulorodecalin reduced incidence of bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes from 60% to 37% 12 hours after development of pancreatitis, and significantly reduced number of bacterial colonies detected after 24 hours. The treatment did not alter the villous height and crypt depth of the ileum. In this model for pancreatitis, however, accelerated apoptosis of the intestinal  was detected histochemically by TUNEL staining and biochemically by DNA fragmentation ELISA, and the apoptotic changes were significantly suppressed by the treatment. These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of oxygenated perfluorochemical inhibits apoptosis of intestinal  and bacterial translocation induced in severe acute pancreatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25455456>Diet supplementation with cholic  promotes intestinal epithelial proliferation in rats exposed to γ-radiation.</a></h2><p>Consumption of a high-fat diet increases some secondary bile acids (BAs) such as  (DCA) in feces. DCA is derived from cholic  (CA), a primary BA. We evaluated intestinal epithelial proliferation and BA metabolism in response to oral administration of cholic  (CA) in rats to determine the influence of a CA diet on the responses of  epithelia to γ-rays. WKAH/HkmSlc rats were divided into two dietary groups: control diet or CA-supplemented (2g/kg diet) diet. Some of the rats from each group were irradiated with γ-rays, and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon was analyzed histochemically. Unirradiated CA-fed rats had high levels of DCA and CA in the sera, as well as the presence of taurocholic  in their feces. Significant increases were observed in both epithelial proliferation and the number of epithelial cells in the colon of the CA-fed rats, and this effect was observed at 8 weeks after γ-ray exposure. Furthermore, extracts from both cecal contents and sera of the unirradiated CA-fed rats promoted proliferation of IEC-6 cells. These results indicate that BAs in enterohepatic circulation promote proliferation and survival of the intestinal  after receiving DNA damage.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

An electron microscopic morphometric study of the gall bladder  was performed in six gall stone free subjects and 12 gall stone patients. Six of the gall stone patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic  three weeks before cholecystectomy. The number and the volume density of the mucin containing secretory granules, were not significantly increased in gall stone patients compared with gall stone free subjects. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic  did not affect the number or volume density of the secretory granules. Thus, these results do not give evidence for that the degree of cholesterol saturation influences mucin content in the gall bladder wall of man. A major new finding was that gall stone patients had a markedly reduced total lysosome area and volume density of lysosomes compared with gall stone free subjects, a finding which may be related to a decreased intracellular degradation of protein and/or mucin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21712022>Loss of CFTR affects biliary  innate immunity and causes TLR4-NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response in mice.</a></h2><p>Loss of function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the biliary  reduces bile flow and alkalinization in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Liver damage is believed to result from ductal cholestasis, but only 30% of patients with CF develop liver defects, indicating that another factor is involved. We studied the effects of CFTR deficiency on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses of the biliary  to endotoxins.Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6J-Cftrtm1Unc (Cftr-KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. Ductular reaction and portal inflammation were quantified by keratin-19 and CD45 immunolabeling. Cholangiocytes isolated from wild-type and Cftr-KO mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS); cytokine secretion was quantified. Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phosphorylation of TLR4, and activity of Src were determined. HEK-293 that expressed the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter and human TLR4 were transfected with CFTR complementary DNAs.DSS-induced colitis caused biliary damage and portal inflammation only in Cftr-KO mice. Biliary damage and inflammation were not attenuated by restoring biliary secretion with 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  but were significantly reduced by oral neomycin and polymyxin B, indicating a pathogenetic role of -derived bacterial products. Cftr-KO cholangiocytes incubated with LPS secreted significantly higher levels of cytokines regulated by TLR4 and NF-κB. LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB was blocked by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. TLR4 phosphorylation by Src was significantly increased in Cftr-KO cholangiocytes. Expression of wild-type CFTR in the HEK293 cells stimulated with LPS reduced activation of NF-κB.CFTR deficiency alters the innate immunity of the biliary  and reduces its tolerance to endotoxin, resulting in an Src-dependent inflammatory response mediated by TLR4 and NF-κB. These findings might be used to develop therapies for CF-associated cholangiopathy.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We have earlier shown that dietary fat modifies fecal bile acids in mice, decreasing the proportion of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) vs.  (DCA). To clarify the potential role of bile acids in fat-induced barrier dysfunction, we here investigated how physiological concentrations of DCA and UDCA affect barrier function in mouse intestinal tissue. Bile  experiments were conducted in vitro in Ussing chambers using 4- and 20-kDa FITC-labeled dextrans. Epithelial integrity and inflammation were assayed by histology and Western blot analysis for cyclooxygenase-2. LPS was studied in DCA-induced barrier dysfunction. Finally, we investigated in a 10-wk in vivo feeding trial in mice the barrier-disrupting effect of a diet containing 0.1% DCA. DCA disrupted epithelial integrity dose dependently at 1-3 mM, which correspond to physiological concentrations on a high-fat diet. Low-fat diet-related concentrations of DCA had no effect. In vivo, the DCA-containing diet increased intestinal permeability 1.5-fold compared with control (P = 0.016). Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed a clear disruption of the epithelial barrier by 3 mM DCA in vitro. A short-term treatment by DCA did not increase cyclooxygenase-2 content in colon preparations. UDCA did not affect barrier function itself, but it ameliorated DCA-induced barrier disruption at a 0.6 mM concentration. LPS had no significant effect on barrier function at 0.5-4.5 μg/ml concentrations. We suggest a novel mechanism for barrier dysfunction on a high-fat diet involving the effect of hydrophobic luminal bile acids.</p></html>
