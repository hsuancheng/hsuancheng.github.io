To examine this possibility, total bile  concentrations (sulphated and non-sulphated) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in inferior mesentric vein serum of 19 patients undergoing colectomy for severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Similar determinations were obtained on a control group of eight patients requiring colectomy for other non-inflammatory conditions. Mean values for mesenteric vein serum bile  concentrations (muM/1) were 19.6+/-1.8 in controls and 16.3+/-2.0 in IBD. The mean sulphated bile  fraction did not exceed 10% of total, although there was considerable variability (up to 40% of total).  levels (entirely sulphated in all patients) were low. Although the IBD group showed a more than two-fold increase in mean lithocholate concentration (0.54+/-0.15 muM/1) over controls (0.21 +/- muM/1), this difference was not statistically significant. No significant intra-group difference was noted in the non-sulphated and sulphated fractions for cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic  species, respectively. No unidentified or unusual bile acids were observed. There was no correlation between bile  measurements and liver histology. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that liver disease often found in association with severe inflammatory bowel disease represents a form of bile  toxicity. The invariable finding of total sulphation of the  fraction even in the presence of severe mucosal disease was unexpected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16614977>Effect of  and ileoanal pouch on biliary enrichment of ursodeoxycholic  in primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary enrichment of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) may represent the decisive factor for its presumable beneficial effect. Up to now it is not clear how  and colectomy with ileo-anal pouch affect the biliary enrichment of UDCA and the biliary bile  composition. We determined the biliary bile  composition in 63 patients with PSC including 7 patients with ileo-anal pouch, 31 patients with , and 25 patients without . No differences existed between patients with and those without . In patients with colectomy and pouch at a UDCA dose of 17.7 +/- 1.6 mg/kg (n = 7), biliary UDCA represented 46.4 +/- 6.7% (mean +/- SD) of total bile acids. An increase in the dose in six pouch patients from 12.5 +/- 0.9 to 22.3 +/- 1.6 mg/kg led to a slight increase in biliary enrichment of UDCA, from 39.8 +/- 8.1 to 49.4 +/- 10.7%. In five of seven patients with ileo-anal pouch, biliary UDCA enrichment was within the normal range, and in two of seven it was permanently or intermittently abnormally low. During UDCA treatment, in pouch patients the biliary content of deoxycholic  and  was reduced, whereas all other bile acids were unchanged. In a minority of patients with ileo-anal pouch, biliary enrichment of UDCA may be markedly reduced, whereas patients with  have a biliary UDCA enrichment not different from that of patient without .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile acids.</a></h2><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27915991>Control of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer by Synthetic Vitamin D Receptor Ligands.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated with an increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammation, infection, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease, as well as bone and mineral disorders. The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460897>New insights into autoimmune cholangitis through animal models.</a></h2><p>Improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools for these disorders critically depends on easily reproducible animal models. Recently, several spontaneous mouse models for PBC (not requiring previous manipulations for breakdown of immunotolerance) have been reported, including NOD.c3c4 and NOD.c3c4-derived mice, IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice, dominant negative TGF-beta receptor II mice and Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice. To date, no animal model exhibits all of the attributes of PSC. Rodent models induced by bacterial cell components or  may help to explain the strong association between PSC and inflammatory bowel disease. Other models include direct injury to biliary epithelia, peribiliary vascular endothelia or portal venous endothelia. Mice with targeted disruption of the Mdr2 (Abcb4) gene encoding a canalicular phospholipid flippase (Mdr2(-/-) mice) spontaneously develop sclerosing cholangitis with macroscopic and microscopic features of human PSC. Another example for a transporter involved in the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR/ABCC7). Xenobiotics and drugs may also lead to bile duct injury and biliary fibrosis via direct toxic and indirect immune-mediated injury. Hydrophobic bile acids, such as , cause bile duct injury and destructive cholangitis with periductal fibrosis resembling sclerosing cholangitis. These models have enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of PBC and PSC and will hopefully result in improved treatment of these disorders.Copyright 2010 S.

There was no difference in the composition and concentration of bile acids in bile and portal blood compared with control patients. In a second study, serum bile  composition and concentrations were similar in two groups of patients with liver disease, whether they had bowel disease or not. In a further study, post-prandial serum bile  concentrations were not elevated in a group of patients with chronic bowel disease, making it unlikely that subcliical liver disease was present.

We examined the effects of high-dose (28-30 mg/kg/day) UDCA on the development of colorectal neoplasia in patients with UC and PSC.Patients with UC and PSC enrolled in a prior, multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose UDCA were evaluated for the development of colorectal neoplasia. Patients with UC and PSC who received UDCA were compared with those who received placebo. We reviewed the pathology and colonoscopy reports for the development of low-grade or high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer.Fifty-six subjects were followed for a total of 235 patient years. Baseline characteristics (including duration of PSC and UC, medications, patient age, family history of colorectal cancer, and smoking status) were similar for both the groups. Patients who received high-dose UDCA had a significantly higher risk of developing colorectal neoplasia (dysplasia and cancer) during the study compared with those who received placebo (hazard ratio: 4.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.30-20.10, P=0.02).Long-term use of high-dose UDCA is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with UC and PSC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17491508>Coordinated defence and the liver.</a></h2><p>The liver is strategically placed to protect the body against a vast array of potentially harmful compounds. The steps involved include phase I metabolism which makes molecules more reactive and phase II reactions which generally enhance solubility in bile or urine. Recent discoveries have shown how regulation of these reactions is also closely allied to expression of membrane transporters which excrete the products of biotransformation into bile and prevent their reabsorption via the intestine. The coordinated activity of these various functions is orchestrated by orphan nuclear receptors which, in response to an encounter with a potential toxin, are able to induce expression of the genes involved in its biotransformation and excretion.  (LCA) is routinely produced in our intestine by bacterial deconjugation of chenodeoxycholic  a major bile  in humans. In human liver the presence of LCA is sensed by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) which has the potential to switch on all the genes required for safe metabolism and elimination of LCA from the body. These include cytochrome P450 3A which hydroxylates LCA to more soluble forms and sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) which by sulphation of LCA makes it more readily solublein bile and enhances its faecal excretion. Similarly, PXR exposure to LCA produces up-regulated expression of the membrane transporters MDR1 and MRP2 which excrete metabolites of LCA. Evidence is accumulating in support of the hypothesis that deficiencies in these defence mechanisms underlie susceptibility to primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575493>Serum bile  profiling reflects enterohepatic detoxification state and intestinal barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>To determine free and conjugated serum bile  (BA) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic , the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA  (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly. Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC.

Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, cholic  and chenodeoxycholic , were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions.Serum BA profiling in IBD patients that indicates impaired intestinal barrier function and increased detoxification is suitable for advanced diagnostic characterization and differentiation of IBD subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7372059>Hepatotoxic effect of bile acids in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Lithocholate, a secondary bile , is hepatotoxic in many animal species including nonhuman primates. The induced histologic changes resemble those observed in patients with hepatic damage associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, we have examined the hypothesis that lithocholate is of etiologic importance in causing this association by measuring serum and biliary lithocholates in inflammatory bowel disease patients with and without liver disease. Serum and biliary lithocholates and isolithocholates were normal in all patients. Because defective sulfation in the nonhuman primate which allows lithocholate to accumulate in the enterohepatic circulation is thought to be responsible for inducing liver damage and because secondary bile acids are reduced after colectomy and in established liver disease, we examined thae capacity of all patients to sulfate labeled lithocholate. Effective sulfation of lithocholate was demstrated in all groups. Despite the hepatotoxic effects observed in nonhuman primates, we have found no evidence so far to implicate lithocholate as an etiologic factor in inflammatory bowel disease and hepatic dysfunction nor have we detected other potentially hepatotoxic bile acids in these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11246608>Alterations in intestinal microflora, faecal bile acids and short chain fatty acids in dextran sulphate sodium-induced experimental acute  in rats.</a></h2><p>The physiological effects on faecal bile acids and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) or intestinal microflora in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced  remain unknown and are an area of interest DESIGN ALTERATIONS: of these parameters in DSS-induced  in rats were evaluated.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) were given a 3% DSS aqueous solution orally for 7 days.

The absence of the colon and the coexistence of bile  malabsorption may increase bile lithogenicity, but data on biliary lipid composition in patients with this operation is lacking. Our aim was to assess bile lithogenicity, bile composition and mass of biliary lipids within the gallbladder. We studied 11 patients with total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis and 16 healthy controls. We measured the percentage composition of conjugated bile acids and the masses within the gallbladder of the three main biliary lipids. This method, in contrast with measurement of cholesterol saturation index, can determine the cause of bile lithogenicity in terms of absolute modifications of the biliary lipids. There was no difference in the cholesterol saturation index between patients and controls. Colectomy patients had reduced masses of all three biliary lipids (medians and ranges, mmol): cholesterol 0.11 (0.03-0.24) vs. 0.36 (0.02-0.96), P < 0.02; bile  1.62 (0.75-5.21) vs. 3.95 (1.27-8.70), P < 0.01; phospholipids 0.35 (0.07-0.69) vs. 1.14 (0.14-3.00), P < 0.002. They also had reduced per cent deoxycholic : 3.8 (0.0-27.6) vs. 17.4 (6.4-44.7), P < 0.005, and increased percent cholic : 44.9 (23.3-71.4) vs. 34.3 (19.2-57.9), P < 0.05. We conclude that, despite having bile  malabsorption, patients with colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis have a normal cholesterol saturation index, caused by a concomitant reduction in the masses of all three biliary lipids. The reduced per cent biliary deoxycholic  may help explain the reduced cholesterol and phospholipid masses in these patients. Total colectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis does not seem to predispose to the formation of cholesterol gallstones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6800873>Hepatic alterations during total parenteral nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a possible consequence of lithocholate toxicity.</a></h2><p>In order to understand the mechanism of hepatic abnormalities appearing during total parenteral nutrition, biliary bile  composition and liver function tests were examined serially in 15 patients undergoing total parenteral nutrition for inflammatory bowel disease.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

In patients with bile  diarrhea resulting from bile  malabsorption, dehydroxylation is decreased, and the concentration of bile acids in the colon is markedly elevated. The major secretory bile  in solution is chenodeoxycholic . Administration of cholestyramine, a resin that binds bile , reduces the elevated concentration of chenodeoxycholic  and abolishes the diarrhea.

Little is known about the roles of microbiota in C jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation. We investigated interactions between microbiota and intestinal cells during C jejuni infection of mice.Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10 mice were colonized with conventional microbiota and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10 colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional microbiota were cultured under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into germ-free Il10 mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal microbiota and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively.Introduction of conventional microbiota reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously germ-free Il10 mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Microbiota transplantation and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice colonized with microbiota cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis) compared with mice fed microbiota cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible to colitis). Oral administration to mice of microbiota-derived secondary bile  sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic  or , reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile -producing bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10 mice compared with the nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic ; colitis induction by antibiotics was associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate.We identified a mechanism by which the microbiota controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465107>Secondary bile acids effects in colon pathology.
