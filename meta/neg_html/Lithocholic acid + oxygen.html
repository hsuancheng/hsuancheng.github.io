<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20665558>The bile  receptor TGR5 (Gpbar-1) acts as a neurosteroid receptor in brain.</a></h2><p>TGR5 (Gpbar-1) is a membrane-bound bile  receptor in the gastrointestinal tract and immune cells with pleiotropic actions. As shown in the present study, TGR5 is also expressed in astrocytes and neurons. Here, TGR5 may act as a neurosteroid receptor, which is activated by nanomolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and micromolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-17α-21-triol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone). TGR5 stimulation in astrocytes and neurons is coupled to adenylate cyclase activation, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and the generation of reactive  species. In cultured rat astrocytes, TGR5 mRNA is downregulated in the presence of neurosteroids and ammonia already at concentrations of 0.5 mmol L(-1). Furthermore, TGR5 protein levels are significantly reduced in isolated rat astrocytes after incubation with ammonia. A marked downregulation of TGR5 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex from cirrhotic patients dying with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) when compared with brains from noncirrhotic control subjects. It is concluded that TGR5 is a novel neurosteroid receptor in brain with implications for the pathogenesis of HE.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825559>Anti-oxidants do not prevent bile -induced cell death in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines are crucial regulators of cell death in acute and chronic liver diseases. The contribution of each factor to hepatocyte death, either apoptosis or necrosis, has not been clarified as yet. It has been suggested that the generation of oxidative stress by bile acids contributes to hepatocyte death during cholestasis and bile  toxicity, although the beneficial role of ROS prevention in bile -mediated cell death is not fully understood.Study the effects of anti-oxidants in bile -induced cell death in vitro.Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to the bile acids glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) or taurolithocholic -3 sulphate in the absence or presence of ROS scavengers or anti-oxidants. Haeme oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA levels were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Apoptosis was quantified by acridine orange staining and caspase-3 activity assay. Necrosis was detected by Sytox green staining.Anti-oxidants do not attenuate bile -induced cell death. Furthermore, bile  exposure does not enhance the mRNA expression of the oxidative stress-responsive gene HO-1. The Src-kinase inhibitor, SU6656, does reduce GCDCA-induced apoptosis and necrosis.In hepatocytes, bile -induced toxicity is not prevented by scavengers of oxidative stress. The beneficial effects observed in patients might be because of the contribution of ROS and cytokines rather than bile -mediated oxidative stress. However, the use of specific Src kinase inhibitors might be a useful tool to prevent bile -induced injury in liver diseases.© 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370495>Ursodeoxycholic  inhibits overexpression of P-glycoprotein induced by doxorubicin in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>The hepatoprotective action of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was previously suggested to be partially dependent on its antioxidative effect. Doxorubicin (DOX) and reactive  species have also been implicated in the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is encoded by the MDR1 gene and causes antitumor multidrug resistance. In the present study, we assessed the effects of UDCA on the expression of MDR1 mRNA, P-gp, and intracellular reactive  species levels in DOX-treated HepG2 cells and compared them to those of other bile acids. DOX-induced increases in reactive  species levels and the expression of MDR1 mRNA were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, and the DOX-induced increase in reactive  species levels and DOX-induced overexpression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp were inhibited by UDCA. Cells treated with UDCA showed improved rhodamine 123 uptake, which was decreased in cells treated with DOX alone. Moreover, cells exposed to DOX for 24h combined with UDCA accumulated more DOX than that of cells treated with DOX alone. Thus, UDCA may have inhibited the overexpression of P-gp by suppressing DOX-induced reactive  species production. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) also exhibited these effects, whereas deoxycholic  and litocholic  were ineffective. In conclusion, UDCA and CDCA had an inhibitory effect on the induction of P-gp expression and reactive  species by DOX in HepG2 cells. The administration of UDCA may be beneficial due to its ability to prevent the overexpression of reactive  species and acquisition of multidrug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The authors used an isolated, perfused rat liver preparation to determine whether PMNs might injure the liver. Livers from fasted rats were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a recirculating system. Rat peritoneal PMNs (4 x 10(8] or vehicle (Hank's balanced salt solution [HBSS], pH 7.35) were added, and liver injury was assessed 90 minutes later by release of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) into the perfusion medium and histopathologic analysis of liver sections. Perfusion of livers receiving only HBSS for 90 minutes resulted in a small increase in ALT activity in the perfusion medium but did not significantly alter histologic features of liver sections. Addition of unstimulated PMNs did not increase further the ALT activity and, with the exception of vascular neutrophilia, did not significantly change the histomorphology compared with controls. When PMNs activated with a combination of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 31 ng/ml) and lithocholate (100 mumol/l [micromolar]) were added to the perfusion system, however, livers released greater amounts of ALT than those perfused with PMA, lithocholate, and HBSS. Activated PMNs caused a transient reduction in flow of perfusion medium that lasted approximately 5 to 15 minutes. Liver sections had multifocal to coalescing foci of moderate to severe, acute hepatocellular necrosis associated with the areas of intense sinusoidal neutrophilia. In addition a second type of lesion was observed and was characterized by triangular foci of necrosis located adjacent to periportal regions of sinusoids or portal veins containing neutrophilic thrombi. These lesions were void of PMNs and were consistent with infarcts. A combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase added to the perfusion medium (500 U/ml each) prevented the elevation in ALT activity but not the transient reduction in flow. These results indicate that activated PMNs may cause liver injury by an  radical-dependent mechanism. It is unclear whether PMN-derived  radicals, hepatocellular-derived  species resulting from reduced tissue perfusion and reperfusion, or both are involved in the pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524653>Which way to die: the regulation of acinar cell death in pancreatitis by mitochondria, calcium, and reactive  species.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10048711>The role of ursodeoxycholic  in bile -mediated kidney fragment toxicity.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of bile acids are thought to play an important role in the renal failure of patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing surgery. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (UDA) is widely used to improve cholestasis and has been proposed as protective bile acids and antioxidant. The present study employs kidney fragments to determine the role of reactive  species (ROS) in the mechanism of toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids and to determine the nephroprotectant properties of UDA against the hydrophobic bile acids. The hydrophobic bile acids chenodeoxycholic (200 microM) and deoxycholic  (200 microM) significantly (P<0.05) increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage (LDH) from glomerular fragments from 2.7+/-0.4 to 5.03+/-0.23 and 4.66+/-0.37 (micromol NADH consumed/min/mg protein) for chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic  respectively. Preincubating the fragments with UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the leakage of LDH caused by the bile acids. The level of lipid peroxidation was not increased in fragments exposed to either ursodeoxycholic (0-500 microM),  (0-100 microM), chenodeoxycholic (0-500 microM) or deoxycholic  (0-500 microM). Furthermore UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the increase in lipid peroxidation caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0-1000 microM) in the fragments. These results suggest that hydrophobic bile acids do not cause lipid peroxidation in kidney fragments and that UDA is neither capable of preventing the loss of membrane integrity induced by hydrophobic bile acids or acting as an antioxidant in kidney fragments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2365980>Tauroursodeoxycholate prevents taurolithocholate-induced cholestasis and toxicity in rat liver.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate has been advocated for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. The coinfusion of tauroursodeoxycholate with taurolithocholate in the perfused rat liver completely prevented the decrease of bile flow and the increase of  uptake found with taurolithocholate only. Bile flow and bile salt secretion were increased with the coinfusion of both bile acids as compared with the infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate only (+4.30 microliters/g liver per 30 min) with 16 and 32 mumol/l tauroursodeoxycholate (+1.55 microliters/g liver per 30 min with 80 and 160 mumol/l). Morphological examination revealed a 50% decrease of the number of necrotic cells in the periportal area. Tauroursodeoxycholate did not inhibit the uptake of taurolithocholate, but increased its transcellular passage and biotransformation. Thus, tauroursodeoxycholate prevents taurolithocholate-induced cholestasis and liver cell toxicity probably by an intracellular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20654385>The effects of Bile Acids on Freshly Isolated Rat Glomeruli and Proximal Tubular Fragments.</a></h2><p>The role of bile acids in post-surgical acute renal failure in jaundiced patients is obscure.

The concentration of hydrophobic bile acids that inhibited protein synthesis by 50% (IC(50)) was 10mum, 75mum and 80mum for , chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids, respectively. The glycine and taurine conjugates of these bile acids had no significant effect on de novo protein synthesis up to 200mum.  (50mum), chenodeoxycholic (200mum) and deoxycholic acids (200mum) caused a significant increase (P<0.05) in LDH leakage.  also directly inhibited LDH activity above 50mum (P<0.05), whereas chenodeoxycholic  and deoxycholic  had no effect on LDH below 500mum, at which concentration they caused a slight increase in activity. The cytotoxic bile acids had no effect on the level of reactive  species in kidney fragments. Hydrophobic bile acids inhibit protein synthesis and increase membrane permeability. Hydrophobic bile acids also directly alter LDH activity. Kidney cells are susceptible to the hydrophobic bile acids at concentration significantly below their critical micellar concentration. These results suggest that both glomeruli and tubules are highly sensitive to hydrophobic bile acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2120135>A comparative study on the effect of tumor promoters on poly ADP-ribosylation in A431 cells.</a></h2><p>Poly ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of chromatin proteins catalyzed by the enzyme poly-ADPR transferase (poly-ADPRT) and affects the structure as well as the functional properties of chromatin. It is of particular relevance in carcinogenesis, as it represents an epigenetic mechanism for modulation of gene expression. In the present study, A431 cells were exposed to tumor promoters phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), benzoyl peroxide (BP), mezerein and 6-keto- (KA), and their effect on poly-ADP-ribosylation was studied. All these tumor promoters increased the activity of poly-ADPRT in these cells--PMA 2.3-fold, BP and mezerein 2.2-fold each and KA 1.3-fold. The enzyme inhibitor 3-amino benzamide (3AB) partially prevented the stimulation of poly-ADPRT by these promoters. There was a concomitant decrease in NAD levels, the substrate for poly-ADPRT. The decrease was 44% for PMA, 46% for BP, 21% for KA and 34% for mezerein. The induction of poly-ADP-ribose synthesis by PMA and BP appears to be mediated at least in part by active  species, as they induced an increase in superoxide anions and anti-oxidants prevented the increase of poly-ADPRT activity to varying extents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563847>A mitochondrially targeted compound delays aging in yeast through a mechanism linking mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism to mitochondrial redox biology.</a></h2><p>A recent study revealed a mechanism of delaying aging in yeast by a natural compound which specifically impacts mitochondrial redox processes. In this mechanism, exogenously added  bile  enters yeast cells, accumulates mainly in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and elicits an age-related remodeling of phospholipid synthesis and movement within both mitochondrial membranes. Such remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics progresses with the chronological age of a yeast cell and ultimately causes significant changes in mitochondrial membrane lipidome. These changes in the composition of membrane phospholipids alter mitochondrial abundance and morphology, thereby triggering changes in the age-related chronology of such longevity-defining redox processes as mitochondrial respiration, the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, the preservation of cellular homeostasis of mitochondrially produced reactive  species, and the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25839782> bile  accumulated in yeast mitochondria orchestrates a development of an anti-aging cellular pattern by causing age-related changes in cellular proteome.</a></h2><p>We have previously revealed that exogenously added  bile  (LCA) extends the chronological lifespan of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, accumulates in mitochondria and alters mitochondrial membrane lipidome. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that LCA alters the age-related dynamics of changes in levels of many mitochondrial proteins, as well as numerous proteins in cellular locations outside of mitochondria. These proteins belong to 2 regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3 different patterns of the age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for many longevity-defining nuclear genes. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how such LCA-driven changes early and late in life of chronologically aging yeast cause a stepwise development of an anti-aging cellular pattern and its maintenance throughout lifespan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16351514>Effect of dried plums on colon cancer risk factors in rats.</a></h2><p>Dried plums (that is, prunes) are a fruit that show promise as a food to lower colon cancer risk, based on their high content of dietary fiber and polyphenolics. In this study, we have examined the effect of diets containing dried plums on the number of colonic precancerous lesions (aberrant crypts, ACs), fecal bile  concentration, and cecal bacterial enzyme activities related to colon cancer risk. Rats were fed one of four diets: a basal diet (a modified AIN-93G diet), a low-concentration dried plum diet (LCDP, 4.75% dried plum powder), a high-concentration dried plum diet (HCDP, 9.5% dried plum powder), or a diet matched to the carbohydrate content of the HCDP diet (CH-M) for 10 days. All animals were then administered azoxymethane (15 mg/kg, s.c., given two times, 1 wk apart) and fed their respective diets for 9 additional weeks. The number of AC foci (ACF), large ACF (>3 AC/ACF), or ACF multiplicity (AC/ACF) did not differ among the four groups. When compared with the basal diet, rats fed the LCDP diet had significantly lower concentrations of total fecal bile acids, deoxycholic , and hyodeoxycholic . Rats fed the HCDP diet had significantly lower fecal concentrations of  and hyodeoxycholic . The LCDP and HCDP diets significantly decreased the cecal activity of 7alpha-dehydroxylase, and the LCDP also had lower beta-glucuronidase activity. The LCDP, HCDP, and CH-M groups had significantly greater cecal nitroreductase activities than the basal group. There was a significant correlation between 7alpha-dehydroxylase activity and fecal  concentration. Compared with the basal diet, both the LCDP and HCDP diets greatly increased cecal supernatant  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). These results suggest that, although dried plums did not reduce ACF number, they favorably altered other colon cancer risk factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6947718>Transformation of bile acids by Eubacterium lentum.</a></h2><p>A group of fecal isolates identified as Eubacterium lentum elaborated 3 alpha-, 7 alpha-, and 12 alpha-dehydrogenases and also an epimerizing enzyme(s) for the 3 alpha-hydroxy group.

The compounds examined include a series of monosubstituted bile acids related to cholanoic acids differing from one another in the position and configuration of an -containing function (hydroxyl or oxo group) at the position C-3, C-6, C-7, or C-12 and the stereochemistry of the A/B-ring fusion (trans 5 alpha-H and cis 5 beta-H) in the steroid nucleus. The inclusion HPLC with Me-beta-CD was also applied to biologically important 4 beta- and 6-hydroxylated bile acids substituted by three to four hydroxyl groups in the 5 beta-steroid nucleus. These bile  samples were converted into their fluorescence prelabeled 24-pyrenacyl ester derivatives and chromatographed on a Capcell Pak C18 column eluted with methanol-water mixtures in the presence or absence of 5 mM Me-beta-CD. The effects of Me-beta-CD on the retentions of each compound were correlated quantitatively to the decreasing rate of capacity factors and the relative strength of host-guest interactions.

Bile acids diminished the biliary excretion of AM, and in vitro they enhanced the state 4 mitochondrial respiration and inhibited DNP- and ADP-stimulated  consumption. The ID50 values (mumol/kg i.v.) and I50 concentrations (X 10(-5) M) of the bile acids for inhibiting AM excretion and ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration, respectively, were as follows: for LCA 16 and 3.3, for CDCA 160 and 24, for DOCA 230 and 31, for CA 680 and 105, and for DHCA 700 and 260. LCA, CDCA and DOCA inhibited the biliary excretion of AM uncompetitively.

The sequence begins with oxidative cleavage of ring A of commercially available, optically pure . Insertion of nitrogen at position 4 and stereoselective hydrogenation of the resulting electron-rich enelactam under 600 psi H2 yielded a system analogous to testosterone-5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Upon exhaustive reduction of this compound with lithium aluminium hydride, a linker for bioconjugation was attached before the N-oxide key functionality is established in ring A. This functional group is believed to be a true transition-state mimic for the electronic nature of initiation of the cationic cyclization of 2,3-epoxy-squalene derivatives. In addition, it also holds promise for eliciting acidic residues as part of a bait-and-switch strategy. Remarkably, both N-oxide epimers obtained from mCPBA oxidation can be separated by column chromatography on a 60 mg scale and were used in enantiopure form for separate immunizations. Reliable configurative assignment was carried out by comparison studies with previously characterized and published systems.

Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the role of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) in pancreatic acinar cell injury.Freshly isolated murine and human pancreatic acinar cells were studied using confocal microscopy to measure changes in intracellular and mitochondrial ROS concentrations ([ROS]I and [ROS]M), cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]C and [Ca2+]M), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate levels, and death pathways in response to taurolithocholate  sulfate (TLC-S) or the oxidant menadione. Ca2+-activated Cl- currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp, with or without adenosine triphosphate (ATP).TLC-S induced prolonged increases in [Ca2+]C and [Ca2+]M, which led to dose-dependent increases in [ROS]I and [ROS]M, impaired production of ATP, apoptosis, and necrosis. Inhibition of the antioxidant reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinine oxidoreductase by 2,4-dimethoxy-2-methylnaphthalene potentiated the increases in [ROS]I and apoptosis but reduced necrosis, whereas the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine reduced [ROS]I and apoptosis but increased necrosis. Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production prevented apoptosis but did not alter necrosis; autophagy had no detectable role. Patched ATP prevented sustained increases in [Ca2+]C and necrosis.Increases in [ROS]M and [ROS]I during bile  injury of pancreatic acinar cells promote apoptosis but not necrosis. These results indicate that alternative strategies to antioxidants are required for oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis.Copyright © 2011 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by  (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2358447>Side chain conjugation prevents bacterial 7-dehydroxylation of bile acids.</a></h2><p>The effect of side chain conjugation on 7-dehydroxylation of bile acids has been investigated.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

TLCS induced a rapid serine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). Inhibitors of p47phox phosphorylation and p47phox protein knockdown abolished the TLCS-induced oxidative stress response and blunted subsequent CD95 activation. Consequences of TLCS-induced oxidative stress were c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation and Yes-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by EGFR-catalyzed CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and execution of apoptosis. As shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in Huh7 cells, TLCS induced a c-Jun-N-terminal kinase-dependent EGFR/CD95 association in the cytosol and trafficking of this protein complex to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 allowed for cytosolic EGFR/CD95 association, but prevented targeting of the EGFR/CD95 complex to the plasma membrane. Both processes, and TLCS-induced Yes and EGFR activation, were sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase, PKCzeta, or NADPH oxidases.The data suggest that hydrophobic bile salts activate NADPH oxidase isoforms with the resulting oxidative stress response triggering activation of the CD95 system and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7175373>Hepatic bile  uptake: effect of conjugation, hydroxyl and keto groups, and albumin binding.</a></h2><p>Hepatic extraction of trihydroxy (free, glyco- and tauro-conjugated) dihydroxy, and monohydroxy bile acids has been evaluated in single pass liver perfusion experiments in rats. The percentage of each bile  bound to albumin was also evaluated by equilibrium dialysis. Conjugation increased bile  liver extraction, without relevant differences in the percentage of bile  bound to albumin. Among the free bile acids, trihydroxy bile acids were more efficiently cleared by the liver than the dihydroxy acids, and the latter more than monohydroxy bile acids. 7-Ketolithocholic  uptake was slightly less than that of cholic . Conversely, among dihydroxy bile acids, the percentage of the bile  bound to albumin decreased from  to cholic . Decreasing the albumin concentration in the medium, and hence the fraction of the bile  bound to albumin, resulted in an increase in bile  liver extraction. Therefore besides differences in the chemical structure of bile acids, the extent of bile -albumin binding may be a determinant in bile  liver uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032975>Microbiome and Metabolome Profiles Associated With Different Types of Short Bowel Syndrome: Implications for Treatment.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome and metabolome may significantly influence clinical outcomes in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS). The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein  intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant  pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and metabolic activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial . Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28593023>Mechanisms Underlying the Essential Role of Mitochondrial Membrane Lipids in Yeast Chronological Aging.</a></h2><p>The functional state of mitochondria is vital to cellular and organismal aging in eukaryotes across phyla. Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern. In this review, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in yeast chronological aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27896021> induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in human prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p> (LCA) is a secondary bile  that is selectively toxic to human neuroblastoma, breast and prostate cancer cells, whilst sparing normal cells. We previously reported that LCA inhibited cell viability and proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis of androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the toxicity of LCA in PC-3 and autophagy deficient, androgen-independent DU-145 cells. LCA induced ER stress-related proteins, such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (p-eIF2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK) in both cancer cell-types. The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and B cell lymphoma-like protein 11 (BIM) levels were decreased at overtly toxic LCA concentrations, although PUMA levels increased at lower LCA concentrations in both cell lines. LCA induced autophagy-related conversion of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3BI-LC3BII), and autophagy-related protein ATG5 in PC-3 cells, but not in autophagy-deficient DU-145 cells. LCA (>10 µM) increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration-dependently in PC-3 cells, whereas ROS levels were not affected in DU-145 cells. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2 dephosphorylation and ER stress, reduced LCA-induced CHOP levels slightly in PC-3, but not DU-145 cells. Salubrinal pre-treatment increased the cytotoxicity of LCA in PC-3 and DU-145 cells and resulted in a statistically significant loss of cell viability at normally non-toxic concentrations of LCA. The late-stage autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 exacerbated LCA toxicity at subtoxic LCA concentrations in PC-3 cells. The antioxidant -tocotrienol strongly inhibited the toxicity of LCA in PC-3 cells, but not in DU-145 cells. Collectively, although LCA induces autophagy and ER stress in PC-3 cells, these processes appear to be initially of protective nature and subsequently consequential to, but not critical for the ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity of LCA. The full mechanism of LCA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity in the similarly sensitive DU-145 cells remains to be elucidated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2315560>Hepatic passage of bile acids increases  uptake by perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>It has been claimed that the hepatic passage of conjugated bile acids does not increase  uptake by the isolated perfused rat liver. We studied a variety of bile acids in the single-pass perfused rat liver. All bile acids studied except taurocholate and tauro-beta-muricholate induced an increase in  uptake of 2.1%-11.2% (baseline 2.54 +/- 0.57 mumoles/min per g liver). Raised values for  uptake were not specifically associated with the critical micellar concentration of the bile , with bile  uptake, or with bile  secretion. It is postulated that bile  toxicity may have an intracellular effect on hepatic  uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269179>The Apoptosis Effect on Liver Cancer Cells of Gold Nanoparticles Modified with .</a></h2><p>Functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have widely applied in many fields, due to their good biocompatibility, a long drug half-life, and their bioactivity is related to their size and the modified ligands on their surface. Here, we synthesized the AuNPs capped with ligands that possess polyethylene glycol (PEG) and  (LCA) linked by carboxyl groups (AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA). Our cytotoxicity results indicated that AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA have better cell selectivity; in other words, it could inhibit the growth of multiple liver cancer cells more effectively than other cancer cells and normal cells. Apoptosis plays a role in AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA inhibition cell proliferation, which was convincingly proved by some apoptotic index experiments, such as nuclear staining, annexin V-FITC, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis, and AO/EB staining experiments. The most potent AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA were confirmed to efficiently induce apoptosis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediating mitochondrial dysfunction. And AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA could be more effective in promoting programmed cell death of liver cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3323449>Aspects of the effect of bile salts on Candida albicans.</a></h2><p>Cholic , chenodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , glycocholic , glycodeoxycholic , hyodeoxycholic  and  as their sodium salts, were fungistatic to the growth of Candida albicans. Of the compounds tested, cholic , deoxycholic  and chenodeoxycholic  were the most active. In combination with other antifungal agents only cholic  exhibited synergism with amphotericin B, whilst the imidazole antifungal agents inhibited the action of the bile salts. The bile salt minimal inhibitory concentrations were close to the critical micelle concentrations. Even though the compounds are surface active they did not cause loss of intracellular K+ and were without effect on  consumption. The bile salts, particularly cholic , produced morphological changes that gave rise to swollen cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9214446>Cytotoxicity of bile salts against biliary epithelium: a study in isolated bile ductule fragments and isolated perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>We evaluated cytotoxic effects of different unconjugated and glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile salts (BS) against bile duct epithelial cells in isolated bile ductule fragments and isolated perfused rat liver. Ultrastructural morphometric studies were performed in polarized rat bile ductule fragments exposed in vitro to increasing concentrations (10-100 micromol/L) of lithocholate (LCA), deoxycholate (DCA), chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), cholate (CA), ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), their taurine-conjugates, and glycoconjugates of cholic (GCA) or chenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) for 20, 30, or 75 minutes. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of unconjugated hydrophobic bile salts against biliary epithelium (BDE) in the whole liver, livers were isolated from rats with impaired taurine-conjugation capacity (beta-alanine treatment) and perfused for 70 minutes with 2 micromol/min LCA (n = 6), CDCA (n = 6), CA (n = 6), or 0.5 micromol/min tauro-LCA (n = 4). In isolated bile ductule fragments, hydrophobic unconjugated bile salts (LCA, CDCA, DCA) induced a marked damage of intracellular organelles, mainly mitochondria. The damage started at a concentration of 10 micromol/L and became prominent at concentrations higher than 50 micromol/L. No damage of the apical and basolateral membrane was seen and tight junctions appeared intact. UDCA, taurine and glycoconjugated bile salts failed to induce any evident ultrastructural alteration. In taurine-depleted isolated livers, perfused with LCA, CDCA, or CA, bile duct epithelial cells showed no evidence of intracellular damage, despite the increased biliary excretion of unconjugated BS. Marked alterations of the apical cell membrane were seen only in livers perfused with LCA and in isolated segments of the biliary epithelium. In contrast with biliary epithelium, hepatocytes showed prominent subcellular damage with CA and CDCA, and profound alterations of the canalicular membrane with LCA and tauro-LCA. We have shown that, in vitro, BDE cells are not damaged by taurine- or glycine-conjugated BS, but they are very sensitive to cytotoxicity of hydrophobic unconjugated BS. Such sensitivity is not present in the whole liver, probably because of the specificity of BS transport processes, the microvascular architecture of the bile ductal system, and the presence in bile of a physiological surfactant, such as phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878403>Effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone in murine acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Although oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP), antioxidant therapy in patients has so far been discouraging. The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10 µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels. Our results suggest that MitoQ would be inappropriate for AP therapy, consistent with prior antioxidant evaluations in this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924582>Mitochondrial membrane lipidome defines yeast longevity.</a></h2><p>Our studies revealed that  (LCA), a bile , is a potent anti-aging natural compound that in yeast cultured under longevity-extending caloric restriction (CR) conditions acts in synergy with CR to enable a significant further increase in chronological lifespan. Here, we investigate a mechanism underlying this robust longevity-extending effect of LCA under CR. We found that exogenously added LCA enters yeast cells, is sorted to mitochondria, resides mainly in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and also associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane. LCA elicits an age-related remodeling of glycerophospholipid synthesis and movement within both mitochondrial membranes, thereby causing substantial changes in mitochondrial membrane lipidome and triggering major changes in mitochondrial size, number and morphology. In synergy, these changes in the membrane lipidome and morphology of mitochondria alter the age-related chronology of mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, ATP synthesis and reactive  species homeostasis. The LCA-driven alterations in the age-related dynamics of these vital mitochondrial processes extend yeast longevity. In sum, our findings suggest a mechanism underlying the ability of LCA to delay chronological aging in yeast by accumulating in both mitochondrial membranes and altering their glycerophospholipid compositions. We concluded that mitochondrial membrane lipidome plays an essential role in defining yeast longevity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057690>Hepatoprotective effect of vitamin C on -induced cholestatic liver injury in Gulo(-/-) mice.</a></h2><p>Prevention and restoration of hepatic fibrosis from chronic liver injury is essential for the treatment of patients with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin C is known to have hepatoprotective effects, but their underlying mechanisms are unclear, especially those associated with hepatic fibrosis. Here, we analyzed the impact of vitamin C on bile  induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and  (LCA)-induced liver injury in vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice, which cannot synthesize vitamin C similarly to humans. When Huh-BAT cells were treated with bile , apoptosis was induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress-related JNK activation but vitamin C attenuated bile -induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro. In our in vivo experiments, LCA feeding increased plasma marker of cholestasis and resulted in more extensive liver damage and hepatic fibrosis by more prominent apoptotic cell death and recruiting more intrahepatic inflammatory CD11b(+) cells in the liver of vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice compared to wild type mice which have minimal hepatic fibrosis. However, when vitamin C was supplemented to vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice, hepatic fibrosis was significantly attenuated in the liver of vitamin C-sufficient Gulo(-/-) mice like in wild type mice and this hepatoprotective effect of vitamin C was thought to be associated with both decreased hepatic apoptosis and necrosis. These results suggested that vitamin C had hepatoprotective effect against cholestatic liver injury.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The C2-symmetrical C6(I),C6(V) diol was transformed into dithiol and dimerized to produce a γ-cyclodextrin duplex structure. A crystal structure revealed tubular cavity whose peripheries are slightly elliptically distorted. The solvent accessible volume of the cavity of the γ-CD duplex is about 740 Å(3). Due to this large inner space the duplex forms very stable inclusion complexes with steroids; bile acids examined in this study show binding affinities to the γ-cyclodextrin duplex in the range of 5.3 × 10(7) M(-1)-1.9 × 10(8) M(-1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19054763>Characterization of enantiomeric bile -induced apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are steroid detergents that are toxic to mammalian cells at high concentrations; increased exposure to these steroids is pertinent in the pathogenesis of cholestatic disease and colon cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of bile  toxicity and apoptosis, which could include nonspecific detergent effects and/or specific receptor activation, has potential therapeutic significance. In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of  (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic  (ent-CDCA), and deoxycholic  (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile -induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive  species compared with ent-LCA. This suggests that LCA/ent-LCA induce apoptosis enantioselectively through CD95 activation, likely because of increased reactive  species generation, with resulting procaspase-8 cleavage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187369>Synthesis of nitrogen- and -containing macrocycles--derivatives of .</a></h2><p>Palladium-catalyzed amination of 3,24-bis(3-bromophenoxy)cholane (4) with various polyamines and polyoxadiamines 5 taken in 1:1 ratio was used for the synthesis of the macrocycles 6, which contain steroidal and polyamine moieties and were obtained in 38-65 % yields. The same reaction with excess polyamine (2.2-3 equiv) provided bis(polyamino) derivatives of 3,24-diphenoxycholane 7 in excellent yields, whereas the diarylation of polyamines with two equivalents of 3,24-bis(3-bromophenoxy)cholane afforded their bis(steroidal) derivatives 8.

In addition, bile acids also actively participate in regulation of gene expression through their ability to act as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor or by activating kinase signaling pathways. Under cholestatic conditions, elevated levels of bile acids in the liver induce hepatic inflammation, and because bile  levels are also elevated in the circulation, they might also induce vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic endothelial cells were treated with bile acids, and the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were monitored. The three major bile acids found in the circulation, chenodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , and , all strongly induced both the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. To delineate the mechanism, the experiments were conducted in the presence of various kinase inhibitors. The results demonstrate that the bile -mediated induction of adhesion molecule expression occurs by stimulation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways through the elevation in reactive  species. The bile -induced cell surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was sufficient to result in the increased adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to the HUVEC, suggesting that elevated levels of bile acids in the circulation may cause endothelium dysfunction and contribute to the initiation of early events associated with vascular lesion formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522903>Oxidative stress, antioxidants and intestinal calcium absorption.</a></h2><p>The disequilibrium between the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species and their elimination by protective mechanisms leads to oxidative stress.  are the main source of ROS as by-products of electron transport chain. Most of the time the intestine responds adequately against the oxidative stress, but with aging or under conditions that exacerbate the ROS and/or RNS production, the defenses are not enough and contribute to developing intestinal pathologies. The endogenous antioxidant defense system in gut includes glutathione (GSH) and GSH-dependent enzymes as major components. When the ROS and/or RNS production is exacerbated, oxidative stress occurs and the intestinal Ca absorption is inhibited. GSH depleting drugs such as DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, menadione and sodium deoxycholate inhibit the Ca transport from lumen to blood by alteration in the protein expression and/or activity of molecules involved in the Ca transcellular and paracellular pathways through mechanisms of oxidative stress, apoptosis and/or autophagy. Quercetin, melatonin,  and ursodeoxycholic acids block the effect of those drugs in experimental animals by their antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and/or anti-autophagic properties. Therefore, they may become drugs of choice for treatment of deteriorated intestinal Ca absorption under oxidant conditions such as aging, diabetes, gut inflammation and other intestinal disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9990726>Biotransformation of monoterpenes, bile acids, and other isoprenoids in anaerobic ecosystems.</a></h2><p>Isoprenoic compounds play a major part in the global carbon cycle. Biosynthesis and mineralization by aerobic bacteria have been intensively studied. This review describes our knowledge on the anaerobic metabolism of isoprenoids, mainly by denitrifying and fermentative bacteria. Nitrate-reducing beta-Proteobacteria were isolated on monoterpenes as sole carbon source and electron donor. Thauera spp. were obtained on the -containing monoterpenes linalool, menthol, and eucalyptol. Several strains of Alcaligenes defragrans were isolated on unsaturated monoterpenes as growth substrates. A novel denitrifying beta-Proteobacterium, strain 72Chol, mineralizes cholesterol completely to carbon dioxide. Physiological studies showed the presence of several oxidative pathways in these microorganisms. Investigations by organic geochemists indicate possible contributions of anaerobes to early diagenetic processes. One example, the formation of p-cymene from monoterpenes, could indeed be detected in methanogenic enrichment cultures. In man, cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. During their enterohepatic circulation, bile acids are biotransformed by the intestinal microflora into a variety of metabolites. Known bacterial biotranformations of conjugated bile acids include: deconjugation, oxidation of hydroxy groups at C-3, C-7 and C-12 with formation of oxo bile acids and reduction of these oxo groups to either alpha- or beta-configuration. Quantitatively, the most important bacterial biotransformation is the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of CA and CDCA yielding deoxycholic  and , respectively. The 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of CA occurs via a novel six-step biochemical pathway. The genes encoding several enzymes that either transport bile acids or catalyze various reactions in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway of Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 have been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23300732>Angiotensin II protects primary rat hepatocytes against bile salt-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (AT-II) is a pro-fibrotic compound that acts via membrane-bound receptors (AT-1R/AT-2R) and thereby activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). AT-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are thus important candidates in the treatment of liver fibrosis. However, multiple case reports suggest that AT-1R blockers may induce hepatocyte injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect of AT-II and its receptor blockers on cytokine-, oxidative stress- and bile salt-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to TNF-α/Actinomycin D, the ROS-generating agent menadione or the bile salts: glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) and tauro--3 sulfate (TLCS), to induce apoptosis. AT-II (100 nmol/L) was added 10 minutes prior to the cell death-inducing agent. AT-1R antagonists (Sartans) and the AT-2R antagonist PD123319 were used at 1 µmol/L. Apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, acridine orange staining) and necrosis (Sytox green staining) were quantified. Expression of CHOP (marker for ER stress) and AT-II receptor mRNAs were quantified by Q-PCR. AT-II dose-dependently reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05) without inducing necrosis. In addition, AT-II reduced TLCS-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05). However, AT-II did not suppress TNF/Act-D and menadione-induced apoptosis. Only the AT-1R antagonists abolished the protective effect of AT-II against GCDCA-induced apoptosis. AT-II increased phosphorylation of ERK and a significant reversal of the protective effect of AT-II was observed when signaling kinases, including ERK, were inhibited. Moreover, AT-II prevented the GCDCA-induced expression of CHOP (the marker of the ER-mediated apoptosis).Angiotensin II protects hepatocytes from bile salt-induced apoptosis through a combined activation of PI3-kinase, MAPKs, PKC pathways and inhibition of bile salt-induced ER stress. Our results suggest a mechanism for the observed hepatocyte-toxicity of Sartans (angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs) in some patients with chronic liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512997>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dysregulation of cardiac energetics in a mouse model of biliary fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cardiac dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease; yet the mechanisms remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that the complex interrelated impairments in cardiac structure and function secondary to progression of liver diseases involve alterations in signaling pathways engaged in cardiac energy metabolism and hypertrophy, augmented by direct effects of high circulating levels of bile acids. Biliary fibrosis was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydroxychollidine (DDC) supplemented diet. After 3 weeks, mice underwent live imaging (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography [2DE], electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), exercise treadmill testing, and histological and biochemical analyses of livers and hearts. Compared with chow-fed mice, DDC-fed mice fatigued earlier on the treadmill, with reduced VO(2). Marked changes were identified electrophysiologically (bradycardia and prolonged QT interval) and functionally (hyperdynamic left ventricular [LV] contractility along with increased LV thickness). Hearts of DDC-fed mice showed hypertrophic signaling (activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene/protein kinase B [AKT], inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK3beta], a 20-fold up-regulation of beta myosin heavy chain RNA and elevated G(s)alpha/G(i)alpha ratio. Genes regulating cardiac fatty  oxidation pathways were suppressed, along with a threefold increase in myocardial glycogen content. Treatment of mouse cardiomyocytes (which express the membrane bile  receptor TGR5) with potent natural TGR5 agonists, taurochenodeoxycholic  and , activated AKT and inhibited GSK3beta, similar to the changes seen in DDC-fed mouse hearts. This provides support for a novel mechanism whereby circulating natural bile acids can induce signaling pathways in heart associated with hypertrophy.Three weeks of DDC feeding-induced biliary fibrosis leads to multiple functional, metabolic, electrophysiological, and hypertrophic adaptations in the mouse heart, recapitulating some of the features of human cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3985610>Optimum conditions for ursodeoxycholic  production from  by Fusarium equiseti M41.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  dissolves cholesterol gallstones in humans.

The activity in the mycelium was controlled by dissolved  tension during cultivation: with a dissolved  tension of 15% and over, the activity peak appeared at 25 h of cultivation, whereas the peak was delayed to 34 and 50 h with 5 and 0% dissolved  tension, respectively. After reaching the maximum, the 7 beta-hydroxylation activity in the mycelium declined rapidly at pH 7.0, but the decline was retarded by increasing the pH to 8.0. Several combinations of operations, such as pH shift (from pH 7 to 8), addition of 0.5 M KCl, and dissolved  control, were applied to the production of ursodeoxycholic  in a jar fermentor, and a much larger amount of ursodeoxycholic  (1.2 g/liter) was produced within 96 h of cultivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7982660>Ursodeoxycholate protects oxidative mitochondrial metabolism from bile  toxicity: dose-response study in isolated rat liver mitochondria.</a></h2><p>The effect of ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate on the toxicity of lipophilic bile acids (chenodeoxycholate and lithocholate) on the function of the electron transport chain was investigated in isolated rat liver mitochondria. At a concentration of 30 mumol/L, both chenodeoxycholate and lithocholate reduced state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. In contrast, ADP/O ratios of these substrates and oxidative metabolism of ascorbate were not significantly affected. Ursodeoxycholate did not impair mitochondrial oxidative metabolism up to concentrations of 100 mumol/L; at 300 mumol/L, however, it decreased state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. Tauroursodeoxycholate had no significant inhibitory effect on state 3 oxidation rates of L-glutamate and succinate at concentrations up to 300 mumol/L. When ursodeoxycholate (final concentration, 30 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) was added to mitochondrial incubations containing chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, the toxic effects of lipophilic bile acids on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were partially reversed. However, 300 mumol/L ursodeoxycholate, in combination with chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, exhibited greater toxicity compared with incubations containing only the individual bile acids. In contrast to ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate did not reduce the toxic effects of chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate on mitochondrial metabolism. Ursodeoxycholate (100 mumol/L) significantly decreased the incorporation of chenodeoxycholate into mitochondrial membranes, whereas the decrease in lithocholate incorporation was not statistically significant. These studies demonstrate that ursodeoxycholate, but not tauroursodeoxycholate, decreases the toxicity of lipophilic bile acids on the function of the electron but increases bile -induced mitochondrial toxicity at higher concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7119570>The metabolism of primary, 7-oxo, and 7 beta-hydroxy bile acids by Clostridium absonum.</a></h2><p>Clostridium absonum was shown to metabolize primary bile acids to give rise to both 7-oxo bile acids and 7 beta-hydroxy (urso) bile acids. At relatively low redox potential (Eh) values, high yields of urso bile acids were achieved (60-75%). If, however, the Eh value of the culture was allowed to rise above approximately -100 mv, the 7-oxo bile  would tend to predominate (more than 75%) and the "death phase" was accelerated. Growth of C. absonum in sterile graduated cylinders instead of in conventional Erlenmeyer flasks was effective in delaying the rise in Eh value with time (which appears largely due to diffusion of atmospheric  into the medium) and in preserving a higher viable count of organisms. It is proposed that the formation of excess amounts of 7-oxo bile  is a manifestation of  toxicity and that it could be mediated by an increasing intracellular NADP:NADPH ratio. Additionally, the reaction: primary bile  in equilibrium oxo bile  in equilibrium urso bile  was shown to be partially reversible. When the organisms were grown with [24-(14)C]chenodeoxycholic, -cholic, or -7-keto-, this reaction could be clearly demonstrated. The addition of an equimolar concentration of deoxycholic  (which itself is not metabolized) effectively enhanced the rate of bioconversion of cholate and 7-keto-, but not chenodeoxycholate (whose rate of bioconversion was the fastest of the three). When the organisms were grown with urso bile acids (ursocholic or ursodeoxycholic) or with 7-keto-deoxycholic , very little metabolism occurred unless deoxycholic  was added which induced formation of primary and keto bile acids. In all cases, formation of oxo bile  from primary or urso bile  occurred as the Eh value of the medium rose with time and could thus be delayed by the use of a cylinder instead of a flask for growing the culture. These results were rationalized by demonstrating that induction of 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is strongly mediated by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids, weakly mediated by cholic and 7-keto- acids, and ineffective with 7-keto-deoxycholic, ursocholic, and ursodeoxycholic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909664>Design, synthesis, and mechanistic investigations of bile -tamoxifen conjugates for breast cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>We have synthesized two series of bile  tamoxifen conjugates using three bile acids  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and cholic  (CA). These bile -tamoxifen conjugates possess 1, 2, and 3 tamoxifen molecules attached to hydroxyl groups of bile acids having free  and amine functionalities at the tail region of bile acids. The in vitro anticancer activities of these bile -tamoxifen conjugates show that the free amine headgroup based cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) is the most potent anticancer conjugate as compared to the parent drug tamoxifen and other  and amine headgroup based bile -tamoxifen conjugates. The cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) bearing three tamoxifen molecules shows enhanced anticancer activities in both estrogen receptor +ve and estrogen receptor -ve breast cancer cell lines. The enhanced anticancer activity of CA-Tam3-Am is due to more favorable irreversible electrostatic interactions followed by intercalation of these conjugates in hydrophobic core of membrane lipids causing increase in membrane fluidity. Annexin-FITC based FACS analysis showed that cells undergo apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis showed the arrest of cells in sub G0 phase. ROS assays showed a high amount of generation of ROS independent of ER status of the cell line indicating changes in mitochondrial membrane fluidity upon the uptake of the conjugate that further leads to the release of cytochrome c, a direct and indirect regulator of ROS. The mechanistic studies for apoptosis using PCR and western analysis showed apoptotsis by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in ER +ve MCF-7 cells and by only an intrinsic pathway in ER -ve cells. In vivo studies in the 4T1 tumor model showed that CA-Tam3-Am is more potent than tamoxifen. These studies showed that bile acids provide a new scaffold for high drug loading and that their anticancer activities strongly depend on charge and hydrophobicity of lipid-drug conjugates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185272>Bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts through farnesoid X receptor-dependent and independent pathways.</a></h2><p>The roles of bile  microaspiration and bile -activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that bile acids activate alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts, which may be regulated by FXR activation.Human AECs and normal or IPF-derived lung fibroblast cells were incubated with the three major bile acids:  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The AECs injury indices, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung fibroblast activation were evaluated. FXR expression in IPF lungs and the roles of FXR and FXR-independent pathways in bile -induced profibrotic effects were also investigated.LCA, DCA and CDCA reduced cell viability and increased intracellular reactive  species (ROS) production in A549 cells. They all induced EMT, as shown by enhanced α-SMA and vimentin and decreased E-cadherin levels. LCA directly induced differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. All three bile acids promoted cellular migration but not proliferation of lung fibroblasts. FXR expression was upregulated in IPF lungs, and inhibition of FXR restrained the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast activation. Differentiation and proliferation were enhanced in lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from bile -stimulated A549 cells, which contained increased levels of profibrotic factors. TGF-β/Smad3 signaling was also involved in the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast differentiation.Bile  microaspiration may promote the development of pulmonary fibrosis by inducing activation of AECs and lung fibroblasts via FXR-dependent and independent pathways.© 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30023697>Role of Surface Hydrophobicity of Dicationic Amphiphile-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles on A549 Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the surface functionality of dicationic cysteamine conjugated cholic  (DCaC), dicationic cysteamine conjugated deoxycholic  (DCaDC), and dicationic cysteamine conjugated  (DCaLC) templated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on mammalian cells. The haemocompatibility of the synthesized NPs was evaluated by in vitro hemolysis and erythrocyte sedimentation rate using human red blood cells (RBCs). In all of the systems, no toxicity was observed on human erythrocytes (RBCs) up to the concentration of 120 μg/mL. The anticancer activity of these dicationic amphiphile-stabilized AuNPs on A549 lung cancer cells was demonstrated by in vitro cell viability assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species estimation by DCFH-DA, apoptosis analysis using AO-EtBr fluorescence staining, DNA fragmentation analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis, and western blot analysis of caspase-3 expression. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity of AuNPs to A549 cells increase with the dose and hydrophobicity of amphiphiles and were found to be in the order: DCaLC-AuNPs > DCaDC-AuNPs > DCaC-AuNPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708356>Novel pathways of bile  metabolism involving CYP3A4.</a></h2><p>The hepatic predominating cytochrome P450, CYP3A4, plays an essential role in the detoxification of bile acids and is important in pathological conditions such as cholestasis where CYP3A4 is adaptively up-regulated. However, the mechanism that triggers the up-regulation of CYP3A4 is still not clear. In this study, using recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes, we demonstrate that CYP3A4 can metabolise  into 3-dehydrolithocholic , a potent activator of the nuclear receptors, pregnane X receptor and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 receptor, which are known to regulate the expression of CYP3A4. This process thus provides a feed-forward metabolism of toxic bile  that may be of importance in maintaining bile  homeostasis. We also provide evidence for a novel CYP3A4-mediated metabolic pathway of the secondary bile  deoxycholic . Patients treated with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, had markedly elevated urinary excretion of 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic  compared to healthy controls. The importance of CYP3A4 in this process was verified by incubations with recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes, both of which efficiently converted deoxycholic  into 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic . Interestingly, CYP3A4 was also found to be active against the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7904981>Toxicity of bile acids on the electron transport chain of isolated rat liver mitochondria.</a></h2><p>The toxicity of hydrophilic (cholate) and lipophilic (deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, and lithocholate) bile acids on the function of the electron transport chain was investigated in intact and disrupted rat liver mitochondria. In intact mitochondria, lipophilic bile acids used at a concentration of 100 mumol/L (0.1 mumol/mg protein) inhibited state 3 and state 3u (dinitrophenol-uncoupled) oxidation rates for L-glutamate, succinate, duroquinol or ascorbate/N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as substrates. In contrast, state 4 oxidation rates and ADP/ ratios were not significantly affected. At a bile  concentration of 10 mumol/L (0.01 mumol/mg protein), the state 3 oxidation rate for L-glutamate was decreased in the presence of deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, whereas only lithocholate inhibited state 3 oxidation for succinate or duroquinol. In broken mitochondria, inhibition of oxidative metabolism was found for NADH or duroquinol as substrate in the presence of 100 mumol/L lithocholate (0.2 mumol/mg protein) and for duroquinol in the presence of 100 mumol/L chenodeoxycholate. Direct assessment of the activities of the enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain revealed decreased activities of complex I and complex III in the presence of 100 mumol/L deoxycholate or chenodeoxycholate or 10 mumol/L lithocholate. Inhibition of complex IV required higher bile  concentrations (300 mumol/L for chenodeoxycholate or 30 mumol/L for lithocholate), and complex II was not affected. Both chenodeoxycholate and lithocholate were incorporated into mitochondrial membranes. The phospholipid content of mitochondrial membranes decreased in incubations containing 100 mumol/L (0.1 mumol/mg protein) chenodeoxycholate but was not affected in the presence of 100 mumol/L lithocholate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6929859>Evaluation of the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase assay for ursodeoxycholic , and 7 oxo- and 12 oxo- bile acids.</a></h2><p>3 alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (SDH) quantifies ursodeoxycholic , 3 alpha,12 alpha-diol-7-one-5 beta-cholanoic , 3 alpha-ol-7-one-5 beta-cholanoic , and 3 alpha,7 alpha-diol-12-one-5 beta-cholanoic  in a manner similar to the more commonly measured bile acids, exemplified by taurocholic .

In particular, cholestasis is difficult to diagnose by conventional markers at an early stage of disease. The aim of this study was to identify promising biomarkers for distinguishing the symptom-based types of liver injury (e.g. hepatocellular injury, cholestasis), which was derived from a rigorously statistical perspective. The associations between diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. bile  components, oxidative stress markers and liver fibrosis markers) and the liver injury types were assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis using 304 blood samples from patients with liver disease. As a result, reductions in the  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) levels, and elevation of the serum sulfated bile  (SSBA), liver fibrosis marker IV collagen (type IV collagen), hyaluronic  (HA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all significantly associated with cholestasis. On the other hand, elevations in the LCA and type IV collagen levels, and a reduction in the ursodeoxy cholic  (UDCA) level, were significantly associated with hepatocellular injury. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for ROS, followed by DCA, HA, LCA, SSBA and type IV collagen in the cholestatic-type cases. These results indicated that ROS, the secondary bile  levels such as DCA and LCA, and SSBA are promising biomarkers for cholestasis and for classifying the type of liver injuries. This comprehensive approach will allow for an accurate diagnosis, which will facilitate the selection of an appropriate therapy at the onset of disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
