A propos of a case of malignant biliary obstruction.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the first choice medication for most cholestatic hepatopathies, due to its capability to counteract inflammation and bile--induced liver damage, two common features in cholestasis. However, UDCA is usually contraindicated in obstructive cholestasis, due to the alleged risk of biliary integrity disruption due to its choleretic effect. We report on an 83-year-old man with an unsuspected malignant biliary obstruction who received moderate doses of UDCA (8-12 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks, because the preliminary evidence suggested he had chemotherapy-induced cholestasis. Liver integrity was extensively protected by UDCA, as indicated by a marked decrease in serum liver enzymes, despite a steady increase in the levels of bilirubin and serum bile acids due to the obstructive process. In conclusion, this report shows, for the first time in humans, that moderate UDCA doses can reduce liver injury associated with complete biliary obstruction. This may contribute to a better understanding of the risk-benefit ratio of the use of UDCA in obstructive cholangiopathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and .</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of  death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as  and lithocholic . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644410>Mechanism of a Novel Camptothecin- Derivate Induced Apoptosis Against Human Liver  HepG2 Cells and Human  HCT116 Cells.</a></h2><p>Camptothecin (CPT) hasis been known as an anticancer drug in traditional Chinese medicine. However, due to the lack of targeting, low solubility and instability of CPT, its therapeutic applications of CPT is hindered by its high toxicity, are hampereddue to lack of targeting, low solubility and instability.. Therefore, we synthesized a series of camptothecinCPT-bile  analogues which have obtained national patentin order to improve their tumour-targeting chemotherapeutic effects on liver or  cancers and we obtained national patent.. Among these analogues, the compound G2 shows thehigh highest antitumor activity with enhanced liver targeting and improved oral absorption. It is significant Fto further investigate the possible anticancer mechanism of G2 is significant for its further clinical research and application. <p> Objective: We aimed to unearth the anticancer mechanism of G2 in HepG2 and HCT116 cells. <p> Methods: Cell viability was measured using MTT assay; cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometer; ROS was measured by fluorescent microplate reader; the mRNA and protein levels of cell cycle-related and apoptosis-associated proteins were examined by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. <p> Results: We found that G2 remarkably inhibited cells proliferation of HepG2 and HCT116 remarkably cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, G2-treatment led to S and G2/M phase arrest in both cells, which could be elucidated by the change of mRNA levels of p21, p27 and Cyclin E and the increased protein level of p21. G2 also induced dramatically ROS accumulated and MMP decreased, which contributed to the apoptosis through activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways via changing the genes and proteins expression involved in apoptosis pathway in both of HepG2 and HCT116 cells. <p> Conclusion: These findings suggested that the apoptotis in both cell lines induced by G2 in both cell lines was related to both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26278512>Enhanced antitumour drug delivery to cholangiocarcinoma through the apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter (ASBT).</a></h2><p>Novel antitumour drugs, such as cationic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are useful in many types of  but not in others, such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), where their uptake through specific membrane transporters, such as OCT1, is very poor. Here we have investigated the usefulness of targeting cytostatic bile  derivatives to enhance the delivery of chemotherapy to tumours expressing the bile  transporter ASBT and whether this is the case for CCA. The analysis of paired samples of CCA and adjacent non-tumour tissue collected from human (n=15) and rat (n=29) CCA revealed that ASBT expression was preserved. Moreover, ASBT was expressed, although at different levels, in human and rat CCA cell lines. Both cells in vitro and rat tumours in vivo were able to carry out efficient uptake of bile  derivatives. Using Bamet-UD2 (cisplatin-ursodeoxycholate conjugate) as a model ASBT-targeted drug, in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity was evaluated. ASBT expression enhanced the sensitivity to Bamet-UD2, but not to cisplatin, in vitro. In nude mice, Bamet-UD2 (more than cisplatin) inhibited the growth of human  adenocarcinoma tumours with induced stable expression of ASBT. As compared with cisplatin, administration of Bamet-UD2 to rats with CCA resulted in an efficient liver and tumour uptake but low exposure of extrahepatic tissues to the drug. Consequently, signs of liver/renal toxicity were absent in animals treated with Bamet-UD2. In conclusion, endogenous or induced ASBT expression may be useful in pharmacological strategies to treat enterohepatic tumours based on the use of cytostatic bile  derivatives.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes  risk in the liver and . The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942193>The role of bile acids in cellular invasiveness of gastric .</a></h2><p>Bile acids have been implicated in the development of digestive tract malignancy by epidemiological, clinical and animal studies. The growth and transformation signaling by most of the bile acids is thought to be related to the induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The highly hydrophobic bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic  (CD) and  can promote carcinogenesis and stimulate the invasion of  cells. On the contrary, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a less hydrophobic stereoisomer of CD, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in  cells. We examined the effects of bile  on human gastric  cells MKN-74.Early-passage human gastric  MKN-74 cells were used for drug treatment, preparation of whole cell lysates, subcellular extracts and Western blot analysis. The levels of PGE2 released by the cells were measured by enzyme inummoassay to indicate COX-2 enzymatic activity. Cellular invasion assay was performed in Boyden chamber.Exposure of CD led to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha, increased COX-2 expression and increased PGE2 synthesis. The induced COX-2 protein expression could be detected within 4 h exposure of 200 μM CD, and it was dose- and time-dependent. PGE2 is the product of COX-2, and has been reported to cause tumor invasion and angiogenesis in animal study. Safingol (SAF), a PKC inhibitor, suppressed the COX-2 protein expression and PGE2 production by CD in MKN-74. Furthermore, UDCA suppressed PGE2 production by CD but did not affect COX-2 protein expression induced by CD. Using a Boyden chamber invasion assay, both SAF and UDCA impeded CD induced tumor invasiveness of MKN-74 by 30-50%.Our results indicate that signaling of hydrophobic bile  such as CD in gastric  cells is through PKC activation and COX-2 induction, which leads to increased cellular invasion. By perturbing the bile  pool, UDCA attenuates CD-induced PGE2 synthesis and tumor invasiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27942212>Multiple nanoemulsion system for an oral combinational delivery of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil: preparation and in vivo evaluation.</a></h2><p>Oxaliplatin (OXA) is a third-generation cisplatin analog that has been approved as first-line chemotherapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of resectable and advanced colorectal . However, the therapeutic efficacy of oral OXA and 5-FU is limited by their low bioavailability due to poor membrane permeability. The aim of the present study was to develop an oral delivery system for OXA and 5-FU. We constructed an ion-pairing complex of OXA with a  derivative (N-deoxycholyl-l-lysyl-methylester, DCK) (OXA/DCK) as a permeation enhancer. Next, we prepared multiple water-in-oil-in-water nanoemulsions incorporating OXA/DCK and 5-FU to enhance their oral absorption. To evaluate their membrane permeability, we assessed in vitro permeabilities of OXA/DCK and 5-FU through an artificial intestinal membrane and Caco-2 cell monolayer. Finally, oral bioavailability in rats and tumor growth inhibition in the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell (CT26)-bearing mouse model were investigated after oral administration of nanoemulsion containing OXA/DCK and 5-FU. The droplet size of the optimized nanoemulsion was 20.3±0.22 nm with a zeta potential of -4.65±1.68 mV. In vitro permeabilities of OXA/DCK and 5-FU from the nanoemulsion through a Caco-2 cell monolayer were 4.80- and 4.30-fold greater than those of OXA and 5-FU, respectively. The oral absorption of OXA/DCK and 5-FU from the nanoemulsion also increased significantly, and the resulting oral bioavailability values of OXA/DCK and 5-FU in the nanoemulsive system were 9.19- and 1.39-fold higher than those of free OXA and 5-FU, respectively. Furthermore, tumor growth in CT26 tumor-bearing mice given the oral OXA/DCK- and 5-FU-loaded nanoemulsion was maximally inhibited by 73.9%, 48.5%, and 38.1%, compared with tumor volumes in the control group and the oral OXA and 5-FU groups, respectively.

To search for clues to the mechanism of CPT-11-induced toxicity, metabolomics was applied using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of CPT-11 induced loss of body weight, and intestine toxicity. Changes in gallbladder morphology suggested alterations in bile  metabolism, as revealed at the molecular level by analysis of the liver, bile, and ileum metabolomes between the vehicle-treated control group and the CPT-11-treated group. Analysis of immune cell populations further showed that CPT-11 treatment significantly decreased the IL-10-producing CD4 T cell frequency in intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes, but not in spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes. In vitro cell culture studies showed that the addition of bile acids  and taurodeoxycholic  accelerated the CPT-11-induced suppression of IL-10 secretion by activated CD4(+) naive T cells isolated from mouse splenocytes. These results showed that CPT-11 treatment caused metabolic changes in the composition of bile acids that altered CPT-11-induced suppression of IL-10 expression.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889418>METABOLIC DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND ITS BIOMARKERS.</a></h2><p>Existing methods of clustering of gut microbiota (enterotypes, clusters, gradients), as well as the term 'phylogenetic core' do not reflect its functional activity. The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in  (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal  (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27908290>Bile : a potential inducer of  stem cells.</a></h2><p>Although the unconjugated secondary bile acids, specifically  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), are considered to be risk factors for colorectal , the precise mechanism(s) by which they regulate carcinogenesis is poorly understood. We hypothesize that the cytotoxic bile acids may promote stemness in  epithelial cells leading to generation of  stem cells (CSCs) that play a role in the development and progression of .Normal human  epithelial cells (HCoEpiC) were used to study bile  DCA/LCA-mediated induction of CSCs. The expression of CSC markers was measured by real-time qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to isolate CSCs. T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) luciferase assay was employed to examine the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Downregulation of muscarinic 3 receptor (M3R) was achieved through transfection of corresponding siRNA.We found DCA/LCA to induce CSCs in normal human  epithelial cells, as evidenced by the increased proportion of CSCs, elevated levels of several CSC markers, as well as a number of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers together with increased colonosphere formation, drug exclusion, ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression, and induction of M3R, p-EGFR, matrix metallopeptidases, and c-Myc. Inhibition of M3R signaling greatly suppressed DCA/LCA induction of the CSC marker ALDHA1 and also c-Myc mRNA expression as well as transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF.Our results suggest that bile acids, specifically DCA and LCA, induce  stemness in  epithelial cells by modulating M3R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and thus could be considered promoters of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026836>Butyrate and  play common and distinct roles in HCT116 human  cell proliferation.</a></h2><p>Consumption of a high-fat diet causes an increase in bile   (DCA) in  lumen and  risk, while butyrate, an intestinal microbiota metabolite of dietary fiber, has been shown to exhibit -preventive effects. To distinguish these opposing effects of DCA and butyrate (two major metabolites in  lumen), we examined the effects of physiologically relevant doses of butyrate (0.5-2 mmol/l) and DCA (0.05-0.3 mmol/l) on  cell proliferation. We hypothesize that butyrate and DCA each modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis via common and distinct cellular signaling targets. In this study, we demonstrated that both butyrate and DCA inhibited cell proliferation by up to 89% and 92% and increased cell apoptosis rate by up to 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that butyrate led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction, but DCA induced an increase in only G1 fraction with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction when compared with the untreated cells. The examination of early cellular signaling revealed that DCA but not butyrate increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, genomic DNA breakage, the activation of ERK1/2, caspase-3 and PARP. In contrast, DCA decreased activated Rb protein level, and butyrate but not DCA increased p21 expression. Collectively, although both butyrate and DCA inhibit  cell proliferation, butyrate increases tumor suppressor gene expression, whereas DCA decreases tumor suppressor activation in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26767984>Protective effect of agaro-oligosaccharides on gut dysbiosis and  tumorigenesis in high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD)-induced alteration in the gut microbial composition, known as dysbiosis, is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for various diseases, including . This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain fatty  contents and bile  metabolism in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal microbiota profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut microbiota significantly. Changes in the microbiota composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the microbiota community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the  derived from HFD-treated mice. Our results suggest that oral intake of AGO prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby inhibiting  carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475007>Bile  induces MUC2 expression and inhibits tumor invasion in gastric carcinomas.</a></h2><p>Bile acids might induce mucin expression and regulate tumor behavior in esophageal and  cancers.

The aim of the current study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which bile acids regulate tumor invasion in GC.We investigated bile -induced MUC2 expression and cell invasion and migration in the cultured GC cell lines, SNU-216, and MKN45. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and Snail was performed on 389 archival paraffin-embedded tissues of GC to evaluate the correlation of their expression with prognosis. (DCA), a secondary bile , had no effect on the viability of SNU-216 and MKN45 GC cells at low concentrations (0-100 μM), but decreased viability at a higher concentration (200 μM). MKN45 cells showed higher MUC2 expression than SNU-216 cells under basal conditions. DCA treatment upregulated MUC2 mRNA expression in both SNU-216 and MKN45 cells. Expression of Snail and MMP9 was markedly decreased by DCA treatment, and E-cadherin expression was subsequently increased. DCA significantly inhibited invasion and migration of SNU-216 and MKN45 cells. In human GC, MUC2 expression showed a negative correlation with Snail expression (P = 0.021) and a significantly positive correlation with better prognosis (P = 0.023).Taken together, our data suggest that DCA induced MUC2 expression in GC cells and inhibited tumor invasion and migration.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type  cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection .

UDCA is also a long-established drug, largely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders. The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of  cells. The effects of UDCA on  cell migration,  stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked.

Here, they stimulate the growth and activity of 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria, which convert primary into secondary bile acids that show tumorigenic activity, especially  (DCA). Fecal levels of secondary bile acids correlate with mucosal and metabolic markers of colorectal  (CRC) risk in high and low risk adult individuals and can be modified within a few weeks by dietary change. While gut bacteria regulate the bile  pool via complex microbial biotransformation, bile acids alter the gut microbiota composition due to their antimicrobial properties. This mutual reaction induces altered bile  pools and dysbiotic compositions of the gut microbiota that may show tumor-promoting activity of bile acids beyond their conversion to DCA.Bile acids act as tumor promoters in the . Diet and the gut microbiota are most likely the key drivers that mediate and confer bile -associated tumorigenic activity. Bacterial conversion of bile acids in the  has a significant impact on their tumorigenic activity, substantiating the hypothesis that diet affects CRC risk through its effects on  microbial metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339173> disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet, which leads to an increased level of  (DCA) in the intestine, is a major environmental factor in the development of colorectal  (CRC). However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal  and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30794774>FXR Regulates Intestinal  Stem Cell Proliferation.</a></h2><p>Increased levels of intestinal bile acids (BAs) are a risk factor for colorectal  (CRC). Here, we show that the convergence of dietary factors (high-fat diet) and dysregulated WNT signaling (APC mutation) alters BA profiles to drive malignant transformations in Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5)  stem cells and promote an adenoma-to-adenocarcinoma progression. Mechanistically, we show that BAs that antagonize intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) function, including tauro-β-muricholic  (T-βMCA) and  (DCA), induce proliferation and DNA damage in Lgr5 cells. Conversely, selective activation of intestinal FXR can restrict abnormal Lgr5 cell growth and curtail CRC progression. This unexpected role for FXR in coordinating intestinal self-renewal with BA levels implicates FXR as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

FXR expression is reduced in colorectal tumors of subjects carrying inactivated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this reduction may offer new molecular targets for  prevention.We investigated how APC inactivation influences the regulation of FXR expression in  mucosal cells. We hypothesized that APC inactivation would epigenetically repress nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (FXR gene name) expression through increased CpG methylation.Normal proximal  mucosa and normal-appearing adjacent  mucosa and  tumors were collected from wild-type C57BL/6J and Apc-deficient (Apc(Min) (/+)) male mice, respectively. The expression of Fxr, ileal bile -binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In both normal and adjacent  mucosa and  tumors, we measured CpG methylation of Fxr in bisulfonated genomic DNA. In vitro, we measured the impact of APC inactivation and  (DCA) treatment on FXR expression in human  HCT-116 cells transfected with silencing RNA for APC and HT-29 cells carrying inactivated APC.In Apc(Min) (/+) mice, constitutive CpG methylation of the Fxrα3/4 promoter was linked to reduced (60-90%) baseline Fxr, Ibabp, and Shp and increased Cox-2 expression in apparently normal adjacent mucosa and  tumors. Apc knockdown in HCT-116 cells increased cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) and lowered (∼50%) FXR expression, which was further reduced (∼80%) by DCA. In human HCT-116 but not HT-29  cells, DCA induced FXR expression and lowered CpG methylation of FXR.We conclude that the loss of APC function favors the silencing of FXR expression through CpG hypermethylation in mouse  mucosa and human  cells, leading to reduced expression of downstream targets (SHP, IBABP) involved in BA homeostasis while increasing the expression of factors (COX-2, c-MYC) that contribute to inflammation and .© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648597>Secondary bile acids inhibit Candida albicans growth and morphogenesis.</a></h2><p>Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of fungal infections in humans with a significant mortality rate. However, the factors involved in C. albicans gastrointestinal (GI) colonization remain unclear. We hypothesize that secondary bile acids have direct antifungal activity against C. albicans and may play a critical role in maintaining GI colonization resistance against C. albicans. In this study, we investigated the effect of secondary bile acids including lithocholic  (LCA) and  (DCA) on C. albicans growth and morphogenesis. Results indicate that LCA and DCA at in vivo cecal micelle concentrations inhibit C. albicans growth in vitro. Interestingly, LCA and DCA also significantly inhibited the germ tube, hyphae and biofilm formation in C. albicans. In addition, pre-treatment of C. albicans with LCA and DCA significantly reduced the percentage of C. albicans cells attached to a  cell line. Collectively, our results demonstrate that secondary bile acids play an important role in controlling the growth and morphological switching of C. albicans.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes, microbiota profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and  butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice. Microbiota transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty  methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples.

It correlates to a high fat diet, which causes an increase of the secondary bile acids including deoxycholate (DOC) in the intestine. We aimed to determine the effects of DOC on intestinal carcinogenesis in Apc (min/+) mice, a model of spontaneous intestinal adenomas. Four-week old Apc (min/+) mice were treated with 0.2 % DOC in drinking water for 12 weeks. The number and size of tumors were measured, and tissue sections were prepared for the evaluation of intestinal carcinogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The activation of Wnt signaling was detected in the intestinal tumor cells of the Apc (min/+) mice, and also in the human  samples. DOC increased the number of intestine tumors by 165.1 % compared with that in untreated Apc (min/+) mice mainly in the middle and distal segments of the small intestine and . The numbers of all sizes of tumors in the small intestine were increased. Intestinal carcinogenesis was confirmed in 75 % mice in DOC treated-Apc (min/+) mice compared with 0 % in untreated mice. This was accompanied by promoting tumor cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis, and increasing the percentage of β-catenin positive cells and its nuclear expression in intestinal tumor cells of Apc (min/+) mice, and also up-regulating the expression of cyclin D1. In addition, the activation of Wnt signaling also played in modulating human  carcinogenesis.

The UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes use UDP-glucuronic , and UGT3 enzymes use UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-glucose, and UDP-xylose to conjugate xenobiotics, including drugs and endobiotics such as metabolic byproducts, hormones, and signaling molecules. This metabolism renders the substrate more polar and more readily excreted from the body and/or functionally inactive. The fourth UGT family, called UGT8, contains only one member that, unlike other UGTs, is considered biosynthetic. UGT8 uses UDP galactose to galactosidate ceramide, a key step in the synthesis of brain sphingolipids. To date other substrates for this UGT have not been identified and there has been no suggestion that UGT8 is involved in metabolism of endo- or xenobiotics. We re-examined the functions of UGT8 and discovered that it efficiently galactosidates bile acids and drug-like bile  analogs. UGT8 conjugates bile acids ∼60-fold more efficiently than ceramide based on in vitro assays with substrate preference  > chenodeoxycholic  > cholic  > hyodeoxycholic  > ursodeoxycholic . Activities of human and mouse UGT8 are qualitatively similar. UGT8 is expressed at significant levels in kidney and gastrointestinal tract (intestine, ) where conjugation of bile acids is likely to be metabolically significant. We also investigate the structural determinants of UDP-galactose selectivity. Our novel findings suggest a new role for UGT8 as a modulator of bile  homeostasis and signaling.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465107>Secondary bile acids effects in  pathology.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TUDCA in the pathogenesis of CAC.Colitis-associated  was induced in mice using azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate administration, and TUDCA's effect on tumor development was evaluated. HCT 116 and COLO 205 were treated with TUDCA or vehicle and then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation was evaluated by immunoblot assay. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell viability assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF were performed.Tauroursodeoxycholic  significantly attenuated the development of CAC in mice. Exposure to TUDCA resulted in extensive epithelial apoptosis and reduced levels of phospho-IκB kinase in the . In HCT 116 cells stimulated with TNF-α, TUDCA significantly inhibited IL-8 and IL-1α expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, in both HCT 116 and COLO 205 cells, TUDCA reduced cell viability and downregulated the expression of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF.These results demonstrated that TUDCA suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates colitis-associated tumorigenesis, suggesting that TUDCA could be a potential treatment for CAC.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29956475> activates epidermal growth factor receptor and promotes intestinal carcinogenesis by ADAM17-dependent ligand release.</a></h2><p>High fat diet is implicated in the elevated  (DCA) in the intestine and correlated with increased  risk. However, the potential mechanisms of intestinal carcinogenesis by DCA remain unclarified. Here, we investigated the carcinogenic effects and mechanisms of DCA using the intestinal tumour cells and Apc mice model. We found that DCA could activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and promote the release of EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG), but not HB-EGF or TGF-α in intestinal tumour cells. Moreover, ADAM-17 was required in DCA-induced promotion of shedding of AREG and activation of EGFR/Akt signalling pathway. DCA significantly increased the multiplicity of intestinal tumours and accelerated adenoma-carcinoma sequence in Apc mice. ADAM-17/EGFR signalling axis was also activated in intestinal tumours of DCA-treated Apc mice, whereas no significant change occurred in tumour adjacent tissues after DCA exposure.

A common feature is the progressive destruction of bile ducts leading to cholestasis with fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver over time. The diseases are mostly identified during routine laboratory testing. Clinical signs and symptoms such as pruritus, fatigue or jaundice are infrequent in the early stage.The diagnostic work-up involves the patient's history, physical examination, serological tests, abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and, where necessary, liver biopsy and genetic testing.Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is an effective treatment of PBC. Second-line therapies in addition to UDCA for incomplete UDCA responders are obeticholic  (OCA) and bezafibrate, whereby only OCA has received approval for this indication from American (Federal Drug Administration) and European (European Medicines Agency) authorities. In PSC, UDCA improves prognostic markers; dominant bile duct strictures are treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation. Despite therapy, liver transplantation is frequently necessary for PSC. The risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma, , and gallbladder  is increased for patients with PSC. In contrast to PBC and PSC, IAC responds well to corticosteroids.

Specifically, increased levels of the bile   (DCA), an established tumor promoter, has been shown to correlate with increased development of colorectal adenomas and progression to carcinoma. Herein we investigate the mechanism by which DCA leads to EGFR-MAPK activation, a candidate mechanism by which DCA may promote colorectal tumorigenesis. DCA treated  cells exhibited strong and prolonged activation of ERK1/2 when compared to EGF treatment alone. We also showed that DCA treatment prevents EGFR degradation as opposed to the canonical EGFR recycling observed with EGF treatment. Moreover, the combination of DCA and EGF treatment displayed synergistic activity, suggesting DCA activates MAPK signaling in a non-canonical manner. Further evaluation showed that DCA treatment increased intracellular calcium levels and CAMKII phosphorylation, and that blocking calcium with BAPTA-AM abrogated MAPK activation induced by DCA, but not by EGF. Finally we showed that DCA-induced CAMKII leads to MAPK activation through the recruitment of c-Src. Taken together, we demonstrated that DCA regulates MAPK activation through calcium signaling, an alternative mechanism not previously recognized in human  cells. Importantly, this mechanism allows for EGFR to escape degradation and thus achieve a constitutively active state, which may explain its tumor promoting effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
