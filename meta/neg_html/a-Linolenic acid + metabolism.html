Six groups of male Wistar rats were employed in this study, wherein five groups were fed with a high cholesterol diet (stock diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol) for 30 days, among which, two groups of rats were also treated with EPA-DHA rich sterol ester in two doses (25 and 50 mg/rat/day, oral gavage) and two groups were treated with ALA rich sterol ester also in two doses (25 and 50 mg/rat/day, oral gavage). The remaining one group served as control. Abnormal increases in the levels of malondialdehyde, as well as depressed antioxidants status, were observed in hepatic tissue of hypercholesterolemic control group. Hypercholesterolemia induced abnormal elevation in the activities of marker enzymes in liver (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase) and was accompanied by increased hepatic cholesterol level and altered fatty changes in the histology of liver. These changes were restored partially in the groups administered with lower doses (25 mg/rat/day) of sterol esters. However, the higher doses (50 mg/rat/day) of sterol esters almost ameliorated the hypercholesterolemic-oxidative changes in the hypercholesterolemic rats. The results of this study present oxidative injury induced by hypercholesterolemic diet and administration of the treatment with higher doses of sterol esters afforded sound protection against lipemic-oxidative injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12733752>Whole-body utilization of n-3 PUFA in n-6 PUFA-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the utilization of   (18:3n-3) in growing rats consuming a diet deficient in n-6 PUFA. After 90 d, whole-body 18:3n-3 accumulation was 55% lower, total n-3 PUFA accumulation was 21% lower, and 18:3n-3 disappearance was 14% higher in n-6 PUFA-deficient rats. Part of the reduction of whole-body 18:3n-3 in n-6 PUFA-deficient rats was due to the 25% increase in net conversion of 18:3n-3 to long-chain n-3 PUFA. Despite adequate 18:3n-3 intake, n-6 PUFA deficiency decreased the accumulation of 18:3n-3 and total n-3 PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21443816>Dietary intake of α-linolenic  and low ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA are associated with decreased exhaled NO and improved asthma control.</a></h2><p>As recently described, adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with improved asthma control. However, evidence of how specific nutrients such as fatty  and antioxidants may affect this relationship remains largely unknown. We aimed to examine the association between dietary intake of fatty  and antioxidants and asthma control. A cross-sectional study was developed in 174 asthmatics, mean age of 40 (SD 15) years. Dietary intake was obtained by a FFQ, and nutritional content was calculated using Food Processor Plus™ software (ESHA Research, Inc., Salem, OR, USA). Good asthma control was defined by the combination of forced expiratory volume during the first second, exhaled NO (eNO) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score (control: forced expiratory volume in the first second ≥80 %; eNO ≤35 ppb; ACQ <1·0, scale 0-6 score). Multiple linear and logistic regression models were performed to analyse the associations between nutrients and asthma outcomes, adjusting for confounders. A high n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio predicted high eNO, whereas high intakes of n-3 PUFA,   (ALA) and SFA were associated with low eNO. Odds for controlled asthma improved along with an increased intake of n-3 PUFA (OR 0·14, 95% CI 0·04, 0·45; P for trend=0·001), SFA (OR 0·36, 95% CI 0·13, 0·97; P for trend=0·047) and ALA (OR 0·18, 95% CI 0·06, 0·58; P for trend=0·005). A high n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio increased the odds for uncontrolled asthma (OR 3·69, 95% CI 1·37, 9·94; P for trend=0·009), after adjusting for energy intake, sex, age, education and use of inhaled corticosteroids. Higher intakes of n-3 PUFA, ALA and SFA were associated with good asthma control, while the risk for uncontrolled asthma increased with a higher n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio. The present results introduce a protective effect of ALA in asthma control, independent of marine n-3 fatty , and provide a rationale to dietary intervention studies in asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951696>Alpha-eleostearic  induces autophagy-dependent cell death through targeting AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signal together with the generation of reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Alpha-eleostearic  (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3),   isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically-active compound that has been shown to possess potent anti-tumor properties. Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA induced apoptosis and autophagy with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells. Treatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phase in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also induced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading to a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC3 II compared to that of the control. The autophagy was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry through monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining. It appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanism against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mTOR signaling, and AKT were further reduced by pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhanced. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that the generation of ROS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding death promotion.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Two months before insemination, the rabbits (15 animals/group) were fed different diets: commercial standard (group C), supplemented with 10% extruded linseed (group L), and 3% fish oil (group FO). The L group does showed both the highest feed intake before AI (P < 0.01) and the highest body weight (BW) throughout pregnancy (P < 0.001). The L does yielded less milk than the C does (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in either weight or size of litter at weaning. Regardless of diet, insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR values were higher during the first half of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the L does showed higher mean insulin concentrations than FO rabbits (P < 0.01) and the lowest glucose clearance (P < 0.01) during pregnancy. On the other hand, pregnant FO rabbits showed the lowest glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and the lowest Homeostasis model assessment values for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, P < 0.05) as well as a faster restoration of baseline glucose levels following glucose load (P < 0.001). Before and during pregnancy, the BW of the rabbits was positively related to fasting sample- and tolerance test-derived indices of insulin resistance (P < 0.05) suggesting that a high pre-pregnancy BW predisposes to gestational insulin resistance. Linseed supplementation increased BW and predisposed to insulin resistance during pregnancy; whereas, fish oil improved insulin sensitivity without significant changes in BW.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Female SHR were fed a linoleic  rich (LAr) diet (13.3 cal % LA, sunflower oil),   rich (LNAr) diet (18.8 cal % LNA, 3.9 cal % LA; linseed oil) and a PUFA deficient diet (0.5 cal % LA, hydrogenated palm kernel fat), respectively, during the last week of pregnancy and during the suckling period. Corresponding diets were given to the male offspring up to an age of 16 weeks. Our results demonstrate that the attenuation of hypertension development in LAr and LNAr fed male SHR was paralleled by an increased in-vitro uptake of 14C-norepinephrine into cardiac and aortic tissues as well as an increased degradation rate of 14C-norepinephrine in cardiac tissue. Ex vivo prostaglandin (PG) formation was reduced after LNAr diet in the aorta (PGF2 alpha, PGI2-like material) and in the kidney medulla (PGE, PGF2 alpha). It is concluded that an increased catecholamine inactivation may play a role in the attenuation of hypertension development in LAr and LNAr diet fed SHR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2864692>  as a regulator of the  of arachidonic : dietary implications of the ratio, n-6:n-3 fatty .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23328113>Low-n-6 and low-n-6 plus high-n-3 diets for use in clinical research.</a></h2><p>Few trials have evaluated the  effects and health outcomes of lowering dietary n-6 PUFA. The objectives of the present paper were (1) to report the methods employed to lower dietary n-6 PUFA, while either increasing or maintaining n-3 PUFA intake and (2) to validate our methods with 24 h recalls and erythrocyte fatty  analyses. A total of sixty-seven subjects were randomised to either (1) an average-n-3 PUFA, low-n-6 PUFA (L6) intervention designed to lower linoleic  (LA; #2·5% of energy (en%)) and arachidonic  (#60 mg/d), while maintaining an average US intake of n-3 PUFA or (2) a high-n-3 PUFA, low-n-6 PUFA (H3-L6) intervention designed to lower n-6 LA, while increasing the n-3 PUFA   (ALA; $1·5 en%) and EPA þ DHA ($1000 mg/d). Pre- and intraintervention nutrient intakes were estimated with six 24 h dietary recalls per subject. Both groups achieved the targeted reductions in dietary LA to #2·5 en% (median LA 2·45 (2·1, 3·1); P,0·001). Intakes of n-3 PUFA did not change for the L6 group. Target increases in n-3 ALA (median 1·6 en%, (1·3, 2·0), P,0·001) and EPA þ DHA (1482 mg, (374, 2558), P,0·001) were achieved in the H3-L6 group. Dietary changes were validated by corresponding changes in erythrocyte n-6 and n-3 fatty  composition. Dietary LA can be lowered to #2·5 en%, with or without concurrent increases in dietary n-3 PUFA, in an outpatient clinical trial setting using this integrated diet method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090251>Keloids in rural black South Africans. Part 3: a lipid model for the prevention and treatment of keloid formations.</a></h2><p>In the third part of this study a basic lipid model (regarding phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and free fatty ) for keloids (n=20), compared with normal skin of keloid prone and non-keloid prone patients (n=20 of each), was constructed according to standard methods, to serve as a sound foundation for essential fatty  supplementation strategies in the prevention and treatment of keloid formations. Essential fatty  deficiency (EFAD) of the omega-6 series (linoleic  (LA), g-linolenic  (GLA), and dihomo-g-linolenic  (DGLA)) and the omega-3 series (  (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)), but enhanced arachidonic  (AA) levels, were prevalent in keloid formations. Enhanced AA, but a deficiency of AA precursors (LA, GLA and DGLA) and inflammatory competitors (DGLA and EPA), are inevitably responsible for the overproduction of pro-inflammatory metabolites (prostaglandin E(2)(PGE(2))) participating in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Of particular interest was the extremely high free oleic  (OA) levels present, apart from the high free AA levels, in the keloid formations. OA stimulates PKC activity which, in turn, activates PLA(2)activity for the release or further release of AA from membrane pools. Interactions between EFAs, eicosanoids, cytokines, growth factors and free radicals can modulate the immune response and the immune system in undoubtedly involved in keloid formation. The histopathology of keloids can be adequately explained by: persistence of inflammatory- and cytokine-mediated reactions in the keloid/dermal interface and peripheral areas, where fibroblast proliferation and continuous depletion of membrane linoleic  occur; microvascular regeneration and circulation of sufficient EFAs in the interface and peripheral areas, where maintenance of  active fibroblasts for collagen production occur; microvessel occlusion and hypoxia in the central areas, where deprivation of EFAs and oxygen with consequent fibroblast apoptosis occur, while excessive collagen remain. All these factors contribute to different fibroblast populations present in: the keloid / dermal interface and peripheral areas where increases in fibroblast proliferation and endogenous TGF-b occur, and these  active fibroblast populations are responsible for enhanced collagen production: the central areas where fibroblast populations under hypoxic conditions occur, and these fibroblasts are responsible for excessive collagen production. It was concluded that: fibroblast membrane EFAD of AA precursors and inflammatory competitors, but prevailing enhanced AA levels, can contribute to a chain of reactions eventually responsible for keloid formations.Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090250>Keloids in rural black South Africans. Part 2: dietary fatty  intake and total phospholipid fatty  profile in the blood of keloid patients.</a></h2><p>In the second part of this study, emphasis is placed on nutritional intakes (fatty  and micronutrients) and fatty  intake and  in the blood, respectively, according to a combined 24 h recall and standardized food frequency questionnaire analyses of keloid prone patients (n=10), compared with normal black South Africans (n=80), and total phospholipid blood (plasma and red blood cell ) analyses of keloid patients (n=20), compared with normal individuals (n=20). Lipid extraction and fractionation by standard procedures, total phospholipid (TPL) separation with thin layer chromatography, and fatty  methyl ester analyses with gas liquid chromatography techniques were used. Since nutrition may play a role in several disease disorders, the purpose of this study was to confirm or refute a role for essential fatty  (EFAs) in the hypothesis of keloid formations stated in part 1 of this study. (1)According to the Canadian recommendation (1991), we observed that in keloid patients linoleic  (LA) and arachidonic  (AA) dietary intakes, as EFAs of the omega-6-series, are higher than the recommended 7-11 g/d. However, the   (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) dietary intakes, as EFAs of the omega-3 series, are lower than the recommendation of 1.1-1.5 g/d. This was also the case in the control group, where a higher dietary intake of the omega-6 fatty  and a slightly lower dietary intake of the omega-3 fatty  occurred. Thus, we confirm a high dietary intake of LA (as a product of organ meats, diary products and many vegetable oils) and AA (as a product of meats and egg yolks), as well as lower dietary intakes of ALA (as a product of grains, green leafy vegetables, soy oil, rapeseed oil and linseed), and EPA and DHA (as products of marine oils). Lower micronutrient intakes than the recommended dietary allowances were observed in the keloid group that may influence EFA  and/or collagen synthesis. Of cardinal importance may be the lower intake of calcium in the keloid patients that may contribute to abnormal cell signal transduction in fibroblasts and consequent collagen overproduction, and the lower copper intake that may influence the immune system, or perhaps even the high magnesium intake that stimulates  activity. Micronutrient deficiencies also occurred in the diets of the normal black South Africans that served as a control group. In the case of plasma TPLs, deficiency of the omega-3 EFA series (ALA, EPA and DHA) occurred, and this is in accordance with the apparent lower omega-3 EFA intake in the diets of these patients. In the case of the red blood cell TPLs, as a true and reliable source of dietary fatty  intake and , sufficient EFAs of the omega-6 series (LA and AA) and the omega-3 series (ALA, EPA and DHA) occurred. For this study group a relative deficiency of nutritional omega-3 EFA intake apparently did occur, but was probably compensated for by blood fatty  .Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16841857>n-3 fatty  and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>The results of prospective cohort studies indicate that consuming fish or fish oil containing the n-3 fatty  eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is associated with decreased cardiovascular death, whereas consumption of the vegetable oil-derived n-3 fatty    is not as effective. Randomized control trials (RCTs) in the context of secondary prevention also indicate that the consumption of EPA plus DHA is protective at doses <1 g/d. The therapeutic effect appears to be due to suppression of fatal arrhythmias rather than stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. At doses >3 g/d, EPA plus DHA can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including decreasing plasma triacylglycerols, blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and inflammation, while improving vascular reactivity. Mainly on the basis of the results of RCTs, the American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat oily fish twice per week and that those with coronary heart disease eat 1 g/d of EPA plus DHA from oily fish or supplements. Directions for future research include (1) RCTs to confirm the initial trials showing that EPA plus DHA decreases cardiovascular death and additional studies to determine whether this effect is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination; the dosage of the effective components; and whether the mechanism of action in humans is prevention of fatal arrhythmias. (2) Clinical studies to determine whether the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination and the dosage of the effective components.

FFA rich in linoleic ,  , CLA, or CLNA were used as experimental fats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 wk old) were fed purified diets containing 1% of one of these experimental fats. After 4 wk of feeding, adipose tissue weights, serum and liver lipid concentrations, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and leptin levels, and hepatic beta-oxidation activities were measured. Compared with linoleic , CLA and, more potently, CLNA were found to reduce perirenal adipose tissue weight. The same trend was observed in the weight of epididymal adipose tissue. CLNA, but not CLA, was found to significantly increase serum and liver TG concentrations. Serum FFA concentration was also increased in the CLNA group more than in the other groups. The activity of beta-oxidation in liver mitochondria and peroxisomes was significantly higher in the CLNA group than in the other groups. Thus, the amount of liver TG exceeded the ability of hepatic beta-oxidation. Significant positive correlation was found between the adipose tissue weights and serum leptin levels in all animals (vs. perirenal: r = 0.557, P < 0.001; vs. epididymal: r = 0.405, P < 0.05). A less significant correlation was found between adipose tissue weights and serum TNF-alpha level (vs. perirenal: r = 0.069, P > 0.1; vs. epididymal: r = 0.382, P < 0.05). Although the mechanism for the specific effect of CLNA is not clear at present, these findings indicate that in rats CLNA modulated the body fat and TG  differently from CLA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11942484>Selective (R)-3-hydroxylation of FA by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.</a></h2><p>Soil samples were screened for microorganisms selectively transforming FA.

While it is believed that the synthesis rate of DHA from α-linolenic  (ALA) is low, how this synthesis rate compares with the amount of DHA required to maintain brain DHA levels is unknown. The objective of this work was to assess whether DHA synthesis from ALA is sufficient for the brain. To test this, rats consumed a diet low in n-3 PUFAs, or a diet containing ALA or DHA for 15 weeks. Over the 15 weeks, whole body and brain DHA accretion was measured, while at the end of the study, whole body DHA synthesis rates, brain gene expression, and DHA uptake rates were measured. Despite large differences in body DHA accretion, there was no difference in brain DHA accretion between rats fed ALA and DHA. In rats fed ALA, DHA synthesis and accretion was 100-fold higher than brain DHA accretion of rats fed DHA. Also, ALA-fed rats synthesized approximately 3-fold more DHA than the DHA uptake rate into the brain.

FA regulate PPAR activity and modulate PPAR mRNA abundance. Increasing evidence indicates that PUFA are required for optimal neuronal development and function. To gain insight into the mechanism for nutrition-induced impairment of neuronal development and function we investigated the effect of chronic n-3 FA deficiency on PPAR mRNA levels in rat brain and ocular tissues. Rats were fed for three generations a diet designed to reduce DHA levels in tissues, and the abundance of PPARalpha and PPARbeta transcripts was measured by hybridization with specific probes. Chronic consumption of the   (LNA)-insufficient diet caused a remarkable modification in DHA content in membrane phospholipids. The results reported here indicate that PPARa mRNA levels did not exhibit significant variation in ocular, hepatic, or nervous tissues from rats fed the experimental diet. In contrast, PPARalpha mRNA normalized to beta-actin mRNA was 21% higher in ocular tissue from F3 generation rats consuming the LNA-deficient diet but was independent of diet in hepatic and nervous tissues. The absolute abundance of PPARbeta transcripts showed a 17% increase in ocular tissue from rats consuming the LNA-deficient diet (F3 generation). The biological significance of the reported changes in PPARbeta mRNA in ocular tissue remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23098619>Erythrocyte stearidonic  and other n-3 fatty  and CHD in the Physicians' Health Study.</a></h2><p>Intake of marine-based n-3 fatty  (EPA, docosapentaenoic  and DHA) is recommended to prevent CHD. Stearidonic  (SDA), a plant-based n-3 fatty , is a precursor of EPA and may be more readily converted to EPA than   (ALA). While transgenic soyabeans might supply SDA at low cost, it is unclear whether SDA is associated with CHD risk. Furthermore, associations of other n-3 fatty  with CHD risk remain inconsistent. The present ancillary study examined the association of erythrocyte SDA as well as other n-3 fatty  with the risk of CHD. In a prospective nested case-control study of the Physicians' Health Study, we randomly selected 1000 pairs of incident CHD with matching controls. Erythrocyte fatty  were measured using GC. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks. Mean age was 68·7 (SD 8·7) years. In a multivariable model controlling for matching factors and established CHD risk factors, OR for CHD for each standard deviation increase of log-SDA was 1·03 (95% CI 0·90, 1·18). Corresponding values for log-ALA and log-marine n-3 fatty  were 1·04 (95% CI 0·94, 1·16) and 0·97 (95% CI 0·88, 1·07), respectively.

However, the accumulation of DHA in human body or other mammals relies on the intake of high dose of DHA for a certain period of time, and the bioconversion of dietary ALA to DHA is very limited. Therefore the mammalian cells are not rich in DHA. Here, we report a new technology for increased production of DHA in mammalian cells. By using transient transfection method, Siganus canaliculatus Δ4 desaturase was heterologously expressed in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and simultaneously, mouse Δ6-desaturase and Δ5-desaturase were overexpressed. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of Δ6/Δ5-desaturases significantly enhanced the ability of transfected cells to convert the added ALA to docosapentaenoic  (DPA) which in turn get converted into DHA directly and efficiently by the heterologously expressed Δ4 desaturase. This technology provides the basis for potential utility of these gene constructs in the creation of transgenic livestock for increased production of DHA/related products to meet the growing demand of this important PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894891>[A method using long primers for cloning the upstream sequence of delta-6 fatty  desaturases gene of Thamnidium elegans by nested inverse PCR].</a></h2><p>Thamnidium elegans is a kind of phycomycete that produces essential unsaturated fatty , particularly y-linolenic .

This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step of highly unsaturated fatty  (HUFA) synthesis . After we have isolated and cloned the gene coding delta6-fatty  desaturase from Thamnidium elegans As3.2806 (GenBank accession number DQ099380), our interest focuses on the promotion and regulation of the gene transcription. To achieve this aim, we designed long primers and used nested inverse PCR to amplify DNA flanking sequences. First, genome of Thamnidium elegans was extracted and digested with restriction enzymes EcoR I and Kpn I , respectively. Then we ligated the digested DNA with T4 ligase at low concentration which is propitious for linear DNA to joint intromolecule. According to the sequence of delta6-fatty  desaturase gene of Thamnidium elegans, we designed a couple of 35nt long inverse primers and two couples of shorter inverse primers for inverse PCR. Three rounds of PCR reactions were performed. In the primary reaction, the ligated DNA was used as a template, and the product was used as the template of the secondary reaction, the tertiary reaction was achieved in the same way. After all the three rounds of reactions, we got a nice product about 4 kb from the EcoR I digested sample, in which a 1.3kb 5' upstream sequence (GenBank accession number DQ309425) of delta6-fatty  desaturase gene containing several putative regulatory elements including TATA. box, FSE-2, AP-1 sites, CCAAT cis-element site and STRE-binding site was derived after sequencing.

For instance, the 13-HPOD was converted to three epimeric oxiranyl carbinols 1-3 (formed at a ratio ca. 4:2:1), namely the (11R,12S,13S), (11R,12R, 13S), and (11S,12S,13S) epimers of (9Z)-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic . Besides these products, a minority of oxiranyl vinyl carbinols like (10E)-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic  was formed. The 13-HPOT conversion by CYP74M2 afforded two stereoisomers of 11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9,15-octadecadienoic . Individual oxylipins were purified by HPLC and finally identified by their NMR data, including the H-NMR, 2D-COSY, HSQC, and HMBC. Thus, the CYP74M2 is the dedicated epoxyalcohol synthase.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary flaxseed supplementation, a rich source of lignans,   and soluble fiber mucilage on serum and hepatic lipid concentrations in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in hamsters.Twenty-four male Golden Syrian hamsters were used in this experiment; diabetes was induced in half of them by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight), and both diabetic and control groups were divided in 2 subgroups, one fed standard diet, and one fed standard diet supplemented with flaxseed (15%), for 20 weeks. Serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides were measured at the end of the experiment.Dietary flaxseed supplementation in diabetic hamsters was associated with significant reductions in serum TC (-24.9%), TC/HDL-C ratio (-60%) and increase in serum HDL-C (+91%) as compared to diabetic group without supplementation. There were no significant differences in serum TG levels between diabetes supplemented with flaxseed and diabetic groups. Also, flaxseed supplementation in diabetes induced significant reductions in hepatic cholesterol (-39.5%) and triglycerides levels (-28.8%).These results suggest that dietary flaxseed supplementation may reduce the incidence of diabetic macrovascular complications through improvement of lipid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11458286>Influence of dietary fat type on arterial thrombosis tendency.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease has a multifactorial aetiology, as is illustrated by the existence of numerous risk indicators, many of which can be influenced by the dietary fat type. It should be recalled, however, that only after a cause-and-effect relationship has been established between the disease and a given risk indicator (called a risk factor in that case), modifying this factor can be expected to affect disease morbidity and mortality. In this review, effects of dietary lipids on cardiovascular risk are considered, with special emphasis on modification of arterial thrombosis and platelet thrombotic processes, coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although epidemiological studies do not give entirely consistent results, replacement of dietary saturated by unsaturated fatty  generally lowers cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The few (secondary) prevention studies reported so far confirmed this for fish oil or fish oil concentrates, as well as for vegetable oils rich in oleic-, linoleic- or  . Animal thrombosis models demonstrated that dietary unsaturated fatty  reduce arterial thrombosis tendency as compared to saturated fatty . Using restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and occlusion of coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) as human models of arterial thrombosis, fish oil treatment has been shown to have an anti-thrombotic effect, but results are inconsistent (PTCA) or need confirmation (CABG). Major thrombotic and anti-thrombotic conditions and processes include endothelial integrity, thrombotic functions of blood platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. The dietary fat type can affect endothelial integrity, but results are inconsistent and often difficult to interpret in terms of arterial thrombosis tendency. The same can be concluded for platelet aggregation, especially because results of dietary interventions often depend on the aggregation measuring technique. Novel well-validated methods are required to solve this problem. Dietary fats can affect certain factors involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Thus, Factor VII activity is increased by the fat content of the diet. However, the dietary fat type seems of less importance. Studies addressing the effect of specific fatty  on extrinsic clotting and thrombin formation in vivo did not produce consistent results. The same holds for the dietary fatty  effects on promoters and inhibitors of the plasma fibrinolytic potential. Although trans unsaturated fatty  may increase cardiovascular risk, this is probably not mediated by effects on arterial thrombosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10674359>Dietary trans fatty  affect docosahexaenoic  concentrations in plasma and liver but not brain of pregnant and fetal rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the maternal-fetal transport, incorporation, and effects on liver delta-6 fatty- desaturase activity of dietary trans fatty  in pregnant rats. Three groups of six rats each were fed three experimental diets containing approximately 0%, 15%, and 30% of trans fatty  but containing the same proportion of linoleic (18:2 n-6) and  (18:3 n-3)  for 10 wk. On d 20 of pregnancy, the animals from each group were killed. We determined the fatty  profiles in plasma, brain, and liver microsomes of pregnant rats, as well as in placenta and fetal liver and brain. No changes were found in the number of fetuses of the pregnant rats. Trans fatty  were incorporated in high concentrations in placenta and in maternal and fetal tissues, except brain, strongly elevating the linoleic  proportion and lowering that of docosahexaenoic . The delta-6 fatty- desaturase activity in the liver microsomes of the pregnant rats was inhibited by trans isomers. In conclusion, high intakes of trans fatty  partially inhibit liver delta-6 fatty- desaturase in pregnant rats, which may explain, in part, the low concentrations of docosahexaenoic  in pregnant and fetal tissues. However, the fatty  composition of both fetal and pregnant rat brain remains mostly unaffected regardless of the dietary trans fatty  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22609276>Beta-eleostearic  induce apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Beta-eleostearic  (β-ESA, 9E11E13E-18:3),   isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically active compound. Herein, we investigated effects of β-eleostearic  on T24 human bladder cancer cells. In this study, results showed that β-eleostearic  had strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in T24 cells. The cell viability assay results showed that incubation with β-eleostearic  concentrations of 10-80μmol/L caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease of T24 cell viability, and the IC(50) value was 21.2μmol/L at 24h and 13.1μmol/L at 48h. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to assess apoptosis with flow cytometry. Treatment with β-eleostearic  caused massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to activation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 indicating induction of apoptosis. Subsequently, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and PEG-catalase effectively blocked the ROS elevated effect of β-eleostearic , which suggested that β-eleostearic -induced apoptosis involved ROS generated. Additionally, we found that treating T24 cells with β-eleostearic  induced activation of PPARγ. A PPARγ-activated protein kinase inhibitor was able to partially abrogate the effects of β-eleostearic . These results suggested that β-eleostearic  can induce T24 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which may be involved PPARγ activation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The main source of DHA for neural cells is food, and hepatic and astroglia DHA synthesis from essential   (C18: 3n-3). Accretion of DHA in the brain is most intensive during fetal life and the first two years of life. An adequate level of DHA in cell membranes is important for many functions of neural cells and this is presumably the reason for DHA saving in the adult mammalian brain during dietary   deficiency. DHA-containing phospholipids in membranes are flexible and membranes possessing a high content of them are quite thin, more permeable to ions and small molecules, have looser lipid packing, and finally are more "dynamic" than membranes composed of other fatty  containing phospholipids. Furthermore, these membranes create an appropriate environment for integral proteins highly condensed in neurons, such as receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and peripheral proteins. The quantity of phosphatidylserine in the inner membrane lipid layer depends on the availability of DHA to neurons. Phosphatidylserine promotes neuronal survival by translocation/activation of kinase Akt and Raf-1/MEK. DHA present in membrane phospholipids facilitates v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex formation, which is necessary for fusion of synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes necessary for transmitter exocytosis, and neurite outgrowth-dependent plasticity. DHA plays an important neuroprotective role. DHA has been shown to inhibit PGE2 synthesis and COX-1 expression in astrocytes, and DHA derivatives, especially neuroprotectins D, can suppress inflammatory responses, preventing neuronal damage or apoptosis. The results of high DHA content in neuronal membranes and formation of DHA derivates, as well as the function of DHA-dependent phosphatidylserine, may explain the promising results supporting beneficial DHA supplementation in neurodegenerative diseases and improvement of brain function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12769542>Antioxidant activity of peptides obtained from porcine myofibrillar proteins by protease treatment.</a></h2><p>Hydrolysates obtained from porcine myofibrillar proteins by protease treatment (papain or actinase E) exhibited high antioxidant activity in   peroxidation system induced by Fe(2+).

Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) can be found in brown and golden varieties; however, questions have arisen as to whether the variety may influence the health effects.The objective of this study was to compare the effects of brown and golden flaxseeds on lipid profile, glycemia, blood pressure, inflammatory status,body weight, and body composition in overweight adolescents.Seventy-five overweight adolescents (33 boys, 42 girls; age 13.7 ! 2.1 y), from Alegre-ES, Brazil, were randomized to one of the three groups (n ¼ 25) on a parallel, single-blind clinical trial. They received 28 g/d of brown flaxseed (BF), golden flaxseed (GF), or the equivalent amount of wheat bran (Control, CG) in different preparations at school from Monday to Friday for 11 wk. Blood pressure, anthropometric evaluation, and the analyses of blood total cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose, and inflammatory markers were performed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. The data were analyzed by ANCOVA at 5% significance.The groups who consumed brown and golden flaxseed showed significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Brown and golden flaxseed did not differentially affect plasma lipid responses, plasma glucose and inflammatory profile, although all groups (BF, GF, and CG) showed increased levels of TNF-a.The adolescents consumed about half the daily amount provided, which may not have been sufficient to exert the health benefits of flaxseed reported in the literature, concerning the lipid profile, inflammation biomarkers and body composition.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This diet contained about 38 mg linolenic /kg diet. Control rats were given the same diet supplemented with methyl linolenate (2,500 mg/kg diet). Male and female rats ranged in age from weaning pups to adults. Lipids were extracted from liver, brain, kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, lung, ovary, testis, adrenal, plasma, erythrocytes, retina, and adipose tissue. Fatty  of major phospholipid classes (choline phosphoglycerides, ethanolamine phosphoglycerides, and mixed serine phosphoglycerides plus inositol phosphoglycerides) or of total lipid extracts were measured by gas liquid chromatography. Growth rates and organ weights were similar in control and linolenic -deficient rats. The major effect of the deficiency was to lower the proportions of n-3 fatty , especially 22:6 n-3, in all the organs analyzed.

To examine the role of the placenta in this process, binding of four different radiolabelled fatty  (-14C-oleate, -14C-linoleate, [14C]a-linolenate and [14C]arachidonate) to human placental membranes was studied. Binding of fatty  was found to be time- and temperature dependent. At equilibrium, the total binding of oleate was highest (5.1 +/- 0.1 nmoles/mg protein) followed by linoleate (2.8 +/- 0.31 nmoles/mg protein) and arachidonate (2.06 +/- 0.4 nmoles/mg protein) and alpha-linolenate binding was lowest (0.5 +/- 0.1 nmoles/mg protein). However, oleate had the lowest specific binding (37% of the total binding) whereas arachidonate had the highest specific binding (approximately 86% of the total binding) followed by linoleate and a-linolenate (62%, and 69% of the total binding, respectively). Binding of each [14C] fatty  was also assessed in the presence of 20-fold excess of other unlabelled ligands. Binding sites seem to have preference for the binding of [14C] fatty  in the following order: arachidonic  >>> linoleic  >>   >>>>> oleic , whereas BSP and a-tocopherol did not show any competition with any of the [14C] fatty . These data suggest that the fatty  binding sites in placental membranes are specific for the fatty  but that they have heterogeneous affinities. Trans fatty  (elaidic and linoelaidic ) also competed very strongly for the [14C] fatty  binding. Polyclonal antiserum raised against placental FABPpm inhibited binding of these [14C] fatty  but with variable degrees of inhibition; EFA/LCPUFA binding was much more than that of oleate. Our data suggest that EFA/LCPUFA bound to albumin are preferentially transported by human placental membranes and that the placental FABPpm may be involved in the sequestration of EFA/LCPUFA by the placenta.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16036510>Essential fatty  depletion in children with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer from malabsorption and malnutrition and therefore may be at risk of developing polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) deficiency.

The oil possesses antiinflammatory activity due to dual inhibition of arachidonate  supplemented by antihistaminic activity. The antiinflammatory activity is not dependent on the pituitary adrenal axis. The oil possesses antipyretic activity due to prostaglandin inhibition and peripherally acting analgesic activity. The oil has been found to be effective against formaldehyde or adjuvant induced arthritis and turpentine oil induced joint edema in animals. Lipoxygenase inhibitory, histamine antagonistic and antisecretory activities of the oil contribute towards antiulcer activity. The oil can inhibit enhancement of vascular capillary permeability and leucocyte migration following inflammatory stimulus.

Intake of treated flaxseed raised plasma triacylglycerol concentrations of ALA more (P < 0.01) than intake of nontreated flaxseed did, but there was no difference (P = 0.65) in ALA increase between FLXT1 and FLXT2. Intake of treated flaxseed increased (P ≤ 0.05) muscle phospholipid ALA and eicosapentaenoic  concentrations more than nontreated flaxseed did.

The antitumor effect of the CLnA with the strongest cytotoxic effect was then examined in mice. The results showed that all CLnA isomers have strong cytotoxic effects on DLD-1 cells, with jacaric  (JA) having the strongest effect. Examination of the mechanism of cell death showed that CLnAs induce apoptosis in DLD-1 cells via lipid peroxidation. The intracellular levels of incorporated CLnAs were measured to examine the reason for differences in cytotoxic effects. These results showed that JA was taken into cells efficiently. Collectively, these results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of CLnAs is dependent on intracellular incorporation and induction of apoptosis via lipid peroxidation.

During the last decade, some fatty  (FA) have received attention because of their functional and beneficial effects on human health. The milk FA profile is affected by both diet and genetics. Differences in milk fat composition are based on biochemical pathways, and candidate genes have been proposed to explain FA profile variation. Here, the association between DGAT1 K232A, SCD1 A293V, and LEPR T945M markers with milk fat composition in southern Chile was evaluated. We selected five herds of Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Frisón Negro, Montbeliarde, and Overo Colorado cows (pasture-grazed) that received strategic supplementation with concentrates and conserved forages. We genotyped the SNPs and calculated allele frequencies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Milk fat composition was determined for individual milk samples over a year, and associations between genotypes and milk composition were studied. The most frequent variants for DGAT1, SCD1, and LEPR polymorphisms were GC/GC, C, and C, respectively. The DGAT1 GC/GC allele was associated with lower milk fat and protein content, lower saturated fatty  levels, and higher polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3 and n-6 FA, and   to cholesterolemic FA ratios, which implied a healthier FA profile. The SCD1 CC genotype was associated with a low cholesterolemic FA content, a high ratio of linolenic  to cholesterolemic FA, and lower conjugated-linolenic  and PUFA content.

Seed oils from certain plants include conjugated linolenic , which have a conjugated triene system and are geometrical and positional isomers of α-linolenic . One of these isomers, jacaric  (JA, 8c, 10t, 12c-18:3), has not been examined widely. Therefore, we investigated the absorption and  of JA in normal animals (ICR mice). An oral dose of JA of 5 mg/day for 1 week had no effects on body weight, food intake and tissue weight of mice. JA was detected in the serum, kidney, liver, lung and epididymal white adipose tissue. Analysis of the fatty  composition in liver and white adipose tissue showed a tendency to increase levels of saturated fatty  (SFAs) such as palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) and to decrease levels of monounsaturated fatty  (MUFAs) such as palmitoleic  (16:1) and oleic  (18:1). Thus, JA treatment decreased the desaturation index (16:1/16:0, 18:1/18:0) in liver and white adipose tissue. This index is used as an indicator of the activity of stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase (SCD), an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of MUFAs from SFAs. The change in this index indicates that JA inhibited SCD activity in ICR mice, and further experiments showed that JA also decreased the expression level of SCD-1 mRNA. Inhibition of SCD activity may have anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects, and therefore the findings in this study suggest that JA may be effective for preventing obesity and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/851547>Depletion of docosahexaenoic  in retinal lipids of rats fed  -deficient, linoleic -containing diet.</a></h2><p>Rats were raised for 2 generations on a diet in which 1.25% methyl linoleate was the only source of fat.

Animals were fed for 14 d with one of three diets: a control diet (group A) containing cis 18:3n-3 at a level of 2.0% of total FA, a diet (group B) in which a part of the 18:3n-3  was isomerized (1.3% of cis 18:3n-3 and 0.7% of trans 18:3n-3), or a diet (group C) with 2.0% cis 18:3n-3 and 0.7% trans 18:3n-3. Feeding animals with diets containing trans 18:3n-3 resulted in the presence of trans isomers of 18:3n-3, trans isomers of EPA, and trans isomers of DHA in phospholipids; however, the level of total trans n-3 PUFA in tissues was less than 0.3% of total tissue FA. In group B, the reduction of dietary amounts of cis 18:3n-3 was associated with a decrease in individual and total cis n-3 PUFA. In contrast, in group C there was no decrease in tissue n-3 PUFA despite the increased dietary level of trans 18:3n-3. These results suggest that the isomerization of a part of dietary n-3 PUFA, leading to the reduction of their levels in the diet, could induce a decrease in n-3 PUFA in phospholipids. The physiological effects of trans PUFA are not known and should be considered in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7381608>Effects of linolenic  deficiency on the fatty  patterns in plasma and liver cholesteryl esters, triglycerides and phospholipids in female rats.</a></h2><p>These experiments were performed to measure the effects of linolenate deficiency upon neutral lipids of plasma and liver, and to search for a  interaction between dietary choline and linolenic . Rats were fed for two generations on  -deficient diet containing methyl linoleate as the only source of lipid. Control rats were supplemented with methyl linolenate. Second-generation linolenate-deficient rats and control rats were fed low-methionine, choline-deficient diets for 2 weeks. Half the animals in each group were given choline-supplemented diets. Plasma and liver total cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, triglyceride and major phospholipid classes, and the fatty  of these classes were measured. Linolenic  deficiency reduced the concentrations of plasma triglycerides in both choline-deficient and choline-supplemented rats. Evidence for a  interaction between choline and linolenic  was not obtained because the rats responded very weakly to the choline deficiency. Linolenate deficiency reduced the proportions of n-3 fatty , particularly 22:6n-3, in all the lipids analyzed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7914941>Failure of topical vegetable oils to prevent essential fatty  deficiency in a critically ill patient receiving long-term parenteral nutrition.</a></h2><p>This case report describes the failure of topical vegetable oils containing esters of linoleic  to prevent essential fatty  deficiency in a critically ill patient with trauma. A 40-year-old black man injured in a motor vehicle accident developed essential fatty  deficiency after being maintained on long-term, fat-free parenteral nutrition plus topical vegetable oil application because of the presence of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Biochemical evidence of this deficiency included a decrease in serum linoleic, , and arachidonic  levels with a corresponding increase in oleic and palmitoleic  levels. Cutaneous manifestations consistent with this syndrome were also present. After 3 weeks of daily topical treatments with vegetable oils rich in linoleic , biochemical abnormalities of deficiency were still evident. Over the following 2 1/2 months, 4% to 22% of the total caloric intake was delivered as intravenous fat in addition to continued topical administration of vegetable oil. Only after supplementation with intravenous fat did the patient demonstrate clinical and biochemical signs of improvement. The results show that cutaneous administration of vegetable oils as the sole source of linoleic  may be unable to prevent or treat essential fatty  deficiency in a critically ill surgical patient.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14963014>Tumor growth suppression by alpha-eleostearic ,   isomer with a conjugated triene system, via lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that conjugated linolenic  (CLnA) prepared by alkaline isomerization have a stronger antitumor effect than conjugated linoleic  (CLA). In this study we have compared the suppressive effect on tumor growth of alpha-eleostearic  (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3) with those of the CLA isomers 9Z11E-CLA and 10E12Z-CLA, using nude mice into which DLD-1 human colon cancer cells were transplanted. The results showed that alpha-ESA, which is a CLnA that can be prepared from natural sources in bulk, had a stronger antitumor effect than CLA. DNA fragmentation was enhanced and lipid peroxidation was increased in tumor tissues of the alpha-ESA-fed mice, which suggested that alpha-ESA induced apoptosis via lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, treatment of DLD-1 cells with alpha-ESA, 9Z11E-CLA and 10E12Z-CLA confirmed that alpha-ESA had a stronger antitumor effect than CLA in cultured cell lines. The induction of apoptosis by alpha-ESA was consistent with enhanced DNA fragmentation, increased caspase activity and increased expression of caspase mRNA following alpha-ESA treatment. Addition of alpha-tocopherol, an antioxidant, suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis, suggesting that these effects were associated with lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8886251>The nutritional effect of  -rich emulsion with total parenteral nutrition in a rat model with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the nutritional effect of perilla oil emulsion (POE) in a rat model with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic . POE and soybean oil emulsion (SOE) were infused at 20% of nonprotein energy during 7 days' total parenteral nutrition (TPN). After infusion of test solutions, body weight gain and cumulative nitrogen balance in the POE group were significantly higher than those in the fat-free TPN (FF) group after infusion of test solutions. Moreover, those in the POE group were higher than those in the SOE group, but no significant difference was observed between the POE and SOE groups. In the POE group, total cholesterol and phospholipid concentration in the plasma was significantly decreased compared with the FF and SOE groups. Triglyceride concentration in the plasma did not significantly differ between the POE, SOE and FF groups. Plasma lipid peroxide concentration in the POE group was significantly lower than that in the SOE group, but it was not different from the FF group. In fatty  composition in the plasma total lipids, linoleic  in the POE and SOE groups and alpha-linolenic  in the POE group were significantly increased compared with those in the FF group. Arachidonic  (AA) in the POE and FF groups were significantly decreased compared with that in the SOE group. Otherwise, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) in the POE group was significantly increased compared with that in the SOE and FF groups. EPA/AA ratio in the POE group was significantly increased compared with the SOE group. The thickness and damage score of the colon were significantly depressed in the POE group compared with the SOE group. These results suggest that POE has a superior nutritional effect and improves inflammation in the IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15966318>[Expression of Mortierella isabellina delta6-fatty  desaturase gene in gamma-linolenic  production in transgenic tobacco].</a></h2><p>Gamma-linolenic  (GLA, C18:3delta6.9.12) is nutritional and important polyunsaturated fatty  in human and animal diets. GLA play an important role in hormone regulation and fatty  metabolization. Furthermore it is also the biological precursor of a group of molecules, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes. Vast majority of oilseed crops do not produce GLA, but linoleic  (LA, C18:2delta9.12) as its substrate. GLA is only produced by a small number of oilseed plants such as evening promrose ( Oenotheera spp.), borage (Borago officinalis) and etc. delta6-fatty  desaturase (D6D) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of GLA. It can convert from linoleic  to linolenic . To produce GLA in tobacco, plant expression vector was first constructed. To facilitate preparation of plant expression constructs, flanking Xba I and Bgl II restriction enzyme sites were added to the coding region of clone pTMICL6 by PCR amplification. pTMICL6 contains delta6-fatty  desaturase gene cloned from Mortierella isabellina which is an oil-producing fugus. The PCR product was purified and subcloned into the plant expression vector pGA643 to generate the recombinant vector pGAMICL6 which contains the ORF of the D6D gene of Mortierella isabellina, together with regulatory elements consisting of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase (nos) termination sequence. The plasmid pGAMICL6 was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by method of freeze thawing of liquid nitrogen. Transformants were selected by plating on YEB medium plates containing kanamycin and streptomycin and grown overnight at 28 degrees C, then transformants were further identified by PCR. The positive transformant containing the plant expression vector pGAMICL6 was transformed into tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) via Agrobacterium infection. Transgenic plants were selected on 100 microg/mL kanamycin. Plants were maintained in axionic culture under controlled conditions. Total nucleic  were extracted and purified from anti-kanamycin transgenic tobacco and were analysed by PCR. 48 out of 80 transgenic plants were positive, in other words, transformation efficiency is 60% . This shows that Mortierella isabellina D6D gene is transformed into tobacco. Genomic DNA from PCR positive transgenic tobacco plants was digested with Hind III restriction enzyme and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern blotting was performed with strandard procedures for vacuum transfer of nucleic  to nylon membrane. The probe was delta6-fatty  desaturase gene from M. isabellina, which was labeled with DIG-dUTP via random-primed labeling. Hybridization and immumological detection were carried out the kit of DIG detection. The result shows single hybridizing bands in each of the transgenic tobacco plants DNA, but no hybridization was observed to non-transgenic tobacco. This indicates that delta6-fatty  desaturase gene is integrated into the genome of transgenic tobacco. To provide further evidence that the introduction of the M. isabellina cDNA into the tobacco genome was responsible for the novel desaturation products, total RNA was isolated from GLA-positive transgenic tobacco plants via both PCR and Southern blotting and separated by electrophoresis through 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. Northern blotting including probe labeling, hybridization and detection was the same as Southern blotting in operation approach. A positive hybridization signal of identical mobility was obtained from RNA isolated from the transgenic tobacco plants, but not from the control tobacco plant. At last, total fatty  extracted from the positive transgenic tobacco were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) of methyl esters to confirm the transgenic tobacco containing a functional delta6-fatty  desaturase gene. The result shows that two peaks were observed in the chromatogram of FAMes. GLA and octadecatetraenoic  (OTA, C18:4delta6.9.12.15) respectively have 19.7% and 3.5% of the total fatty  in the transgenic plant. The presence of both GLA and OTA indicates that the delta6-fatty  desaturase used both linoleic  and   (ALA, C18:3delta6.9.12.15) as substrates, and this may be responsible for the decrease in ALA observed in the transgenic line. That was the first report about the expression of M. isabellina delta6-fatty  desaturase gene in tobacco. All results mentioned above have laid the foundation of the thorough studying on an breeding transgenic oilseeds containing GLA to change the fatty  composition of conventional oilseeds, it is significant to study on regulation mechanism of fatty  desaturase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ-linolenic  for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty , and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to  and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

XO activity, determined by the spectrophotometric assay for urate generation over time, was completely inhibited in vitro by allopurinol at concentrations > or = 200 microM. Allopurinol's antioxidant activity was determined in vitro using   peroxidation (LAP) assay. Although the known antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene effectively inhibited LAP (80% inhibition of malondialdehyde generation at 10(1) microM), allopurinol (10(1)-10(3) microM) did not inhibit this LAP (p < .01). Rat serum obtained after oral administration of allopurinol (100 mg/kg x 2 doses) did not suppress LAP in vitro more than did control rat serum. Following oral administration of allopurinol (2-50 mg/kg x 2 doses), dose-dependent inhibition of XO activity was observed in the homogenates of the liver (to 5% of control level; p < .001) and the intestine (to 12% of control level; p < .001). We conclude that while 2-50 mg/kg of oral allopurinol effectively suppresses XO activity in the rat liver and intestine, antioxidant activity is not seen even in doses up to 100 mg/kg. The selective enzymatic inhibitory effect of allopurinol at these doses therefore should provide a useful tool to allow the discrimination of the effects of xanthine oxidase in particular from the effects of reactive oxygen metabolites in general.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2872365>[Comparison of the effect of linolenic  and eicosapentaenoic  on prostaglandin biosynthesis and thrombocyte function in humans].</a></h2><p>Platelet aggregation, bleeding time, prostaglandin biosynthesis and plasma cholesterol fatty  were investigated in 12 healthy females (25-32 years), who were given different amounts of linolenic  (0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, 16% of total energy intake) or eicosapentaenoic  (1.7%) with formula diets for 2 weeks each. Linolenic and eicosapentaenoic  prolonged the bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation and prostaglandin biosynthesis. These effects became apparent after   intake of 12% of the energy intake. A decrease in PGE in 24 h urine was observed after intake of linolenic  amounting to 8% of energy intake. Eicosapentaenoic  influenced all parameters measured ten times more than linolenic . Linolenic  intake had no effect on the ratio of linoleic/arachidonic  in plasma cholesterol esters in contrast to in vitro findings. Thus energy intake comprising 1.7% of eicosapentaenoic  is sufficient to affect thrombocyte function in man. The concomitant intake of linolenic-type fatty  inhibits the biosynthesis of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha to different degrees.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763705>Proteomic analysis of broccoli sprouts by iTRAQ in response to jasmonic .</a></h2><p>Jasmonic  (JA) is well known as  -derived signal molecule related to the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. JA can regulate various plant metabolisms, such as glucosinolate metabolism. In this study, the proteome profiles of broccoli sprouts under JA treatment were analyzed using the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome approach. A total of 122 differentially expressed proteins participating in a wide range of physiological processes were confidently identified in broccoli sprouts treated with JA. Functional classification analysis showed that photosynthesis and protein synthesis were inhibited by JA treatment, thereby inhibiting sprout growth, while proteins related to carbohydrate catabolism and amino  metabolism showed an increased expression. Additionally, proteins involved in defense and secondary metabolism were also up-regulated. Proteins related to glucosinolate biosynthesis and degradation were mediated by JA, leading to the accumulation of glucosinolates and sulforaphane. These results indicate that JA stimulated a defense response at the proteome level by redirecting metabolism of growth and physiology in broccoli sprouts.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
