Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273921>Nicotinic  suppresses sebaceous  of human sebocytes via activating hydroxycarboxylic  receptor 2 (HCA ).</a></h2><p>Nicotinic  (NA) activates hydroxycarboxylic  receptor 2 (HCA ), and it is widely used in treating dyslipidaemias. Since its side effects include skin dryness, whereas its deficiency can be accompanied by dyssebacia, characterized by sebaceous gland enlargement, we asked if HCA is expressed on human sebocytes, and if NA influences sebocyte functions. By using human immortalized SZ95 sebocytes, we found that non-cytotoxic (≤100 μmol/L; MTT-assay) concentrations of NA had no effect on the homeostatic sebaceous  (SLG; Nile Red), but normalized excessive, acne-mimicking SLG induced by several lipogenic agents (, anandamide, linoleic  + testosterone; Nile Red; 48-hr treatments). Moreover, it exerted significant anti-proliferative actions (CyQUANT-assay), and increased [Ca ] (Fluo-4 AM-based Ca -measurement). Although NA did not prevent the lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory response (up-regulation [Q-PCR] and release [ELISA] of several pro-inflammatory cytokines) of the sebocytes, collectively, these data support the concept that NA may be effective in suppressing sebum production in vivo. While exploring the mechanism of the sebostatic actions, we found that sebocytes express HCA (Q-PCR, immunofluorescent labelling), siRNA-mediated silencing of which prevented the NA-induced Ca -signal and the lipostatic action. Collectively, our data introduce NA, and HCA activators in general, as novel, potent and most likely safe sebostatic agents, with possible anti-acne potential.© 2019 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated no effect of LCPUFA supplementation after birth on BP and anthropometrics. Little is known about the association between fatty  status at birth and cardiometabolic health at older ages.To evaluate associations between docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (AA) levels in the umbilical cord and blood pressure (BP) and anthropometrics at 9years.Observational follow-up study. Multivariable analyses were carried out to adjust for potential confounders.229 children who took part in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of LCPUFA formula supplementation.BP was chosen as primary outcome; heart rate and anthropometrics as secondary outcomes.AA levels in the wall of the umbilical vein and artery were negatively associated with diastolic BP (B: vein -0.831, 95% CI: -1.578; -0.083, p=0.030; artery: -0.605, 95% CI: -1.200; -0.010, p=0.046). AA was not associated with systolic BP; DHA not with diastolic nor systolic BP. The AA:DHA ratio in the umbilical vein was negatively associated with diastolic BP (B: -1.738, 95% CI: -3.141; -0.335, p=0.015). Heart rate and anthropometrics were not associated with neonatal LCPUFA status.Higher AA levels and a higher AA:DHA ratio at birth are associated with lower diastolic BP at age 9. This suggests that the effect of LCPUFAs at early age is different from that in adults, where DHA is regarded anti-adipogenic and AA as adipogenic.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Subcutaneous and omental visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 16 healthy intact female dogs. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocyte cultures, and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in undifferentiated stromovascular cell (SVC) cultures following treatment with eicosapentaenic  (EPA, 20:5n-3),  (ARA, 20:4n-6), or palmitic  (PAM, 16:0) at 25, 50, or 100 μM. Secretion of adiponectin from mature adipocytes was higher (p < 0.001) following EPA treatment at 50 μM compared to control in subcutaneous tissue, and higher following EPA treatment compared to PAM treatment at 25 μM in both subcutaneous (p < 0.001) and visceral tissues (p = 0.010). Secretion of IL6 from SVC derived from subcutaneous tissue was lower following EPA treatment and higher following PAM treatment compared to control both at 50 μM (p = 0.001 and p = 0.041, respectively) and 100 μM (p = 0.013 and p < 0.001, respectively). These findings of stimulation of adiponectin secretion and inhibition of IL6 secretion by EPA, and stimulation of IL6 secretion by PAM, are consistent with findings of increased circulating concentrations of adiponectin and decreased circulating concentration of IL6 in dogs supplemented with dietary fish oil, and show that the effect of fish oil on circulating concentrations of adiponectin and IL6 is, at least partially, the result of local effects of EPA and PAM on adipose tissue.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28465089>Adipocyte lipid storage and adipokine production are modulated by lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins generated from 18-carbon fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Generation of oxylipins (oxygenated metabolites of fatty acids) by lipoxygenases may be responsible for the beneficial effects of 20- and 22-carbon n-3 fatty acids on adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity, but the potential actions of oxylipins derived from 18-carbon fatty acids, which are generally at higher levels in the diet, are unknown. We therefore compared the effects of select lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from α-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3 n-3), linoleic  (LA, C18:2 n-6), and  (AA, C20:4 n-6) on key adipocyte functions that are altered in obesity. Individual oxylipins were added to the culture medium of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes for 6days. Lipid accumulation was subsequently determined by Oil Red O staining, while Western blotting was used to measure levels of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and characteristics of adipocyte functionality. Addition of all oxylipins at 30nM was sufficient to significantly decrease triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets, and higher levels completely blocked lipid production. Our results establish that lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins produced from 18-carbon PUFA differentially affect multiple adipocyte processes associated with lipid storage and adipokine production. However, these effects are not due to the oxylipins blocking adipocyte maturation and thus globally suppressing all adipocyte characteristics. Furthermore, these oxylipin species decrease the lipid content of adipocytes regardless from which precursor fatty  or lipoxygenase they were derived. Consequently, adipocyte characteristics can be altered through the ability of oxylipins to selectively modulate levels of proteins involved in both lipid metabolism and adipokine production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Endogenous ligands comprise oxidized derivatives of  and structurally similar PUFAs. Although expression of PPARγ peaks in mature adipocytes, ligands are produced primarily at the onset of differentiation. Concomitant with agonist production, murine fibroblasts undergo two rounds of mitosis referred to as mitotic clonal expansion. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in either of two cell cycle inhibitors, the transcription factor p53 or its target gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, exhibit increased adipogenic potential. The antiadipogenic effect of p53 relied on its transcriptional activity and p21 expression but was circumvented by administration of an exogenous PPARγ agonist suggesting a linkage between cell cycling and PPARγ ligand production. Indeed, cell cycle inhibitory compounds decreased PPARγ ligand production in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, these inhibitors abolished the release of  induced by the hormonal cocktail initiating . Collectively, our results suggest that murine fibroblasts require clonal expansion for PPARγ ligand production at the onset of adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876761>Early infant adipose deposition is positively associated with the n-6 to n-3 fatty  ratio in human milk independent of maternal BMI.</a></h2><p>Excessive infant weight gain in the first 6-month of life is a powerful predictor of childhood obesity and related health risks. In mice, omega-6 fatty acids (FAs) serve as potent ligands driving  during early development. The ratio of omega-6 relative to omega-3 (n-6/n-3) FA in human milk (HM) has increased threefold over the last 30 years, but the impact of this shift on infant adipose development remains undetermined. This study investigated how maternal obesity and maternal dietary FA (as reflected in maternal red blood cells (RBCs) composition) influenced HM n-6 and n-3 FAs, and whether the HM n-6/n-3 ratio was associated with changes in infant adipose deposition between 2 weeks and 4 months postpartum.Forty-eight infants from normal weight (NW), overweight (OW) and obese (OB) mothers were exclusively or predominantly breastfed over the first 4 months of lactation. Mid-feed HM and maternal RBC were collected at either transitional (2 weeks) or established (4 months) lactation, along with infant body composition assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. The FA composition of HM and maternal RBC was measured quantitatively by lipid mass spectrometry.In transitional and established HM, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was lower (P=0.008; 0.005) and the  (AA)/DHA+eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) ratio was higher (P=0.05; 0.02) in the OB relative to the NW group. Maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and AA/DHA+EPA ratios in transitional and established HM were moderately correlated (P=0.018; 0.001). Total infant fat mass was increased in the upper AA/DHA+EPA tertile of established HM relative to the lower tertile (P=0.019). The amount of changes in infant fat mass and percentage of body fat were predicted by AA/EPA+DHA ratios in established HM (P=0.038; 0.010).Perinatal infant exposures to a high AA/EPA+DHA ratio during the first 4 months of life, which is primarily reflective of maternal dietary FA, may significantly contribute to the way infants accumulate adipose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317983>Critical role for cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A2 in early adipocyte differentiation and obesity.</a></h2><p> is the process of differentiation of immature mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes. Elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate adipocyte differentiation is key for the development of novel therapies for the control of obesity and related comorbidities. Cytosolic group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) is the pivotal enzyme in receptor-mediated  (AA) mobilization and attendant eicosanoid production. Using primary multipotent cells and cell lines predetermined to become adipocytes, we show here that cPLA2α displays a proadipogenic function that occurs very early in the adipogenic process. Interestingly, cPLA2α levels decrease during , but cPLA2α-deficient preadipocytes exhibit a reduced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, which affects early and terminal adipogenic transcription factors. Additionally, the absence of the phospholipase alters proliferation and cell-cycle progression that takes place during . Preconditioning of preadipocytes with AA increases the adipogenic capacity of these cells. Moreover, animals deficient in cPLA2α show resistance to obesity when fed a high fat diet that parallels changes in the expression of adipogenic transcription factors of the adipose tissue. Collectively, these results show that preadipocyte cPLA2α activation is a hitherto unrecognized factor for  in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the effect of a short exposure to AA at different stages of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. AA caused the upregulation of fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2) following 24 h of differentiation. This was mediated by the prostaglandin F(2α) (PGF(2α)), as inhibition of cyclooxygenases or PGF(2α) receptor signaling counteracted the AA-mediated aP2 induction. In addition, calcium, protein kinase C, and ERK are all key elements of the pathway through which AA induces the expression of aP2. We also show that treatment with AA during the first 24 h of differentiation upregulates the expression of the transcription factor Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) via the same pathway. Finally, treatment with AA for 24 h at the beginning of the adipocyte differentiation is sufficient to inhibit the late stages of  through a Fra-1-dependent pathway, as Fra-1 knockdown rescued .

However, the transcriptional events underlying these processes have not been fully characterized. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mouth-opening acclimation, RNA-seq was used to investigate the transcriptional profiles of the endogenous feeding, mixed feeding and exogenous feeding stages of zebrafish larvae. Differential expression analysis showed 2172 up-regulated and 2313 down-regulated genes during this stage. Genes associated with the assimilation of exogenous nutrients such as the  metabolism, linoleic  metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, and  were activated significantly, whereas dissimilation including the cell cycle, homologous recombination, and fatty  metabolism were inhibited, indicating a physiological switch for energy storage occurred during the mouth-opening stage. Moreover, the immune recognition involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway was activated and nutritional supply seemed to be required in this event confirmed by qPCR. These results suggested the energy utilization during the mouth-opening stage is more tended to be reserved or used for some important demands, such as activity regulation, immune defense, and lipid deposition, instead of rapid growth.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma-linolenic  and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28131819>Bovine lipid metabolism related gene GPAM: Molecular characterization, function identification, and association analysis with fat deposition traits.</a></h2><p>Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mitochondrial (GPAM) is the enzyme that catalyzes the initial and committed step of glycerolipid synthesis in animal lipometabolism related pathway.

However, its role in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been supported by results obtained from high-fat feeding of iPLA2β-null (PKO) mice. Unlike livers of human NAFLD and genetically obese rodents, fatty liver induced by high-fat diet is not associated with depletion of hepatic phospholipids. We therefore tested whether iPLA2β could regulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in leptin-deficient mice by cross-breeding PKO with ob/ob mice to generate ob/ob-PKO mice. Here we observed an improvement in ob/ob-PKO mice with significant reduction in serum enzymes, lipids, glucose, insulin as well as improved glucose tolerance, and reduction in islet hyperplasia. The improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by liver triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol esters was associated with decreased expression of PPARγ and de novo lipogenesis genes, and the reversal of β-oxidation gene expression. Notably, ob/ob livers contained depleted levels of lysophospholipids and phospholipids, and iPLA2β deficiency in ob/ob-PKO livers lowers the former, but replenished the latter particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contained  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Compared with WT livers, PKO livers also contained increased PE and PC containing AA and DHA. Thus, iPLA2β deficiency protected against obesity and ob/ob fatty liver which was associated with hepatic fatty-acyl phospholipid remodeling.

The mouse EP3 gene gives rise to three isoforms, namely EP3α, EP3β, and EP3γ, which differ only at their C-terminal tails. To date, functions of EP3 receptor and its isoforms in WAT remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we found that the expression of all EP3 isoforms were downregulated in WAT of both db/db and high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Genetic ablation of three EP3 receptor isoforms (EP3 mice) or EP3α and EP3γ isoforms with EP3β intact (EP3β mice) led to an obese phenotype with increased food intake, decreased motor activity, reduced insulin sensitivity, and elevated serum triglycerides. Since the differentiation of preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts to adipocytes was markedly facilitated by either pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion/inhibition of EP3 receptor via the cAMP/PKA/PPARγ pathway, increased  may contribute to obesity in EP3 and EP3β mice. Moreover, both EP3 and EP3β mice had increased lipolysis in WAT mainly due to the activated cAMP/PKA/hormone-sensitive lipase pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that EP3 receptor and its α and γ isoforms are involved in both  and lipolysis and influence food intake, serum lipid levels, and insulin sensitivity.© The Author (2016).

A pattern analysis may be a more useful approach. In addition, it remains unclear whether erythrocyte FA composition relates to insulin resistance among Hispanics/Latinos.We derived erythrocyte FA patterns for a Puerto Rican cohort and examined their association with diet and insulin resistance in cross-sectional and prospective analyses.At baseline, principal components analysis was used to derive factor patterns with the use of 24 erythrocyte FAs from 1157 participants of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (aged 45-75 y). Dietary intake was assessed with a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated at baseline and at the 2-y follow-up. Relations between FA patterns and HOMA-IR were analyzed in a sample of 922 participants with available data.Five FA patterns were derived, differentiated by 1) relatively high de novo lipogenesis (DNL) FAs and low n-6 (ω-6) FAs, 2) high very-long-chain saturated FAs, 3) high n-3 (ω-3) FAs, 4) high linoleic  and low , and 5) high trans FAs. The DNL pattern was positively correlated with sugar and inversely with n-6 and monounsaturated FA intakes. Only the DNL pattern was positively related to baseline HOMA-IR [adjusted geometric means (95% CIs) for quartiles 1 and 4: 1.72 (1.58, 1.87) and 2.20 (2.02, 2.39); P-trend < 0.0001].

Tie2-CYP2J2 gene targeting restored HF-mediated decreases in vascular heme oxygenase-1, Cyp2C44, soluble epoxide hydrolase, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated protein kinase B, and phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate protein kinase protein expression, thus improving vascular function. These changes translated into decreased inflammation and oxidative stress within adipose tissue and decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, mesoderm-specific transcript, and adipocyte 2 expression and increased uncoupling protein 1 and uncoupling protein 2 expression, reflecting the effect of vascular EET overproduction on . The current study documents a direct link between endothelial-specific EET production and , further implicating the EET-heme oxygenase-1 crosstalk as an important cytoprotective mechanism in the amelioration of vascular and adipocyte dysfunction resulting from diet-induced obesity.© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30431153>Prostacyclin: A major prostaglandin in the regulation of adipose tissue development.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) belong to the group lipid mediators and can act as local hormones. They contain 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring, and are biosynthesized from membrane phospholipid derived  through the arachidonate cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway with the help of various terminal synthase enzymes. Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I ) is one of the major prostanoids produced with the help of prostacyclin synthase (prostaglandin I synthase) enzyme and rapidly hydrolyzed into 6-keto-PGF in biological fluids. Obesity indicates an excess of body adiposity, which is globally considered as one of the major health disasters responsible for developing complex pathological situations in the human body. Adipose tissues can produce various PGs, and thus, the level and the molecular activity of these endogenously synthesized PGs are considered critical for the development of obesity. In this regard, the involvement of prostacyclin in  has been studied in the last few decades. The current review, along with the background of other related PGs, presents the several molecular aspects of endogenous prostaglandin I in adipose tissue development. Especially, the regulation of life cycle of adipocytes, impact on terminal differentiation, activity through prostacyclin receptor (IP), autocrine-paracrine manner, thermogenic adipose tissue remodeling and some future experimental aspects of prostacyclin have been focused upon in this study. This discussion might assist to develop new drug molecules acting on the signaling pathways of prostacyclin and devise therapeutic strategies for treating obesity.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913432>Transcriptome analysis reveals novel insights into the response of low-dose benzo(a)pyrene exposure in male tilapia.</a></h2><p>Despite a wide number of toxicological studies that describe benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) effects, the metabolic mechanisms that underlie these effects in fish are largely unknown. Of great concern is the presence of BaP in aquatic systems, especially those in close proximity to human activity leading to consumption of potentially contaminated foods. BaP is a known carcinogen and it has been reported to have adverse effects on the survival, development and reproduction of fish. The purpose of this study was to investigate if a low dose of BaP can alter genes and key metabolic pathways in the liver and testis in male adult tilapia, and whether these could be associated with biological endpoints disruption. We used both high-throughput RNA-Sequencing to assess whole genome gene expression following repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg of BaP (every 6 days for 26 days) and morphometric endpoints as indicators of general health. Condition factor (K) along with hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices (morphometric parameters) were significantly lower in BaP-treated fish than in controls. BaP exposure induced important changes in the gene expression pattern in liver and testis as revealed by both Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Alterations that were shared by both tissues included  metabolism, androgen receptor to prostate-specific antigen signaling, and insulin-associated effects on . The most salient liver-specific effects included: biological processes involved in detoxification, IL6-associated insulin resistance, mTOR hyperactivation, mitotic cytokinesis, spindle pole and microtubule binding. BaP effects that were confined to the testis included: immune system functions, inflammatory response, estrogen and androgen metabolic pathways. Taken together, gene expression and morphometric end point data indicate that the reproductive success of adult male tilapia could be compromised as a result of BaP exposure. These results constitute new insights on the mechanism of action of low dose BaP in a non-model organism (tilapia).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

EVs are implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-driven cardiovascular disease, although the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs are not well described. We sought to define the characteristics of adipocyte-derived EVs before and after adipogenesis, hypothesising that adipogenesis would affect EV structure, molecular composition and function. Using 3T3-L1 cells, EVs were harvested at day 0 and day 15 of differentiation. EV and cell preparations were visualised by electron microscopy and EVs quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). EVs were then assessed for annexin V positivity using flow cytometry; lipid and phospholipid composition using 2D thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography; and vesicular protein content by an immuno-phenotyping assay. Pre-adipogenic cells are connected via a network of protrusions and EVs at both time points display classic EV morphology. EV concentration is elevated prior to adipogenesis, particularly in exosomes and small microvesicles. Parent cells contain higher proportions of phosphatidylserine (PS) and show higher annexin V binding. Both cells and EVs contain an increased proportion of  at day 0. PREF-1 was increased at day 0 whilst adiponectin was higher at day 15 indicating EV protein content reflects the stage of adipogenesis of the cell. Our data suggest that EV production is higher in cells before adipogenesis, particularly in vesicles <300 nm. Cells at this time point possess a greater proportion of PS (required for EV generation) whilst corresponding EVs are enriched in signalling fatty acids, such as , and markers of adipogenesis, such as PREF-1 and PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26083030>Apolipoprotein D Transgenic Mice Develop Hepatic Steatosis through Activation of PPARγ and Fatty  Uptake.</a></h2><p>Transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human apolipoprotein D (H-apoD) in the brain are resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty  transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty  uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty  synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic  measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of  (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty  uptake by the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583582>Chronic sucrose intake decreases concentrations of n6 fatty acids, but not docosahexaenoic  in the rat brain phospholipids.</a></h2><p>We investigated the influence of high sucrose intake, administered in drinking water, on the lipid profile of the brain and on the expression of SREBP1c and Δ-desaturase genes. Adult male rats received 30% sucrose solution for 20 weeks (Sucrose group), or plain water (Control group). After the 20th week of sucrose treatment, the Sucrose group showed permanent hyperglycemia. Sucrose treatment also increased the amount of total lipids and fatty acids in the brain. The brain fatty  profile of total lipids as well as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin of the Sucrose group was extensively changed. The most interesting change was a significant decrease in n6 fatty acids, including the important , whereas the content of oleic and docosahexaenoic  remained unchanged. RT-qPCR revealed an increase in Δ-5-desaturase and SREBP1c gene expression. In conclusion, high sucrose intake via drinking water extensively changes rat brain fatty  profile by decreasing n6 fatty acids, including . In contrast, the content of docosahexaenoic  remains constant in the brain total lipids as well as in phospholipids. Changes in the brain fatty  profile reflect changes in the lipid metabolism of the rat lipogenic tissues and concentrations in the circulation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The n-6 PUFA ARA increased lipid droplet size and expression of the white-specific marker TCF21 while decreased mitochondrial protein expression and respiratory function. In contrast, EPA increased expression of the brown adipocyte-related genes UCP1 and CPT1B, and improved mitochondrial function of adipocytes. The opposing effects of EPA and ARA on gene expression and mitochondrial function were also observed in cells treated from day 8 to 12 of adipocyte differentiation.EPA promotes brite  and improves parameters of mitochondrial function, such as increased expression of CPTB1, citrate synthase activity and higher maximal respiratory capacity, while ARA reduced mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity in vitro.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

They are an important source for the industrial production of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (gamma-linolenic and ) and have been suggested as an alternative route for biodiesel production. Initial research steps for various applications include the screening of fungi in order to find efficient fungal producers with desired fatty  composition. Traditional cultivation methods (shake flask) and lipid analysis (extraction-gas chromatography) are not applicable for large-scale screening due to their low throughput and time-consuming analysis. Here we present a microcultivation system combined with high-throughput Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for efficient screening of oleaginous fungi.The microcultivation system enables highly reproducible fungal fermentations throughout 12 days of cultivation. Reproducibility was validated by FTIR and HPLC data. Analysis of FTIR spectral ester carbonyl peaks of fungal biomass offered a reliable high-throughput at-line method to monitor lipid accumulation. Partial least square regression between gas chromatography fatty  data and corresponding FTIR spectral data was used to set up calibration models for the prediction of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturation index, total lipid content and main individual fatty acids. High coefficients of determination (R = 0.86-0.96) and satisfactory residual predictive deviation of cross-validation (RPD = 2.6-5.1) values demonstrated the goodness of these models.We have demonstrated in this study, that the presented microcultivation system combined with rapid, high-throughput FTIR spectroscopy is a suitable screening platform for oleaginous fungi.

We previously demonstrated that DNA microarray analysis is an appropriate method to comprehensively evaluate the effects of a HP diet on kidney dysfunction such as calcification, fibrillization, and inflammation. We reported that type IIb sodium-dependent phosphate transporter is significantly up-regulated in this context. In the present study, we performed DNA microarray analysis to investigate the effects of a HP diet on the liver, which plays a pivotal role in  metabolism. DNA microarray analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from the livers of rats fed a control diet (containing 0.3% phosphorus) or a HP diet (containing 1.2% phosphorus). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the HP diet induced down-regulation of genes involved in hepatic amino  catabolism and lipogenesis, while genes related to fatty  β-oxidation process were up-regulated. Although genes related to fatty  biosynthesis were down-regulated in HP diet-fed rats, genes important for the elongation and desaturation reactions of omega-3 and -6 fatty acids were up-regulated. Concentrations of hepatic  and eicosapentaenoic  were increased in HP diet-fed rats. These essential fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a transcription factor for fatty  β-oxidation. Evaluation of the upstream regulators of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that PPARα was activated in the livers of HP diet-fed rats. Furthermore, the serum concentration of fibroblast growth factor 21, a hormone secreted from the liver that promotes fatty  utilization in adipose tissue as a PPARα target gene, was higher (p = 0.054) in HP diet-fed rats than in control diet-fed rats. These data suggest that a HP diet enhances  expenditure through the utilization of free fatty acids released via lipolysis of white adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237701>The whole transcriptional profiling of cellular metabolism during adipogenesis from hMSCs.</a></h2><p>Metabolism homeostasis plays an important role in progenitor-cell differentiation to adipocytes, but less is known about the whole transcriptional profiling of cellular metabolism during adipogenesis.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64% alpha-linolenic (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of , endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Six experimental diets differing basically in ARA level (0.05%, 0.22%, 0.37%, 0.60%, 1.38% and 2.32% of dry matter) were used in the feeding trial. Liver samples from fish fed diets with 0.05% and 0.37% ARA were subjected to transcriptomic assay, generating a total of 139 differently expressed unigenes, which were primarily enriched in lipid metabolism and cell cycle-related signaling pathways. Then, qRT-PCR validation on lipid metabolism and cell cycle-related genes as well as corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of selected proteins were conducted with liver samples from all six groups. Moderated ARA levels reduced  and stimulated β-oxidation concurrently, but high ARA levels seemed to affect lipid metabolism in complicated ways. Both gene expression and protein concentration of cell cycle-related proteins were decreased by moderate levels of dietary ARA. The lipid content and fatty  composition in fish confirmed the transcription and protein concentration results related to lipid metabolism.

It is well documented that production of some form of eicosanoids activates lipid synthesis during adipogenesis but also contributes to the formation of factors maintaining low-level systemic inflammation. Developing nutrients for reduction of adipogenesis and inflammation can enhance preventive efficacy of daily diet. This study examined the effects of free fatty  influence on changes in lipid biosynthesis and corresponding gene expression during differentiation of human subcutaneous adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells. Proadipogenic conditions promoted SVF cell differentiation and lipid droplet (LD) formation up to 15 days. This correlated with gene expression of adipocyte differentiation markers as well as inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. Addition of free fatty acids to differentiation medium increased their incorporation during the first period of differentiation (48 h). Presence of eicosanoid  (EPA) during the initial period of differentiation by elevation of Perilipin 3 protein (TIP47), may be responsible for smaller LD formation. Presence of  (AA) tends to deposit lipids in large form of LDs. Prolongation of differentiation up to 15 days decreased AA or EPA in cellular lipids. PUFA through up-regulation of both phospholipase 2 and enzymes related to eicosanoid production influenced type and quantity of eicosanoids which regulated the extent of SVF cell differentiation. Formation of small LDs and reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in adipose tissue are the consequence of eicosanoid production with anti-inflammatory potential from EPA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This enzyme has an important role in the regulation of hepatic  and lipid oxidation, and alterations in these pathways may lead to several diseases. We examined, in HepG2 cell cultures, the mechanism of SCD1 regulation considering the involvement of two transcription factors: liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), also investigating the effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on this process. The analysis of SCD1 promoter allowed to identify a functional SREBP-1 binding site (SRE 1). LXRα activation increased SCD1 protein level through upregulation of SREBP-1 and its consequent binding to SRE 1 sequence. Polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5) and  (AA, C20:4) were able to reduce SREBP-1 binding to SCD1 promoter, while saturated stearic  (SA, C18:0) did not give any effect. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed a direct binding of DHA, EPA and AA to LXRα. These data indicate a direct inhibitory interaction of PUFAs with LXRα, a consequent reduction of SREBP-1 and of its binding to SCD1 promoter.

Heavy-labeled precursor and subtraction lipidomic experiments in mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells, a model cell line for the study of fatty  amide metabolism, establish the biosynthetic pathways for the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. We provide evidence that the N-acylglycines are formed by a long-chain specific glycine-conjugating enzyme, glycine N-acyltransferase-like 3 (GLYATL3). siRNA knockdown of GLYATL3 in the N18TG2 cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. This is the first report of an enzyme responsible for long-chain N-acylglycine production in cellula. The production of the PFAMs in N18TG2 cells was reported to occur by the oxidative cleavage of the N-acylglycines, as catalyzed by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). siRNA knockdown of PAM resulted in an accumulation of [(13)C18]N-oleoylglycine and decreased levels of [(13)C18]oleamide when the N18TG2 cells were grown in the presence of [(13)C18]oleic .

For this purpose, a rat model for IDDM was established by streptozotocin application. The rats were randomly divided into four groups of 8 animals each: CON 6 (control group sacrificed after 6 months of the experiment), CON 12 (control group sacrificed after 12 months of the experiment), DM 6 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 6 months of diabetes) and DM 12 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 12 months of diabetes). The periods of 6 and 12 months were taken to observe the changes in lipid metabolism for chronic, long-term diabetes. Fatty  profiles of the liver and skeletal muscle total lipids and phospholipids as well as desaturation indices for ∆6 desaturase (D6D), ∆5 desaturase (∆6D), ∆9 desaturase (∆9D) and de novo  index (DNL) were estimated. Additionally the long-term effects (12 months) were tested in the brain, perirenal fat and bone marrow. The fatty  composition of lipids was altered in IDDM rats in all tested tissues. The desaturation indices revealed the expected significant decrease in ∆9D and ∆5D indices in tested tissues, while indices for ∆6D were not influenced by diabetes. DNL revealed the strong inhibition of de novo  in the liver tissue. Values for  C20:4n6 () significantly decreased in liver total lipids in DM 6 and DM 12 groups and in phospholipids in the DM 12 group. Surprisingly, values for C20:4n6 were also significantly lower in the brain tissue in the DM 12 group. Accumulation of C20:4n6 precursors (C18:2n6 and C20:3n6) was visible in all tissues. Docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n3) significantly decreased in liver total lipids, liver phospholipids and in the brain phospholipids of the DM 12 group. The present results show that age could exacerbate the expected decrease in the liver synthesis of C20:4n6 in IDDM. Moreover, long-term diabetes could impair C22:6n3 synthesis in the liver and muscle, and incorporation of both important fatty acids into brain phospholipids. In conclusion, numerous changes in fatty  composition are caused by long-term diabetes in aged rats. These changes could be involved in the pathogenesis of senile and diabetes-induced damage. The results could have clinical significance due to the increasing age of diabetic patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo  proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA)  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

Three experimental diets differing basically in DHA:EPA ratio, that is, 0·68 (diet D:E-0·68), 1·09 (D:E-1·09) and 2·05 (D:E-2·05), were randomly assigned to nine tanks of 3-year-old tongue sole (ten females and fifteen males in each tank). The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0·68, diet D:E-1·09 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2·05 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males. In ovaries, diet D:E-1·09 induced highest mRNA expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). In testes, diet 2·05 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3β-HSD. Fatty  profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in liver. In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA: ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles. Females seemed to require more EPA but less DHA for the gonadal steroidogenesis than males. The results are beneficial to sex-specific nutritive strategies in domestic teleost.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986657> impairs hypothalamic leptin signaling and hepatic energy homeostasis in mice.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the consumption of a diet high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is associated with the development of leptin resistance and obesity. We aim to examine the central effect of n-6 PUFA,  (ARA) on leptin sensitivity and leptin-regulated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of ARA (25 nmol/day) for 2.5 days reversed the effect of central leptin on hypothalamic JAK2, pSTAT3, pAkt, and pFOXO1 protein levels, which was concomitant with a pro-inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. ARA also attenuated the effect of central leptin on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by reversing the mRNA expression of the genes involved in  (G6Pase, PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2), lipogenesis (FAS, SCD1), and cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase). These results indicate that an increased exposure to central n-6 PUFA induces central cellular leptin resistance with concomitant defective JAK2-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A number of animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are established but they significantly differ in the molecular and biochemical changes depending on the genetic modification and diet used. Mice deficient for melanocortin type 4 receptor (Mc4rmut) develop hyperphagia, obesity, and subsequently NAFLD already under regular chow and resemble more closely the energy supply-driven obesity found in humans. This animal model was used to assess the molecular and biochemical consequences of hyperphagia-induced obesity on hepatic lipid metabolism. We analyzed transcriptome changes in Mc4rmut mice by RNA sequencing and used high resolution 1H magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to assess changes in the lipid composition. On the transcriptomic level we found significant changes in components of the triacylglycerol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and lipid transport and storage compared to the wild-type. These findings were supported by increases in triacylglycerol, monounsaturated fatty , and  levels. The transcriptome signatures significantly differ from those of other NAFLD mouse models supporting the concept of hepatic subphenotypes depending on the genetic background and diet. Comparative analyses of our data with previous studies allowed for the identification of common changes and genotype-specific components and pathways involved in obesity-associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27659731>Parabens inhibit fatty  amide hydrolase: A potential role in paraben-enhanced 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Parabens are a class of small molecules that are regularly used as preservatives in a variety of personal care products. Several parabens, including butylparaben and benzylparaben, have been found to interfere with endocrine signaling and to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. We hypothesized these biological effects could be due to interference with the endocannabinoid system and identified fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) as the direct molecular target of parabens. FAAH inhibition by parabens yields mixed-type and time-independent kinetics. Additionally, structure activity relationships indicate FAAH inhibition is selective for the paraben class of compounds and the more hydrophobic parabens have higher potency. Parabens enhanced 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation in a dose dependent fashion, different from two other FAAH inhibitors URB597 and PF622. Moreover, parabens, URB597 and PF622 all failed to enhance AEA-induced differentiation. Furthermore, rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB)-selective antagonist, did not attenuate paraben-induced adipocyte differentiation. Thus,  mediated by parabens likely occurs through modulation of endocannabinoids, but cell differentiation is independent of direct activation of CB by endocannabinoids.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a key outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiota, and has a dominant role in linking inflammation to high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of inflammation regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes. In addition, LPS-increased DNA synthesis, cell numbers and cell viability of preadipocytes were attenuated by AACOCF3, AG490, BML-275, cPLA2 siRNA, JAK2 siRNA or AMPK siRNA. Attenuation JAK2/STAT or AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression reduced LPS-mediated  of preadipocytes. Stimulation of  or AMPK activator, A-769662, increased cell numbers and cell viability and promoted differentiation of preadipocytes. Collectively, these results indicated that LPS increased preadipocytes proliferation and  via JAK/STAT and AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression. The mechanisms of LPS-stimulated cPLA2 expression may be a link between bacteria and obesity and provides the molecular basis for preventing metabolic syndrome or hyperplasic obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25389363>CYP2J2 attenuates metabolic dysfunction in diabetic mice by reducing hepatic inflammation via the PPARγ.</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and -derived cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase metabolites have diverse biological effects, including anti-inflammatory properties in the vasculature. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation in type 2 diabetes is a key component in the development of insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated whether CYP epoxygenase expression and exogenous EETs can attenuate insulin resistance in diabetic db/db mice and in cultured hepatic cells (HepG2). In vivo, CYP2J2 expression and the accompanying increase in EETs attenuated insulin resistance, as determined by plasma glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. CYP2J2 expression reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in liver, including CRP, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα, and decreased the infiltration of macrophages in liver. CYP2J2 expression also decreased activation of proinflammatory signaling cascades by decreasing NF-κB and MAPK activation in hepatocytes. Interestingly, CYP2J2 expression and exogenous EET treatment increased glucose uptake and activated the insulin-signaling cascade both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that CYP2J2 metabolites play a role in glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, CYP2J2 expression upregulated PPARγ, which has been shown to induce , which attenuates dyslipidemias observed in diabetes. All of the findings suggest that CYP2J2 expression attenuates the diabetic phenotype and insulin resistance via inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and activation of PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580553>n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the management of alcoholic liver disease: A critical review.</a></h2><p>Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased   and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

An 8-week feeding trial was performed using three isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets: ARA-free, ARA, and ARA + acetylsalicylic  [ASA, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor]. Fish were sampled after 4 and 8 weeks of feeding. Results showed that ARA-fed fish had a significantly lower intraperitoneal fat index (IPFI) and smaller adipocytes; these decreases were reversed by ASA after 8 weeks of feeding. Nevertheless, at week 4, the IPFI and adipocyte size were higher in the ARA group, and they were comparable to those of fish fed ARA + ASA. To further investigate the influence of ARA on adipocyte differentiation, confluent pre-adipocytes of grass carp were incubated with ARA for 3 days. This in vitro experiment demonstrated that ARA promoted  in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic  attenuated the pro-adipogenic function of ARA. However, after treatment with ARA for 8 days, adipocytes had a lower lipid content than cells treated with oleic , and ASA could suppress this effect. We thus revealed the dual function of ARA in  in grass carp. The LOX pathway may play a key role in pro- after short-term treatment with ARA, whereas the COX pathway is possibly responsible for the inhibition of  after long-term treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26778987>Exposure to a Highly Caloric Palatable Diet During Pregestational and Gestational Periods Affects Hypothalamic and Hippocampal Endocannabinoid Levels at Birth and Induces Adiposity and Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Male Rat Offspring.</a></h2><p>Exposure to unbalanced diets during pre-gestational and gestational periods may result in long-term alterations in metabolism and behavior. The contribution of the endocannabinoid system to these long-term adaptive responses is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the impact of female rat exposure to a hypercaloric-hypoproteic palatable diet during pre-gestational, gestational and lactational periods on the development of male offspring. In addition, the hypothalamic and hippocampal endocannabinoid contents at birth and the behavioral performance in adulthood were investigated. Exposure to a palatable diet resulted in low weight offspring who exhibited low hypothalamic contents of  and the two major endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) at birth. Palmitoylethanolamide, but not oleoylethanolamide, also decreased. Additionally, pups from palatable diet-fed dams displayed lower levels of anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide in the hippocampus. The low-weight male offspring, born from palatable diet exposed mothers, gained less weight during lactation and although they recovered weight during the post-weaning period, they developed abdominal adiposity in adulthood. These animals exhibited anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and open field test and a low preference for a chocolate diet in a food preference test, indicating that maternal exposure to a hypercaloric diet induces long-term behavioral alterations in male offspring. These results suggest that maternal diet alterations in the function of the endogenous cannabinoid system can mediate the observed phenotype of the offspring, since both hypothalamic and hippocampal endocannabinoids regulate feeding, metabolic adaptions to caloric diets, learning, memory, and emotions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012634>Early intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids preserves brain structure and function in diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Worldwide, the incidence of obesity is increasing at an alarming rate, and the number of children with obesity is especially worrisome. These developments raise concerns about the physical, psychosocial and cognitive consequences of obesity. It was shown that early dietary intake of  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) can reduce the detrimental effects of later obesogenic feeding on lipid metabolism and adipogenesis in an animal model of mild obesity. In the present study, the effects of early dietary ARA and DHA on cognition and brain structure were examined in mildly obesogenic ApoE*3Leiden mouse model. We used cognitive tests and neuroimaging during early and later life. During their early development after weaning (4-13weeks of age), mice were fed a chow diet or ARA and DHA diet for 8 weeks and then switched to a high-fat and high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet for 12weeks (14-26weeks of age). An HFHC-diet led to increased  storage in white adipose tissue, increased cholesterol levels, decreased triglycerides levels, increased cerebral blood flow and decreased functional connectivity between brain regions as well as cerebrovascular and gray matter integrity. ARA and DHA intake reduced the HFHC-diet-induced increase in body weight, attenuated plasma triglycerides levels and improved cerebrovasculature, gray matter integrity and functional connectivity in later life. In conclusion, an HFHC diet causes adverse structural brain and metabolic adaptations, most of which can be averted by dietary ARA and DHA intake early in life supporting metabolic flexibility and cerebral integrity later in life.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

DNL up-regulation is able to induce fat accumulation through an increase in fatty acids. To investigate the relationship between DNL up-regulation and the accumulation of fatty acids and lipid droplets in response to 2,2',4,4' tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47), we examined DNL in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Transcription levels of DNL-related genes were increased after exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 for 24h. After exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47, palmitic  was significantly increased (P<0.05) at days 1 and 4, along with upregulation of fatty  synthesis-related genes (e.g., desaturases and elongases). However, docosahexaenoic  and  were down-regulated at days 1 and 4, showing an antagonistic effect. Lipid droplet area significantly increased in Nile red staining analysis after 24h of exposure to 2.5μg/L BDE-47 in T. japonicus, while DNL was down-regulated in response to 500μM salicylate (a  inhibitor), indicating that BDE-47 exposure is closely associated with an increase in fatty acids in this copepod.

We have previously shown that a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid ((-)-cannabidiol [CBD]) exerted complex anti-acne effects by normalizing 'pro-acne agents'-induced excessive sebaceous lipid production, reducing proliferation and alleviating inflammation in human SZ95 sebocytes. Therefore, in this study we aimed to explore the putative anti-acne effects of further non-psychotropic phytocannabinoids ((-)-cannabichromene [CBC], (-)-cannabidivarin [CBDV], (-)-cannabigerol [CBG], (-)-cannabigerovarin [CBGV] and (-)-Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabivarin [THCV]). Viability and proliferation of human SZ95 sebocytes were investigated by MTT and CyQUANT assays; cell death and lipid synthesis were monitored by DilC1 (5)-SYTOX Green labelling and Nile Red staining, respectively. Inflammatory responses were investigated by monitoring expressions of selected cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide treatment (RT-qPCR, ELISA). Up to 10 μm, the phytocannabinoids only negligibly altered the viability of the sebocytes, whereas high doses (≥50 μm) induced apoptosis. Interestingly, basal sebaceous lipid synthesis was differentially modulated by the substances: CBC and THCV suppressed it, and CBDV had only minor effects, whereas CBG and CBGV increased it. Importantly, CBC, CBDV and THCV significantly reduced  (AA)-induced 'acne-like' . Moreover, THCV suppressed proliferation, and all phytocannabinoids exerted remarkable anti-inflammatory actions. Our data suggest that CBG and CBGV may have potential in the treatment of dry-skin syndrome, whereas CBC, CBDV and especially THCV show promise to become highly efficient, novel anti-acne agents. Moreover, based on their remarkable anti-inflammatory actions, phytocannabinoids could be efficient, yet safe novel tools in the management of cutaneous inflammations.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Diet supplemented with 0.30%  (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation,  and gluconeogenesis.

The role of  (AA) and its downstream enzymatic cascades, such as cyclooxygenase, in adipogenesis is well established. The exact contribution of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, however, remains to be established. Enzymes belonging to this pathway are mainly encoded by the CYP2J locus which shows extensive allelic expansion in mice. Here we aimed to establish the role of endogenous epoxygenase during adipogenesis under homeostatic and metabolic stress conditions.We took advantage of the simpler genetic architecture of the Cyp2j locus in the rat and used a Cyp2j4 (orthologue of human CYP2J2) knockout rat in two models of metabolic dysfunction: physiological aging and cafeteria diet (CAF). The phenotyping of Cyp2j4 rats under CAF was integrated with proteomics (LC-MS/MS) and lipidomics (LC-MS) analyses in the liver and the adipose tissue.We report that Cyp2j4 deletion causes adipocyte dysfunction under metabolic challenges. This is characterized by (i) down-regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) PPARγ and C/EBPα, (ii) adipocyte hypertrophy, (iii) extracellular matrix remodeling, and (iv) alternative usage of AA pathway. Specifically, in Cyp2j4 rats treated with a cafeteria diet, the dysfunctional adipogenesis is accompanied by exacerbated weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dysregulated .These results suggest that AA epoxygenases are essential regulators of healthy adipogenesis.

Unlike common 'obese/metabolic' NAFLD, these subjects lack hypertriglyceridemia and have lower risk of cardiovascular disease. In animals, phosphatidylcholine (PC) deficiency results in a similar phenotype. PCs surround the core of VLDL consisting of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesteryl-esters (CEs). We determined the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K on these lipids in the human liver and serum and on hepatic gene expression and studied the effect of TM6SF2 knockdown on hepatocyte handling of these lipids.Liver biopsies were taken from subjects characterized with respect to the TM6SF2 genotype, serum and liver lipidome, gene expression and histology. In vitro, after TM6SF2 knockdown in HuH-7 cells, we compared incorporation of different fatty acids into TGs, CEs, and PCs.The TM6SF2 and TM6SF2 groups had similar age, gender, BMI and HOMA-IR. Liver TGs and CEs were higher and liver PCs lower in the TM6SF2 than the TM6SF2 group (p<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were deficient in liver and serum TGs and liver PCs but hepatic free fatty acids were relatively enriched in PUFA (p<0.05). Incorporation of PUFA into TGs and PCs in TM6SF2 knockdown hepatocytes was decreased (p<0.05). Hepatic expression of TM6SF2 was decreased in variant carriers, and was co-expressed with genes regulated by PUFAs.Hepatic lipid synthesis from PUFAs is impaired and could contribute to deficiency in PCs and increased intrahepatic TG in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers.Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

It is specifically found in seeds from gymnosperms such as pine nuts. Published papers describe a decrease in liver and plasma triacylglycerols in rats fed with this nutriment. The present study seeks to identify the action mechanism of Scia on triacylglycerol synthesis. In this way, its nutritional effect on FA metabolism involving the Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) is investigated.Scia is discerned in trace amount in various tissues of rats and in human serum. It is produced by Δ5-desaturation of 20:2n-6 in human transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines and also in rat hepatocytes. When Scia is incubated with cultured hepatocytes as a nutrient, the cellular FA profile is modified. In particular, the proportion of the monoenes (18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 16:1n-7) are all decreased, correlating to the reduction of triacylglycerol amounts. This effect is mediated by the inhibition of SCD1 expression. Furthermore, Scia, as well as 20:3n-6 and 20:3n-9 but not 20:3n-3, strongly inhibit the SCD1 activity measured on liver microsomes.Overall, this study shows that Scia, despite its unusual structure, contributes to the FA metabolism and reduced triacylglycerol release by inhibiting SCD1 activity.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Using hMADS cells as a human cell model which undergoes a white to a brite adipocyte conversion, we had shown previously that , the major metabolite of the essential nutrient Ω6-linoleic , plays a major role in this process. Its metabolites PGE2 and PGF2 alpha inhibit this process via a calcium-dependent pathway, whereas in contrast carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), a stable analog of prostacyclin, activates white to brite adipocyte conversion. Herein, we show that cPGI2 generates via its cognate cell-surface receptor IP-R, a cyclic AMP-signaling pathway involving PKA activity which in turn induces the expression of UCP1. In addition, cPGI2 activates the pathway of nuclear receptors of the PPAR family, i.e. PPARα and PPARγ, which act separately from IP-R to up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in the function of brite adipocytes. Thus dual pathways are playing in concert for the occurrence of a browning process of human white adipocytes. These results make prostacyclin analogs as a new class of interesting molecules to treat obesity and associated diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, little knowledge exists linking acetaminophen to liver free fatty acids and the eicosanoid-mediated signaling pathway. To this end, adult NMRI mice injected with a dose of 400 mg/kg acetaminophen were monitored for one week post-treatment. Consistent changes were observed in serum transaminases, profile of hepatic free fatty acids, expression of cyclooxygenase, elongase, lipogenesis, and lipolysis genes; as well as in expression patterns of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 in the liver. Both linoleic  and --substrates in eicosanoid biosynthesis--were significantly influenced by overdose, and the latter peaked first among the free fatty acids examined here. There was a close similarity between the temporal dynamics of linoleic  and aspartate aminotransferases. Moreover, serum transaminases were reduced by cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, but not by cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors. Our results hence attest to the hazard of acetaminophen overdose on the temporal homeostasis of hepatic concentrations of free fatty acids and expression of key genes underlying liver lipid metabolism. There is also evidence for activation of a cyclooxygenase-mediated signaling pathway, especially the cyclooxygenase 2-prostanoid pathway, during acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Therefore, the results of the present study should provide valuable information to a wide audience, working to understand the health hazard of this drug and the implications of the eicosanoid signaling pathway in liver pathophysiology.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we investigated the effect of the pretreatment of cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with exogenous AA during the differentiation phase without 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a cAMP-elevating agent, on the storage of fats after the maturation phase. This pretreatment with AA stimulated appreciably adipogenesis after the maturation phase as evident with the up-regulated gene expression of adipogenic markers. The stimulatory effect of the pretreatment with AA was attenuated by the co-incubation with each of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. Among exogenous prostanoids and related compounds, the pretreatment with MRE-269, a selective agonist of the IP receptor for prostaglandin (PG) I2, strikingly stimulated the storage of fats in adipocytes. The gene expression analysis of arachidonate COX pathway revealed that the transcript levels of inducible COX-2, membrane-bound PGE synthase-1, and PGF synthase declined more greatly in cultured preadipocytes treated with AA. By contrast, the expression levels of COX-1, cytosolic PGE synthase, and PGI synthase remained constitutive. The treatment of cultured preadipocytes with AA resulted in the decreased synthesis of PGE2 and PGF2α serving as anti-adipogenic PGs although the biosynthesis of pro-adipogenic PGI2 was up-regulated during the differentiation phase. Moreover, the gene expression levels of EP4 and FP, the respective prostanoid receptors for PGE2 and PGF2α, were gradually suppressed by the supplementation with AA, whereas that of IP for PGI2 remained relatively constant. Collectively, these results suggest the predominant role of endogenous PGI2 in the stimulatory effect of the pretreatment of cultured preadipoccytes with AA during the differentiation phase without IBMX on adipogenesis after the maturation phase.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to gain insights into molecular basis of the antitumorigenic action of ACR from a metabolic point of view. To achieve this, comprehensive cationic and lipophilic liver metabolic profiling was performed in mouse diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatic tumorigenesis model using both capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. ACR significantly counteracted against acceleration of lipogenesis but not glucose metabolism in DEN-treated mice liver, suggesting an important role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in the initiation step of hepatic tumorigenesis. Knowledge-based pathway analysis suggested that inhibition of linoleic  metabolites such as , a proinflammatory precursor, played a crucial role in the prevention by ACR of DEN-induced chronic inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis of the liver. As a molecular mechanism of the ACR's effect to prevent the aberrant lipogenesis, microarray analysis identified that a key transcription regulator of both embryogenesis and tumorigenesis, COUP transcription factor 2, also known as NR2F2, was associated with the metabolic effect of ACR in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our study provided potential therapeutic targets for the chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma as well as new insights into the mechanisms underlying prevention of hepatic tumorigenesis.©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29471285>Effects of docosahexanoic  supplementation on inflammatory and subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression in HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

Whether docosahexanoic  (DHA) supplementation can modify systemic inflammatory and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression in HIV-infected patients is unknown.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 84 antiretroviral-treated patients who had fasting TG levels from 2.26 to 5.65 mmol/l and received DHA or placebo for 48 weeks was performed (ClinicalTrials.gov, ). Systemic inflammatory and SAT gene expression was assessed at baseline and at week 48 in 39 patients.Patients receiving DHA had a 43.9% median decline in fasting TG levels at week 4 (IQR: -31% to -56%), compared with -2.9% (-18.6% to 16.5%) in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). High sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) and  levels significantly decreased in the DHA group. Adipogenesis-related and mitochondrial-related gene expression did not experience significant changes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) significantly decreased in the placebo group. SAT inflammation-related gene expression (Tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) significantly decreased in the DHA group.DHA supplementation down-regulated inflammatory gene expression in SAT.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty acids on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic , , or palmitic , at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003).  treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic  treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty acids treatments at 25 (P = 0.2), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of  on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic  on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p></html>
