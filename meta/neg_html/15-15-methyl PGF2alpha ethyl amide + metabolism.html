To understand how activation of both kinases affects CFTR activity, transfected NIH/3T3 cells were stimulated with forskolin (FSK), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF). PGF stimulates inositol trisphosphate and cAMP production in NIH/3T3 cells. As measured by I- efflux, maximal CFTR activity with PGF and FSK was equivalent and fivefold greater than that with PMA. Both PGF and PMA had additive effects on FSK-dependent CFTR activity. PMA did not increase cellular cAMP, and maximal PGF-dependent CFTR activity occurred with approximately 20% of the cellular cAMP observed with FSK-dependent activation. Staurosporine, but not H-89, inhibited CFTR activation and in vivo phosphorylation at low PGF concentrations. In contrast, at high PGF concentrations, CFTR activation and in vivo phosphorylation were inhibited by H-89. As judged by protease digestion, the sites of in vivo CFTR phosphorylation with FSK and PMA differed. For PGF, the data were most consistent with in vivo CFTR phosphorylation by PKA and PKC. Our data suggest that activation of PKC can enhance PKA-dependent CFTR activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18851973>cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling negatively regulates Gq-coupled receptor-mediated fetal gene response in cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>The treatment with beta-blockers causes an enhancement of the norepinephrine-induced fetal gene response in cultured cardiomyocytes. Here, we tested whether the activation of cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated fetal gene response. To address this question, the fetal gene program, of which atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the beta-isoform of myosin heavy chain are classical members, was induced by phenylephrine (PE), an alpha(1)-AR agonist. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we found that stimulation of beta-ARs with isoproterenol, a beta-AR agonist, inhibited the fetal gene expression induced by PE. Similar results were also observed when cardiomyocytes were treated with forskolin (FSK), a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, or 8-CPT-6-Phe-cAMP, a selective activator of protein kinase A (PKA). Conversely, the PE-induced fetal gene expression was further upregulated by H89, a selective PKA inhibitor. To evaluate whether these results could be generalized to Gq-mediated signaling and not specifically to alpha(1)-ARs, cardiomyocytes were treated with prostaglandin F(2)alpha, another Gq-coupled receptor agonist, which is able to promote fetal gene expression. This treatment caused an increase of both ANP mRNA and protein levels, which was almost completely abolished by FSK treatment. The capability of beta-adrenergic signaling to regulate the fetal gene expression was also evaluated in vivo conditions by using beta1- and beta2-AR double knockout mice, in which the predominant cardiac beta-AR subtypes are lacking, or by administering isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-AR agonist, at a subpressor dose. A significant increase of the fetal gene expression was found in beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR gene deficient mice. Conversely, we found that ANP, beta-MHC and skACT mRNA levels were significantly decreased in ISO-treated hearts. Collectively, these data indicate that cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling negatively regulates Gq cascade activation-induced fetal gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes and that this inhibitory regulation is already operative in the mouse heart under physiological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12804054>The hydrolysis of the prostaglandin analog prodrug bimatoprost to 17-phenyl-trinor  by human and rabbit ocular tissue.</a></h2><p>Bimatoprost (Lumigan), the   derivative of the potent prostaglandin FP agonist 17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha), has been reported to be a member of a pharmacologically unique class of ocular hypotensive agents. To confirm that bimatoprost, which is intrinsically active as an FP prostaglandin agonist, is also a prostaglandin analog prodrug, the hydrolysis of bimatoprost by ocular tissues was studied by incubating solutions containing bimatoprost with either human or rabbit ocular tissue. The   group of bimatoprost was hydrolyzed by rabbit and human cornea, iris/ciliary body and Thasclera to produce the expected carboxylic acid product, 17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha). The rate of hydrolysis by human and rabbit cornea and iris/ciliary body is similar, whereas the rate of hydrolysis by the sclera is slower in humans than in rabbits. These studies show that human and rabbit ocular tissue (cornea, iris/ciliary body and sclera) can convert bimatoprost to the potent prostaglandin FP agonist 17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha). Separate in vitro studies clearly show that both bimatoprost and 17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha) have affinity for and are agonists at the human FP receptor. Taken together, the data strongly suggests that the ocular hypotensive effect of bimatoprost can be attributed to its activity as a prostaglandin receptor agonist either directly or through its role as a prostaglandin agonist prodrug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389977>Thromboxane A(2) receptor mediated activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase cascades in human uterine smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Both thromboxane (TX) A(2) and 8-epi prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) have been reported to stimulate mitogenesis of vascular smooth muscle (SM) in a number of species. However, TXA(2) and 8-epiPGF(2alpha) mediated mitogenic signalling has not been studied in detail in human vascular SM. Thus, using the human uterine ULTR cell line as a model, we investigated TXA(2) receptor (TP) mediated mitogenic signalling in cultured human vascular SMCs. Both the TP agonist U46619 and 8-epiPGF(2alpha) elicited time and concentration dependent activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)s and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)s in ULTR cells. Whereas the TP antagonist SQ29548 abolished U46619 mediated signalling, it only partially inhibited 8-epiPGF(2alpha) mediated ERK and JNK activation in ULTR cells. Both U46619 and 8-epiPGF(2alpha) induced ERK activations were inhibited by the protein kinase (PK) C, PKA and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors GF109203X, H-89 and wortmannin, respectively, but were unaffected by pertussis toxin. In addition, U46619 mediated ERK activation in ULTR cells involves transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In humans, TXA(2) signals through two distinct TP isoforms. In investigating the involvement of the TP isoforms in mitogenic signalling, both TPalpha and TPbeta independently directed U46619 and 8-epiPGF(2alpha) mediated ERK and JNK activation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells over-expressing the individual TP isoforms. However, in contrast to that which occurred in ULTR cells, SQ29548 abolished 8-epiPGF(2alpha) mediated ERK and JNK activation through both TPalpha and TPbeta in HEK 293 cells providing further evidence that 8-epiPGF(2alpha) may signal through alternative receptors, in addition to the TPs, in human uterine ULTR cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16394175>Effect of epidermal growth factor and prostaglandin on the expression of aromatase (CYP19) in human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI-H295R cells.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and prostaglandins (PG) on the expression of aromatase (CYP19) in human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI-H295R cells. EGF significantly increased aromatase activity and CYP19 gene transcript in NCI-H295R cells. Exon PII was selected from among several tissue-specific exon I regions. Promoter II that abuts on exon PII was activated by EGF. PGE(2) also significantly increased aromatase activity, CYP19 gene transcript, and promoter II activity. The results of experiments using protein kinase (PK) inhibitors suggest that the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is involved in the up-regulation of aromatase expression by EGF. PGE(2) activated promoter II activity in 4 h, while 12 h was required for its activation by EGF. In addition, PGE(2) was secreted from NCI-H295R cells in response to EGF. Selective agonists for prostaglandin receptors EP(1) and EP(2) significantly increased aromatase activity, which was decreased by the corresponding antagonists. Finally, antagonists for EP(1) and EP(2) inhibited the up-regulation of aromatase expression following EGF. These results suggest that PGE(2) secondarily acts as an autocrine signal in the up-regulation of aromatase expression by EGF in NCI-H295R cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/888954>Renal tubular transport of prostaglandins: inhibition by probenecid and indomethacin.</a></h2><p>With use of the Sperber technique in chickens, labeled prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha were infused and resulted in renal tubular excretion of the label into the urine. A labeled metabolite, 12,14-dihydro,15-keto-, was infused exogenously and this label was also excreted by active tubular transport. Tubular excretion of the label from PGE2, , and 13,14-dihydro,15-keto- was inhibited by probenecid, indomethacin, and PAH. The PAH was 10 times weaker as an inhibitor than probenecid and indomethacin. These results indicate that the prostaglandins are actively transported across the renal tubule by the classic anionic transport system which transports PAH. Since the transport of the prostaglandins is blocked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as indomethacin, the anti-inflammatory action of indomethacin may be produced not only by the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis but also by restriction of the distribution of endogenous prostaglnadins. Thin-layer chromatography of an  acetate extract of urine collected during infusion of [3H] revealed three discrete radioactive peaks, one of which corresponded to authentic . This signified tubular excretion of . One metabolite in the  acetate extract was found to be of renal origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12490597>Real-time intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by travoprost acid, bimatoprost, unoprostone, and other analogs via endogenous mouse, rat, and cloned human FP prostaglandin receptors.</a></h2><p>The ability of a number of prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) analogs to mobilize intracellular Ca2+[Ca2+]iand to compete for [3H]PGF 2 alpha binding to prostaglandin F 2 alpha receptors (FP) was evaluated. Radioligand binding studies measuring displacement of [3H]PGF 2 alpha by a variety of FP prostaglandin analogs yielded the following rank order of affinities: travoprost acid [(+)-16-m-trifluorophenoxy tetranor PGF 2 alpha; (+)-fluprostenol] > bimatoprost acid (17-phenyl-trinor PGF 2 alpha) >> unoprostone (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-20- PGF 2 alpha) = bimatoprost (17-phenyl-trinor PGF 2 alpha  ) > or = Lumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution). In FP functional studies, travoprost acid (EC50= 17.5-37 nM, n = 13), bimatoprost acid (EC50= 23.3-49.0 nM, n = 6-12), unoprostone (EC50= 306-1270 nM, n = 4-8), bimatoprost (EC50= 3070- 3940 nM, n = 4-9), and Lumigan (EC50= 1470-3190 nM, n = 5-9) concentration dependently stimulated [Ca2+]imobilization via the rat (A7r5 cells), mouse (3T3 cells), and cloned human ocular FP prostanoid receptors. The rank order of potency of these compounds at the FP receptor of the three species was similar and in good agreement with the determined binding affinities. The agonist effects of these compounds were concentration dependently blocked by the FP receptor-selective antagonist, AL-8810 (11beta-fluoro-15-epi-15-indanyl-tetranor PGF 2 alpha) (Ki= 0.6-1.3 microM). These studies have demonstrated that bimatoprost, unoprostone, and bimatoprost acid possess direct agonist activities at the rat, mouse, and human FP prostanoid receptor and that travoprost acid is the most potent of the synthetic FP prostaglandin analogs tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10998108>Prostaglandin E2-induced sensitization of bradykinin-evoked responses in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons is mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.</a></h2><p>Primary cultures of neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were used to examine the mechanisms underlying both the direct activation and the sensitization of sensory neurons by prostanoids. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) elevated cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a subpopulation of small (< 19 microm) diameter, capsaicin-sensitive DRG neurons. PGE2 also stimulated substance P (SP) release from DRG cultures. In contrast to bradykinin, PGE2 did not stimulate phosphoinositidase C (PIC) and the PGE2-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i was dependent on extracellular calcium. Pre-treatment with PGE2 potentiated bradykinin-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i in small diameter neurons and increased the number of cells that responded to low concentrations of bradykinin. A similar effect was seen with prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) but not prostaglandin F2alpha (). PGE2 pretreatment also potentiated bradykinin-evoked release of SP, inducing a leftward shift in the bradykinin concentration-response curve and an increase in the maximum response. PGE2 stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in DRG cultures, at concentrations and times consistent with those required to observe both the direct and sensitizing effects of the prostanoid on [Ca2+]i responses. Furthermore, the direct and sensitizing effects of PGE2, on both [Ca2+]i responses and SP release, were mimicked by the membrane permeant cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP and inhibited by H89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that both direct activation and sensitization of sensory neurons by prostanoids, such as PGE2, are mediated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11740958>Bimatoprost and its free acid are prostaglandin FP receptor agonists.</a></h2><p>Bimatoprost (17-phenyl-prostaglandin F(2alpha)  ) has been reported not to exert its actions via prostaglandin receptors. Here, bimatoprost displaced [3H]prostaglandin F(2alpha) from FP receptors (K(i)=6310+/-1650 nM). Bimatoprost rapidly mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) via cloned human FP receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (EC(50)=2940+/-1663 nM) and via native FP receptors in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (EC(50)=2200+/-670 nM).

The objective of the present study was to clarify the intracellular signaling pathway of TNFalpha to stimulate  production in cultured bovine luteal cells. Bovine luteal cells that were obtained from mid- (days 8-12 after ovulation) CL were incubated with TNFalpha (0.6 nM) and/or various compounds as follows: U-73122 (an inhibitor of phospholipase [PL] C), ACA (an inhibitor of PL-A2), H-89 (an inhibitor of protein kinase [PK] A), calphostin C (an inhibitor of PK-C), L-NAME/L-NORG (inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase), and PD98059 (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] kinase). Although U-73122 (0. 1-10 microM), H-89 (0.1-10 microM), calphostin C (0.01-1 microM) and L-NAME/L-NORG (1-100 microM) did not affect TNFalpha-induced  secretion by the cultured cells, ACA (1-100 microM) and PD98059 (0.1-100 microM) inhibited TNFalpha-stimulated  secretion by the cells in a dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.05 or lower). These findings suggest that TNFalpha activates the MAPK and PL-A2  in bovine luteal cells to stimulate  secretion.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8554613>Agents that elevate cAMP inhibit human neutrophil apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil apoptosis, determined after 20 h in culture using standard criteria and shedding of cell surface CD16 (Fc gamma RIII), is dramatically inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, by the cAMP analogs, dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP, and the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin. Furthermore, the stable receptor-directed PGD2 mimetic, ZK 118.182, and the PGE2 mimetic, 11-deoxy PGE1, similarly inhibited apoptosis. The DP-receptor antagonist BW A868C blocked the effect of ZK 118.182 and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 reversed the inhibition of apoptosis induced by dibutyryl-cAMP. These results clearly show that neutrophil apoptosis is markedly attenuated by cAMP elevating agents. This nucleotide second messenger may play a fundamental role in controlling neutrophil longevity and pharmacological regulation of cAMP levels or actions may influence neutrophil apoptosis in vivo.</p></html>
