Glucans from Phytophthora infestans, inactive themselves as elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction, enhanced sesquiterpene accumulation and hypersensitive  elicited by AA. Significant activity (seven times control values) was observed with 33 pmol AA/3.0-cm potato disc in the presence of glucans. Glucans did not affect accumulation of steroid glycoalkaloids, influence the timing or relative amounts of sesquiterpenes which accumulate, or affect recovery of AA added to potato discs. Glucans enhanced activity whether added to potato discs 18 h prior to AA, at the same time as AA, or 18 h after AA. Elicitor activity in the presence of glucans was evident with 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acids that had little or no elicitor activity in the absence of glucans. The position of double bonds had considerable influence on the specific activity of unsaturated fatty acids. The most active had a minimum of three double bonds in a methylene-interrupted series beginning with delta 5, e.g., delta 5,8,11. A delta 5 double bond conferred significant activity even if it was not part of a methylene-interrupted series. The 20-carbon chain length appeared optimal for elicitor activity. The 22-carbon chain acids had low activity, and 16- and 18-carbon acids were inactive. A free carboxyl group or easily transesterified group appeared necessary for activity. Arachidonyl alcohol had very low activity and arachidonyl cyanide was inactive. AA-containing phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine and monoacylglycerol were at least as active as free AA, AA-containing diacylglycerols were slightly less active than free AA, and triarachidonyl glycerol was inactive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2137129>Role of lipocortin I in the glucocorticoid induction of the terminal differentiation of a human squamous carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The human squamous cell carcinoma SqCC/Y1 undergoes spontaneous terminal differentiation in the confluent state. The degree of maturation was markedly increased by glucocorticoids and by both human recombinant and placental lipocortin I. Western analyses demonstrated cellular secretion of lipocortin into the medium. Glucocorticoid-induced maturation was antagonized by a lipocortin I-specific monoclonal antibody, by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and by . Induction of the differentiation of SqCC/Y1 cells by lipocortin I was prevented by . The PLA2 inhibitor, dibromoacetophenone, caused an increase in envelope-competent cells indicating that inhibition of PLA2 results in induction of differentiation. Epidermal growth factor prevented the induction of differentiation by both lipocortin I and by glucocorticoids. The nonsteroidal lipoxygenase/cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, phenidone, also increased SqCC/Y1 differentiation, suggesting that leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and/or prostaglandins may be involved in lipocortin-mediated regulation of SqCC/Y1 maturation. The findings support a role for lipocortin I in mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on epidermal cell differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711599> sex-dependently affects obesity through linking gut microbiota-driven inflammation to hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis.</a></h2><p>Unraveling the role of dietary lipids is beneficial to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6 fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating microbiota-driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators,  process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut microbiota composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory microbiota and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin resistance via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces insulin resistance. Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing microbiota, up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte  and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Our findings formulate recommendations of n-6 fatty acids like AA from dietary intake for obese subjects preferably in a sexually dimorphic way.Copyright © 2017.

Potato 5-lipoxygenase and lipolytic acyl hydrolase play a key role in hypersensitive response (HR) induction. As expected, , its hydrolysable esters, and eicosapentaenoic  elicited much higher HR than the other PUFA tested, although the latter were equally affected by potato 5-lipoxygenase. Hydroxyl radicals appear to be actively involved in the  process.

Here, -inducing effects of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g.,  (ARA)/docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and extensively hydrolyzed casein (eHC) were investigated in uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp-1) reporter mice. To address the overall functionality, their potential role in supporting a healthy metabolic profile under obesogenic dietary challenges later in life was evaluated. At weaning Ucp1+/LUC reporter mice were fed a control low fat diet (LFD) with or without ARA + DHA, eHC or eHC + ARA + DHA for 8 weeks until week 12 after which interventions continued for another 12 weeks under a high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Serology (metabolic responses and inflammation) and in vivo and ex vivo luciferase activity were determined; in the meantime -related proteins UCP-1 and the genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and Ucp-1 were examined. ARA + DHA, eHC or their combination reduced body weight gain and adipose tissue weight compared to the HFD mice. The interventions induced Ucp-1 expression in adipose tissues prior to and during the HFD exposure. Ucp-1 induction was accompanied by higher PGC1a and PRDM16 expression. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were improved coinciding with lower serum cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, leptin, resistin, fibroblast growth factor 21, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and higher adiponectin than the HFD group. HFD-associated increased systemic (IL-1β and TNF-α) and adipose tissue inflammation (F4/80, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) was reduced. Studies in a Ucp-1 reporter mouse model revealed that early intervention with ARA/DHA and eHC improves metabolic flexibility and attenuates obesity during HFD challenge later in life. Increased  is suggested as, at least, part of the underlying mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25506549>The ω6-fatty , , regulates the conversion of white to brite adipocyte through a prostaglandin/calcium mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Brite adipocytes are inducible energy-dissipating cells expressing UCP1 which appear within white adipose tissue of healthy adult individuals. Recruitment of these cells represents a potential strategy to fight obesity and associated diseases.Using human Multipotent Adipose-Derived Stem cells, able to convert into brite adipocytes, we show that  strongly inhibits brite adipocyte formation via a cyclooxygenase pathway leading to secretion of PGE2 and PGF2α. Both prostaglandins induce an oscillatory Ca(++) signaling coupled to ERK pathway and trigger a decrease in UCP1 expression and in oxygen consumption without altering mitochondriogenesis. In mice fed a standard diet supplemented with ω6 , PGF2α and PGE2 amounts are increased in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and associated with a decrease in the recruitment of brite adipocytes.Our results suggest that dietary excess of ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids present in Western diets, may also favor obesity by preventing the "" process to take place.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26247960>The Pattern of Fatty Acids Displaced by EPA and DHA Following 12 Months Supplementation Varies between Blood Cell and Plasma Fractions.</a></h2><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are increased in plasma lipids and blood cell membranes in response to supplementation. Whilst  (AA) is correspondingly decreased, the effect on other fatty acids (FA) is less well described and there may be site-specific differences. In response to 12 months EPA + DHA supplementation in doses equivalent to 0-4 portions of oily fish/week (1 portion: 3.27 g EPA+DHA) multinomial regression analysis was used to identify important FA changes for plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride (TAG) and for blood mononuclear cells (MNC), red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (PLAT). Dose-dependent increases in EPA + DHA were matched by decreases in several n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in PC, CE, RBC and PLAT, but were predominantly compensated for by oleic  in TAG. Changes were observed for all FA classes in MNC. Consequently the n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in all pools after 12 months (37%-64% of placebo in the four portions group). We conclude that the profile of the FA decreased in exchange for the increase in EPA + DHA following supplementation differs by FA pool with implications for understanding the impact of n-3 PUFA on blood lipid and blood cell biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2955229>Recombinant human lipocortin 1 inhibits thromboxane release from guinea-pig isolated perfused lung.</a></h2><p>The guinea-pig perfused isolated lung, used in conjunction with the cascade superfusion system to measure the release of thromboxane A2(TXA2), is a simple and convenient model for assessing the inhibition by glucocorticoids of eicosanoid formation. Dexamethasone inhibits the release of TXA2 from the lung when it is stimulated by agents such as RCS-RF2 of leukotrienes, but not when bradykinin or  are used. Using this model we have shown that the glucocorticoids suppress eicosanoid generation by cells through the induction of a family of phospholipase A2-inhibitory proteins now termed the 'lipocortins'. Recently the primary structure of one form of lipocortin has been elucidated and the human gene cloned. Lipocortin 1 is a polar monomeric protein with anti-phospholipase properties in vitro and we now report that when infused into guinea-pig lung preparations this protein has the same inhibitory profile as the glucocorticoids but with a more rapid onset of action. This is the first demonstration that eicosanoid formation can be inhibited by a recombinant phospholipase inhibitory protein applied extracellularly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10801874>Pyridoxamine, an inhibitor of advanced glycation reactions, also inhibits advanced lipoxidation reactions. Mechanism of action of pyridoxamine.</a></h2><p>Maillard or  reactions lead to formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on protein and contribute to the increase in chemical modification of proteins during aging and in diabetes. AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine (PM) have proven effective in animal model and clinical studies as inhibitors of AGE formation and development of diabetic complications. We report here that PM also inhibits the chemical modification of proteins during lipid peroxidation (lipoxidation) reactions in vitro, and we show that it traps reactive intermediates formed during lipid peroxidation. In reactions of arachidonate with the model protein RNase, PM prevented modification of lysine residues and formation of the advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(epsilon)-(carboxyethyl)lysine, malondialdehyde-lysine, and 4-hydroxynonenal-lysine. PM also inhibited lysine modification and formation of ALEs during copper-catalyzed oxidation of low density lipoprotein. Hexanoic  amide and nonanedioic  monoamide derivatives of PM were identified as major products formed during oxidation of linoleic  in the presence of PM. We propose a mechanism for formation of these products from the 9- and 13-oxo-decadienoic  intermediates formed during peroxidation of linoleic . PM, as a potent inhibitor of both AGE and ALE formation, may prove useful for limiting the increased chemical modification of tissue proteins and associated pathology in aging and chronic diseases, including both diabetes and atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28587463>Lipidomics Profiling of Human Adipose Tissue Identifies a Pattern of Lipids Associated with Fish Oil Supplementation.</a></h2><p>To understand the interaction between diet and health, biomarkers that accurately reflect consumption of foods of perceived health relevance are needed. The aim of this investigation was to use direct infusion-mass spectrometry (DI-MS) lipidomics to determine the effects of fish oil supplementation on lipid profiles of human adipose tissue. Adipose tissue samples from an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation study (n = 66) were analyzed to compare the pattern following supplementation equivalent to zero or four portions of oily fish per week. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were incorporated into highly unsaturated (≥5 double bonds) triglycerides (TGs), phosphocholines, and phosphoethanolamines as well as being detected directly as the nonesterified fatty  forms. Multivariate statistics demonstrated that phospholipids were the most accurate and sensitive lipids for the assessing EPA and DHA incorporation into adipose tissue. Potential confounding factors (adiposity, age, and sex of the subject) were also considered in the analysis, and adiposity was also associated with an increase in highly unsaturated TGs as a result of incorporation of the n-6 PUFA . DI-MS provides a high-throughput analysis of fatty  status that can monitor oily fish consumption, suitable for use in cohort studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832208>Maternal Dietary Docosahexaenoic  Alters Lipid Peroxidation Products and (n-3)/(n-6) Fatty  Balance in Offspring Mice.</a></h2><p>The abundance of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in the mammalian brain has generated substantial interest in the search for its roles in regulating brain functions. Our recent study with a gene/stress mouse model provided evidence to support the ability for the maternal supplement of DHA to alleviate autism-associated behavior in the offspring. DHA and  (ARA) are substrates of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions, and lipid peroxidation results in the production of 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), respectively. In this study, we examine whether a maternal DHA-supplemented diet alters fatty acids (FAs), as well as lipid peroxidation products in the pup brain, heart and plasma by a targeted metabolite approach. Pups in the maternal DHA-supplemented diet group showed an increase in DHA and a concomitant decrease in ARA in all brain regions examined. However, significant increases in 4-HHE, and not 4-HNE, were found mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Analysis of heart and plasma showed large increases in DHA and 4-HHE, but a significant decrease in 4-HNE levels only in plasma. Taken together, the DHA-supplemented maternal diet alters the (n-3)/(n-6) FA ratio, and increases 4-HHE levels in pup brain, heart and plasma. These effects may contribute to the beneficial effects of DHA on neurodevelopment, as well as functional changes in other body organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6403678>Platelet arachidonate metabolism and platelet function in zinc-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of zinc status on arachidonate metabolism and the initiation of aggregation by a prostaglandin endoperoxide analog (U-44069), immature rats were fed for 5 days a low zinc (less than 1 ppm) or control (100 ppm Zn) diet based on soybean protein. In vitro production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) by platelet-rich plasma after stimulation by either arachidonate (0.2 mM) or ADP (0.2 microM) was not changed by dietary zinc deprivation, even though bleeding time was prolonged. Oxygenation of exogenous arachidonate, catalyzed by either the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathway, was not affected by zinc deficiency. Platelet aggregation in response to the prostaglandin endoperoxide analog at both 8 and 16 microM was impaired by dietary zinc deprivation. While short-term zinc deprivation decreased platelet response to minimal levels of aggregating agents, production of arachidonate metabolites was unimpaired. It is postulated that platelet response to the products of arachidonate metabolism is reduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12232162>Involvement of de Novo Protein Synthesis, Protein Kinase, Extracellular Ca2+, and Lipoxygenase in  Induction of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Genes and Isoprenoid Accumulation in Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.).</a></h2><p>A series of inhibitors were tested to determine the participation of de novo protein synthesis, protein kinase activity, extracellular Ca2+, and lipoxygenase activity in  elicitation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) gene expression and sesquiterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis in potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Kennebec). Gene-specific probes were used to discriminate effects on the expression of two HMGR genes (hmg1 and hmg2) that respond differentially in tuber tissue following wounding or elicitor treatment. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide completely blocked arachidonate-induced hypersensitive necrosis and , including HMGR gene induction and phytoalexin accumulation. This suggests that proteins necessary for coupling  reception to HMGR mRNA accumulation are either rapidly turned over or not present constitutively and are induced following elicitor treatment. Staurosporin, a potent inhibitor of protein kinases, and ethyleneglycol-bis([beta]-aminoethyl ether)-N,N[prime]-tetraacetic , a Ca2+ chelator, inhibited arachidonate-induction of hmg2 gene expression and phytoalexin accumulation but did not inhibit the wound-induced expression of hmg1. However, staurosporin inhibited arachidonate's suppression of hmg1 gene expression. Eicosatetraynoic , a lipoxygenase inhibitor that suppresses elicitor-induced phytoalexin accumulation, also inhibited arachidonate's suppression of hmg1 and induction of hmg2. The results indicate that arachidonate's suppression of hmg1 and activation of hmg2 depend on a common intermediate or set of intermediates whose generation is sensitive to the inhibitors tested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16665539>Inhibition by Salicylhydroxamic , BW755C, Eicosatetraynoic , and Disulfiram of Hypersensitive Resistance Elicited by  or Poly-l-Lysine in Potato Tuber.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis that  (AA) induction of sesquiterpene accumulation and  in potato (Solanum tuberosum) is mediated by a lipoxygenase metabolite of AA was tested using lipoxygenase inhibitors. Salicylhydroxamic  (SHAM) and 3-amino-1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-pyrazoline hydrochloride (BW755C) delayed the response to AA. Inhibition by eicosatetraynoic  (ETYA) was more persistent. These results are consistent with previous reports that SHAM and BW755C are reversible inhibitors of lipoxygenase and easily oxidized by potato while ETYA acts as an irreversible inhibitor. Disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram disulfide) also inhibited AA elicitor activity. SHAM was most effective if applied at the time of AA treatment, having no effect if applied 6 hours afterward. SHAM was effective in the presence of MES or MOPS buffers but not in acetate-buffered or unbuffered solutions; neither BW755C nor ETYA exhibited this restriction. However, SHAM, BW755C, and ETYA also were inhibitors of  and sesquiterpene accumulation elicited in potato by poly-l-lysine, which, unlike AA, is not a lipoxygenase substrate. SHAM effectiveness also was restricted to 6 hours after treatment with poly-l-lysine. While the results with AA support a role for lipoxygenase, those with poly-l-lysine may be evidence that these compounds are having other effects in potato tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31006007>Plasma oxylipins respond in a linear dose-response manner with increased intake of EPA and DHA: results from a randomized controlled trial in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>The health effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are partly mediated by their oxidized metabolites, i.e., eicosanoids and other oxylipins. Some intervention studies have demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) increase systemic concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and moderately decrease -derived oxylipins. There is no information on the dose-response of oxylipin concentrations after n-3 PUFA intake.The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipins in human plasma samples from an intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to different daily intakes of EPA and DHA for 12 mo.Healthy adult men and women with low habitual fish consumption (n = 121) were randomly assigned to receive capsules providing doses of n-3 PUFAs reflecting 3 patterns of consumption of oily fish [1, 2, or 4 portions/wk with 3.27 g EPA + DHA (1:1.2, wt:wt) per portion] or placebo. Oxylipins were quantified in plasma after 3 and 12 mo. Relative and absolute changes of individual oxylipins were calculated and concentrations were correlated with the dose and the content of EPA and DHA in blood lipid pools.Seventy-three oxylipins, mostly hydroxy-, dihydroxy-, and epoxy-PUFAs, were quantified in the plasma samples. After 3 and 12 mo a linear increase with dose was observed for all EPA- and DHA-derived oxylipins. Cytochrome-P450-derived anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective epoxy-PUFAs increased linearly with n-3 PUFA dose and showed low interindividual variance (r2 > 0.95). Similarly, 5, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroxy-PUFAs as well as those formed autoxidatively increased linearly. These include the precursors of so-called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), e.g., 17-hydroxy-DHA and 18-hydroxy-EPA.Plasma concentrations of biologically active oxylipins derived from n-3 PUFAs, including epoxy-PUFAs and SPM-precursors, increase linearly with elevated intake of EPA and DHA. Interindividual differences in resulting plasma concentrations are low.

AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine (PM) inhibit both the formation of AGEs and development of complications in animal models of diabetes. PM also inhibits the chemical modification of protein by advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) during lipid peroxidation reactions in vitro. We show here that several PM adducts, formed in incubations of PM with linoleate and arachidonate in vitro, are also excreted in the urine of PM-treated animals. The PM adducts N-nonanedioyl-PM (derived from linoleate), N-pentanedioyl-PM, N-pyrrolo-PM, and N-(2-formyl)-pyrrolo-PM (derived from arachidonate), and N-formyl-PM and N-hexanoyl-PM (derived from both fatty acids) were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of rat urine. Levels of these adducts were increased 5-10-fold in the urine of PM-treated diabetic and hyperlipidemic rats, compared with control animals. We conclude that the PM functions, at least in part, by trapping intermediates in AGE/ALE formation and propose a mechanism for PM inhibition of AGE/ALE formation involving cleavage of alpha-dicarbonyl intermediates in glycoxidation and lipoxidation reactions. We also conclude that ALEs derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids are increased in diabetes and hyperlipidemia and may contribute to development of long term renal and vascular pathology in these diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2117556>Is glucose the sole source of tissue  in diabetes mellitus?</a></h2><p>Reactions between glucose and protein are held to be responsible for the protein '' reactions which occur in diabetes mellitus.

This property could be useful in the treatment of obesity, and nutritional aspects are relevant to this important issue. Using hMADS cells as a human cell model which undergoes a white to a brite adipocyte conversion, we had shown previously that , the major metabolite of the essential nutrient Ω6-linoleic , plays a major role in this process. Its metabolites PGE2 and PGF2 alpha inhibit this process via a calcium-dependent pathway, whereas in contrast carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), a stable analog of prostacyclin, activates white to brite adipocyte conversion. Herein, we show that cPGI2 generates via its cognate cell-surface receptor IP-R, a cyclic AMP-signaling pathway involving PKA activity which in turn induces the expression of UCP1. In addition, cPGI2 activates the pathway of nuclear receptors of the PPAR family, i.e. PPARα and PPARγ, which act separately from IP-R to up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in the function of brite adipocytes. Thus dual pathways are playing in concert for the occurrence of a  process of human white adipocytes. These results make prostacyclin analogs as a new class of interesting molecules to treat obesity and associated diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
