The method regarding bile acid active absorption was validated, then, the portal venous content was examined for fibroblast growth factor 15(FGF15), a putative signaling protein produced by the ileal enterocytes following bile acid absorption. After isolation and cannulation of the relevant vessels (abdominal aorta and portal vein), the abdominal aorta and the terminal ileum were infused with respectively Krebs-Ringer solution and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) and the absorption was assessed by its recovery in the portal vein. After immunoblot, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis were performed both on gel bands digestion products and on portal outflow samples in order to evaluate if negligible amounts of FGF15 were present in the portal circulation. TUDCA absorption was efficient, intestinal morphology and  consumption were normal. Despite accurate analysis, we could not find FGF15. Our method proved to be reliable for studying the active bile acid absorption. It is also suitable to identify molecules produced by enterocytes and transferred to the portal circulation in response to absorption of different substances such as nutrients or drugs. Since FGF15 was not recovered we suggest the possibilities that this protein is produced in very little amounts, poorly transferred outside the cell, or that it is extremely unstable and rapidly degraded.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843188>Critical Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia-Induced Deficits in Synaptic Plasticity and Long-Term Memory.</a></h2><p>This study examined the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mediating chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH)-induced neurocognitive deficits. We designed experiments to demonstrate that ER stress is initiated in the hippocampus under chronic IH and determined its role in apoptotic cell death, impaired synaptic structure and plasticity, and memory deficits.Two weeks of IH disrupted ER fine structure and upregulated ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein, in the hippocampus, which could be suppressed by ER stress inhibitors,  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid. Meanwhile, ER stress induced apoptosis via decreased Bcl-2, promoted reactive oxygen species production, and increased malondialdehyde formation and protein carbonyl, as well as suppressed mitochondrial function. These effects were largely prevented by ER stress inhibitors. On the other hand, suppression of oxidative stress could reduce ER stress. In addition, the length of the synaptic active zone and number of mature spines were reduced by IH. Long-term recognition memory and spatial memory were also impaired, which was accompanied by reduced long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral pathway. These effects were prevented by coadministration of the TUDCA.These results show that ER stress plays a critical role in underlying memory deficits in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated IH. Attenuators of ER stress may serve as novel adjunct therapeutic agents for ameliorating OSA-induced neurocognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483094> increases neural stem cell pool and neuronal conversion by regulating mitochondria-cell cycle retrograde signaling.</a></h2><p>The low survival and differentiation rates of stem cells after either transplantation or neural injury have been a major concern of stem cell-based therapy. Thus, further understanding long-term survival and differentiation of stem cells may uncover new targets for discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches. We have previously described the impact of mitochondrial apoptosis-related events in modulating neural stem cell (NSC) fate. In addition, the endogenous bile acid,  (TUDCA) was shown to be neuroprotective in several animal models of neurodegenerative disorders by acting as an anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant molecule at the mitochondrial level. Here, we hypothesize that TUDCA might also play a role on NSC fate decision. We found that TUDCA prevents mitochondrial apoptotic events typical of early-stage mouse NSC differentiation, preserves mitochondrial integrity and function, while enhancing self-renewal potential and accelerating cell cycle exit of NSCs. Interestingly, TUDCA prevention of mitochondrial alterations interfered with NSC differentiation potential by favoring neuronal rather than astroglial conversion. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) scavenger and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase revealed that the effect of TUDCA is dependent on mtROS and ATP regulation levels. Collectively, these data underline the importance of mitochondrial stress control of NSC fate decision and support a new role for TUDCA in this process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19914257>Cardiac overexpression of metallothionein rescues cardiac contractile dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress but not autophagy in sepsis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is characterized by systematic inflammation where oxidative damage plays a key role in organ failure. This study was designed to examine the impact of the antioxidant metallothionein (MT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy. Mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were examined in hearts from FVB and cardiac-specific MT overexpression mice treated with LPS. Oxidative stress, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (ERK, JNK and p38), ER stress, autophagy and inflammatory markers iNOS and TNFalpha were evaluated. Our data revealed enlarged end systolic diameter, decreased fractional shortening, myocyte peak shortening and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening as well as prolonged duration of relengthening in LPS-treated FVB mice associated with reduced intracellular Ca(2+) release and decay. LPS treatment promoted oxidative stress (reduced glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and ROS generation). Western blot analysis revealed greater iNOS and TNFalpha, activation of ERK, JNK and p38, upregulation of ER stress markers GRP78, Gadd153, PERK and IRE1alpha, as well as the autophagy markers Beclin-1, LCB3 and Atg7 in LPS-treated mouse hearts without any change in total ERK, JNK and p38. Interestingly, these LPS-induced changes in echocardiographic, cardiomyocyte mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties, ROS, stress signaling and ER stress (but not autophagy, iNOS and TNFalpha) were ablated by MT. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the ER stress inhibitor  reversed LPS-elicited depression in cardiomyocyte contractile function. LPS activated AMPK and its downstream signaling ACC in conjunction with an elevated AMP/ATP ratio, which was unaffected by MT. Taken together, our data favor a beneficial effect of MT in the management of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to examine the influence of oxidative stress through glutathione depletion on myocardial ER stress and contractile function in the absence or presence of the heavy metal scavenger antioxidant metallothionein (MT). FVB and MT overexpression transgenic mice received the GSH synthase inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 30 mM) in drinking water for 2 weeks. Oxidative stress, ER stress, apoptosis, cardiac function and ultrastructure were assessed using GSH/GSSG assay, reactive  species (ROS), immunoblotting, caspase-3 activity, Langendorff perfused heart function (LVDP and +/-dP/dt), and transmission electron microscopy. BSO led to a robust decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio and increased ROS production, consolidating oxidative stress. Cardiac function and ultrastructure were compromised following BSO treatment, the effect of which was obliterated by MT. BSO promoted overt ER stress as evidenced by upregulated BiP, calregulin, phospho-IRE1 alpha and phospho-eIF2 alpha without affecting total IRE1 alpha and eIF2 alpha. BSO treatment led to apoptosis manifested as elevated expression of CHOP/GADD153, caspase-12 and Bax as well as caspase-3 activity, reduced Bcl-2 expression and JNK phosphorylation, all of which was ablated by MT. Moreover, both antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the ER stress inhibitor  reversed the oxidative stress inducer menadione-elicited depression in cardiomyocyte contractile function. Taken together, these data suggested that ER stress occurs likely downstream of oxidative stress en route to cardiac dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150771>Obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress causes chronic inflammation in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a central role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis under normal conditions. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. In this study, we observed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inflammatory response occurred in adipose tissue of mice fed a high- diet for a period of 16 weeks. After 16 weeks of feeding, ER stress markers increased and chronic inflammation occurred in adipose tissue. We found that ER stress is induced by free fatty acid (FFA)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and up-regulated gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oral administration to obese mice of chemical chaperons, which alleviate ER stress, improved chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, followed by the suppression of increased body weight and improved insulin signaling. These results indicate that ER stress plays important pathophysiological roles in obesity-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28562691>Chronic treatment with paeonol improves endothelial function in mice through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to endothelial dysfunction which is commonly associated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases. We explored the vascular protective effects of chronic treatment with paeonol (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), the major compound from the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa on ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with ER stress inducer, tunicamycin (1 mg/kg/week) for 2 weeks to induce ER stress. The animals were co-administered with or without paeonol (20 mg/kg/oral gavage), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, tempol (20 mg/kg/day) or ER stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA, 150 mg/kg/day) respectively. Blood pressure and body weight were monitored weekly and at the end of treatment, the aorta was isolated for isometric force measurement. Protein associated with ER stress (GRP78, ATF6 and p-eIF2α) and oxidative stress (NOX2 and nitrotyrosine) were evaluated using Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability were determined using total nitrate/nitrite assay and western blotting (phosphorylation of eNOS protein). ROS production was assessed by en face dihydroethidium staining and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, respectively. Our results revealed that mice treated with tunicamycin showed an increased blood pressure, reduction in body weight and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) of aorta, which were ameliorated by co-treatment with either paeonol, TUDCA and tempol. Furthermore, paeonol reduced the ROS level in the mouse aorta and improved NO bioavailability in tunicamycin treated mice. These beneficial effects of paeonol observed were comparable to those produced by TUDCA and tempol, suggesting that the actions of paeonol may involve inhibition of ER stress-mediated oxidative stress pathway. Taken together, the present results suggest that chronic treatment with paeonol preserved endothelial function and normalized blood pressure in mice induced by tunicamycin in vivo through the inhibition of ER stress-associated ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820500>Monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein (MCPIP) promotes inflammatory angiogenesis via sequential induction of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity and tumor growth are known to involve inflammation. Inflammatory molecules such as MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 are known to promote angiogenesis. MCP-induced protein (MCPIP), originally discovered as a novel zinc finger protein induced by MCP-1, is also induced by other inflammatory agents. MCPIP was shown to mediate MCP-1-induced angiogenesis. Whether angiogenesis induced by other inflammatory agents is mediated via MCPIP is unknown and the molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis induced by MCPIP have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to bridge this gap and delineate the sequential processes involved in angiogenesis mediated via MCPIP. siRNA knockdown of MCPIP was used to determine whether different inflammatory agents, MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8, mediate angiogenesis via MCPIP in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Chemical inhibitors and specific gene knockdown approach were used to inhibit each process postulated. Oxidative stress was inhibited by apocynin or cerium oxide nanoparticles or knockdown of NADPH oxidase subunit, phox47. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was blocked by tauroursodeoxycholate or knockdown of ER stress signaling protein IRE-1 and autophagy was inhibited by the use of 3'methyl adenine, or LY 294002 or by specific knockdown of beclin1. Matrigel assay was used as a tool to study angiogenic differentiation induced by inflammatory agents or MCPIP overexpression in HUVECs. Tube formation induced by inflammatory agents, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and MCP-1 was inhibited by knockdown of MCPIP. Forced MCPIP-expression induced oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy and angiogenic differentiation in HUVECs. Inhibition of each step caused inhibition of each subsequent step postulated. The results reveal that angiogenesis induced by inflammatory agents is mediated via induction of MCPIP that causes oxidative and nitrosative stress resulting in ER stress leading to autophagy required for angiogenesis. The sequence of events suggested to be involved in inflammatory angiogenesis by MCPIP could serve as possible targets for therapeutic intervention of angiogenesis-related disorders.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Pharmacologic inhibition of photoreceptor cell death may prevent this outcome. This study tests whether systemic administration of  (TUDCA) can protect photoreceptors from cell death after experimental retinal detachment in rodents.Retinal detachment was created in rats by subretinal injection of hyaluronic acid. The animals were treated daily with vehicle or TUDCA (500 mg/kg). TUNEL staining was used to evaluate cell death. Photoreceptor loss was evaluated by measuring the relative thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Macrophage recruitment, oxidative stress, cytokine levels, and caspase levels were also quantified. Three days after detachment, TUDCA decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared to vehicle (651±68/mm(2) vs. 1314±68/mm(2), P = 0.001) and prevented the reduction of ONL thickness ratio (0.84±0.03 vs. 0.65±0.03, P = 0.002). Similar results were obtained after 5 days of retinal detachment. Macrophage recruitment and expression levels of TNF-a and MCP-1 after retinal detachment were not affected by TUDCA treatment, whereas increases in activity of caspases 3 and 9 as well as carbonyl-protein adducts were almost completely inhibited by TUDCA treatment.Systemic administration of TUDCA preserved photoreceptors after retinal detachment, and was associated with decreased oxidative stress and caspase activity. TUDCA may be used as a novel therapeutic agent for preventing vision loss in diseases that are characterized by photoreceptor detachment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8387948>Evidence for involvement of oxygen free radicals in bile acid toxicity to isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which hydrophobic bile acids are toxic to the liver are unknown. To determine whether the generation of free radicals is involved in the hepatotoxicity of bile acids, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated with individual bile acids (100 to 200 mumol/L) for 4 hr. Hepatocyte viability (trypan blue exclusion) declined to 40% to 50% in incubations with taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurolithocholic acid, whereas taurocholic acid and  were not toxic.  peroxidation was significantly associated with the loss of cell viability. Preincubation with different antioxidants-D-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, D-alpha-tocopherol, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, superoxide dismutase, catalase, superoxide dismutase + catalase, deferoxamine or apotransferrin-protected against the loss of viability and inhibited  peroxidation in cells incubated with 200 mumol/L taurolithocholic acid. alpha-Tocopheryl succinate added after 90 min of incubation with taurolithocholic acid ameliorated further hepatocyte toxicity and  peroxidation. Incubation of hepatocytes with 500 mumol/L of taurochenodeoxycholic acid or taurolithocholic acid under a low oxygen tension (9% O2) similarly caused  peroxidation and cell injury that was reversed by preincubation with D-alpha-tocopherol. These data suggest that oxygen free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of bile acid hepatotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28962181> attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress and protects the liver from chronic intermittent hypoxia induced injury.</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea that characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) has been reported to associate with chronic liver injury.  (TUDCA) exerts liver-protective effects in various liver diseases. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that TUDCA could protect liver against CIH injury. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to intermittent hypoxia for eight weeks and applied with TUDCA by intraperitoneal injection. The effect of TUDCA on liver histological changes, liver function, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, hepatocyte apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were investigated. The results showed that administration of TUDCA attenuated liver pathological changes, reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase level, suppressed reactive oxygen species activity, decreased tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β level and inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis induced by CIH. TUDCA also inhibited CIH-induced ER stress in liver as evidenced by decreased expression of ER chaperone 78 kDa glucose-related protein, unfolded protein response transducers and ER proapoptotic proteins. Altogether, the present study described a liver-protective effect of TUDCA in CIH mice model, and this effect seems at least partly through the inhibition of ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187671>Bavachin Induces Apoptosis through Mitochondrial Regulated ER Stress Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>As a traditional herbal medicine, the fruits of Psoralea corylifolia L. (Fructus Psoraleae (FP)) have been widely used for the treatment of various skin diseases for hundred years. Recently, the emerging FP-induced toxic effects, especially hepatotoxicity, in clinic are getting the public's attention. However, its exact toxic components and mechanisms underlying remain unclear. Bavachin, one of flavonoids in FP, has been documented as a hepatotoxic substance, and the present study aimed to determine the toxicity caused by bavachin and the possible toxic mechanisms involved using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results showed that bavachin could significantly inhibited cell proliferation and trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent manner. Downregulating ER stress using  (TUDCA) obvious attenuated bavachin-triggerd cell apoptosis. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of Mitofusion2 (Mfn2) resulted in a remarkable aggravation of ER stress through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ROS Scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC)) also reduced bavachin-induced ER stress. Taken together, our study demonstrated that bavachin-induced ER stress caused cell apoptosis by Mfn2-Akt pathway, and that ROS may participate upstream in this mechanism. Here, we not only provide a new understanding of ROS/Mfn2/Akt pathway in bavachin-induced cytotoxicity via the ER stress, but also identify a new specific intervention to prevent FP-induced hepatotoxicity in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16056106>Human hepatic mitochondria generate reactive  species and undergo the permeability transition in response to hydrophobic bile acids.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic bile acids accumulate in the liver during cholestasis and are believed to cause hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis in part through induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and the mitochondrial generation of oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to determine if human hepatic mitochondria respond to bile acids in this manner.The MPT was measured spectrophotometrically and morphologically in normal human liver mitochondria exposed to glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) with and without cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the MPT, antioxidants, and  (TUDC). Hydroperoxide generation was measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence. Cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor were assessed by immunoblotting.GCDC induced the MPT in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by cyclosporin A, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, idebenone, and TUDC. GCDC stimulated reactive  species generation and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, which were significantly inhibited by the antioxidants, cyclosporin A, and TUDC.Mitochondrial pathways of cell death are stimulated in human hepatic mitochondria exposed to GCDC consistent with the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury. These results parallel those reported in rodents, supporting the extrapolation of mechanistic studies of bile acid toxicity from rodent to humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30793306>VEGF-A promotes angiogenesis after acute myocardial infarction through increasing ROS production and enhancing ER stress-mediated autophagy.</a></h2><p>Proangiogenesis is generally regarded as an effective approach for treating ischemic heart disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a strong and essential proangiogenic factor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy are implicated in the process of angiogenesis. This study is designed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms underlying VEGF-A, ROS, ER stress, autophagy, and angiogenesis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A mouse model of AMI was successfully established by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared with the sham-operated mice, the microvessel density, VEGF-A content, ROS production, expression of vascular endothelial cadherin, positive expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/Bip), and LC3 puncta in CD31-positive endothelial cells of the ischemic myocardium were overtly elevated. Moreover, VEGF-A exposure predominantly increased the expression of beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (ATG) 4, ATG5, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1), GRP78/Bip, and LC3-II/LC3-I as well as ROS production in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose and time-dependent manner. Both beclin-1 small interfering RNA and 3-methyladenine treatment predominantly mitigated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs, but they failed to elicit any notable effect on VEGF-A-increased expression of GRP78/Bip.  not only obviously abolished VEGF-A-induced increase of IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I, but also negated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, N-acetyl- l-cysteine markedly abrogated VEGF-A-increased ROS production, IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I in the HUVECs. Taken together, our data demonstrated that increased spontaneous production of VEGF-A may induce angiogenesis after AMI through initiating ROS-ER stress-autophagy axis in the vascular endothelial cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15869421>Sustaining a bioartificial liver under hypothermic conditions.</a></h2><p>Bioartificial liver (BAL) devices employing xenogeneic hepatocytes are being developed as a temporary support of liver failure.

Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit increased oxidative stress in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including monocytes; however, the mechanisms remain unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that factors contained within the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes can contribute to increased oxidative stress in monocytes, making them more adherent to endothelial cells. We show that these effects are largely mediated by the interaction between endoplasmic reticulum stress and NADPH oxidase activity. Recent evidence suggests that exposure of human monocytes to glucolipotoxic media to mimic the composition of plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) results in the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The extent to which these findings translate to patients with T2D remains unclear. Thus, we first measured ROS (dihydroethidium fluorescence) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of T2D patients (n = 8) and compared the values with age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 8). The T2D patients exhibited greater basal intracellular ROS (mean ± SD, +3.4 ± 1.4-fold; P < 0.05) compared with control subjects. Next, the increase in ROS in PBMCs isolated from T2D patients was partly recapitulated in cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cells) exposed to plasma from T2D patients for 36 h (+1.3 ± 0.08-fold versus plasma from control subjects; P < 0.05). In addition, we found that increased ROS formation in THP-1 cells treated with T2D plasma was NADPH oxidase derived and led to increased endothelial cell adhesion (+1.8 ± 0.5-fold; P < 0.05) and lipid uptake (+1.3 ± 0.3-fold; P < 0.05). Notably, we found that T2D plasma-induced monocyte ROS and downstream functional effects were abolished by treating cells with , a chemical chaperone known to inhibit ER stress. Collectively, these data indicate that monocyte ROS production with T2D can be attributed, in part, to signals from the circulating environment. Furthermore, an interplay between ER stress and NADPH oxidase activity contributes to ROS production and may be a mechanism mediating endothelial cell adhesion and foam cell formation in T2D.© 2016 The Authors.

However, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by ischemia in the area of application limits the integration and survival of MSCs in patients. In our study, we generated ER stress-induced conditions in MSCs using -cresol. As -cresol is a toxic compound accumulated in the body of CKD patients and induces apoptosis and inflammation through reactive  species (ROS), we observed ER stress-induced MSC apoptosis activated by oxidative stress, which in turn resulted from ROS generation. To overcome stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the protective effects of  (TUDCA), a bile acid, on ER stress in MSCs. In ER stress, TUDCA treatment of MSCs reduced ER stress-associated protein activation, including GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1α, and CHOP. Next, to explore the protective mechanism adopted by TUDCA, TUDCA-mediated cellular prion protein (PrP) activation was assessed. We confirmed that PrP expression significantly increased ROS, which was eliminated by superoxide dismutase and catalase in MSCs. These findings suggest that TUDCA protects from inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress via PrP expression. Our study demonstrates that TUDCA protects MSCs against inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress by PrP expression in response to -cresol exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203149>: relieving the pathogenesis of HFE C282Y hereditary hemochromatosis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2365980>Tauroursodeoxycholate prevents taurolithocholate-induced cholestasis and toxicity in rat liver.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate has been advocated for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. The coinfusion of tauroursodeoxycholate with taurolithocholate in the perfused rat liver completely prevented the decrease of bile flow and the increase of oxygen uptake found with taurolithocholate only. Bile flow and bile salt secretion were increased with the coinfusion of both bile acids as compared with the infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate only (+4.30 microliters/g liver per 30 min) with 16 and 32 mumol/l tauroursodeoxycholate (+1.55 microliters/g liver per 30 min with 80 and 160 mumol/l). Morphological examination revealed a 50% decrease of the number of necrotic cells in the periportal area. Tauroursodeoxycholate did not inhibit the uptake of taurolithocholate, but increased its transcellular passage and biotransformation.

The present study assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which play an important role in the development of diabetes complications, on testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells. Primary rat Leydig cells were cultured and treated with AGEs (25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml). Testosterone production induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis, were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyssi, respectively. Reactive  species (ROS) production in Leydig cells was measured using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins [C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)] in the Leydig cells were measured by western blot analysis. We found that the AGEs markedly suppressed testosterone production by rat Leydig cells which was induced by hCG in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR, 3β-HSD and P450scc were downregulated by the AGEs in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The antioxidant agent, N-acetyl‑L‑cysteine (NAC), and the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA), reversed the inhibitory effects of AGEs. In addition, the content of ROS in Leydig cells treated with AGEs increased significantly. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 were markedly upregulated by the AGEs in the Leydig cells. From these findings, it can be concluded that AGEs inhibit testosterone production by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26643417>[ suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress in pulmonary tissues of intermittent hypoxia mice].</a></h2><p>To explore the mechanism of  (TUDCA) in suppressing apoptosis in pulmonary tissues of intermittent hypoxia (IH) mice model. A total of 32 C57 mice were randomly divided into a control group, a TUDCA group, an IH group and an IH+TUDCA group (8 mice per group).

After 4 weeks of IH exposure, the expression levels of caspase-12 and cleaved caspase-3 in pulmonary tissues were detected by Western blot. Meanwhile, the expression levels of glucose regulated protein-78 (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) were quantified by Western blot, immunochemistry and real-time PCR. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, GRP78 and CHOP were increased in the IH group (all P<0.01). TUDCA treatment could reduce these proteins expression (all P<0.05). Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis can be activated in pulmonary tissues after chronic IH exposure, and TUDCA can reduce the cellular apoptosis via suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534273> Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis, Neural Stem Cell Pool, and Early Neurogenesis in Adult Rats.</a></h2><p>Although neurogenesis occurs in restricted regions of the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) produce very few neurons during ageing or after injury. We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile acid  (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile acid. TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data. Collectively, our results highlight a potential novel role for TUDCA in neurologic disorders associated with SVZ niche deterioration and impaired neurogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515732>Osmotic Stress Induced Cell Death in Wheat Is Alleviated by  and Involves Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related Gene Expression.</a></h2><p>Although,  (TUDCA) has been widely studied in mammalian cells because of its role in inhibiting apoptosis, its effects on plants remain almost unknown, especially in the case of crops such as wheat. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects and mechanisms of action of TUDCA on wheat growth and cell death induced by osmotic stress. Our results show that TUDCA: (1) ameliorates the impact of osmotic stress on wheat height, fresh weight, and water content; (2) alleviates the decrease in chlorophyll content as well as membrane damage caused by osmotic stress; (3) decreases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes under osmotic stress; and (4) to some extent alleviates osmotic stress-induced cell death probably by regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related gene expression, for example expression of the basic leucine zipper genes  and , the binding proteins  and , the protein disulfide isomerase , and the glucose-regulated protein . We also propose a model that illustrates how TUDCA alleviates osmotic stress-related wheat cell death, which provides an important theoretical basis for improving plant stress adaptation and elucidates the mechanisms of ER stress-related plant osmotic stress resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30708974>TUDCA-Treated Mesenchymal Stem Cells Protect against ER Stress in the Hippocampus of a Murine Chronic Kidney Disease Model.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to the loss of kidney function, as well as the dysfunction of several other organs due to the release of uremic toxins into the system. In a murine CKD model, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the hippocampus. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the candidates for cell-based therapy for CKD; however severe pathophysiological conditions can decrease their therapeutic potential. To address these issues, we established  (TUDCA)-treated MSCs using MSCs isolated from patients with CKD (CKD-hMSCs) and assessed the survival and ROS generation of neural cell line SH-SY5Y cells by co-culturing with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs. In the presence of the uremic toxin -cresol, the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced by ROS-mediated ER stress. Co-culture with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs increased anti-oxidant enzyme activities in SH-SY5Y cells through the upregulation of the cellular prion protein (PrP) expression. Upregulated PrP expression in SH-SY5Y cells protected against CKD-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. In an adenine-induced murine CKD model, injection with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs suppressed ROS generation and ER stress in the hippocampus. These results indicate that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs prevent the CKD-mediated cell death of SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ER stress. Our study suggests that treatment with TUDCA could be a powerful strategy for developing autologous MSC-based therapeutics for patients with CKD, and that PrP might be a pivotal target for protecting neural cells from CKD-mediated ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23348250>Saxifragifolin D induces the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells through ROS-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females, and novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating breast cancer are needed urgently. Saxifragifolin D (SD) was isolated by our group from Androsace umbellata which is commonly used to treat solid tumor. In this study, we evaluated its growth inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that SD inhibited the growth of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that SD induced apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Evidence of SD-induced autophagy included the occurrence of autophagic vacuoles, up-regulation of LC3-II, Beclin1 and Vps34. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 or Beclin1 siRNA pretreatment decreased the ratio of apoptosis, indicating that autophagy induction contributes to apoptosis and is required for the latter. SD was also found to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, accompanied by ROS production, increase of intracellular calcium and up-regulation of Bip, IRE1α and XBP-1s. Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress by N-acetyl-l-cysteine,  or IRE1α siRNA pretreatment could suppress both apoptosis and autophagy. Besides, increases in CHOP, calnexin, calpain, p-JNK and p-Bcl-2 were followed by subsequent dissociation of Beclin1 from Bcl-2, further suggesting endoplasmic reticulum stress to be the common signaling pathway shared by SD-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion, SD inhibits breast cancer cell growth and induces interplay between apoptosis and autophagy through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress. It will provide molecular bases for developing SD into a drug candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although diabetic retinopathy is considered a vascular disease, several reports demonstrate that retinal neurons are also affected, leading to vision loss.  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, has proven to be neuroprotective in several models of neurodegenerative diseases, including models of retinal degeneration. Since hyperglycemia is considered to play a central role in retinal cell dysfunction and degeneration, underlying the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TUDCA in rat retinal neurons exposed to elevated glucose concentration. We found that TUDCA markedly decreased cell death in cultured retinal neural cells induced by exposure to elevated glucose concentration. In addition, TUDCA partially prevented the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria, as well as the subsequent accumulation of AIF in the nucleus. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as protein carbonyl groups and reactive  species production, were markedly decreased after TUDCA treatment as compared to cells exposed to elevated glucose concentration alone. In conclusion, TUDCA protected retinal neural cell cultures from cell death induced by elevated glucose concentration, decreasing mito-nuclear translocation of AIF. The antioxidant properties of TUDCA might explain its cytoprotection. These findings may have relevance in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy patients.Copyright © 2013 IBRO.

In brown adipocytes, TUDCA or 4-PBA induced T3-dependent genes and oxygen consumption (∼2-fold), an effect partially lost in D2 knockout cells. In wild type, but not in D2 knockout mice, administration of TUDCA lowered the respiratory quotient, doubled brown adipose tissue D2 activity and normalized the glucose intolerance associated with high  feeding.

In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive  species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different pathways on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and  (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to investigate the action of curcumin in the hippocampus subjected to glutamate neurotoxicity. Glutamate stimulation induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to damage in the hippocampus. Curcumin treatment in the hippocampus or SH-SY5Y cells inhibited IRE1α and PERK phosphorylation with suppression of intracellular ROS production. Curcumin increased AMPK activity and knockdown of AMPKα with specific siRNA abrogated its inhibitory effects on IRE1α and PERK phosphorylation, indicating that AMPK activity was essential for the suppression of ER stress. As a result, curcumin reduced TXNIP expression and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by downregulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thus reduced IL-1β secretion. Specific fluorescent probe and flow cytometry analysis showed that curcumin prevented mitochondrial malfunction and protected cell survival from glutamate neurotoxicity. Moreover, oral administration of curcumin reduced brain infarct volume and attenuated neuronal damage in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunohistochemistry showed that curcumin inhibited p-IRE1α, p-PERK and NLRP3 expression in hippocampus CA1 region. Together, these results showed that curcumin attenuated glutamate neurotoxicity by inhibiting ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the regulation of AMPK, and thereby protected the hippocampus from ischemic insult.Copyright © 2015.

In the present study, we explored the anticancer properties of SAN in lung cancer using the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A1. Our results revealed that SAN inhibited SPC-A1 cell growth and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We found that SAN triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while elimination of ROS by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by SAN. SAN-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulted in the upregulation of many genes and proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), p-protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Blocking ER stress with  (TUDCA) markedly reduced SAN-induced inhibition of growth and apoptosis. Furthermore, TUDCA decreased SAN-induced ROS production, and NAC attenuated SAN-induced GRP78 and CHOP expression. Overall, our data indicate that the anticancer effects of SAN in lung cancer cells depend on ROS production and ER stress and that SAN may be a potential agent against lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576409>Mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>We recently reported that ER stress plays a key role in vascular endothelial dysfunction during hypertension. In this study we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which ER stress induction and oxidative stress impair vascular endothelial function.We conducted in vitro studies with primary endothelial cells from coronary arteries stimulated with tunicamycin, 1μg/mL, in the presence or absence of two ER stress inhibitors:  (Tudca), 500μg/mL, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), 5mM. ER stress induction was assessed by enhanced phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, and increased expression of CHOP, ATF6 and Grp78/Bip. The ER stress induction increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, Nox2/4 mRNA levels and NADPH oxidase activity, and decreased eNOS promoter activity, eNOS expression and phosphorylation, and nitrite levels. Interestingly, the inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway reduced CHOP and Bip expressions enhanced by tunicamycin and restored eNOS promoter activation as well as phosphorylation. To study the effects of ER stress induction in vivo, we used C57BL/6J mice and p47phox(-/-) mice injected with tunicamycin or saline. The ER stress induction in mice significantly impaired vascular endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation in C57BL/6J mice compared with p47phox(-/-) mice indicating NADPH oxidase activity as an intermediate for ER stress in vascular endothelial dysfunction.We conclude that chemically induced ER stress leads to a downstream enhancement of p38 MAPK and oxidative stress causing vascular endothelial dysfunction. Our results indicate that inhibition of ER stress could be a novel therapeutic strategy to attenuate vascular dysfunction during cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the development of zygotes generated from these sperms was poor. Here, we demonstrated that the supplementation of  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, during embryo culture improved the developmental competency of embryos derived from in vitro matured pig oocytes injected intracytoplasmically with boar ED spermatozoa by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species, the DNA degradation and fragmentation, and the expression of apoptosis-related gene Bax and Bak, and by increasing the transcription of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, TUDCA treatment promoted the blastocyst quality manifested by the total cell numbers and the ratio of inner cell mass. Taken together, our data suggest that evaporative drying would be a potentially useful method for the routine preservation of boar sperm in combination with further optimization of subsequently embryo culture conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054569>Ilexgenin A inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress and ameliorates endothelial dysfunction via suppression of TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in an AMPK dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Ilexgenin A is a natural triterpenoid with beneficial effects on lipid disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, relationships between these processes are unclear. We hypothesized that Nox isoforms localize in a subcellular compartment-specific manner, contributing to oxidative and ER stress, which influence the oxidative proteome and vascular function in hypertension. Nox compartmentalization (cell fractionation), O (lucigenin), HO (amplex red), reversible protein oxidation (sulfenylation), irreversible protein oxidation (protein tyrosine phosphatase, peroxiredoxin oxidation), and ER stress (PERK [protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase], IRE1α [inositol-requiring enzyme 1], and phosphorylation/oxidation) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMC proliferation was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and vascular reactivity assessed in stroke-prone SHR arteries by myography. Noxs were downregulated by short interfering RNA and pharmacologically. In SHR, Noxs were localized in specific subcellular regions: Nox1 in plasma membrane and Nox4 in ER. In SHR, oxidative stress was associated with increased protein sulfenylation and hyperoxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and peroxiredoxins. Inhibition of Nox1 (NoxA1ds), Nox1/4 (GKT137831), and ER stress (4-phenylbutyric acid/) normalized SHR vascular reactive  species generation. GKT137831 reduced IRE1α sulfenylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing in SHR. Increased VSMC proliferation in SHR was normalized by GKT137831, 4-phenylbutyric acid, and STF083010 (IRE1-XBP1 disruptor). Hypercontractility in the stroke-prone SHR was attenuated by 4-phenylbutyric acid. We demonstrate that protein hyperoxidation in hypertension is associated with oxidative and ER stress through upregulation of plasmalemmal-Nox1 and ER-Nox4. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response is regulated by Nox4/reactive  species and plays a role in the hyperproliferative VSMC phenotype in SHR. Our study highlights the importance of Nox subcellular compartmentalization and interplay between cytoplasmic reactive  species and ER stress response, which contribute to the VSMC oxidative proteome and vascular dysfunction in hypertension.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038553> Alleviates HO-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis via Suppressing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>We aimed to test the mechanism of protective effects of  (TUDCA) on cardiovascular disease using cultured cardiomyocytes.Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were isolated and cultured and then the cells were divided into 4 groups based on the treatments: control group (cells treated with culture medium), HO/thapsigargin (TG) group (cells treated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress inducer), TUDCA group, and HO/TG + TUDCA group.

The administration of neuroprotective factors is crucial in all phases of the pathology, even when vision has been completely lost. The retina is one of the most susceptible tissues to reactive  species damage. On the other hand, proper development and functioning of the retina requires a precise balance between the processes of proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death. The life-or-death decision seems to be the result of a complex balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic signals. It has been recently shown the efficacy of natural products to slow retinal degenerative process through different pathways. In this review, we assess the neuroprotective effect of two compounds used in the ancient pharmacopoeia. On one hand, it has been demonstrated that administration of the saffron constituent safranal to P23H rats, an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, preserves photoreceptor morphology and number, the capillary network and the visual response. On the other hand, it has been shown that systemic administration of  (TUDCA), the major component of bear bile, to P23H rats preserves cone and rod structure and function, together with their contact with postsynaptic neurons. The neuroprotective effects of safranal and TUDCA make these compounds potentially useful for therapeutic applications in retinal degenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16180656>Hypothermic maintenance of hepatocyte spheroids.</a></h2><p>Primary hepatocytes form spheroids under some culture conditions. These spheroids exhibit many tissue-like ultrastructures and retain many liver-specific functions over a long period of time. They are attractive for many applications employing liver cells. The ability to maintain their viability and functions at a reduced temperature to allow for transportation to the site of their application will facilitate their use. Furthermore, with their structural and functional similarity, they could possibly be used as a model system for studying various liver ischemias. The effect of hypothermic treatment was assessed by  consumption rate, ATP, H2O2, and caspase 8 content, as well as albumin and urea synthesis, during and posttreatment. No single outcome variable gives a superlative quantification of hypothermic damage. Taken together, the hypothermic treatment can be seen as increasingly damaging as the temperature decreases from 21 degrees C to 15 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The addition of the chemical protectants glutathione, N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC), and  (TUDCA) decreased the damaging effect of hypothermic treatment. This protection effect was even more profound when spheroids were preincubated with the protectant for 24 h, and was most prominent at 4 degrees C. The viability of the hypothermically treated hepatocyte spheroids was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The method reported provides a means of maintaining spheroids' viability and may allow for their distribution to application sites at a distance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21542787>Activation of Akt rescues endoplasmic reticulum stress-impaired murine cardiac contractile function via glycogen synthase kinase-3β-mediated suppression of mitochondrial permeation pore opening.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to examine the impact of chronic Akt activation on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cardiac mechanical anomalies, if any, and the underlying mechanism involved.Wild-type and transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the active mutant of Akt (Myr-Akt) were subjected to the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (1 or 3 mg/kg). ER stress led to compromised echocardiographic (elevated left ventricular end-systolic diameter and reduced fractional shortening) and cardiomyocyte contractile function, intracellular Ca(2+) mishandling, and cell survival in wild-type mice associated with mitochondrial damage. In vitro ER stress induction in murine cardiomyocytes upregulated the ER stress proteins Gadd153, GRP78, and phospho-eIF2α, and promoted reactive  species production, carbonyl formation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and mitochondrial permeation pore (mPTP) opening associated with overtly impaired cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) properties. Interestingly, these anomalies were mitigated by chronic Akt activation or the ER chaperon  (TUDCA). Treatment with tunicamycin also dephosphorylated Akt and its downstream signal glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (leading to activation of GSK3β), the effect of which was abrogated by Akt activation and TUDCA. The ER stress-induced cardiomyocyte contractile and mitochondrial anomalies were obliterated by the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A, GSK3β inhibitor SB216763, and ER stress inhibitor TUDCA.This research reported the direct relationship between ER stress and cardiomyocyte contractile and mitochondrial anomalies for the first time.Taken together, these data suggest that ER stress may compromise cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) properties, possibly through the Akt/GSK3β-dependent impairment of mitochondrial integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22773138> prevents MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell death in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are implicated in the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays an important role in dopaminergic neuronal death in substantia nigra pars compacta.  (TUDCA) acts as a mitochondrial stabilizer and anti-apoptotic agent in several models of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated the role of TUDCA in preventing 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD. We evaluated whether TUDCA modulates MPTP-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal axis, and if that can be explained by regulation of JNK phosphorylation, reactive  species (ROS) production, glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalytic activation, and Akt signaling, using C57BL/6 glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP) null mice. TUDCA efficiently protected against MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that exacerbated JNK activation in GSTP null mice resulted in increased susceptibility to MPTP neurotoxicity. Interestingly, pre-treatment with TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced JNK phosphorylation in mouse midbrain and striatum. Moreover, the anti-oxidative role of TUDCA was demonstrated in vivo by impairment of ROS production in the presence of MPTP. Finally, results herein suggest that the survival pathway activated by TUDCA involves Akt signaling, including downstream Bad phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. We conclude that TUDCA is neuroprotective in an in vivo model of PD, acting mainly by modulation of JNK activity and cellular redox thresholds, together with activation of the Akt pro-survival pathway. These results open new perspectives for the pharmacological use of TUDCA, as a modulator of neurodegeneration in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351168>Coregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress in neuropathic pain and disinhibition of the spinal nociceptive circuitry.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen leads to ER stress, which is related to cellular reactive  species production. Neuropathic pain may result from spinal dorsal horn (SDH) ER stress. In this study, we examined the cause-effect relationship between ER stress and neuropathic pain using the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rat model. We showed that ER stress was mutually promotive with oxidative stress during the process. We also tested the hypothesis that spinal sensitization arose from reduced activities of GABA-ergic interneurons and that spinal sensitization was mediated by SDH ER stress. Other important findings in this study including the following: (1) nociceptive behavior was alleviated in SNL rat as long as  injections were repeated to inhibit ER stress; (2) inducing SDH ER stress in healthy rat resulted in mechanical hyperalgesia; (3) blocking protein disulfide isomerase pharmacologically reduced ER stress and nociceptive behavior in SNL rat; (4) cells in the dorsal horn with elevated ER stress were mainly neurons; and (5) whole-cell recordings made in slide preparations revealed significant inhibition of GABA-ergic interneuron activity in the dorsal horn with ER stress vs in the healthy dorsal horn. Taken together, results of the current study demonstrate that coregulation of ER stress and oxidative stress played an important role in neuropathic pain process. Inhibiting SDH ER stress could be a potential novel strategy to manage neuropathic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728112>Connexin32 plays a crucial role in ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress apoptosis signaling pathway in ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) not only prolongs the length of hospital stay, but also seriously affects the patient's survival rate.

Thus, in present study, we focused on the underlying mechanisms of I/R-induced AKI, and postulated that Cx32 mediated ROS/ERS/apoptosis signal pathway activation played an important part in I/R-induced AKI.We established renal I/R models with Cx32 and Cx32 mice, which underwent double kidneys clamping and recanalization. ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) and ERS inhibitors (4-phenyl butyric acid, 4-PBA, and , TUDCA) were used to decrease the content of ROS and attenuate ERS activation, respectively.Renal damage was progressively exacerbated in a time-dependent manner at the reperfusion stage, that was consistent with the alternation of ERS activation, including glucose regulated protein 78 (BiP/GRP78), X box-binding protein1, and C/EBP homologous protein expression. TUDCA or 4-PBA application attenuated I/R-induced ERS activation and protected against renal tubular epithelial cells apoptosis and renal damage. Cx32 deficiency decreased ROS generation and distribution between the neighboring cells, which attenuated I/R-induced ERS activation, and improved cell apoptosis and renal damage.Cx32 mediated ROS/ERS/apoptosis signal pathway activation played an important part in I/R-induced AKI. Cx32 deficiency, ROS elimination, and ERS inhibition all could protect against I/R-induced AKI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121477>Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Induce Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagic Cell Death via -Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Disruption in Normal Lung Cells.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterials are used in diverse fields including food, cosmetic, and medical industries. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) are widely used, but their effects on biological systems and mechanism of toxicity have not been elucidated fully. Here, we report the toxicological mechanism of TiO2-NP in cell organelles. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were exposed to 50 and 100 μg/mL TiO2-NP for 24 and 48 h. Our results showed that TiO2-NP induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cells and disrupted the -associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) and calcium ion balance, thereby increasing autophagy. In contrast, an inhibitor of ER stress,  (TUDCA), mitigated the cellular toxic response, suggesting that TiO2-NP promoted toxicity via ER stress. This novel mechanism of TiO2-NP toxicity in human bronchial epithelial cells suggests that further exhaustive research on the harmful effects of these nanoparticles in relevant organisms is needed for their safe application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726039>Effect of S-adenosylmethionine versus  on bile acid-induced apoptosis and cytolysis in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) increases survival in alcoholic liver cirrhosis and may have a beneficial effect in cholestatic liver disease. SAMe repletes glutathione stores and protects tissue from  free radicals. The effect of SAMe on bile acid-induced apoptosis is unknown. In the present study the possible hepatoprotective effect of SAMe was evaluated and compared with that of  (TUDCA).Primary rat hepatocytes treated with glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were used as a model for cholestasis-induced hepatocellular damage, which served to study the effects of SAMe and TUDCA on bile acid-induced apoptosis and cytolysis.SAMe reduced bile acid-induced apoptosis but did not prevent bile acid-induced cytolysis. Compared with SAMe, TUDCA was more efficient in reducing apoptosis due to toxic bile acids. The combination of SAMe and TUDCA had additive effects in reducing apoptosis.The reduction in bile acid-induced apoptosis by SAMe may represent one of the factors responsible for its beneficial effects in the treatment of liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25948649>Mitochondria: Major Regulators of Neural Development.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are organelles derived from primitive symbiosis between archeon ancestors and prokaryotic α-proteobacteria species, which lost the capacity of synthetizing most proteins encoded the bacterial DNA, along the evolutionary process of eukaryotes. Nowadays, mitochondria are constituted by small circular mitochondrial DNA of 16 kb, responsible for the control of several proteins, including polypeptides of the electron transport chain. Throughout evolution, these organelles acquired the capacity of regulating energy production and , thus becoming central modulators of cell fate. In fact, mitochondria are crucial for a variety of cellular processes, including adenosine triphosphate production by oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and also cellular specialization in a variety of tissues that ultimately relies on specific mitochondrial specialization and maturation. In this review, we discuss recent evidence extending the importance of mitochondrial function and energy  to the context of neuronal development and adult neurogenesis.© The Author(s) 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11080188> partially prevents apoptosis induced by 3-nitropropionic acid: evidence for a mitochondrial pathway independent of the permeability transition.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to be a strong modulator of the apoptotic threshold in both hepatic and nonhepatic cells. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, appears to cause apoptotic neuronal cell death in the striatum, reminiscent of the neurochemical and anatomical changes associated with Huntington's disease (HD). This study was undertaken (a) to characterize further the mechanism by which 3-NP induces apoptosis in rat neuronal RN33B cells and (b) to determine if and how the taurine-conjugated UDCA,  (TUDCA), inhibits apoptosis induced by 3-NP. Our results indicate that coincubation of cells with TUDCA and 3-NP was associated with an approximately 80% reduction in apoptosis (p < 0.001), whereas neither taurine nor cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), inhibited cell death. Moreover, TUDCA, as well as UDCA and its glycine-conjugated form, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, prevented mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (p < 0.001), which probably accounts for the observed inhibition of DEVD-specific caspase activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. 3-NP decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (p < 0.001) and increased mitochondrial-associated Bax protein levels (p < 0.001). Coincubation with TUDCA was associated with significant inhibition of these mitochondrial membrane alterations (p < 0.01). The results suggest that TUDCA inhibits 3-NP-induced apoptosis via direct inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization and outer membrane disruption, together with modulation of Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria. In addition, cell death by 3-NP apparently occurs through pathways that are independent of the MPT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806967>Short-term feedback regulation of bile salt uptake by bile salts in rodent liver.</a></h2><p>The sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) is the major bile salt uptake transporter at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. Short-term feedback regulation of Ntcp by primary bile salts has not yet been investigated in vivo. Subcellular localization of Ntcp was analyzed in Ntcp-transfected HepG2-cells by flow cytometry and in immunofluorescence images from tissue sections by a new automated image analysis method. Net bile salt uptake was investigated in perfused rat liver by a pulse chase technique. In Flag-Ntcp-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) expressing HepG2-cells, taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), but not taurocholate (TC), induced endocytosis of Ntcp. TCDC, but not TC, caused significant internalization of Ntcp in perfused rat livers, as shown by an increase in intracellular Ntcp immunoreactivity, whereas Bsep distribution remained unchanged. These results correlate with functional studies. Rat livers were continuously perfused with 100 μmol/L of TC. 25 μmol/L of TCDC, taurodeoxycholate (TDC), tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC), or TC were added for 30 minutes, washed out, followed by a pulse of (3) [H]-TC. TCDC, but not TDC, TUDC, or TC significantly increased the amount of (3) [H]-TC in the effluent, indicating a reduced sinusoidal net TC uptake. This effect was sensitive to chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) and cypermethrin (protein phosphatase 2B inhibitor). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors had an additive effect, whereas Erk1/2 (extracellular signal activated kinase 1/2), p38MAPK, protein phosphatase 1/2A (PP1/2A), and reactive  species (ROS) were not involved.TCDC regulates bile salt transport at the sinusoidal membrane by protein kinase C- and protein phosphatase 2B-mediated retrieval of Ntcp from the plasma membrane. During increased portal bile salt load this mechanism may adjust bile salt uptake along the acinus and protect periportal hepatocytes from harmful bile salt concentrations.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891994>The Unexpected Uses of Urso- and  in the Treatment of Non-liver Diseases.</a></h2><p> (TUDCA) is the taurine conjugate of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved hydrophilic bile acid for the treatment of certain cholestatic liver diseases. There is a growing body of research on the mechanism(s) of TUDCA and its potential therapeutic effect on a wide variety of non-liver diseases. Both UDCA and TUDCA are potent inhibitors of apoptosis, in part by interfering with the upstream mitochondrial pathway of cell death, inhibiting oxygen-radical production, reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and stabilizing the unfolded protein response (UPR). Several studies have demonstrated that TUDCA serves as an anti-apoptotic agent for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. In addition, TUDCA plays an important role in protecting against cell death in certain retinal disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa. It has been shown to reduce ER stress associated with elevated glucose levels in diabetes by inhibiting caspase activation, up-regulating the UPR, and inhibiting reactive oxygen species. Obesity, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, spinal cord injury, and a long list of acute and chronic non-liver diseases associated with apoptosis are all potential therapeutic targets for T/UDCA. A growing number of pre-clinical and clinical studies underscore the potential benefit of this simple, naturally occurring bile acid, which has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 3000 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552716>Nrf2 activation by  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive  species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that  (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, however, several oxaliplatin-based combinatorial treatments have shown a promising anti-tumor activity in patients with HCC. Presently, we demonstrate that oxaliplatin triggers necrosis more than apoptosis in HepG2, SK-Hep1, SNU-423 and Hep3B HCC cells, while mainly inducing apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells. Interestingly, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a less hydrophobic bile acid that can suppress carcinogenesis, shifted oxaliplatin-induced necrosis to apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The same effect was produced by hydrophilic bile acids ( and taurohyodeoxycholic acid), but not by highly hydrophobic bile acids (deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid). UDCA also triggered the necrosis-to-apoptosis switch when cotreated with other platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs including cisplatin and carboplatin, suggesting that the cell death mode switching effect of UDCA is a general phenomenon when combined with platinum drugs. Oxaliplatin produced high level of reactive  species (ROS) in HepG2 cells and UDCA significantly reduced oxaliplatin-induced ROS generation. In addition, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the superoxide scavengers butylated hydroxyanisole and dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid attenuated necrosis, indicating a critical role(s) of ROS in occurrence of necrotic death. Apoptosis induced by combined treatment appeared to be mediated by p53-caspase 8-caspase 3 pathway. In conclusion, UDCA switches oxaliplatin-induced necrosis to apoptosis via inhibition of ROS production and activation of the p53-caspase 8 pathway in HepG2 cells. As necrosis and subsequent inflammation are implicated in tumor progression and malignancy, our results imply a potential improved efficacy of UDCA-combined chemotherapy in HCC by reducing inflammatory responses that may be triggered by oxaliplatin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375691>Synergistic neuroprotective effects of Geniposide and ursodeoxycholic acid in hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in SH-SY5Y cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and autophagy activation play important roles in the process of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The synergistic protective effects of Geniposide and ursodeoxycholic acid against cellular apoptosis caused by -glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD/R) were investigated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and western blotting to examine cellular viability, apoptosis, reactive  species (ROS) levels, mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in relation to ERS and autophagy. We found that pretreatment with Geniposide improved cellular viability. Moreover, treatment with a combination of Geniposide and  (TUDCA) (GT) protected injured cells better than Geniposide alone. Further studies showed that the increase in cellular ROS levels, and the overexpression of mRNA and proteins related to OGD/R-induced ERS and autophagy, were both counteracted by GT. Our study indicates that the protective effects of GT on OGD/R-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells are associated with the inhibition of ERS and autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407160>, a bile acid, promotes blood vessel repair by recruiting vasculogenic progenitor cells.</a></h2><p>Although serum bile acid concentrations are approximately 10 µM in healthy subjects, the crosstalk between the biliary system and vascular repair has never been investigated. In this study,  (TUDCA) induced dissociation of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from stromal cells by reducing adhesion molecule expression. TUDCA increased CD34(+) /Sca1(+) progenitors in mice peripheral blood (PB), and CD34(+) , CD31(+) , and c-kit(+) progenitors in human PB. In addition, TUDCA increased differentiation of CD34(+) HSCs into EPC lineage cells via Akt activation. EPC invasion was increased by TUDCA, which was mediated by fibroblast activating protein via Akt activation. Interestingly, TUDCA induced integration of EPCs into human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by increasing adhesion molecule expression. In the mouse hind limb ischemia model, TUDCA promoted blood perfusion by enhancing angiogenesis through recruitment of Flk-1(+) /CD34(+) and Sca-1(+) /c-kit(+) progenitors into damaged tissue. In GFP(+) bone marrow-transplanted hind limb ischemia, TUDCA induced recruitment of GFP(+) /c-kit(+) progenitors to the ischemic area, resulting in an increased blood perfusion ratio. Histological analysis suggested that GFP(+) progenitors mobilized from bone marrow, integrated into blood vessels, and differentiated into VEGFR(+) cells. In addition, TUDCA decreased cellular senescence by reducing levels of p53, p21, and reactive oxygen species and increased nitric oxide. Transplantation of TUDCA-primed senescent EPCs in hind limb ischemia significantly improved blood vessel regeneration, as compared with senescent EPCs. Our results suggested that TUDCA promoted neovascularization by enhancing the mobilization of stem/progenitor cells from bone marrow, their differentiation into EPCs, and their integration with preexisting endothelial cells.© 2014 AlphaMed Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20396375>Hyperglycaemia and diabetes impair gap junctional communication among astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Sensory and cognitive impairments have been documented in diabetic humans and animals, but the pathophysiology of diabetes in the central nervous system is poorly understood. Because a high glucose level disrupts gap junctional communication in various cell types and astrocytes are extensively coupled by gap junctions to form large syncytia, the influence of experimental diabetes on gap junction channel-mediated dye transfer was assessed in astrocytes in tissue culture and in brain slices from diabetic rats. Astrocytes grown in 15-25 mmol/l glucose had a slow-onset, poorly reversible decrement in gap junctional communication compared with those grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose. Astrocytes in brain slices from adult STZ (streptozotocin)-treated rats at 20-24 weeks after the onset of diabetes also exhibited reduced dye transfer. In cultured astrocytes grown in high glucose, increased oxidative stress preceded the decrement in dye transfer by several days, and gap junctional impairment was prevented, but not rescued, after its manifestation by compounds that can block or reduce oxidative stress. In sharp contrast with these findings, chaperone molecules known to facilitate protein folding could prevent and rescue gap junctional impairment, even in the presence of elevated glucose level and oxidative stress. Immunostaining of Cx (connexin) 43 and 30, but not Cx26, was altered by growth in high glucose. Disruption of astrocytic trafficking of metabolites and signalling molecules may alter interactions among astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells and contribute to changes in brain function in diabetes.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which particulate matter 2.5 (PM) induces damage in human HaCaT keratinocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts, and to evaluate the preventive capacity of the ginsenoside Rb1. PM induced oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation; this effect was inhibited by ginsenoside Rb1. Through gene silencing of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as , , , and , and through the use of the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA), it was demonstrated that PM-induced ER stress also causes apoptosis and ultimately leads to cell death; however, this phenomenon was reversed by ginsenoside Rb1. We also found that TUDCA partially restored the production of ATP that was inhibited by PM, and its recovery ability was significantly higher than that of ginsenoside Rb1, indicating that the process of ER stress leading to cell damage may also occur via the mitochondrial pathway. We concluded that ER stress acts alone or via the mitochondrial pathway in the induction of cell damage by PM, and that ginsenoside Rb1 blocks this process. Ginsenoside Rb1 shows potential for use in skin care products to protect the skin against damage by fine particles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23685124>Progressive stages of mitochondrial destruction caused by cell toxic bile salts.</a></h2><p>The cell-toxic bile salt glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) are responsible for hepatocyte demise in cholestatic liver diseases, while  (TUDCA) is regarded hepatoprotective. We demonstrate the direct mitochondrio-toxicity of bile salts which deplete the mitochondrial membrane potential and induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The bile salt mediated mechanistic mode of destruction significantly differs from that of calcium, the prototype MPT inducer. Cell-toxic bile salts initially bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Subsequently, the structure of the inner boundary membrane disintegrates. And it is only thereafter that the MPT is induced. This progressive destruction occurs in a dose- and time-dependent way. We demonstrate that GCDCA and TCDCA, but not TUDCA, preferentially permeabilize liposomes containing the mitochondrial membrane protein ANT, a process resembling the MPT induction in whole mitochondria. This suggests that ANT is one decisive target for toxic bile salts. To our knowledge this is the first report unraveling the consecutive steps leading to mitochondrial destruction by cell-toxic bile salts.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

MCP-1, an inflammatory chemokine, and MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP) are known to induce adipogenesis that causes increase in the number of adipocytes. Here we elucidate the intermediate processes through which MCPIP induces adipogenesis. Forced expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production and inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER), as indicated by expression of ER chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, and autophagy as indicated by expression of beclin-1 and cleavage of LC3. Treatment of ROS inhibitor, apocynin attenuated MCPIP induction of adipogenesis as measured by the induction of transcription factors involved in adipogenesis, adipocyte markers and  droplet accumulation. Inhibition of ER stress with taurursodeoxycholate or knockdown of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) inhibited MCPIP induced autophagy and adipogenesis. Preadipocytes in adipogenesis-inducing cocktail manifested ER stress and autophagy. Knockdown of MCPIP attenuated these effects.

At a concentration of 30 mumol/L, both chenodeoxycholate and lithocholate reduced state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. In contrast, ADP/O ratios of these substrates and oxidative metabolism of ascorbate were not significantly affected. Ursodeoxycholate did not impair mitochondrial oxidative metabolism up to concentrations of 100 mumol/L; at 300 mumol/L, however, it decreased state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. Tauroursodeoxycholate had no significant inhibitory effect on state 3 oxidation rates of L-glutamate and succinate at concentrations up to 300 mumol/L. When ursodeoxycholate (final concentration, 30 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) was added to mitochondrial incubations containing chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, the toxic effects of lipophilic bile acids on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were partially reversed. However, 300 mumol/L ursodeoxycholate, in combination with chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, exhibited greater toxicity compared with incubations containing only the individual bile acids. In contrast to ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate did not reduce the toxic effects of chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate on mitochondrial metabolism. Ursodeoxycholate (100 mumol/L) significantly decreased the incorporation of chenodeoxycholate into mitochondrial membranes, whereas the decrease in lithocholate incorporation was not statistically significant. These studies demonstrate that ursodeoxycholate, but not tauroursodeoxycholate, decreases the toxicity of lipophilic bile acids on the function of the electron but increases bile acid-induced mitochondrial toxicity at higher concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17768385>Cellular osmolytes reduce lens epithelial cell death and alleviate cataract formation in galactosemic rats.</a></h2><p>Many cataractogenic stresses also induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in lens epithelial cells (LECs), which appears to be one of the universal inducers of cell death. In galactosemic rats, activation of ER stress results in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-dependent death pathway, production of reactive  species (ROS), and cell death. All are induced and precede cataract formation. Cellular osmolytes such as 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and tauroursodeoxychoric acid (TUDCA) are known to suppress the induction of ER stress. We investigated whether these small molecules prevent cataract formation in galactose-fed rat lenses.Cultured LECs were treated with galactose and each cellular osmolyte. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a 50% galactose chow for 15 days with or without cellular osmolyte treatment. Similarly, selenite was injected subcutaneously into rats with or without cellular osmolytes. Calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD) were used to detect live and dead cells, respectively. The cellular osmolytes, PBA, TMAO, and TUDCA were tested for their ability to suppress LEC death and cataract formation.Cellular osmolytes rescued cultured human LECs which were treated with the ER stressors. We administered these osmolytes either orally or by injection into galactosemic Sprague-Dawley rats. These rats had significantly reduced LEC death and partially delayed hypermature cataract formation. Since the UPR was not activated in cultured LECs treated with selenite, we used the selenite nuclear cataract as a UPR-independent death pathway control. In selenite-induced nuclear cataract in rats, cellular osmolytes did not prevent LEC death and did not alleviate cataract formation.These results further establish that ER stress and LEC death play a vital role in certain types of cataract formation. In addition, cellular osmolytes may be potential prophylactic drugs for some types of cataracts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583715>Novel insights into the antioxidant role of  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Impaired mitochondrial function and generation of reactive oxygen species are deeply implicated in Parkinson's disease progression. Indeed, mutations in genes that affect mitochondrial function account for most of the familial cases of the disease, and post mortem studies in sporadic PD patients brains revealed increased signs of oxidative stress. Moreover, exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, leads to clinical symptoms similar to sporadic PD. The bile acid  (TUDCA) is an anti-apoptotic molecule shown to protect against MPTP-induced neurodegeneration in mice, but the mechanisms involved are still incompletely identified. Herein we used MPTP-treated mice, as well as primary cultures of mice cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP to investigate the modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction by TUDCA in PD models. We show that TUDCA exerts its neuroprotective role in a parkin-dependent manner.

Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved.  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy.

This study examined the influence of cardiac-specific overexpression of catalase, an antioxidant detoxifying H(2)O(2), on paraquat-induced myocardial geometric and functional alterations, with a focus on ER stress. FVB and catalase transgenic mice were administered paraquat for 48h. Myocardial geometry, contractile function, apoptosis, and ER stress were evaluated using echocardiography, edge detection, caspase-3 activity, and immunoblotting. Our results revealed that paraquat treatment significantly enlarged left ventricular (LV) end diastolic and systolic diameters; increased LV mass and resting myocyte length; reduced fractional shortening, cardiomyocyte peak shortening, and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening; and prolonged relengthening duration in the FVB group. Whereas the catalase transgene itself did not alter myocardial geometry and function, it mitigated or significantly attenuated paraquat-elicited myocardial geometric and functional changes. Paraquat promoted overt apoptosis and ER stress as evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity, apoptosis, and ER stress markers including Bax, Bcl-2, GADD153, calregulin, and phosphorylated JNK, IRE1α, and eIF2α; all were ablated by the catalase transgene. Paraquat-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was mitigated by the ER stress inhibitor . Moreover, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed paraquat-induced ER stress as evidenced by enhanced GADD153 and IRE1α phosphorylation. Taken together, these data revealed that catalase may rescue paraquat-induced myocardial geometric and functional alteration possibly by alleviating JNK-mediated ER stress.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16239214>Similar patterns of mitochondrial vulnerability and rescue induced by genetic modification of alpha-synuclein, parkin, and DJ-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>How genetic and environmental factors interact in Parkinson disease is poorly understood. We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing alpha-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin. In contrast, the genetic manipulations did not increase sensitivity to paraquat, sodium azide, divalent metal ions (Fe(II) or Cu(II)), or etoposide compared with the nontransgenic nematodes. Each of the PD-related lines was also partially rescued by the antioxidant probucol, the mitochondrial complex II activator, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, or the anti-apoptotic bile acid . Complete protection in all lines was achieved by combining d-beta-hydroxybutyrate with  but not with probucol. These results show that diverse PD-related genetic modifications disrupt the mitochondrial function in C. elegans, and they raise the possibility that mitochondrial disruption is a pathway shared in common by many types of familial PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721575>Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperon  Attenuates Aldosterone-Infused Renal Injury.</a></h2><p>Aldosterone (Aldo) is critically involved in the development of renal injury via the production of reactive  species and inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is also evoked in Aldo-induced renal injury. In the present study, we investigated the role of ER stress in inflammation-mediated renal injury in Aldo-infused mice. C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive treatment for 4 weeks as follows: vehicle infusion, Aldo infusion, vehicle infusion plus  (TUDCA), and Aldo infusion plus TUDCA. The effect of TUDCA on the Aldo-infused inflammatory response and renal injury was investigated using periodic acid-Schiff staining, real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. We demonstrate that Aldo leads to impaired renal function and inhibition of ER stress via TUDCA attenuates renal fibrosis. This was indicated by decreased collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and TGF- expression, as well as the downregulation of the expression of Nlrp3 inflammasome markers, Nlrp3, ASC, IL-1, and IL-18. This paper presents an important role for ER stress on the renal inflammatory response to Aldo. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by TUDCA negatively regulates the levels of these inflammatory molecules in the context of Aldo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593880>Role of endoplasmic reticulum stress on developmental competency and cryo-tolerance in bovine embryos.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a dysfunction in protein folding capacity of the ER, is involved in many physiological responses including mammalian reproductive systems. Studies have shown that ER stress interferes with the developmental process of in vitro oocyte maturation and embryo development; however, little is known about its effects on bovine preimplantation embryonic development. In this study, we examined the effects of ER stress during IVC on developmental competency and cryo-tolerance in bovine embryos. IVF-derived zygotes were cultured in CR1aa medium supplemented with  (TUDCA) and/or tunicamycin (TM), which are ER stress-inhibitory and stress-inducing agents, respectively, for 8 days. TM treatment decreased the blastocyst developmental rate and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to that in the control group (10.2 ± 2.3% vs. 39.75 ± 1.3% and 17.8 ± 1.2% vs. 3.6 ± 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.01). However, the blastocyst developmental rate was increased and the percentage of apoptotic cells was decreased by addition of TUDCA in IVC medium compared to that in the control group (50.9 ± 0.9% vs. 39.75 ± 1.3% and 1.13 ± 1.0% vs. 3.6 ± 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.01). Importantly, in the group treated with TM plus TUDCA, the developmental rate and the percentage of apoptotic cells in blastocysts were similar to that in the control group, indicating that TUDCA ameliorates the adverse effects of TM alone on embryo development. In addition, TUDCA treatment significantly reduced the reactive  species, expression of ER stress (GRP78, ATF4, ATF6, IER1, and sXBP1) and pro-apoptotic (CHOP and BAX) genes, while it increased anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene expression and glutathione levels. Moreover, TUDCA improved blastocyst cryo-tolerance as marked by a significantly increased hatching rate and decreased the number of apoptotic cells recorded at 48 h after a post-warming. Therefore, in concordance with a previous report in mice or pig, we showed that TUDCA supplementation during IVC increases the developmental competency of bovine in vitro-derived embryos. Additionally, we found that the presence of TUDCA in IVC medium improves the cryo-tolerance of bovine embryos. These results suggest that modulation of ER stress during IVC contributes to the production of high-quality bovine embryos in terms of cryo-tolerance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
