Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the , gluconeogenesis, and  pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was conducted on plasma metabolites of normal and model rats. Principal component analysis (PCA), differentiation analysis of supervised partial least squares method (PLS-DA), and orthogonal to partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on metabolomics data for multidimensional statistical analysis were employed, and the resulting biomarkers were screened. Compared to the normal group, there were 46 endogenous metabolites in blood stasis-rat plasma. Of these, 21 metabolites were significantly upregulated, such as acetylcholine, 6,6,6-trimethyl-L-lysine, cytosine, and acetylcarnitine, while 25 metabolites were reduced, including indoleacrylic , and lysoPC(14:0). These metabolites were mainly related to metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, galactose metabolism, linoleic  metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, , and  metabolism. In conclusion, these results indicated that metabolites could be used as important biomarkers for blood stasis syndrome, and could help in revealing the mechanism of blood stasis disease and provide a reference network to determine the disease development stage and appropriate follow-up treatment. Studying altered metabolites in blood stasis model rats can provide insights useful for the diagnosis of blood stasis in the clinic and for the development of drug therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049141>Supplementing Genistein for Breeder Hens Alters the Fatty  Metabolism and Growth Performance of Offsprings by Epigenetic Modification.</a></h2><p>The experiment was designed to clarify the effect and molecular mechanism of maternal genistein (GEN) on the lipid metabolism and developmental growth of offspring chicks. Laying broiler breeder (LBB) hens were supplemented with 40 mg/kg genistein (GEN), while the control group was fed with the low-soybean meal diet. The offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation with 8 replicates each. Hepatic transcriptome data revealed 3915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs,  adjusted < 0.05, fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.67) between chicks in the two groups. Maternal GEN activated the GH-IGF1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promoted the developmental processes and cellular amino  metabolic processes, as well as inhibited the apoptotic process. GEN treatment significantly increased the weight gain, breast muscle percentage, and liver index in chicks. PANTHER clustering analysis suggested that maternal GEN enhanced the antioxidant activity of chicks by the upregulation of gene (SOD3, MT1, and MT4) expression. Accordingly, the activities of T-AOC and T-SOD in the liver were increased after GEN treatment. The overrepresentation tests revealed that maternal GEN influenced the , unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A metabolism, lipid transport, and cholesterol metabolism in the chick livers. Hepatic cholesterol and long-chain fatty  were significantly decreased after GEN treatment. However, the level of  was higher in the livers of the GEN-treated group compared with the CON group. Moreover, GEN treatment enhanced fatty  -oxidation and upregulated PPAR expression in the chick liver. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that maternal GEN might induce histone H3-K36 trimethylation in the promoter region of PPAR gene (PPARD) through Iws1, methyltransferases. It also induced histone H4-K12 acetylation at the PPARD promoter through MYST2, which activated the PPAR signaling pathways in the chick livers. In summary, supplementing LBB hens with GEN can alter lipid metabolism in the offspring chicks through epigenetic modification and improve the antioxidative capability as well as growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30914513>Biphasic Dynamics of Macrophage Immunometabolism during  Infection.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are the primary targets of  infection; the early events of macrophage interaction with  define subsequent progression and outcome of infection.  can alter the innate immunity of macrophages, resulting in suboptimal Th1 immunity, which contributes to the survival, persistence, and eventual dissemination of the pathogen. Recent advances in immunometabolism illuminate the intimate link between the metabolic states of immune cells and their specific functions. In this review, we describe the little-studied biphasic metabolic dynamics of the macrophage response during progression of infection by  and discuss their relevance to macrophage immunity and  pathogenicity. The early phase of macrophage infection, which is marked by M1 polarization, is accompanied by a metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)-mediated aerobic  (also known as the Warburg effect in cancer cells), as well as by an upregulation of pathways involving oxidative and antioxidative defense responses, arginine metabolism, and synthesis of bioactive lipids. These early metabolic changes are followed by a late adaptation/resolution phase in which macrophages transition from  to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, with a consequent dampening of macrophage proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Importantly, the identification of upregulated metabolic pathways and/or metabolic regulatory mechanisms with immunomodulatory functions during M1 polarization has revealed novel mechanisms of  pathogenicity. These advances can lead to the development of novel host-directed therapies to facilitate bacterial clearance in tuberculosis by targeting the metabolic state of immune cells.Copyright © 2019 Shi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970255>Tricarboxylic  Cycle Activity and Remodeling of Glycerophosphocholine Lipids Support Cytokine Induction in Response to Fungal Patterns.</a></h2><p>Increased  parallels immune cell activation, but the role of pyruvate remains largely unexplored. We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and acetate rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty  remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic metabolism during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Of these three subtypes, only the α1A and α1B are expressed in the heart. Multiple pre-clinical models of heart injury demonstrate cardioprotective roles for the α1A.

Cardiac tissue and serum were analyzed using a non-targeted metabolomics approach.We identified previously unrecognized metabolic responses to α1A activation, most notably broad reduction in the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and endocannabinoids (ECs).Given the well characterized roles of PUFAs and ECs in inflammatory pathways, these findings suggest a possible role for cardiac α1A-ARs in the regulation of inflammation and may offer novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective benefit of selective pharmacologic α1A activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195667>Metabolomic Investigation of β-Thalassemia in Chorionic Villi Samples.</a></h2><p>Beta-thalassemias are blood disorders characterized by poorly understood clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to severe anemia. Metabolic composition of the human placenta could be affected by the presence of pathological states such as β-thalassemia. The aim of our study was to describe metabolic changes in chorionic villi samples of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia compared to a control group by applying a metabolomics approach.Chorionic villi samples were differentiated according to the genetic diagnosis of β-thalassemia: control (Group 1,  = 27); heterozygous (Group 2,  = 7); homozygous (Group 3,  = 7). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolic composition of the samples. Subsequently, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was performed. The discriminant metabolites were used to identify the altered pathways.Supervised multivariate models were devised to compare the groups. The model resulting from the comparison between Group 1 and Group 3 was the most significant. Discriminant metabolites were identified, and the most altered pathways were as follows: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),  metabolism, , and gluconeogenesis, suggesting the presence of an energetic shift toward the PPP and the presence of oxidative stress in β-thalassemia chorionic villi samples.The metabolomics approach identified a specific metabolic fingerprint in chorionic villi of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I. Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h2><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with  and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling,  metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Liver fibrosis is a consequence of chronic liver lesion, which can progress into liver cirrhosis even hepatocarcinoma. However, the toxicological mechanisms of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis remain not fully understood. We combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis and biological network technology, predicted toxicological targets and regulatory networks of CCl4 in liver fibrosis. Wistar rats were treated with CCl4 for 9 weeks. Histopathological changes, hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents, serum ALT and AST in the CCl4-treated group were significantly higher than that of CCl4-untreated group. CCl4-treated and -untreated liver tissues were examined by microarray and iTRAQ. The results showed that 3535 genes (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.05) and 1412 proteins (fold change ≥ 1.2, P < 0.05) were differentially expressed. Moreover, the integrative analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data showed 523 overlapped proteins, enriched in 182 GO terms including oxidation reduction, response to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, extracellular matrix organization, etc. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 36 pathways including retinol metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, /gluconeogenesis,  metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and drug metabolism. Network of protein-protein interaction (PPI) and key function with their related targets were performed and the degree of network was calculated with Cytoscape. The expression of key targets such as CYP4A3, ALDH2 and ALDH7A1 decreased after CCl4 treatment. Therefore, the toxicological mechanisms of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis may be related with multi biological process, pathway and targets which may provide potential protection reaction mechanism for CCl4 detoxication in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27303373>Microbiome-Metabolome Responses in the Cecum and Colon of Pig to a High Resistant Starch Diet.</a></h2><p>Currently, knowledge about the impact of long-term intake of high resistant starch diet on pig hindgut microbiota and metabolite profile is limited. In this study, a combination of the pyrosequencing and the mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques were used to investigate the effects of a raw potato starch (RPS, high in resistant starch) diet on microbial composition and microbial metabolites in the hindgut of pig. The results showed that Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter increased significantly, while Sarcina and Clostridium decreased in relative abundances in the hindgut of pigs fed RPS. The metabolimic analysis revealed that RPS significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolites, amino  turnover or protein biosynthesis, lipid metabolites, , the pentose phosphate pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, a Pearson's correlation analysis showed that Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate, maltose, , 9, 12-octadecadienoic , oleic , phosphate, but negatively correlated with α-aminobutyric . However, the correlation of Clostridium and Sarcina with these compounds was in the opposite direction.

We sought to evaluate the placenta-specific effect of AMPK activation on the handling of nutrients required for fetal development.Explants were isolated from term placenta of 29 women (pregravid body mass index: 29.1 ± 9.9 kg/m) and incubated for 24 hours with 0 to 100 µmol/L resveratrol or 0 to 1 mmol/L of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). Following treatment, uptake and metabolism of radiolabeled fatty acids and glucose were measured. Phosphorylation of AMPK was measured by Western blotting. Adenosine diphosphate (ATP) production was assessed using the mitochondrial ToxGlo assay kit.

The limma package in R was applied to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the Survival package and KMsurv package in R were used to screen disease free survival time related genes (prognosis genes). Then, based on latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA), latent pathways were identified, and pathway-pathway interaction network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape. Based on the expression values of 8284 genes in 126 chips, 2796 DEGs and 353 prognosis genes were screened out. After overlapping DEGs and prognosis genes, 75 key genes were identified, which were most significantly enriched in 25 GO functions and chronic myeloid leukemia pathway. For the 75 key genes, 27 disease risk sub-pathways were identified, and HK3, HNMT, SULT2B1, KYNU, and PTGS2 were the significant key genes which were enriched in these sub-pathways. Furthermore, based on pathway-pathway interaction analysis, HK3 and PTGS2 were predicted as the most important genes.

Dendritic cells (DCs) disintegrate these compartments, thereby eliminating the microbes, through auto/xenophagy, which also promotes chlamydial antigen presentation via MHC I. Here, we show that TNF-α controls this pathway by driving cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA)2-mediated  (AA) production. AA then impairs mitochondrial function, which disturbs the development and integrity of these energy-dependent parasitic inclusions, while a simultaneous metabolic switch towards aerobic  promotes DC survival. Tubulin deacetylase/autophagy regulator HDAC6 associates with disintegrated inclusions, thereby further disrupting their subcellular localisation and stability. Bacterial remnants are decorated with defective mitochondria, mito-aggresomal structures, and components of the ubiquitin/autophagy machinery before they are degraded via mito-xenophagy. The mechanism depends on cytoprotective HSP25/27, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and HDAC6 and promotes chlamydial antigen generation for presentation on MHC I.

Summary data were derived from a large-scale GWAS of ALS, involving 12577 cases and 23475 controls. The eQTL annotation dataset included 923,021 cis-eQTL for 14,329 genes and 4732 trans-eQTL for 2612 genes. Genome-wide single gene expression association analysis was conducted by SMR software.

Here we report an integral analysis on the role of both energy pathways in human platelets activated by several agonists, and the signal transducing mechanisms associated with such activation. We found that thrombin, Trap-6, , collagen, A23187, epinephrine and ADP significantly increased glycolytic flux (3-38 times vs. non-activated platelets) whereas ristocetin was ineffective. OxPhos (33 times) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (88%) were increased only by thrombin. OxPhos was the main source of ATP in thrombin-activated platelets, whereas in platelets activated by any of the other agonists,  was the principal ATP supplier. In order to establish the biochemical mechanisms involved in the thrombin-induced OxPhos activation in platelets, several signaling pathways associated with mitochondrial activation were analyzed. Wortmannin and LY294002 (PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors), ristocetin and heparin (GPIb inhibitors) as well as resveratrol, ATP (calcium-release inhibitors) and PP1 (Tyr-phosphorylation inhibitor) prevented the thrombin-induced platelet activation.

However, the potential mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of TC at the metabonomics level is still not clear. The present study focused on the effects of TC on metabonomics in a stroke model. Rats were divided randomly into sham, model, and TC groups. Rats in the TC group were intragastrically administered with TC for 7 days after a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. The sham and the model groups received vehicle for the same length of time. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of TC were examined by evaluation of neurological defects, assessment of infarct volume, and identification of biochemical indicators for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Further, metabonomics technology was employed to evaluate the endogenous metabolites profiling systematically. Consist with the results of biochemical and histopathological assays, pattern recognition analysis showed a clear separation of the model group and the sham group, indicating the recovery impact of TC on the MCAO rats. Moreover, 12 potential biomarkers were identified in the MCAO model group, involving energy (lactic , succinic , and fumarate), amino acids (leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine), and glycerophospholipid (PC [16:0/20:4], PC [20:4/20:4], LysoPC [18:0], and LysoPC [16:0]) metabolism, as well as other types of metabolism ( and palmitoylcarnitine).

Diet supplemented with 0.30%  (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation,  and gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that dietary ARA has a fat reducing role, and tends to retard adipocyte development and attenuate chronic inflammation based on these adipose transcript expression results in grass carp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Further study of metabolic changes with the relevant pathways demonstrated that the levels of several intermediate metabolites in relation to central carbon metabolism changed remarkably via both processes and citrate and malate was supposed to play vital roles in polyunsaturated  (PUFA) synthesis. Increase of myo-inositol and sorbitol were probably for osmo-regulation and redox balance, while enhanced phosphoric  and pyroglutamic  were supposed to have function in the activation of signal transduction pathway for stress resistance. The present study provides a novel insight into the metabolic responses of M. alpina to aeration rates and the metabolic characteristics during the ARA fermentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287882>Fatty acids modulate the expression of pyruvate kinase and arachidonate-lipoxygenase through PPARγ/CYP2C45 pathway: a link to goose fatty liver.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P-450 2C45 (CYP2C45) is the most highly expressed cytochrome P-450 isoform in chicken liver, and may play an important role in avian liver biology. However, information regarding the function of CYP2C45 in fatty liver is generally limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP2C45 during the development of goose fatty liver. Our result indicated that the transcription of CYP2C45, together with PK and ALOX5, was increased in goose liver upon overfeeding for 19 D (P < 0.05). In goose primary hepatocytes, CYP2C45 RNA expression was also upgraded by the treatment with various chemicals like insulin, the fatty acids, and PPAR agonists (P < 0.05). We also found that both CYP2C45 overexpression and troglitazone treatment could increase the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and furthermore, showed that the up-regulation of PK and ALOX5 induced by troglitazone could be suppressed by small interfering RNAs targeting CYP2C45 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that fatty acids treatment and the overfeeding can induce the up-regulation of CYP2C45 expression possibly via PPARγ and that the induction of PK and ALOX5 in goose fatty liver is at least partially attributed to fatty -induced expression of CYP2C45. Thus, our data provides an insight into the mechanism by which  and  metabolism are modulated in goose fatty liver.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083889>Antischistosomal Properties of Sclareol and Its Heck-Coupled Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Untargeted Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Sclareol, a plant-derived diterpenoid widely used as a fragrance and flavoring substance, is well-known for its promising antimicrobial and anticancer properties. However, its activity on helminth parasites has not been previously reported. Here, we show that sclareol is active against larval (IC ≈ 13 μM), juvenile (IC = 5.0 μM), and adult (IC = 19.3 μM) stages of , a parasitic trematode responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Microwave-assisted synthesis of Heck-coupled derivatives improved activity, with the substituents choice guided by the Matsy decision tree. The most active derivative  showed improved potency and selectivity on larval (IC ≈ 2.2 μM, selectivity index (SI) ≈ 22 in comparison to HepG2 cells), juvenile (IC = 1.7 μM, SI = 28.8), and adult schistosomes (IC = 9.4 μM, SI = 5.2). Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that compound  induced blebbing of the adult worm surface at sublethal concentration (12.5 μM); moreover, the compound inhibited egg production at the lowest concentration tested (3.13 μM). The observed phenotype and data obtained by untargeted metabolomics suggested that compound  affects membrane lipid homeostasis by interfering with  metabolism. The same methodology applied to praziquantel (PZQ)-treated worms revealed sugar metabolism alterations that could be ascribed to the previously reported action of PZQ on serotonin signaling and/or effects on . Importantly, our data suggest that compound  and PZQ exert different antischistosomal activities. More studies will be necessary to confirm the generated hypothesis and to progress the development of more potent antischistosomal sclareol derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875958>Metabolic plasticity in resting and thrombin activated platelets.</a></h2><p>Platelet thrombus formation includes several integrated processes involving aggregation, secretion of granules, release of  and clot retraction, but it is not clear which metabolic fuels are required to support these events. We hypothesized that there is flexibility in the fuels that can be utilized to serve the energetic and metabolic needs for resting and thrombin-dependent platelet aggregation. Using platelets from healthy human donors, we found that there was a rapid thrombin-dependent increase in oxidative phosphorylation which required both glutamine and fatty acids but not glucose. Inhibition of fatty  oxidation or glutamine utilization could be compensated for by increased glycolytic flux. No evidence for significant mitochondrial dysfunction was found, and ATP/ADP ratios were maintained following the addition of thrombin, indicating the presence of functional and active mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation during the early stages of aggregation. Interestingly, inhibition of fatty  oxidation and glutaminolysis alone or in combination is not sufficient to prevent platelet aggregation, due to compensation from , whereas inhibitors of  inhibited aggregation approximately 50%. The combined effects of inhibitors of  and oxidative phosphorylation were synergistic in the inhibition of platelet aggregation. In summary, both  and oxidative phosphorylation contribute to platelet metabolism in the resting and activated state, with fatty  oxidation and to a smaller extent glutaminolysis contributing to the increased energy demand.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518347>Dietary genistein supplementation in laying broiler breeder hens alters the development and metabolism of offspring embryos as revealed by hepatic transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Genistein (GEN) is a type of isoflavone mainly derived from soy products. In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the  process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty  () in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty  β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.
