(PL). PL aerial part has proven to exert antioxidant, photoprotective and immunomodulatory activities; its mechanism of action is complex and includes several activities: (1) PL diminishes the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS); (2) PL inhibits the photoisomerization of trans- (t-UCA); (3) PL inhibits apoptosis induced by ultraviolet radiation; (4) PL prevents damage to genetic material and (5) PL enhances DNA repair. PL is not mutagenic and does not induce acute or chronic toxicity. Its biological effects have been proved in cell cultures, animal models, murine models and in human beings. Photoprotective activity has been assessed in healthy volunteers as well as in patients suffering from several cutaneous diseases such as vitiligo, psoriasis, idiopathic photodermatosis or melasma. PL results to be an efficient treatment especially for sensitive cutaneous phototypes and adds extra protection when ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure cannot be avoided, such as wide or narrow band UVB phototherapy or treatment with psoralens plus UVA exposure radiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30128639>Metabolomics analysis of Pseudomonas chlororaphis JK12 algicidal activity under aerobic and micro-aerobic culture condition.</a></h2><p>Utilization of algicidal bacteria as a biological agent have been receiving significant interest for controlling harmful algal blooms. While various algicidal bacterial strains have been identified, limited studies have explored the influence of bacterial culture conditions on its algicidal activity. Here, the effect of  on the algicidal activity of a novel bacterium JK12, against a model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P. tricornutum) was studied. Strain JK12 showed high algicidal activity against P. tricornutum and was identified as Pseudomonas chlororaphis (P. chlororaphis) by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis. JK12 culture supernatant exhibited strong algicidal activity while washed JK12 cells showed no obvious activity, indicating that JK12 indirectly attacks algae by secreting extracellular algicidal metabolites. Micro-aerobic culture condition dramatically enhanced the algicidal activity of JK12 by 50%, compared to that cultured under aerobic condition in 24 h. Extracellular metabolomic profiling of JK12 using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significantly higher amounts of allantoic , , cytidine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, uridine 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, and chlorinated tryptophan in the micro-aerobic culture. This is the first report to demonstrate the important role of  on the algicidal activity of a non-pathogenic strain P. chlororaphis. In addition, the metabolomics analysis provided insights into the algicidal mechanism of P. chlororaphis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842770>Benefits of controlled ultraviolet radiation in the treatment of dermatological diseases.</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is a second-line treatment modality for the most common dermatoses that is safe and effective. Most phototherapy regimens denote the use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation of different wavelengths in the management of several dermatoses. Currently, irradiations with broadband UVB (290-320 nm), narrowband UVB (311-313 nm), 308 nm excimer laser, UVA 1 (340-400 nm), UVA with psoralen (PUVA), and extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis) are being used. Beneficial effects of UV radiation are far from being completely understood. Dermatoses that may benefit from such approach are numerous, with psoriasis, parapsoriasis, atopic dermatitis, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, morphea, and vitiligo vulgaris as main indications. UVB radiation primarily acts on cells at the epidermis and the epidermodermal junction, while UVA radiation affects epidermal and dermal components, especially blood vessels. UVradiation has im- mediate and delayed effects. Immediate effects are the formation of DNA photoproducts and DNA damage leading to apoptosis of heratinocytes, Langerhans cells, activated T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mast-cells, cell membrane damage by lipid peroxidation, and isomerization of chromophores such as . Delayed effects include synthesis of prostaglandins and cytokines that play important roles in immune suppression. Systemic and local immune suppression, alteration in cytokine expression (induction of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, decrease in IL-2, increase in IL-IO, IL-15), and cell cycle arrest may all contribute to the suppression of disease activity. PUVA is a form of controlled and repeated induction of phototoxic reactions which uses UVA light to activate chemicals known as psoralens. The conjunction of psoralens with epidermal DNA inhibits DNA synthesis and causes cell apoptosis. PUVA also causes an alteration in the expression of cytokines and cytokine receptors. Psoralens interact with RNA, proteins and other cellular components and indirectly modify proteins and lipids via singlet -mediated reactions or by generating of free radicals. Psoralens and UV radiation also stimulate melanogenesis with variable effects in patients with vitiligo vulgaris. Extracorporealphotopheresis is treatment modality used in management of erythrodermic cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. It is very potent in induction of lymphocyte apoptosis. Despite the introduction of numerous potent bioengineered systemic medications in the field of dermatology, phototherapy remains established, and often preferred, option for the most common dermatoses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412785>Phototherapy and photochemotherapy for psoriasis.</a></h2><p>Phototherapy is a first-line option for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Systematic reviews indicate near comparable efficacy of the different forms of phototherapy. Localized phototherapy can be an adjunctive treatment of recalcitrant plaques during systemic treatment of psoriasis. More than 200 psoralen-UV-A therapy treatment sessions is associated with an increased risk of keratinocytic cancers, whereas no increased risk has been demonstrated for narrow-band UV-B therapy. The mechanism of action of phototherapy in psoriasis is via inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation; induction of apoptosis in keratinocytes, dendritic, and T cells; and inhibition of Th1 and Th17 , but activation of Th2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589005>Prevention of Photocarcinogenesis by Agonists of 5-HT1A and Antagonists of 5-HT2A Receptors.</a></h2><p>Exposure to UV radiation is the principal cause of nonmelanoma skin cancer, a process in which serotonin (5-HT) is intimately involved. This review focuses on the potential of serotonin receptors, namely 5-HT1/2A, as therapeutic targets for prevention of photocarcinogenesis. UV-induced immunosuppression is triggered by a cascade of events initiated when cis-, a UV photoreceptor present in the skin, binds to the serotonin receptor. Serotonin receptor antagonists will therefore attempt to block this association, and in turn, prevent skin cancer induction. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor antagonists are also capable of regulating DNA repair, including the acceleration of nucleotide excision repair. At the same time, UV-induced formation of reactive oxygen species is also reduced by these agents. Since the involvement of serotonin in photocarcinogenesis process is somewhat underexplored as a pertinent therapeutic effect, this review intends to reveal the use of serotonergic drugs as an important strategy to prevent and/or inhibit photocarcinogenesis. Considering the emergency of developing novel therapeutic strategies for skin cancer management, the use of these agents, whose benefits have partially been studied, may be crucial especially if topically applied. Topical nanoformulations containing serotonin receptor agonists and/or antagonists also represent a pioneer concept in this area. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.</p></html>
