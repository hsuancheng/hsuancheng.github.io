However, the exact mechanism by which bile acid therapy confers protection from colitogenesis is currently unknown. Since the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and exogenous bile acid administration may affect the community structure of the microbiota, we examined the impact of the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its taurine or glycine conjugates on the fecal microbial community structure during experimental . Daily oral administration of UDCA,  (TUDCA), or glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) equally lowered the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced  in mice, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss, colonic shortening, and expression of inflammatory cytokines. Illumina sequencing demonstrated that bile acid therapy during  did not restore fecal bacterial richness and diversity. However, bile acid therapy normalized the -associated increased ratio of  to  Interestingly, administration of bile acids prevented the loss of  cluster XIVa and increased the abundance of , bacterial species known to be particularly decreased in IBD patients. We conclude that UDCA, which is an FDA-approved drug for cholestatic liver disorders, could be an attractive treatment option to reduce dysbiosis and ameliorate inflammation in human IBD. Secondary bile acids are emerging as attractive candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Although bile acids may affect the intestinal microbial community structure, which significantly contributes to the course of these inflammatory disorders, the impact of bile acid therapy on the fecal microbiota during  has not yet been considered. Here, we studied the alterations in the fecal microbial abundance in colitic mice following the administration of secondary bile acids. Our results show that secondary bile acids reduce the severity of  and ameliorate -associated fecal dysbiosis at the phylum level. This study indicates that secondary bile acids might act as a safe and effective drug for inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084077>Accumulation of HLA-DR4 in Colonic Epithelial Cells Causes Severe  in Homozygous HLA-DR4 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Homozygous HLA-DR4/I-E transgenic mice (tgm) spontaneously developed  similar to human ulcerative . We explored whether endoplasmic reticulum stress in colonic epithelial cells due to overexpression of HLA-DR4/I-E was involved in the pathogenesis of .Major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator-knockout (CIITAKO) background tgm were established to test the involvement of HLA-DR4/I-E expression in the pathogenesis of . Histological and cellular analyses were performed and the effect of oral administration of the molecular chaperone  (TUDCA) and antibiotics were investigated. IgA content of feces and serum and presence of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were also investigated.Aberrantly accumulated HLA-DR4/I-E molecules in colonic epithelial cells were observed only in the colitic homozygous tgm, which was accompanied by upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and reduced mucus. Homozygous tgm with CIITAKO, and thus absent of HLA-DR4/I-E expression, did not develop . Oral administration of TUDCA to homozygotes reduced HLA-DR4/I-E and BiP expression in colonic epithelial cells and restored the barrier function of the intestinal tract. The IgA content of feces and serum, and numbers of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were higher in the colitic tgm, and antibiotic administration suppressed the expression of HLA-DR4/I-E and .The pathogenesis of the  observed in the homozygous tgm was likely due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in goblet cell damage and compromised mucus production in the colonic epithelial cells in which HLA-DR4/I-E molecules were heavily accumulated. Commensal bacteria seemed to be involved in the accumulation of HLA-DR4/I-E, leading to development of the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179450>Tauroursodeoxycholate improves 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced experimental acute ulcerative  in mice.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  is a chronic nonspecific inflammatory disease of unknown cause. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of tauroursodeoxycholate in 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced experimental  in mice. After the induction of  for 24h, the mice were administrated orally with tauroursodeoxycholate (20, 40 and 60mg/kg) and sulfasalazine (500mg/kg) by gavage for 7 consecutive days. The inhibition effects were evaluated by the body of weight change, survival rate, macroscopical and histological evaluations. Besides, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in colon tissue were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with different doses of tauroursodeoxycholate (20, 40 and 60mg/kg) significantly improved the body weight change, decreased the macroscopic and histopathological scores. Compared with the model group, the accumulation of MPO activity, the colonic tissue levels of IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α were significantly reduced in the tauroursodeoxycholate treated groups. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholate assuaged the symptoms of . These results suggested that tauroursodeoxycholate has an anti-inflammatory effect in TNBS-induced ulcerative  in mice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether  (TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental , we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378164> attenuates -associated colon cancer by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB signaling.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases is associated with an increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer. However, the mechanism of immune signaling pathways linked to -associated cancer (CAC) has not been fully elucidated.  (TUDCA) exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TUDCA in the pathogenesis of CAC.-associated cancer was induced in mice using azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate administration, and TUDCA's effect on tumor development was evaluated. HCT 116 and COLO 205 were treated with TUDCA or vehicle and then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation was evaluated by immunoblot assay. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell viability assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF were performed. significantly attenuated the development of CAC in mice. Exposure to TUDCA resulted in extensive epithelial apoptosis and reduced levels of phospho-IκB kinase in the colon. In HCT 116 cells stimulated with TNF-α, TUDCA significantly inhibited IL-8 and IL-1α expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, in both HCT 116 and COLO 205 cells, TUDCA reduced cell viability and downregulated the expression of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF.These results demonstrated that TUDCA suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates -associated tumorigenesis, suggesting that TUDCA could be a potential treatment for CAC.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p></html>
