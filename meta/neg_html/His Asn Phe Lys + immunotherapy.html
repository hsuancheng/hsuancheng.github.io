The search for peptides with GMDP-like adjuvant activity was performed using highly specific monoclonal antibodies against GMDP and combinatorial peptide libraries in the format of phage display. Various elution methods were used for the immunoaffinity enrichment of the libraries during the course of the preparation of highly active and specific peptides. A sole peptide (Arg-Val-Pro-Pro-Arg-Tyr--Ala--Ile-Ser-Pro-Met-Val-, RN) was obtained by the elution of phage particles from the immunosorbent with a 1 -microM solution of the natural ligand (GMDP). Elution with a buffer with a low pH value (0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2) gave two other peptides: Ser-Gly-Arg-Val-Ala-Val-Ser-Pro-Asp-Ser-Pro-Leu--Tyr-Pro (SP) and Arg-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Ser-Val-Leu--Ile-Glu-Cys-Gln--Tyr-Gly (RG). Affinity constants for the RN and SP peptides proved to be 3.6 x 10(8) and 3.5 x 10(8) M(-1), respectively. The specificity of the interaction with the monoclonal antibodies was checked by the competitive displacement of the peptides from the antigen-antibody complex by GMDP. The RN peptide exhibited adjuvant activity similar to that of GMDP, but had no pyrogenic effect characteristic of GMDP. The described method could be used for the search for mimetics of biologically active low-molecular compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/66284>Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat: farther delineation of active sites in guinea pig and bovine myelin basic proteins.</a></h2><p>Highly encephalitogenic peptide (37-88), derived from the guinea pig myelin basic protein by peptic digestion, was treated chemically to destroy its tyrosyl and histidyl residues and enzymatically to remove its C-terminal sequence Val--. Neither of the modifications resulted in loss of activity in Lewis rats. The enccephalitogenic region within peptide (37-88) was located by examination of derivative peptides obtained by selective proteolytic cleavage. The results showed that peptide (61-88), like peptide (43-88), was fully active at the level of 0.02 nmole whereas peptides (72-88) and (72-84) were fully active at levels of 0.5 and 2.5 nmole, respectively. In contrast, peptides (43-71) and (75-88) were completely inactive. These results demonstrated that the undecapeptide Gln--Ser-Gln-Arg-Ser-Gln-Asp-Glu--Pro (residues 72-84), although not as encephalitogenic as peptides (43-88) or (61-88), does contain the elements essential for the induction of disease. At the levels tested (10.8 and 2.2 nmole) only peptides (43-88) and (61-88) were capable of inhibiting the induciton of disease by passively transferred lymph node cells; this inhibition, however, was less than that achieved by the intact guinea pig basic protein. Further studies on the encephalitogenicity of the bovine basic protein in Lewis rats demonstrated that the active site in the C-terminal half of this protein is present in its entirety within residues 89 to 115.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11018763>Production and characterization of specific antibodies for evaluation of glycated insulin in plasma and biological tissues.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that glycation of insulin occurs in pancreatic beta-cells under conditions of hyperglycaemia and that the site of glycation is the N-terminal (1) of the insulin B-chain. To enable evaluation of glycated insulin in diabetes, specific antibodies were raised in rabbits and guinea-pigs by using two synthetic peptides (A: -Val--Gln--Leu-Cys-Tyr, and B: -Val--Gln--Leu-Tyr-) modified by N-terminal glycation and corresponding closely to the N-terminal sequence of the glycated human insulin B-chain. For immunization, the glycated peptides were conjugated either to keyhole limpet haemocyanin or ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. Antibody titration curves, obtained using I(125)-tyrosylated tracer prepared from glycated peptide A, revealed high-titre antisera in five groups of animals immunized for 8-28 weeks. The highest titres were observed in rabbits and guinea-pigs immunized with peptide B coupled to ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde. Under radioimmunoassay conditions, these antisera exhibited effective dose (median) (ED(50)) values for glycated insulin of 0.3-15 ng/ml and 0.9-2.5 ng/ml respectively, with negligible cross-reactivity against insulin or other islet peptides. The degree of cross-reaction with glycated proinsulin was approximately 50%. Glycated insulin in plasma of control and hydrocortisone-treated diabetic rats measured using rabbit 3 antiserum (1:10 000 dilution; sensitivity <19 pg/ml) was 0. 08+/-0.01 and 1.5+/-0.6 ng/ml (P<0.01), corresponding to 4 and 16% of total circulating insulin concentration respectively. Immunocytochemistry studies of the pancreas of streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats using a 1:1000 dilution of guinea-pig 2 antiserum revealed clusters of fluorescent positively stained cells in islets. These studies document the successful production of polyclonal antisera specific for glycated insulin and their usefulness in radioimmunoassays and immunocytochemistry. The demonstration of glycated insulin in plasma and islets of animal models of diabetes supports the view that glycation of insulin is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p></html>
