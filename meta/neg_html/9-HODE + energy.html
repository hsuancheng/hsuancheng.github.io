A possible mechanism is through a decrease in lipid peroxidation (LPO); however, evidence linking the Mediterranean diet with lower LPO in premenopausal women is sparse.We investigated whether adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower LPO concentrations in premenopausal women.Two hundred fifty-nine healthy women aged 18-44 y were followed for ≤ 2 menstrual cycles. Plasma concentrations of F(2)-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF2α), 9-hydroxyoctadecadieneoic acid (), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured ≤ 8 times per cycle at visits scheduled by using fertility monitors. Diet was assessed ≤ 4 times per cycle by using 24-h dietary recalls. The alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED) (range: 0-9) was calculated on the basis of intake of vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, whole grains, red and processed meat, fish, and alcohol and the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat.A 1-unit increase in aMED was associated with a 4.50% decrease in 8-iso-PGF2α concentrations (95% CI: -6.32%, -2.65%) and a 14.01% decrease in  concentrations (95% CI: -17.88%, -9.96%) after adjustment for  intake, age, race, body mass index, plasma ascorbic acid, and serum cholesterol. No significant association was observed between aMED and TBARS. A 1-unit increase in aMED was associated with a 1.39% increase (95% CI: 0.07%, 2.72%) in plasma ascorbic acid concentrations.Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower LPO and higher ascorbic acid concentrations. These results confirm that decreased LPO is a plausible mechanism linking a Mediterranean diet to reduced cardiovascular disease risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760997>Metabolomics approach to assessing plasma 13- and 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid and linoleic acid metabolite responses to 75-km cycling.</a></h2><p>Bioactive oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) include 13- and 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE + ) and have been linked to oxidative stress, , and numerous pathological and physiological states. The purpose of this study was to measure changes in plasma 13-HODE +  following a 75-km cycling bout and identify potential linkages to linoleate metabolism and established biomarkers of oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes) and  (cytokines) using a metabolomics approach. Trained male cyclists (N = 19, age 38.0 ± 1.6 yr, wattsmax 304 ± 10.5) engaged in a 75-km cycling time trial on their own bicycles using electromagnetically braked cycling ergometers (2.71 ± 0.07 h). Blood samples were collected preexercise, immediately post-, 1.5 h post-, and 21 h postexercise, and analyzed for plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), F2-isoprostanes, and shifts in metabolites using global metabolomics procedures with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). 13-HODE +  increased 3.1-fold and 1.7-fold immediately post- and 1.5 h postexercise (both P < 0.001) and returned to preexercise levels by 21-h postexercise. Post-75-km cycling plasma levels of 13-HODE +  were not significantly correlated with increases in plasma cytokines but were positively correlated with postexercise F2-isoprostanes (r = 0.75, P < 0.001), linoleate (r = 0.54, P = 0.016), arachidate (r = 0.77, P < 0.001), 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoate (12,13-DiHOME) (r = 0.60, P = 0.006), dihomo-linolenate (r = 0.57, P = 0.011), and adrenate (r = 0.56, P = 0.013). These findings indicate that prolonged and intensive exercise caused a transient, 3.1-fold increase in the stable linoleic acid oxidation product 13-HODE +  and was related to increases in F2-isoprostanes, linoleate, and fatty acids in the linoleate conversion pathway. These data support the use of 13-HODE +  as an oxidative stress biomarker in acute exercise investigations.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595524>Nutrigenomics approach elucidates health-promoting effects of high vegetable intake in lean and obese men.</a></h2><p>We aimed to explore whether vegetable consumption according to guidelines has beneficial health effects determined with classical biomarkers and nutrigenomics technologies. Fifteen lean (age 36 ± 7 years; BMI 23.4 ± 1.7 kg m(-2)) and 17 obese (age 40 ± 6 years; BMI 30.3 ± 2.4 kg m(-2)) men consumed 50- or 200-g vegetables for 4 weeks in a randomized, crossover trial. Afterward, all subjects underwent 4 weeks of  restriction (60 % of normal  intake). Despite the limited weight loss of 1.7 ± 2.4 kg for the lean and 2.1 ± 1.9 kg for the obese due to  restriction, beneficial health effects were found, including lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HbA1c concentrations. The high vegetable intake resulted in increased levels of plasma amino acid metabolites, decreased levels of  and prostaglandin D3 and decreased levels of ASAT and ALP compared to low vegetable intake. Adipose tissue gene expression changes in response to vegetable intake were identified, and sets of selected genes were submitted to network analysis. The network of inflammation genes illustrated a central role for NFkB in (adipose tissue) modulation of inflammation by increased vegetable intake, in lean as well as obese subjects. In obese subjects, high vegetable intake also resulted in changes related to  metabolism, adhesion and inflammation. By inclusion of sensitive omics technologies and comparing the changes induced by high vegetable intake with changes induced by  restriction, it has been shown that part of vegetables' health benefits are mediated by changes in  metabolism, inflammatory processes and oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303483>Proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue in prolonged lean and obese critically ill patients.</a></h2><p>In prolonged non-obese critically ill patients, preservation of adipose tissue is prioritized over that of the skeletal muscle and coincides with increased adipogenesis. However, we recently demonstrated that in obese critically ill mice, this priority was switched. In the obese, the use of abundantly available adipose tissue-derived  substrates was preferred and counteracted muscle wasting. These observations suggest that different processes are ongoing in adipose tissue of lean vs. overweight/obese critically ill patients.We hypothesize that to preserve adipose tissue mass during critical illness, adipogenesis is increased in prolonged lean critically ill patients, but not in overweight/obese critically ill patients, who enter the ICU with excess adipose tissue. To test this, we studied markers of adipogenesis in subcutaneous and visceral biopsies of matched lean (n = 24) and overweight/obese (n = 24) prolonged critically ill patients. Secondly, to further unravel the underlying mechanism of critical illness-induced adipogenesis, local production of eicosanoid PPARγ agonists was explored, as well as the adipogenic potential of serum from matched lean (n = 20) and overweight/obese (n = 20) critically ill patients.The number of small adipocytes, PPARγ protein, and CEBPB expression were equally upregulated (p ≤ 0.05) in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue biopsies of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients. Gene expression of key enzymes involved in eicosanoid production was reduced (COX1, HPGDS, LPGDS, ALOX15, all p ≤ 0.05) or unaltered (COX2, ALOX5) during critical illness, irrespective of obesity. Gene expression of PLA2G2A and ALOX15B was upregulated in lean and overweight/obese patients (p ≤ 0.05), whereas their end products, the PPARγ-activating metabolites 15s-HETE and , were not increased in the adipose tissue. In vitro, serum of lean and overweight/obese prolonged critically ill patients equally stimulated adipocyte proliferation (p ≤ 0.05) and differentiation (lipid accumulation, DLK1, and CEBPB expression, p ≤ 0.05).Contrary to what was hypothesized, adipogenesis increased independently of initial BMI in prolonged critically ill patients. Not the production of local eicosanoid PPARγ agonists but circulating adipogenic factors seem to be involved in critical illness-induced adipogenesis. Importantly, our findings suggest that abundantly available  substrates from the adipose tissue, rather than excess adipocytes, can play a beneficial role during critical illness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699243>Spatial distribution mapping of molecules in the grains of different rice landraces, using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Documentation of the metabolite profiles of rice landraces is essential as most of them have been lost due to the conventional practices of cultivation. Therefore, application of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) will be an appropriate analytical platform for molecular profiling, as it can provide a detailed understanding of the site-specific localization patterns of biomolecules, and the cues concerning metabolic pathways in organisms.Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) is a relatively non-destructive analytical technique for surface sampling in natural conditions. Here, we report the spatial distribution of diverse molecules in the grains of different rice landraces of India using DESI-MSI. Molecules were identified by ESI-MS and tandem MS analysis of rice extracts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used for the elemental mapping on the rice grains.DESI-MSI showed a uniform distribution of choline (m/z 104.1), sucrose in the form of its sodium (m/z 365.1) and potassium (m/z 381.0) adducts, linoleic acid (m/z 279.2), 13-HODE- (m/z 295.2), unidentified molecules with m/z 535.3, 559.5, and 561.5 and isoschaftoside (m/z 563.1) in the endosperm of rice grains. Gluconic acid (m/z 195.0) and signalling phospholipid intermediate molecules were localized in the embryo whereas oryzanol A (m/z 601.5) and oryzanol C (m/z 615.5) had a restricted localization in the bran region of the grain. SEM-EDS mapping showed the localization of potassium and phosphorus along the bran and embryo.DESI-MSI revealed the distribution of lipids and sugar molecules in the specific regions of the rice grains. Thus, molecules unique to some rice varieties were identified with this analytical platform. Mass spectrometry imaging of rice along with the elemental mapping by SEM-EDS will be of use in understanding the localization pattern of certain molecules in the context of metals present in the grain.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017952>Metabolomic changes in murine serum following inhalation exposure to gasoline and diesel engine emissions.</a></h2><p>The adverse health effects of environmental exposure to gaseous and particulate components of vehicular emissions are a major concern among urban populations. A link has been established between respiratory exposure to vehicular emissions and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms driving this interaction remain unknown. Chronic inhalation exposure to mixed vehicle emissions has been linked to CVD in animal models. This study evaluated the temporal effects of acute exposure to mixed vehicle emissions (MVE; mixed gasoline and diesel emissions) on potentially active metabolites in the serum of exposed mice. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 or 300 μg/m(3)) by whole body inhalation. Immediately after and 18 hours after the end of the exposure period, animals were sacrificed for serum and tissue collection. Serum was analyzed for metabolites that were differentially present between treatment groups and time points. Changes in metabolite levels suggestive of increased oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione, cysteine disulfide, taurine), lipid peroxidation (13-HODE, ), energy metabolism (lactate, glycerate, branched chain amino acid catabolites, butrylcarnitine, fatty acids), and  (DiHOME, palmitoyl ethanolamide) were observed immediately after the end of exposure in the serum of animals exposed to MVE relative to those exposed to FA. By 18 hours post exposure, serum metabolite differences between animals exposed to MVE versus those exposed to FA were less pronounced. These findings highlight complex metabolomics alterations in the circulation following inhalation exposure to a common source of combustion emissions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9113624>Separation and quantitation of linoleic acid oxidation products in mammary gland tissue from mice fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>We have developed an assay for the isolation and quantitation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of free 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (, 13-HODE) in the mammary glands of female mice. Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13-HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water step. The remaining lipid material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE. The extraction and quantitation protocol was applied to the analysis of mammary glands for free 9- and 13-HODE from mice fed isocaloric diets containing 20% corn oil, 5% corn oil, or 20% beef tallow. Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)-HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis. This methodology will be important during investigations of the contribution of linoleate oxidation products to the enhancement of mammary tumorigenesis by dietary fat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551591>Influence of Liver Condition and Copper on Selective Parameters of Post-Mortem Dog Tissue Samples.</a></h2><p>One of the liver functions is copper storage, which can be toxic when in excess. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the relationship between hepatic copper and pathology conditions in stored samples from 55 post-mortem dogs (37 Beagles, 12 Labrador Retrievers, and 6 Labrador Mixes). The analyses evaluated data from blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) that were measured immediately before euthanasia, and liver biopsies which were harvested at necropsy and frozen at -80 °C. Slides for microscopic evaluation were prepared, and liver copper and plasma metabolites were measured. Hepatic copper was correlated ( ≤ 0.001) with monoacylglycerols, 13-HODE +  (13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid + ), and stearoyl-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine. This indicates lipid metabolism modification and cell membrane oxidation. However, hepatic copper was not related to liver histopathology severity or altered liver biomarkers. The severity of liver pathology was positively correlated ( ≤ 0.05) with liver enzymes, bile salts, and glycerophosphocholines, suggesting cholestasis and altered lipid and amino acid metabolism. Liver neoplasia had increased ( ≤ 0.05) metabolites derived from nucleotides, along with an increase ( ≤ 0.05) in α-ketoglutarate from the  and amino acid metabolism ( ≤ 0.05), suggesting rapid cell division. This study offers further insight regarding changes in metabolism due to hepatic tissue damage.</p></html>
