A rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for the simultaneous determination of prostanoids, isoprostane and lipoxygenase (LOX) derived fatty acid metabolites in a small biological sample of only 20 microL was developed.Human plasma samples were applied to a filter spot, extracted without prior derivatization and analyzed within 13 min. Detection of metabolites was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative multiple-reaction monitoring detection mode. Application of this assay to various biological matrices was performed.The validated assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-500 nmol/L for prostanoids and isoprostane, 50-5000 nmol/L for LOX-derived metabolites and 400-40,000 nmol/L for fatty acids. Limits of quantitation were 0.4-233 nmol/L, depending on the metabolite. Plasma samples from diabetic patients and controls showed significant increases in (+/-) and 15(S)-HETE with p-values of 0.019 and 0.024, respectively.The small amount of 20 microL sample volume used in this assay and the demonstrated application to various sample types makes it an ideal routine analysis method for fatty acid metabolites. The resulting values for LOX-derived metabolites in diabetes mellitus type 2 samples support earlier findings about the role of lipid oxidation products in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796244>9- and 13-HODE regulate fatty acid binding protein-4 in human macrophages, but does not involve HODE/GPR132 axis in PPAR-γ regulation of FABP4.</a></h2><p>Both activation of monocytes and increased serum fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) occur in  and are associated with increased atherosclerosis. The oxidized lipid, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () increases FABP4 in macrophages, and is a ligand for G protein-coupled receptor 132 (GPR132). We investigated the involvement of GPR132 in mediating the 9-, 13-HODE stimulation of FABP4 secretion, and whether GPR132 expression is increased in monocytes from patients with type 2 .The effects of siRNA silencing of GPR132 gene and of the PPAR-γ antagonist T0070907 were studied in THP-1 cells. Serum levels of FABP4 and other adipokines were measured in patients with , and monocyte subpopulations were analyzed using flow cytometry. GPR132 mRNA was quantified in isolated CD14 cells. and 13-HODE increased FABP4 expression in THP-1 monocytes and macrophages, and also increased GPR132 expression. Silencing of GPR132 did not influence the increase in FABP4 with , 13-HODE, or rosiglitazone (ROSI). By contrast, T0070907 inhibited the effect of all three ligands on FABP4 expression. Diabetic subjects had increased serum FABP4, and activated monocytes. They also expressed higher levels of GPR132 mRNA in CD14 cells.We conclude that GPR132 is an independent monocyte activation marker in , but does not contribute to PPAR-γ-mediated induction of FABP4 by HODEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417276>The adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP/aP2) gene facilitates foam cell formation in human THP-1 macrophages.</a></h2><p>The critical initiating event in atherogenesis involves the invasion of monocytes through the endothelial wall of arteries, and their transformation from macrophages into foam cells. Human THP-1 monocytic cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment, and can then be converted into foam cells by exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). To define genes that are specifically expressed during the transformation of macrophages into foam cells, we have performed a subtractive library screening utilizing mRNA isolated from THP-1 macrophages and foam cells. From this analysis, we have identified adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP/aP2) as a gene that is highly upregulated in foam cells in response to oxLDL. Furthermore, overexpression the ALBP gene using an adenovirus construct enhanced the accumulation of cholesterol ester in macrophage foam cells, probably due to an increase in transcription since oxLDL enhanced ALBP promoter activity in experiments using a promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. The induction of ALBP by oxLDL probably involved activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription factors, since four different endogenous PPARgamma ligands, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), two oxidized lipid components of oxLDL, as well as 15-deoxy-delta12,14 prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and retinoic acid (RA), all induced ALBP expression in macrophage/foam cells. Finally, ALBP was found to be highly expressed in vivo in macrophage/foam cells of human atherosclerotic plaques. These observations suggest that oxLDL-mediated increase in ALBP gene expression accelerate cholesterol ester accumulation, and that this is an important component of the genetic program regulating conversion of macrophages to foam cells. The observation that ALBP is readily detected in foam cells in active atherosclerotic lesions implicates a role for ALBP in human vascular disease. The induction of ALPB expression by oxLDL likely involves activation of PPARgamma by components of oxLDL ( and 13-HODE) that also function as PPARgamma ligands. Our results add to the concern that the clinical use of insulin-sensitizing PPARgamma agonists (i.e. thiazolidinediones) to treat Type 2  could exacerbate atherosclerosis, and highlight the need for clinical trials that address this issue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443177>Troglitazone reduces the expression of PPARgamma while stimulating that of PPARalpha in mononuclear cells in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in the insulin resistant obese in vivo in parallel with its insulin-sensitizing effect. Because these effects are thought to be mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARalpha and PPARgamma), we have now examined the possibility that troglitazone may modulate the expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Seven obese hyperinsulinemic subjects were administered 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and during troglitazone therapy at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Fasting insulin concentrations fell at week 1 and persisted at lower levels till 4 weeks. PPARgamma expression fell significantly at week 1 and fell further at weeks 2 and 4. In contrast, PPARalpha expression increased significantly at week 2 and further at week 4. 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, products of linoleic acid peroxidation and agonists of PPARgamma, decreased during troglitazone therapy. We conclude that troglitazone, an agonist for both PPARalpha and PPARgamma, has significant but dramatically opposite effects on PPARalpha and PPARgamma. These effects may be relevant to its insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10988277>Troglitazone reduces reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and lipid peroxidation and improves flow-mediated vasodilatation in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Because troglitazone has been shown to have antioxidant properties, we investigated whether troglitazone administration to obese subjects causes a reduction in (1) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs) and (2) lipid peroxidation as reflected in the plasma concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Seven obese subjects were given 400 mg/d troglitazone for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before troglitazone administration and at weekly intervals thereafter. Insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 and remained low at weeks 2 and 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by PMNLs fell to 77.6+/-25.1% of the basal at week 1 and 47.9+/-41.1% at week 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by MNCs fell to 59.8+/-15.7% of the basal at week 1 and 35.1+/-17.6% at week 4 (P:<0.001).  and 13-HODE concentrations fell significantly from 787.4+/-52.4 and 713. 1+/-44.7 pg/mL to 720.4+/-66.7 (P:<0.004) and 675.2+/-65.0 pg/mL (P:<0.01) after 4 weeks, respectively. Postischemic dilatation of the brachial artery was measured by ultrasonography. The mean percent dilatation after forearm ischemia before and after troglitazone was 5.5+/-3.01% and 8.75+/-3.37% (P:<0.02), respectively. The percent increase in diameter after nitroglycerin was 17.08+/-1.18% before troglitazone, whereas it was 18.9+/-1.91% (P:<0.02) after troglitazone. We conclude that troglitazone has a potent and rapid biological inhibitory effect on ROS generation by PMNLs and MNCs and that it inhibits lipid peroxidation significantly. These changes are associated with a significant improvement in postischemic flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery over a relatively short period of 4 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794249>Glycoxidized HDL, HDL enriched with oxidized phospholipids and HDL from diabetic patients inhibit platelet function.</a></h2><p>High-density lipoproteins (HDL) possess atheroprotective properties including anti-thrombotic and antioxidant effects. Very few studies relate to the functional effects of oxidized HDL on platelets in type 2  (T2D).The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of in vitro glycoxidized HDL and HDL from patients with T2D on platelet aggregation and arachidonic acid signaling cascade. At the same time, the contents of hydroxylated fatty acids were assessed in HDL.Compared with control HDL, in vitro glycoxidized HDL had decreased proportions of linoleic (LA) and arachidonic (AA) acids in phospholipids and cholesteryl esters, and increased concentrations of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids ( and 13-HODE) and 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), derived from LA and AA respectively, especially hydroxy derivatives esterified in phospholipids. Glycoxidized HDL dose-dependently decreased collagen-induced platelet aggregation by binding to scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI). Glycoxidized HDL prevented collagen-induced increased phosphorylation of platelet p38 MAPK and cytosolic phospholipase A2, as well as intracellular calcium mobilization. HDL enriched with oxidized phosphatidylcholine (PC), namely PC(16:0/13-HODE) dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation. Increased concentrations of , 13-HODE, and 15-HETE in phospholipids (2.1-, 2.1-, and 2.4-fold increase, respectively) were found in HDL from patients with T2D, and these HDL also inhibited platelet aggregation via SR-BI.Our results suggest that in vitro glycoxidized HDL as well as HDL from patients with T2D inhibit platelet aggregation, and suggest that oxidized LA-containing phospholipids may contribute to the anti-aggregatory effects of glycoxidized HDL and HDL from patients with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148150>Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids: novel regulators of macrophage differentiation and atherogenesis.</a></h2><p>Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) are stable oxidation products of linoleic acid, the generation of which is increased where oxidative stress is increased, such as in diabetes. In early atherosclerosis, 13-HODE is generated in macrophages by 15-lipoxygenase-1. This enhances protective mechanisms through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-g activation leading to increased clearance of lipid and lipid-laden cells from the arterial wall. In later atherosclerosis, both  and 13-HODE are generated nonenzymatically. At this stage, early protective mechanisms are overwhelmed and pro-inflammatory effects of , acting through the receptor GPR132, and increased apoptosis predominate leading to a fragile, acellular plaque. Increased HODE levels thus contribute to atherosclerosis progression and the risk of clinical events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Better understanding of the role of HODEs may lead to new pharmacologic approaches to modulate their production or action, and therefore lessen the burden of atherosclerotic disease in high-risk patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11232024>The suppressive effect of dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese on the generation of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive oxygen species generation by the leukocytes of the obese may be responsible for increased oxidative injury to lipids and proteins and, hence, atherosclerosis. We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381799>Switching from singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation to free-radical-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in model mouse.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unknown what kind of oxidative stress underlies the development of type 2 diabetes. We investigated hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) isomers, which have been proposed as a biomarker for evaluating oxidative stress in vivo, during the development of diabetes in Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mouse, a type 2 diabetes model. It was revealed that glucose tolerance and insulin resistance index HOMA-IR in TSOD mice at 5 weeks of age were approximately normal, namely, the mice were in the prediabetic state, but these levels were significantly exacerbated from 8 weeks of age compared with those in Tsumura Suzuki Non  (TSNO) mice (control). Concomitantly, the plasma levels of free-radical-mediated oxidation products, 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODE and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, in TSOD mice were significantly higher than those in TSNO mice at 8, and 8 and 11 weeks of age, respectively. Interestingly, the plasma levels of 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE, which are produced specifically by singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation, in TSOD mice were higher than those in TSNO mice only at 5 weeks of age, and not at 8, 11, and 13 weeks of age. We demonstrated that singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation occurred in TSOD mice before development of the diabetic phenotypes, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. These results suggest that excessive singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10320803>Formation of 9-hydroxy linoleic acid as a product of phospholipid peroxidation in diabetic erythrocyte membranes.</a></h2><p>The increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR) and lipid peroxidation may contribute to vascular complications in . Some lipid peroxidation products have already been reported to be formed via glucose-induced oxidative stress. We have identified 9-hydroxy linoleic acid (9-OH-C18:2) in the red cell membrane phospholipid of diabetic subjects. We hypothesized that 9-OH-C18:2 would be formed in hydroxyl radical reactions to linoleic acid (C18:2) during glucose-induced oxidative stress, and confirmed that the formation of 9-OH-C18:2 was induced by ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation to the synthetic C18:2. UV-C light generates highly reactive hydroxy radicals. C18:2 is confirmed to be the precursor of 9-OH-C18:2. To estimate the degree of oxidative damage to red cell membrane phospholipids, we developed a selective ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometric measurement for C18:2 and 9-OH-C18:2, following methanolysis of red cell membrane phospholipids. The relative peak height ratio of C18:2 to 9-OH-C18:2 (9-OH-C18:2/C18:2) was measured in phospholipid extracts of red cell membranes from healthy (n=29, 3.1+/-1.9%) and diabetic (n=27, 20. 9+/-16.1%) subjects. It was confirmed that 9-OH-C18:2/C18:2 is significantly (P<0.001) elevated in patients with . The measurement of 9-OH-C18:2/C18:2 in red cell membranes should be useful for assessing oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11443197>Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action?</a></h2><p>It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, in vitro, and in experimental animals. To test these properties in humans, we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells (MNC) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein. We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation, p47(phox) subunit expression, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-HODE, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone (400 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4. On the other hand, IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1, and this increase persisted throughout the study. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment, although there was a trend toward inhibition. Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC, p47(phox) subunit protein quantities, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake. 13-HODE/linoleic acid and /linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake. However, o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly. These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level.</p></html>
