<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24049652>Anti-inflammatory effects of  derivatives in models ex vivo and in vivo of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p> (UCA) derivatives were tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in two models: ex vivo and an experimental mouse model. Ex vivo: inflamed colonic tissue was incubated in culture medium with or without the UCA derivatives. Biopsies, incubated with UCA derivatives, produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 as compared to control biopsies. The same compounds also showed increased levels of IL-10, providing an additional indication for anti-inflammatory properties. In vivo: a combination of two imidazoles and a combination of two of their ethyl esters were administered to mice while  was induced by oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Some parameters did not show conclusive effects, but the imidazoles and their ethyl esters reduced the area of inflammation and the number of infiltrating neutrophils. Fibrosis and the sum of all histological aspects were reduced by the imidazoles, whereas the ethyl esters reduced the colon weight to length ratio. These results suggest that the UCA derivatives have anti-inflammatory effect on IBD. In addition, fine tuning of the ex vivo model may provide an elegant way to predict anti-inflammatory effects of potential drugs in humans, which may decrease the need for animal experiments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21060867>cis- attenuates acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced intestinal inflammation.</a></h2><p>On exposure to sunlight,  (UCA) in the skin is converted from trans to the cis form and distributed systemically where it confers systemic immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to determine if administration of cis-UCA would be effective in attenuating  and the possible role of IL-10.  was induced in 129/SvEv mice by administering 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in drinking water. During this period mice received daily subcutaneously injections of cis-UCA or vehicle. To examine a role for IL-10, 129/SvEv IL-10(-/-) mice were injected for 24 days with cis-UCA or vehicle. Clinical disease was assessed by measurement of body weight, stool consistency, and presence of blood. At sacrifice, colonic tissue was collected for histology and measurement of myeloperoxidase and cytokines. Splenocytes were analyzed for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells via flow cytometry. Murine bone-marrow derived antigen-presenting cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ± UCA and cytokine secretion measured. Our results demonstrated that cis-UCA at a dose of 50 µg was effective in ameliorating DSS-induced  as evidenced by reduced weight loss and attenuated changes in colon weight/length. This protection was associated with reduced colonic expression of CXCL1, an increased expression of IL-17A and a significant preservation of splenic CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells. cis-UCA decreased LPS induced CXCL1, but not TNFα secretion, from antigen-presenting cells in vitro. UCA reduced colonic levels of IFNγ in IL-10(-/-) mice but did not attenuate . In conclusion, this study demonstrates that cis- is effective in reducing the severity of  in a chemically-induced mouse model, indicating that pathways induced by ultraviolet radiation to the skin can influence distal sites of inflammation. This provides further evidence for a possible role for sunlight exposure in modulating inflammatory disorders.</p></html>
