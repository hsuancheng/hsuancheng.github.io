The antitumor effect of the CLnA with the strongest cytotoxic effect was then examined in mice. The results showed that all CLnA isomers have strong cytotoxic effects on DLD-1 cells, with jacaric  (JA) having the strongest effect. Examination of the mechanism of cell death showed that CLnAs induce apoptosis in DLD-1 cells via lipid peroxidation. The intracellular levels of incorporated CLnAs were measured to examine the reason for differences in cytotoxic effects. These results showed that JA was taken into cells efficiently. Collectively, these results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of CLnAs is dependent on intracellular incorporation and induction of apoptosis via lipid peroxidation. JA also had a strong preventive antitumor effect in vivo in nude mice into which DLD-1 cells were transplanted. These results suggest that JA can be used as a dietary constituent for prevention of .Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we have compared the suppressive effect on tumor growth of alpha-eleostearic  (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3) with those of the CLA isomers 9Z11E-CLA and 10E12Z-CLA, using nude mice into which DLD-1 human  cells were transplanted. The results showed that alpha-ESA, which is a CLnA that can be prepared from natural sources in bulk, had a stronger antitumor effect than CLA. DNA fragmentation was enhanced and lipid peroxidation was increased in tumor tissues of the alpha-ESA-fed mice, which suggested that alpha-ESA induced apoptosis via lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, treatment of DLD-1 cells with alpha-ESA, 9Z11E-CLA and 10E12Z-CLA confirmed that alpha-ESA had a stronger antitumor effect than CLA in cultured cell lines. The induction of apoptosis by alpha-ESA was consistent with enhanced DNA fragmentation, increased caspase activity and increased expression of caspase mRNA following alpha-ESA treatment. Addition of alpha-tocopherol, an antioxidant, suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis, suggesting that these effects were associated with lipid peroxidation.</p></html>
