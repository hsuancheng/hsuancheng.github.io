Two months before insemination, the rabbits (15 animals/group) were fed different diets: commercial standard (group C), supplemented with 10% extruded linseed (group L), and 3% fish oil (group FO). The L group does showed both the highest feed intake before AI (P < 0.01) and the highest body weight (BW) throughout pregnancy (P < 0.001). The L does yielded less milk than the C does (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in either weight or size of litter at weaning. Regardless of diet, insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR values were higher during the first half of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the L does showed higher mean insulin concentrations than FO rabbits (P < 0.01) and the lowest glucose clearance (P < 0.01) during pregnancy. On the other hand, pregnant FO rabbits showed the lowest glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and the lowest Homeostasis model assessment values for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, P < 0.05) as well as a faster restoration of baseline glucose levels following glucose load (P < 0.001). Before and during pregnancy, the BW of the rabbits was positively related to fasting sample- and tolerance test-derived indices of insulin resistance (P < 0.05) suggesting that a high pre-pregnancy BW predisposes to gestational insulin resistance. Linseed supplementation increased BW and predisposed to insulin resistance during pregnancy; whereas, fish oil improved insulin sensitivity without significant changes in BW.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) can be found in brown and golden varieties; however, questions have arisen as to whether the variety may influence the health effects.The objective of this study was to compare the effects of brown and golden flaxseeds on lipid profile, glycemia, blood pressure, inflammatory status,body weight, and body composition in overweight adolescents.Seventy-five overweight adolescents (33 boys, 42 girls; age 13.7 ! 2.1 y), from Alegre-ES, Brazil, were randomized to one of the three groups (n ¼ 25) on a parallel, single-blind clinical trial. They received 28 g/d of brown flaxseed (BF), golden flaxseed (GF), or the equivalent amount of wheat bran (Control, CG) in different preparations at school from Monday to Friday for 11 wk. Blood pressure, anthropometric evaluation, and the analyses of blood total cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose, and inflammatory markers were performed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. The data were analyzed by ANCOVA at 5% significance.The groups who consumed brown and golden flaxseed showed significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Brown and golden flaxseed did not differentially affect plasma lipid responses, plasma glucose and inflammatory profile, although all groups (BF, GF, and CG) showed increased levels of TNF-a.The adolescents consumed about half the daily amount provided, which may not have been sufficient to exert the health benefits of flaxseed reported in the literature, concerning the lipid profile, inflammation biomarkers and body composition.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
