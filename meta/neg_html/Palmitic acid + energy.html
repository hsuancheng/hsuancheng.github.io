Mushrooms are widely used as healthy nutritious food. In the present study, the nutritional composition of four different Pleurotus sp. was determined. Prior to extraction, all the selected mushrooms were subjected for proximate composition analysis. The protein, fat, ash, total carbohydrate, fiber and  contents were in the range of (16.07- 25.15%), (0.64-2.02%), (2.1-9.14%), (65.66-82.47%), (6.21-54.12%) and (342.20-394.30Kcal/100g), respectively. The spectrophotometric analysis showed that the concentration of protein was in the range of 45.78-33.47 mg/g in all Pleurotus sp. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of sugars showed six different mono and disaccharides in all the selected mushrooms. The fatty  profile by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the main fatty acids in selected mushrooms were present in the order linoliec > oleic > . The results suggested that all the Pleurotus sp. could be considered as a rich source of nutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29395143>Long-term  supplementation interacts with parity in lactating dairy cows: Production responses, nutrient digestibility, and  partitioning.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of long-term  (C16:0) supplementation and parity on production, nutrient digestibility, and  partitioning of mid-lactation dairy cows. Forty mid-lactation Holstein cows (18 primiparous and 22 multiparous) were used in a block design. Cows were assigned to receive either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a C16:0-enriched supplemented diet (PA; 1.5% diet dry matter) fed for 10 wk. Compared with CON, PA increased dry matter intake, milk yield, cumulative milk yield, milk fat content, milk fat yield, 16-carbon milk fatty  (FA) yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield, and -corrected milk yield. Additionally, PA increased body weight change, but did not affect body condition score change compared with CON. A tendency for a treatment by parity interaction was observed for milk yield due to PA increasing milk yield in multiparous but not in primiparous cows. In addition, we observed interactions between treatment and parity for fat-corrected milk, -corrected milk, and milk fat yield due to PA increasing these variables to a greater extent in multiparous compared with primiparous cows. Interestingly, we observed an interaction between treatment and parity for body weight change, due to PA increasing body weight change in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. The PA treatment increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities compared with CON. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility, compared with CON, PA decreased 16-carbon and total FA digestibilities and increased total FA intake by 470 g/d and absorbed total FA by 316 g/d. We also observed an interaction between treatment and parity for total absorbed FA due to PA increasing it to a greater extent in multiparous than in primiparous cows. Compared with CON, PA increased apparent  intake and milk  output. We observed an interaction between treatment and parity for milk  output due to PA increasing milk  output to a greater extent in multiparous than primiparous cows. Additionally, an interaction between treatment and parity was observed for  output in body reserves due to PA increasing  output in body reserves in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. In conclusion, production responses of dairy cows to PA were consistent throughout the 10-wk treatment period. In addition, PA supplementation interacted with parity, with production responses increased to a greater extent in multiparous than primiparous cows and  partitioned to body reserves only increased in primiparous cows.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Myocardial lipid accumulation can lead to pathological responses, however the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The role of myoglobin in dioxygen binding in cardiomyocytes and oxidative skeletal muscle has widely been appreciated. Our recent work established myoglobin as a protector of cardiac function in hypoxia and disease states. We here unravel a novel role of cardiac myoglobin in governing FA metabolism to ensure the physiological  production through β-oxidation, preventing myocardial lipid accumulation and preserving cardiac functions. In vivoH magnetic resonance spectroscopy unveils a 3-fold higher deposition of lipids in mouse hearts lacking myoglobin, which was associated with depressed cardiac function compared to wild-type hearts as assessed by echocardiography. Mass spectrometry reveals a marked increase in tissue triglycerides with preferential incorporation of  and oleic acids. Phospholipid levels as well as the metabolome, transcriptome and proteome related to FA metabolism tend to be unaffected by myoglobin ablation. Our results reveal a physiological role of myoglobin in FA metabolism with the lipid accumulation-suppressing effects of myoglobin preventing cardiac lipotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944916>Two Cockayne Syndrome patients with a novel splice site mutation - clinical and metabolic analyses.</a></h2><p>Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which leads to neurodegeneration, growth failure and premature aging. Most of the cases are due to mutations in the ERCC6 gene, which encodes the protein CSB. CSB is involved in several functions including DNA repair and transcription. Here we describe two Danish brothers with CS. Both patients carried a novel splice site mutation (c.2382+2T>G), and a previously described nonsense mutation (c.3259C>T, p.Arg1087X) in a biallelic state. Both patients presented the cardinal features of the disease including microcephaly, congenital cataract and postnatal growth failure. In addition, their fibroblasts were hypersensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited increased superoxide levels in comparison to fibroblasts from healthy age and gender matched individuals. Metabolomic analysis revealed a distinctive metabolic profile in cells from the CS patients compared to control cells. Among others, α-ketoglutarate, hydroxyglutarate and certain amino acids (ornithine, proline and glycine) were reduced in the CS patient fibroblasts, whereas glycolytic intermediates (glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvic ) and fatty acids (, stearic and myristic ) were increased. Our data not only provide additional information to the database of CS mutations, but also point towards targets for potential treatment of this devastating disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Preliminary analysis based on fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy of Nile red stained yeast cells showed accumulation of lipid globules. The potential of the yeast to produce lipids was evaluated on glucose, glycerol and  hydrolysate of sugarcane bagasse, where Trichosporon sp. (RW) was found to accumulate 21.45 (59.6%), 18.41 (56%) and 10.25g/l (40.5%) of the lipids after 120h of fermentation at 30°C. FAME analysis of lipids by GC-FID and NMR revealed oleic  (18:1) as the major constituent, corresponding to 50.05, 46.48 and 54.66% of the accumulated lipids in glucose, glycerol and hydrolysate grown cultures, respectively. Other accumulated lipids included  (16:0), linoleic (18:2) and stearic acids (18:0) in that order. The cetane number of the lipids ranged from 52.39 to 59.57 indicating suitability for biodiesel production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin, condition of normolipemia and formation of hyper lipoproteinemia type IIb, IV and V].</a></h2><p>According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, when living in ocean all were carnivorous (piscivorous) fatty acids transferring to cells in form of non-polar triglycerides nitially began apoB-48 chylomicrons, continued lipoproteins of very low and low density and fnalized its apoB-100 endocytosis. The fatty acids are transferred by chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density and non-polar triglycerides are hydrolyzed by hepatic glycerolhydrogenase and co-enzyme apoC-III; according WHO classifcation, hyperlipoproteinemia corresponds to type V. On land, in herbivorous who are not yet synthesized insulin, apoB-48 and chylomicrons left process of non-polar triglycerides transferring. In lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density, the carnivorous transfer exogenous  non-polar triglycerides. The herbivorous also transfer  non-polar triglycerides though synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose endogenically. In herbivorous, transferring of  non-polar triglycerides prior to synthesis of insulin is forming apoB-100 in composition of lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density. The hydrolysis of  non-polar triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density is activated by hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-III; cells absorb lipoproteins of low density by means of apoB-100 endocytosis. The content on lipoproteins in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins corresponds to hepatic glycerol hydrogenase type IIb. In frst and second types of fatty acids transferring in form of triglycerides to lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density predominate  fatty , triglycerides of the same name and  metabolism of fatty acids in vivo. The insulin initiated the third type of transferring of oleic fatty  by now to insulin-depended cells only in oleic lipoproteins of very low density; hydrolysis of oleic triglycerides is activated by late in phylogenesis post-heparin hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-II cofactor. The dynamic apoE is actively bound by apoB-100 forming apoE/B-100 ligand. At later stages of phylogenesis insulin formed fatty acids transferring in form of oleic triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density of the same name without forming of oleic lipoproteins of low density; the electrophoregram of lipoproteins reﬂects absence of hepatic glycerol hydrogenase. In phylogenesis three types of fatty acids transferring to triglycerides in composition of lipoproteins formed sequentially: 1) chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low and density + lipoproteins of low density; 2) lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density; 3) only in lipoproteins of very low density. The frst one is specifc to piscivorous (carnivorous) while living in ocean. The second one is implemented by herbivorous while they didn't begin to synthesize insulin and hepatocytes not yet transform all endogenous  fatty  into oleic fatty . Insulin initiated: a) transferring of oleic fatty acids to lipoproteins of very low density without forming oleic lipoproteins of low density; b) highly effective oleic metabolism of fatty acids in vivo: c) becoming of biological function of locomotion. The aphysiological induction by substrate, surplus of  fatty acids in food initiate negative alterations in composition of lipoproteins in opposite direction than in case of phylogenesis. When homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begins to misuse carnivorous (meat) food then instead of normolipoproteinemia in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins one can initially detect transitory hyperlipoproteinemia type IV and then prolonged hyperlipoproteinemia type IIb. If patient factually passes on to carnivorous diet then hyperlipoproteinemia type V is developing. If content of exogenous  fatty  in food surpasses physiological capacities of its transferring in oleic triglycerides as palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate glycerol,  triglycerides as oleyl-palmitoyl-palmitate glycerol begin to form and epigenetically aphysiological non-ligand  lipoproteins of very low density → lipoproteins of low density are formed. Their circulation in blood is a cause of hypertriglyceridemia, higher level of cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density, compensatory increasing of apoC-III. Then occurs induced by substrate formation of hyperlipoproteinemia initially of type IV, then of type IIb and fnally of type V. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atheromotosis is activated when homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begin to misuse carnivorous food affecting biological functions of trophology, reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), function of homeostasis, endoecology and function of adaptation. The formation of  metabolism if fatty acids instead of oleic one is a cause of chronic defciency of  and ATP synthesis in vivo. Insulin activates absorption of glucose by cells with purpose to use it for synthesis of oleic fatty acids. In the frst place, insulin regulates in vivo metabolism of fatty acids and only in second place metabolism of glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27689350>Kinetics of coffee industrial residue pyrolysis using distributed activation  model and components separation of bio-oil by sequencing temperature-raising pyrolysis.</a></h2><p>This study was carried out to investigate the kinetics of coffee industrial residue (CIR) pyrolysis, the effect of pyrolysis factors on yield of bio-oil component and components separation of bio-oil. The kinetics of CIR pyrolysis was analyzed using distributed activation  model (DAEM), based on the experiments in thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and it indicated that the average of activation  (E) is 187.86kJ·mol. The bio-oils were prepared from CIR pyrolysis in vacuum tube furnace, and its components were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among pyrolysis factors, pyrolysis temperature is the most influential factor on components yield of bio-oil, directly concerned with the volatilization and yield of components (, linoleic , oleic , octadecanoic  and caffeine). Furthermore, a new method (sequencing temperature-raising pyrolysis) was put forward and applied to the components separation of bio-oil.

In this work, microencapsulation of vegetable-derived  (PA) in bio-based polylactic  (PLA) shell by solvent evaporation and oil-in-water emulsification was investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were conducted to confirm the successful encapsulation of PA in PLA shells. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to evaluate the thermal properties, thermal reliability, and core content of the fabricated PCM microcapsules (microPCM). Through a series of parametric studies, the effects of PCM and solvent content, oil phase-to-aqueous phase ratio, as well as surfactant type and content on the morphology, particle size, and thermal properties of the PCM microcapsules were investigated. Experimental results showed that PVA was a superior emulsifier to SDS in the emulsion systems being studied. There also existed an optimal PVA concentration to reduce the average size of microPCM. When the PVA concentration was above this optimal level, the emulsifier molecules tend to form micelles among themselves. This led to the adhesion of tiny microspheres on the surface of microPCM as well as larger microPCM. In short, this work has demonstrated the possibility of using the solvent evaporation method to fabricate 100% bio-based PCM-polymer microcapsules for thermal  storage applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27442489>Metabolic Profiles Reveal Changes in Wild and Cultivated Soybean Seedling Leaves under Salt Stress.</a></h2><p>Clarification of the metabolic mechanisms underlying salt stress responses in plants will allow further optimization of crop breeding and cultivation to obtain high yields in saline-alkali land. Here, we characterized 68 differential metabolites of cultivated soybean (Glycine max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja) under neutral-salt and alkali-salt stresses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics, to reveal the physiological and molecular differences in salt tolerance. According to comparisons of growth parameters under the two kinds of salt stresses, the level of inhibition in wild soybean was lower than in cultivated soybean, especially under alkali-salt stress. Moreover, wild soybean contained significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine, asparagine, citraconic , citramalic , citric  and α-ketoglutaric  under neutral-salt stress, and higher amounts of , lignoceric , glucose, citric  and α-ketoglutaric  under alkali-salt stress, than cultivated soybean. Further investigations demonstrated that the ability of wild soybean to salt tolerance was mainly based on the synthesis of organic and amino acids, and the more active tricarboxylic  cycle under neutral-salt stress. In addition, the metabolite profiling analysis suggested that the  generation from β-oxidation, glycolysis and the citric  cycle plays important roles under alkali-salt stress. Our results extend the understanding of mechanisms involved in wild soybean salt tolerance and provide an important reference for increasing yields and developing salt-tolerant soybean cultivars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569770>Dietary sn-2  triacylglycerols reduced faecal lipids, calcium contents and altered lipid metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, the impact of dietary sn-2  triacylglycerol (sn-2 PTAG) on faecal lipids, calcium excretion and lipid metabolic alternation was investigated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats fed with high-fat diet containing either palm olein (PO, sn-2  (PA) of 14.8%), sn-2 PTAG50 (sn-2 PA of 56.4%) or sn-2 PTAG70 (sn-2 PA of 72.4%), respectively. After 4-week feeding period, SD rats fed with sn-2 PTAGs showed reduced faecal soap fatty acids, neutral lipid and calcium excretion compared to those of PO-fed rats, whereas a significant difference was only observed for the sn-2 PTAG70-fed rats (p < .05). Moreover, dietary sn-2 PTAG70 also showed a significant effect on decreasing serum triacylglycerol (TAG) level, reducing perirenal adipocyte size and regulating lipid metabolism in small intestine and perirenal adipose tissue of SD rats. Significantly increased mRNA levels of genes involved in intestinal lipid anabolism as well as lipid catabolism were both observed in the sn-2 PTAG70-fed rats (p < .05). Meanwhile, dietary sn-2 PTAG70 also significantly up-regulated lipolysis, mitochondrial fatty  oxidation and thermogenesis-related gene and protein levels in perirenal adipose tissue, which might be correlated with the reduced perirenal adipocyte size. Taken together, our findings indicated that sn-2 PTAG70 may have some beneficial effects on intestinal lipid utilisation and lipid metabolic activity for energy supply in visceral adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651962>Fatty  composition of free-living and parasitic stages of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus.</a></h2><p>The development of parasitic nematodes proceeds via multiple stages, often implicating the necessity to adapt to different environments. Especially the transition from free-living to parasitic stages is accompanied by a significant change in the environmental conditions. To shed light on possible adaptations to these transitions, the fatty  composition of different developmental stages of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus was investigated. Fatty acids of D. viviparus eggs, the free-living first, second and third larval stage (L1-L3) as well as the parasitic preadult stage and adult male and female worms residing in the lungs of infected hosts were quantified by gas chromatography after transesterification to their fatty  methyl esters. The fatty  content and diversity were higher in parasitic stages compared to those of free-living larvae. The most prevalent fatty acids in both parasitic and free-living stages were stearic (C18:0),  (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1) and caprylic  (C8:0). A variety of (poly-)unsaturated FAs was found in the parasitic stages and in the eggs, which was similar to the variety of FAs found in bovine surfactant. This finding indicates that parasitic stages of D. viviparus take up FAs from their environment. While eggs contained the highest concentration of fatty acids, a decrease was observed from eggs to L1 and further from L2 to L3. The lowest concentration was found in 38-days-old L3, which suggests that FAs serve as an  reserve for the free-living, non-feeding larval stages. The free-living larvae contained mainly saturated fatty acids and only traces of unsaturated fatty acids, which is in contrast to the phospholipid saturation hypothesis of cold tolerance. Instead, a trade-off between desiccation stress and temperature adaptation may favour a higher amount of saturated FAs in the free-living larval stages. Further studies explicitly examining the FA composition of the different classes of lipids are necessary to better describe the adaptative responses of the FA metabolism to different environmental conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the strive for the best kinetic parameters of biological organisms without a possibility of modifying physicochemical and biochemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondria can be provided with a substrate that increases  production efficiency and the amount of ATP. Physicochemical parameters of oleic MFA has become the standard of an oxidation substrate for in vivo  production; this MFA was synthesized in organisms for millions of years. Environmental influences are the second factor which determines kinetic perfection of biological organisms during phylogenesis. Are these influences always beneficial? Mostly, they are not. However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological,  and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, using human non‑small cell lung cancer A549 cells, it was determined that CsA (0.1 or 1 µM) promoted cell proliferation with glucose alone as the  source. CsA treatment increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and consequently the expression of Cyclin D1. Inhibiting Akt signaling with the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase inhibitor wortmannin prevented this effect. Mechanistically, CsA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the intracellular ROS scavenger N‑acetyl‑cysteine (NAC) attenuated CsA‑induced cell proliferation as well as the activation of Akt/Cyclin D1 signaling. However, notably, it was demonstrated that CsA treatment decreased cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation under normal lipid loading. Further investigation indicated that  induced excessive generation of ROS, while CsA treatment further stimulated this ROS production. Scavenging intracellular ROS with NAC attenuated the CsA‑mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. Collectively, the results indicated a pleiotropic effect of CsA in the regulation of A549 cell proliferation under different metabolic conditions. This indicated that CsA administration may contribute to increased post‑transplant cancer risk in organ recipients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160717>SIRT3 promotes lipophagy and chaperon-mediated autophagy to protect hepatocytes against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Lipophagy is a lysosomal lipolytic pathway that complements the actions of cytosolic neutral lipases. Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in  metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O ( and oleic  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453116>Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fraction obtained from stranded driftwood feedstocks for lipid production by .</a></h2><p>Stranded driftwood feedstocks may represent, after pretreatment with steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis, a cheap C-source for producing biochemicals and biofuels using oleaginous yeasts.

We performed lipidomic analysis in a series of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and identified over 1,700 intact lipids originating from three major lipid categories. Comparative lipidomic screening revealed that 93 significantly changed lipids and decreased  acyl (C16:0)-containing glycerophospholipids were positively associated with metastatic abilities of HCC cells. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that C16:0 incubation specifically reduced malignant cell proliferation, impaired cell invasiveness, and suppressed tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that C16:0 treatment decreased cell membrane fluidity and limited glucose metabolism. A phosphoproteomics approach further revealed such C16:0 incubation attenuated phosphorylation levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway proteins. Multiple reaction monitoring analysis of 443 lipid molecules showed 8 reduced C16:0-containing lipids out of total 10 altered lipids when cancer tissues were compared with adjacent nontumor tissues in a cohort of clinical HCC specimens (P < 0.05).These data collectively demonstrate the biomedical potential of using altered lipid metabolism as a diagnostic marker for cancerous cells and open an opportunity for treating aggressive HCCs by targeting altered C16:0 metabolism.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (oleic , found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and oleic  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for  and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased  expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

The results indicate that  kernels have the potential to be utilized as a novel protein source for dietary purposes and non-conventional supply of linoleic,  and oleic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960651>Fabrication and Performance of Composite Microencapsulated Phase Change Materials with  Ethyl Ester as Core.</a></h2><p>Microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) could prevent the leakage of PCMs during solid⁻liquid phase change process. However, their applications are mainly limited by the compactness and thermal stability of the traditional polyurea shell microcapsules. To increase the thermal compactness and thermal stability of PCM microcapsules, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was employed to form polymer/SiO₂ composite shells to enhance the mechanical performance of polyurea and polyurethane microcapsule via interfacial polymerization and in situ polymerization. The morphology and chemical components of the microcapsules were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The thermal properties of the microcapsules were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravity analysis (TGA). The results showed the smoothness and compactness of both polyurea⁻SiO₂ and polyurethane⁻SiO₂ microcapsules enhanced slightly, when compared with that without TEOS addition. Moreover, the SiO₂ composite shell had good effect on thermal compactness, as the weight loss rate of polyurea⁻SiO₂ microcapsules and polyurethane⁻SiO₂ microcapsules decreased 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051454>Green preparation of seaweed-based silver nano-liquid for cotton pathogenic fungi management.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were synthesised using the crude ethyl acetate extracts of  and evaluated their bioefficacy against two crop-damaging pathogens.

The relative contributions of these metabolic fuels chiefly depend on the duration of the fast, but other factors including previous diet, environmental temperature, and activity level can modulate the fuel mixture. It has long been held that endogenous proteins are spared from catabolism until the final stages of prolonged fasting and contribute a significant proportion of  once the other metabolic fuels have been depleted. However, evidence is mounting that protein is catabolized supplemental to fat metabolism under some circumstances. This has been shown in migratory birds that exhibit dramatic reductions in lean mass during flights. One hypothesis to explain this seemingly maladaptive metabolic strategy is that the catabolism and oxidation of protein in situ yields five times more metabolic water than that generated through fat oxidation alone. Recent support for this hypothesis is that birds benefit from such a strategy due to their uricotelic nature. However, it remains unclear whether ureotelic mammals would also employ this strategy. Here we test the protein-for-water hypothesis in resting laboratory mice subjected to water deprivation during fasting while we tracked rates of protein and lipid catabolism using endogenously incorporated C-leucine and C-. We found no differences in instantaneous leucine oxidation; however, cumulative differences in instantaneous leucine oxidation ultimately resulted in a higher total leucine oxidation after 72 h of fasting in water-deprived animals. We also found that lipid oxidation was 8% higher in the hydrated mice, but the difference was not significant presumably because of a concomitant reduction in metabolic rates of the water-deprived mice. Our results indicate that mammals do increase rates of protein catabolism during dehydration but to a lesser degree than birds. The ability of mammals to produce highly concentrated urine and their lower inherent rates of protein turnover apparently preclude mammals from taking full advantage of the protein-for-water strategy during fasting under dehydrating conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201542>Fatty  profiles of the European migratory common noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula).</a></h2><p>In animals, fatty acids (FA) are essential as structural components in membranes and for  storage in adipocytes. Here, we studied the relative proportions of FA in a mammal with extreme changes in metabolic rates. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) switch from energetically demanding long-distance migration at high metabolic rates to regular torpor with extremely low metabolic rates. We found that composition of FA categories differed between adipose tissue types (white adipose tissue (WAT) vs brown adipose tissue (BAT)) and muscle tissue types (skeletal vs heart), but not between sexes. We found oleic  to be the most abundant FA in all studied tissues. Concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were not always higher in muscular tissue compared with adipocyte tissue, even though high concentrations of PUFA are considered beneficial for low body temperatures in torpor. In all tissues, we observed a high content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), possibly to compensate for a low PUFA content in the diet. Ratios of ω6/ω3 were lower in the heart than in skeletal muscles of common noctules. Three FA (, oleic, and linoleic ) accounted for about 70% of the FA in adipose tissue, which is similar to proportions observed in migrating birds, yet migrating birds generally have a higher PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissues than bats. Bats seem to contrast with other mammals in having a high MUFA content in all tissues. We conclude that FA profiles of bats differ largely from those of most cursorial mammals and instead are-with the exception of MUFA-similar to those of migrating birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495626>Altering the ratio of dietary C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 interacts with production level in dairy cows: Effects on production responses and  partitioning.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of altering the dietary ratio of  (C16:0) and oleic (cis-9 C18:1) acids on nutrient digestibility,  partitioning, and production responses of lactating dairy cows. Cows were blocked by milk yield and assigned to 3 groups (12 cows per group) in a main plot: low (45.2 ± 1.7 kg/d), medium (53.0 ± 1.6 kg/d), and high (60.0 ± 1.9 kg/d). Within each production group, a truncated Latin square arrangement of fatty  (FA) treatments was used in 2 consecutive 35-d periods. The FA treatments supplemented at 1.5% of diet dry matter were (1) 80:10 (80% C16:0 + 10% cis-9 C18:1), (2) 73:17 (73% C16:0 + 17% cis-9 C18:1), (3) 66:24 (66% C16:0 + 24% cis-9 C18:1), and (4) 60:30 (60% C16:0 + 30% cis-9 C18:1). Treatment × production group interactions were observed for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, -corrected milk, milk fat, milk protein, and milk lactose and  partitioned to milk. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments reduced fat-corrected milk, -corrected milk, and milk  output in low-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments did not affect milk yield, milk protein yield, and milk lactose yield in low- and medium-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Regardless of production level, there was no effect of treatments on dry matter intake; however, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased body weight change and body condition score change. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased total FA digestibility due to a linear increase in 16- and 18-carbon FA digestibilities. Interactions between FA treatments and production level were observed for the yield of milk fat and milk FA sources. In low-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments decreased milk fat yield due to a decrease in de novo and mixed milk FA without changes in preformed milk FA. In contrast, in high-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased milk fat yield due to an increase in de novo and preformed milk FA. Our results indicate that high-producing dairy cows (averaging 60 kg/d) responded better to a fat supplement containing more cis-9 C18:1, whereas low-producing cows (averaging 45 kg/d) responded better to a supplement containing more C16:0.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Evidence indicates that this increased risk is linked to an altered cardiac substrate preference of the insulin resistant heart, which shifts from a balanced utilization of glucose and long-chain fatty acids (FAs) towards an almost complete reliance on FAs as main fuel source. This shift leads to a loss of endosomal proton pump activity and increased cardiac fat accumulation, which eventually triggers cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of currently used in vitro models to study the underlying mechanism of IR-induced HF and provide insight into a human in vitro model: human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs). Using functional metabolic assays we demonstrate that, similar to rodent studies, hESC-CMs subjected to 16h of high palmitate (HP) treatment develop the main features of IR, i.e., decreased insulin-stimulated glucose and FA uptake, as well as loss of endosomal acidification and insulin signaling. Taken together, these data propose that HP-treated hESC-CMs are a promising in vitro model of lipid overload-induced IR for further research into the underlying mechanism of cardiac IR and for identifying new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies.

Fatty liver is one of the main health disorders after parturition. Therefore, to investigate changes in hepatic lipid metabolic status and mitochondria in dairy cows with mild fatty liver, liver and blood samples were collected from healthy cows (n = 15) and cows with mild fatty liver (n = 15). To determine the effects of  acids (PA), one of the major component of fatty acids, on lipid metabolism and mitochondria in vitro, calf hepatocytes were isolated from healthy calves and treated with various concentrations of PA (0, 50, 100, and 200 μM). Dairy cows with mild fatty liver displayed hepatic lipid accumulation. The protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and mRNA levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) were significantly higher in dairy cows with mild fatty liver than in control cows. The hepatic mitochondrial DNA content, mRNA levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I to V (CO 1-V), protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV), voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were all markedly increased in the liver of dairy cows with mild fatty liver compared with healthy cows. The PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation; protein levels of SREBP-1c and PPARα; and mRNA levels of ACC1, FAS, ACO, and CPT1A in calf hepatocytes. Moreover, the mitochondrial DNA content, mRNA levels of CO 1-V, protein levels of COX IV, VDAC1, PGC-1α, NRF1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and ATP content were significantly increased in PA-treated hepatocytes compared with control hepatocytes. The protein level of mitofusin-2 was significantly decreased in PA-treated groups. In conclusion, lipid synthesis and oxidation, number of mitochondria, and ATP production were increased in the liver of dairy cows with mild fatty liver and PA-treated calf hepatocytes. These changes in hepatic mitochondria and lipid metabolism may be the adaptive mechanism of dairy cows with mild fatty liver.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Fifteen Holstein cows (139 ± 39 d in milk) were randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments were a control diet (CON; no fat supplement) and 1.5% of FA added either as a -enriched triglyceride supplement (PA-TG) or as calcium salts of palm FA supplement (Ca-FA). Fat-supplemented treatments did not affect dry matter intake (DMI) compared with CON, but Ca-FA reduced DMI compared with PA-TG. Compared with CON, fat-supplemented treatments increased 18-carbon FA digestibility by 2.0 percentage units but did not affect digestibility of total FA or 16-carbon FA. Compared with Ca-FA, PA-TG reduced total FA digestibility by 8.7 percentage units due to a decrease in 16-carbon FA digestibility (21.7 percentage units). Both fat supplements increased neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility compared with CON (3.90 percentage units), and PA-TG tended to increase NDF digestibility by 1.60 percentage units compared with Ca-FA. Compared with CON, fat-supplemented treatments increased milk yield (1.05 kg/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield (2.20 kg/d), and -corrected milk yield (1.80 kg/d). Also, PA-TG increased milk fat yield (50 g/d) and milk  output (1.0 Mcal/d) and tended to increase milk fat content (0.07 percentage units) and -corrected milk yield (1.0 kg/d) compared with Ca-FA. Fat-supplemented treatments reduced the yield of de novo milk FA (23 g/d) and increased the yields of mixed (43 g/d) and preformed (52 g/d) milk FA compared with CON. The PA-TG treatment increased the yield of 16-carbon (66 g/d) milk FA compared with Ca-FA, whereas Ca-FA increased the yield of preformed (60 g/d) milk FA. Fat-supplemented treatments increased intake of net  for lactation by 1.80 Mcal/d, milk  output by 1.30 Mcal/d, and  in body reserves by 0.30 Mcal/d compared with CON. The Ca-FA treatment increased  allocated to body reserves (0.60 Mcal/d),  partitioning toward body reserves (1.20 percentage units), and body condition score change (0.06 units), and tended to increase body weight change (0.16 kg/d) and body condition score (0.08 units) compared with PA-TG. In conclusion, feeding a -enriched triglyceride supplement increased milk  output due to increased yields of milk and milk fat, whereas feeding a calcium salts of palm FA supplement increased FA digestibility and  partitioned to body reserves.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for  production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient oleic variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient  variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with  and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and obesity.

Our previous studies suggested that resveratrol (RSV) supplement could improve hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism, particularly which related to LD accumulation, has not yet been elucidated.A high-fat diet (HFD) and  were used to induce hepatic steatosis in mouse liver and hepatocytes, respectively. The effects of RSV on LD accumulation were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The effects of RSV on the expression levels of LD-associated genes (ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, followed by KD or overexpression of SIRT1 and ATF6 with small interfering RNAs or overexpressed plasmids, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay were utilized to clarify the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and possible interaction between SIRT1 and ATF6.There was a significant increase in the accumulation of LDs in liver and hepatocytes during the process of HFD-induced steatosis, respectively, which was significantly inhibited by RSV supplementation. RSV notably activated SIRT1 expression and decreased the expression levels of ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1, which are associated with LD accumulation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of RSV on LD accumulation and the associated expression of genes in hepatocytes were abrogated or strengthened with SIRT1 silencing or overexpression, respectively. On the contrary, the benefits of RSV in hepatocytes were eliminated or aggravated when transfected with the overexpressed ATF6 or ATF6 siRNA, respectively. Furthermore, we found that RSV stimulated SIRT1 expression significantly, which was followed by increased deacetylation and inactivation of ATF6, resulting in a positive feedback loop for SIRT1 transcription associated with ATF6 binding to the SIRT1 promoter region.Taken together, these findings indicate that RSV supplementation improves hepatic steatosis by ameliorating the accumulation of LDs, and this might be partially mediated by a SIRT1/ATF6-dependent mechanism.© 2018 The Author(s).

In this study, the effect of pH and salt on the stability and organization of a  (PA) monolayer is investigated by surface vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Results indicate that alkyl chain packing becomes more disordered as the carboxylic headgroup becomes deprotonated. This is associated with packing mismatch of charged and neutral species as charged headgroups penetrate deeper into the solution phase. At pH 10.7, when the monolayer is ∼99% deprotonated, palmitate (PA) molecules desorb and solubilize into the bulk solution where there is spectroscopic evidence for aggregate formation. Yet, addition of 100 mM NaCl to the bulk solution is found to drive PA molecules to the aqueous surface. Free  calculations show that PA molecules become stabilized within the interface with increasing NaCl concentration. Formation of contact -COO:Na pairs alters the hydration state of PA headgroups, thus increasing the surface propensity. As salts are highly concentrated in SSA, these results suggest that deprotonated fatty acids may be found at the air-aqueous interface of aerosol particles due to sea salt's role in surface stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538994>The selective production of jet fuel range alkanes via the catalytic upgrading of  over Co/HMCM-49 catalysts.</a></h2><p>The complete deoxygenation of  followed by simultaneous hydro-isomerization and appropriate hydrocracking were achieved over Co/HMCM-49 bi-functional catalysts with the special structure of 12 MR cups and a low Si/Al ratio.

In particular, saturated fatty acids such as  (PA) have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. However, how neurons develop insulin resistance in response to lipid overload is not fully understood. Here, we used cultured rat cortical neurons and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells to demonstrate that PA blocks insulin-induced metabolic activation, inhibits the activation of the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway and activates mTOR kinase downstream of Akt. Despite the fact that fatty acids are not normally used as a significant source of fuel by neural cells, we also found that short-term neuronal exposure to PA reduces the NAD/NADH ratio, indicating that PA modifies the neuronal  balance. Finally, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production with mitoTEMPO prevented the deleterious effect of PA on insulin signaling. This work provides novel evidence of the mechanisms behind saturated fatty -induced insulin resistance and its metabolic consequences on neuronal cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The wax esters synthesized are composed of saturated fatty acids and alcohols with chain lengths of 10-18, and the major constituents are myristic  and myristyl alcohol. Since the anaerobic cells gain ATP through the conversion of paramylon to wax esters, the phenomenon is named "wax ester fermentation". The wax ester fermentation is quite unique in that the end products, i.e. wax esters, have relatively high molecular weights, are insoluble in water, and accumulate in the cells, in contrast to the common fermentation end products such as lactic  and ethanol.A unique metabolic pathway involved in the wax ester fermentation is the mitochondrial fatty  synthetic system. In this system, fatty  are synthesized by the reversal of β-oxidation with an exception that trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase functions instead of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Therefore, acetyl-CoA is directly used as a C donor in this fatty  synthesis, and the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which requires ATP, is not necessary. Consequently, the mitochondrial fatty  synthetic system makes possible the net gain of ATP through the synthesis of wax esters from paramylon. In addition, acetyl-CoA is provided in the anaerobic cells from pyruvate by the action of a unique enzyme, oxygen sensitive pyruvate:NADP oxidoreductase, instead of the common pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.Wax esters produced by anaerobic Euglena are promising biofuels because myristic  (C) in contrast to other algal produced fatty acids, such as  (C) and stearic  (C), has a low freezing point making it suitable as a drop-in jet fuel. To improve wax ester production, the molecular mechanisms by which wax ester fermentation is regulated in response to aerobic and anaerobic conditions have been gradually elucidated by identifying individual genes related to the wax ester fermentation metabolic pathway and by comprehensive gene/protein expression analysis.

We identified a novel homozygous missense LONP1 variant, c.2282 C > T, (p.Pro761Leu), by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing in two siblings born to healthy consanguineous parents. Both siblings presented with stepwise regression during infancy, profound hypotonia and muscle weakness, severe intellectual disability and progressive cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Muscle biopsy revealed the absence of ragged-red fibers, however, scattered cytochrome c oxidase-negative staining and electron dense mitochondrial inclusions were observed. Primary cultured fibroblasts from the siblings showed normal levels of mtDNA and mitochondrial transcripts, and normal activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I through V. Interestingly, fibroblasts of both siblings showed glucose-repressed oxygen consumption compared to their mother, whereas galactose and  utilization were similar. Notably, the siblings' fibroblasts had reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and elevated intracellular lactate:pyruvate ratios, whereas plasma ratios were normal. We demonstrated that in the siblings' fibroblasts, PDH dysfunction was caused by increased levels of the phosphorylated E1α subunit of PDH, which inhibits enzyme activity. Blocking E1α phosphorylation activated PDH and reduced intracellular lactate concentrations. In addition, overexpressing wild-type LonP1 in the siblings' fibroblasts down-regulated phosphoE1α. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrated that purified LonP1-P761L failed to degrade phosphorylated E1α, in contrast to wild-type LonP1. We propose a novel mechanism whereby homozygous expression of the LonP1-P761L variant leads to PDH deficiency and  metabolism dysfunction, which promotes severe neurologic impairment and neurodegeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636691>Flaxseed oil ameliorated high-fat-diet-induced bone loss in rats by promoting osteoblastic function in rat primary osteoblasts.</a></h2><p>α-Linolenic  (ALA) is a plant-derived omega-3 unsaturated fatty  that is rich in flaxseed oil (FO). The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% fat), FO diet (NY, 10% fat), HFD (60% fat), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% fat) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness,  absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631363>Role of the saturated fatty  palmitate in the interconnected hypothalamic control of  homeostasis and biological rhythms.</a></h2><p>The brain, specifically the hypothalamus, controls whole body  and glucose homeostasis through neurons that synthesize specific neuropeptides, whereas hypothalamic dysfunction is linked directly to insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nutrient excess, through overconsumption of a Western or high-fat diet, exposes the hypothalamus to high levels of free fatty acids, which induces neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulation of neuropeptide synthesis. Furthermore, exposure to a high-fat diet also disrupts normal circadian rhythms, and conversely, clock gene knockout models have symptoms of metabolic disorders. While whole brain/animal studies have provided phenotypic end points and important clues to the genes involved, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the intracellular pathways and neuron-specific components that ultimately control circadian rhythms and  homeostasis. Because of its complexity and heterogeneous nature, containing a diverse mix cell types, it is difficult to dissect the critical hypothalamic components involved in these processes. Of significance, we have the capacity to study these individual components using an extensive collection of both embryonic- and adult-derived, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell lines from rodents. These defined neuronal cell lines have been used to examine the impact of nutrient excess, such as palmitate, on circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine signaling pathways, as well as changes in vital neuropeptides, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation; the role of proinflammatory molecules in this process; and ultimately, restoration of normal signaling, clock gene expression, and neuropeptide synthesis in disrupted states by beneficial anti-inflammatory compounds in defined hypothalamic neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30456221>Binding energies and the entry route of  and palmitoylcarnitine into myoglobin.</a></h2><p>The interaction of lipids (entry mechanism) with respect to both oxy- and deoxy-myoglobin was explored using unrestrained Molecular Dynamics simulations.

The biochar of PB with large surface area was produced by forest residue of pinecone, and it was cheap, environment friendly and easy to prepare. The PB was firstly utilized as the supporter of PA and the characterizations of PA/PB were analyzed by the BET, SEM, XRD, DSC, TGA, FT-IR and thermal conductivity tester. The results demonstrated that the PA was physically absorbed by the PB and the crystal structure of the PA was not destroyed. The results of DSC showed that the fusing and crystallization points of the form-stable phase change material with the maximum content of PA (PA/PB-4) were 59.25 °C and 59.13 °C, and its fusing and freezing latent heat were 84.74 kJ/kg and 83.81 kJ/kg, respectively. The results of TGA suggested that the thermal stability of the PA/PB-4 composite was excellent, which could be used for the applications of thermal  storage. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of PA/PB-4 was 0.3926 W/(m∙K), which was increased by 43.76% compared with that of the pure PA. Thus, the study results indicated that the PA/PB-4 had great potential for thermal  storage applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347229>Lupin seed hydrolysate promotes G-protein-coupled receptor, intracellular Ca and enhanced glycolytic metabolism-mediated insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta cells.</a></h2><p>Lupin seed proteins have been reported to exhibit hypoglycaemic effects in animals and humans following oral administration, however little is known about its mechanism of action. This study investigated the signalling pathway(s) responsible for the insulinotropic effect of the hydrolysate obtained from lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) seed extracts utilizing BRIN-BD11 β-cells. The extract was treated with digestive enzymes to give a hydrolysate rich in biomolecules ≤7 kDa. Cells exhibited hydrolysate induced dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and enhanced intracellular Ca and glucose metabolism. The stimulatory effect of the hydrolysate was potentiated by depolarizing concentrations of KCl and was blocked by inhibitors of the ATP sensitive K channel, Gα protein, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC). These findings reveal a novel mechanism for lupin hydrolysate stimulated insulin secretion via Gα mediated signal transduction (Gα/PLC/PKC) in the β-cells. Thus, lupin hydrolysates may have potential for nutraceutical treatment in type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The intake of macronutrient was evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, diabetes duration,  intake, educational level, physical activity, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and diabetes treatment, to estimate odds ratio (ORs) of DR.Patients with DR had significantly lower intake of fibre, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and  and oleic .

It has been suggested that microglia sense palmitate, a prevalent circulating SFA, and act as mediators of this inflammatory process by communicating with neurons, particularly those involved in appetite regulation. In this study, we examined the inflammatory response to palmitate in immortalized microglial cell lines, BV-2 and IMG, and the subsequent effects on inflammatory gene expression in a model of NPY/AgRP neurons, mHypoE-46.The BV-2 cells were treated with 50 µM palmitate for 4 and 24 h, and the transcriptional regulation of markers for inflammation and cellular stress was assessed using an RT2 Profiler PCR Array. Select genes were verified with qRT-PCR. The BV-2 and IMG cells were then co-cultured using 1.0-µm cell culture inserts with an immortalized hypothalamic cell line, mHypoE-46, to investigate potential intercellular communication between microglia and neurons.We found that palmitate increased the mRNA levels of specific inflammatory genes, and a general anti-inflammatory profile was revealed in the microglia cells. The mRNA changes in TNFα at 4 and 24 h in BV-2 cells were abrogated with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor, TAK-242, indicating the involvement of TLR4. Co-culture of mHypoE-46 neurons with microglia pre-treated with palmitate resulted in repression of TNFα expression in the hypothalamic neurons. As palmitate significantly increased IL-13 expression in microglia, the effect of this cytokine was tested in mHypoE-46 neurons. The addition of IL-13 to neuronal cultures normalized the palmitate-mediated increase in IL-6 and AgRP expression, suggesting that microglia may protect surrounding neurons, at least in part, through the release of IL-13.These results suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role of microglia towards the palmitate-induced neuroinflammation, and potentially  homeostasis, in hypothalamic neurons.© 2018 ©2018S.

Thus, this study was conducted to recover the value-added products from POME source before being discharged. The samples, before (X) and after (Y) the pre-recovery system in the clarification tank were sampled and analysed and proximate analysis indicated that both samples are  rich source of food due to high contents of fats and carbohydrates. GCMS analysis showed that the oil extracts contain predominantly , oleic, linoleic and stearic acids. Regiospecific analysis of oil extracts by quantitative C-NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that both oil extracts contain similar degree of saturation of fatty acids at sn-2 and sn-1,3 positions. The samples are rich in various phytonutrients, pro-vitamin A, vitamin E, squalene and phytosterols, thus contributing to exceptionally high total flavonoid contents and moderate antioxidant activities.

Exposure to 2- or 3-MCPD thus results, for example, from refined vegetable oils, in instant meals or infant formula, as well as in cereals or pastries. The molecular mechanisms of 2-MCPD toxicity are poorly understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of 2-MCDP-induced alterations in the testes from rats following oral administration of 10 mg/kg body weight per day 2-MCPD, or an equimolar dose of 2-MCPD dipalmitate as a representative 2-MCPD fatty  ester. In the absence of overt histopathologically detectable toxicity, moderate alterations in cellular proteomic signatures were recorded. The observations are in line with the assumption that the molecular mechanisms of 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD toxicity differ. Observed proteomic alterations point towards effects of 2-MCPD on mitogen-dependent signaling and mitochondrial  utilization. Presented data for the first time provide insight into proteomic effects of 2-MCPD in testicular tissue.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have described the microbial communities and metabolic character of traditional sour cream and butter. The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial microbiota and metabolic character of eight samples collected from herdsmen in Buryatia, Russia. Using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing techniques, we identified a total of 294 species and/or subspecies in 169 bacterial genera, belonging to 14 phyla. The dominant phylum was Firmicutes (81.47%) and the dominant genus was  (59.28%). There were differences between the bacterial compositions of the sour cream and butter samples. The relative abundances of , , and  were significantly higher in sour cream than in butter, and the abundance of   was significantly lower in sour cream than in butter. Using a pure culture method, 48 strains were isolated and identified to represent seven genera and 15 species and/or subspecies. Among these isolates,  subsp.  (22.50%) was the dominant LAB species. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry at elevated  was used in combination with statistical methods to detect metabolite differences between traditional sour cream and butter. A total of 27,822 metabolites were detected in all samples, and Lys-Lys, isohexanal, , Leu-Val, and 2'-deoxycytidine were the most dominant metabolites found in all samples. In addition, 27 significantly different metabolites were detected between the sour cream and butter samples, including short peptides, organic acids, and amino acids. Based on correlation analyses between the most prevalent bacterial species and the main metabolites in sour cream, we conclude that there may be a connection between the dominant LAB species and these metabolites. This study combined omics techniques to analyze the bacterial diversity and metabolic character of traditional sour cream and butter, and we hope that our findings will enrich species resource libraries and provide valuable resources for further research on dairy product flavor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268793>Toxicological evaluation of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone, a unique radiolytic compound of .</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the toxic effects and potency of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-dDCB), a unique compound derived from  via irradiation. In a series of assays of bacterial reverse-mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration, and in vivo micronucleus, negative responses were found by the treatment of 2-dDCB comparing vehicle control, dimethyl sulfoxide or corn oil. In the acute oral toxicity test, all of the mice administrated 2-dDCB survived, and there were no clinical and necropsy signs observed at any doses (0, 300, and 2000 mg/kg body weight) during the experimental period of 14 days. These results suggested that 2-dDCB is a relatively non-toxic substance with median lethality dose higher than 2000 mg/kg body weight. Moreover, there were no adverse effects noted in rats orally administrated 2-dDCB everyday via gavage for 28 days, even at the highest dose (2.0 mg/kg body weight/day) tested, which is 1000-times higher than the human daily intake of 2-dDCB estimated through an extreme exposure scenario.

Recent studies on the molecular/cellular anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dietary components have demonstrated that mitochondrial respiration plays a key role in macrophage functioning. Since dietary lipids are major substrates for mitochondrial respiration through β-oxidation, the current study examined whether RBO regulates inflammatory responses by modulating mitochondrial  metabolism. Palm oil (PO), enriched with  which are known to be effectively taken up by cells and used for oxidative phosphorylation, served as a positive control. In the in vitro model of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine cells, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in the culture supernatant were significantly reduced by RBO treatment. In contrast, secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was upregulated by RBO. Transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediator molecules (COX-2 and iNOS) and expression of activation markers (CD80, CD86, and MHC-II) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were suppressed by RBO. Mitochondrial respiration (as assessed by an extracellular flux analyzer) increased upon RBO treatment, as the basal respiration, maximal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity were upregulated. In an in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a negative control diet containing corn oil (CO), PO, or RBO for 4 weeks, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from their tibias and femurs. In pro-inflammatory M1-polarized BMDM (M1-BMDM), the RBO-induced suppression of IL-6 and TNF-α was recapitulated in vivo. Mitochondrial respiration in M1-BMDM also increased following the RBO intervention and the PO control treatment as compared to CO fed negative control. Overall, the current study for the first time demonstrates that RBO regulates inflammatory responses in murine macrophages by upregulating mitochondrial respiration. Further clinical studies are required to validate the animal study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669322>GC-MS Metabolomics Reveals Distinct Profiles of Low- and High-Grade Bladder Cancer Cultured Cells.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that metabolomics can be a useful tool to better understand the mechanisms of carcinogenesis; however, alterations in biochemical pathways that lead to bladder cancer (BC) development have hitherto not been fully investigated. In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics was applied to unveil the metabolic alterations between low-grade and high-grade BC cultured cell lines. Multivariable analysis revealed a panel of metabolites responsible for the separation between the two tumorigenic cell lines. Significantly lower levels of fatty acids, including myristic, , and palmitoleic acids, were found in high-grade versus low-grade BC cells. Furthermore, significantly altered levels of some amino acids were observed between low- and high-grade BC, namely glycine, leucine, methionine, valine, and aspartic . This study successfully demonstrated the potential of metabolomic analysis to discriminate BC cells according to tumor aggressiveness. Moreover, these findings suggest that bladder tumorigenic cell lines of different grades disclose distinct metabolic profiles, mainly affecting fatty  biosynthesis and amino  metabolism to compensate for higher energetic needs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923625>High vulnerability of the heart and liver to 3-hydroxypalmitic -induced disruption of mitochondrial functions in intact cell systems.</a></h2><p>Patients affected by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency predominantly present severe liver and cardiac dysfunction, as well as neurological symptoms during metabolic crises, whose pathogenesis is still poorly known. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that pathological concentrations of 3-hydroxypalmitic  (3HPA), the long-chain hydroxyl fatty  (LCHFA) that most accumulates in LCHAD deficiency, significantly decreased adenosine triphosphate-linked and uncoupled mitochondrial respiration in intact cell systems consisting of heart fibers, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes, but less intense in diced forebrain. 3HPA also significantly reduced mitochondrial Ca retention capacity and membrane potential in Ca -loaded mitochondria more markedly in the heart and the liver, with mild or no effects in the brain, supporting a higher susceptibility of the heart and the liver to the toxic effects of this fatty . It is postulated that disruption of mitochondrial  and Ca homeostasis caused by the accumulation of LCHFA may contribute toward the severe cardiac and hepatic clinical manifestations observed in the affected patients.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317382>Coupling natural systems with synthetic chemistry for light-driven enzymatic biocatalysis.</a></h2><p>Visible light-driven redox reactions have been widely adopted for the production of chemicals to combat  shortage and global warming.

In this review, we introduce the small molecules and nanoparticles that are widely used as photosensitizers, as well as the development of a photosensitizer protein that is based on the expansion of genetic code, with a fluorescent protein that is used as a scaffold. Visible light-driven enzymes using proteins as photosensitizers or as catalysts such as carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), formic  dehydrogenase (FDH), hydrogenase, nitrogenase, cytochrome P450 BM3, and alkane synthase are then described. CODH can be coupled with photosensitizing nanoparticles to reduce CO to CO, and hydrogenase can produce H using high- electrons produced from dye-sensitized nanoparticles. When water-soluble zinc porphyrin is coupled with FDH, visible light drives CO to produce formic . Nitrogenase can reduce N to NH using CdS nanoparticle as photosensitizer. Cytochrome P450 BM3 can be enhanced by a visible light-driven redox system and thus by hydroxylate lauric  or fatty acids.

There is some evidence that supplemental omega-3 dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) can exert positive effects on fertility. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation, post-insemination  plane of nutrition and their interaction on embryo survival in cattle. Crossbred beef heifers (n = 185) were individually offered barley straw ad libitum and 6 kg DM of concentrate supplemented with either a rumen-protected source of saturated fatty  (; control, CON) or a partially rumen-protected n-3 PUFA-enriched supplement (n-3 PUFA). Estrous was synchronised using two injections of PG administered at 11-d intervals and following artificial insemination (AI = Day 0) 179 heifers exhibiting oestrus were inseminated and assigned to one of two dietary treatments: (i) remain on their pre-insemination high dietary plane of nutrition (High) or (ii) restricted to 0.6 × estimated maintenance  requirements (Low) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The heifers were then maintained on their assigned diets until slaughter and embryo recovery on Day 16 (n = 92) or pregnancy diagnosis by ultrasound scanning at Day 30 post-AI (n = 87). Plasma concentrations of fatty acids, metabolites, insulin, progesterone (P4) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were measured at appropriate intervals. Hepatic expression of mRNA for aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C), cytochrome P450 2C (CYP 2C) and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP 3A) was examined. The n-3 PUFA supplementation increased plasma n-3 PUFA concentration (P < 0.05) and reduced n-6: n-3 PUFA ratio (P < 0.05). Plasma IGF-1 was higher for n-3 PUFA relative to the CON (P < 0.05) and for High compared with Low plane of nutrition post-AI (P < 0.05) groups. A low plane of nutrition post-AI increased plasma concentrations of progesterone from Days 7-16 after insemination (P < 0.001) but reduced embryo length (P < 0.001). Supplementation with n-3 PUFA reduced and tended to reduce hepatic expression of CYP2C (P = 0.01) and CYP3A (P = 0.08), respectively. However, while dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation and an abrupt reduction in nutrient status following insemination elevated plasma concentrations of n-3 PUFA and mid and late phase P4, respectively, there was no effect of either PUFA supplementation or post-insemination plane of nutrition on embryo survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This method can be used to study changes in mitochondrial function and fuel utilisation in live skeletal muscle fibre bundles. Our method enables flexibility in experimental design and high-throughput assessment of mitochondrial parameters in isolated skeletal muscle fibre bundles. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice had lower basal oxygen consumption under FCCP-induced maximal respiration, when compared to control chow-fed mice. EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice had enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity under FCCP-induced maximal respiration, when compared to control chow-fed mice.Metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle contributes to the aetiology and development of muscle diseases and metabolic diseases. As such, assessment of skeletal muscle cellular bioenergetics provides a powerful means to understand the role of skeletal muscle metabolism in disease and to identify possible therapeutic targets. Here, we developed a method that allows for the real-time assessment of cellular respiration in intact skeletal muscle fibre bundles obtained from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of adult mice. Using this method, we assessed the contribution of ATP turnover and proton leak to basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Our data demonstrate that the mitochondria in EDL fibres are loosely coupled. Moreover, in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), we show that palmitate exposure induced comparable peak OCR and higher total OCR in EDL fibre bundles when compared to pyruvate exposure, suggesting that fatty acids might be a more sustainable fuel source for skeletal muscle when mitochondria are driven to maximal respiration. Application of this method to EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice revealed lower basal OCR and enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity in the presence of FCCP when compared to the chow-diet fed control mice. By using a 96-well microplate format, our method provides a flexible and efficient platform to investigate mitochondrial parameters of intact skeletal muscle fibres obtained from adult mice.© 2016 The Authors.

Regarding their chemical composition: water ranged from 471.7 to 515.4 g kg and 878.3-885.9 g kg ; fat content in dry matter ranged from 607 to 647 g kg and 6.7-11.6 g kg ; protein varied from 302 to 331.7 g kg and 823.6-892.5 g kg ; ash ranged from 33.7 to 37.7 g kg and 63.8-74.0 g kg ; and nitrogen-free extracts ranged from 12.7 to 36.5 g kg and 35.0-96.2 g kg . The sterols and phospholipids in the yolk lipids were 16-26 g kg and 59-127 g kg . The main fatty acids in the lipids were oleic (39.1-47.3%) and  (26.0-35.5%) acids. Cholesterol in the yolk lipids ranged from 15.9 to 25.9 g kg . Phosphatidylcholine (389-573 g kg ), phosphatidylethanolamine (219-355 g kg ) and phosphatidylinositol (112-284 g kg ) were the main phospholipids. The content of saturated fatty acids in the phospholipids was significantly higher than that in triacylglycerols.Small variations in the chemical composition of eggs from seven different genotypes were observed. Significant differences in the fatty  compositions of the main classes of phospholipids and the triacylglycerol fraction were established. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30198455>The protein-sparing effect of α-lipoic  in juvenile grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus: effects on lipolysis, fatty  β-oxidation and protein synthesis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the protein-sparing effect of α-lipoic  (LA), experimental fish (initial body weight: 18·99 (sd 1·82) g) were fed on a 0, 600 or 1200 mg/kg α-LA diet for 56 d, and hepatocytes were treated with 20 μm compound C, the inhibitor of AMP kinase α (AMPKα), treated for 30 min before α-LA treatment for 24 h. LA significantly decreased lipid content of the whole body and other tissues (P0·05). Consistent with results from the experiment in vitro, LA activated phosphorylation of AMPKα and notably increased the protein content of adipose TAG lipase in intraperitoneal fat, hepatopancreas and muscle in vivo (P<0·05). Meanwhile, LA significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty  β-oxidation in the same three areas, and LA also obviously down-regulated the mRNA expression of genes involved in amino  catabolism in muscle (P<0·05). Besides, it was observed that LA significantly activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in muscle of experimental fish (P<0·05). LA could promote lipolysis and fatty  β-oxidation via increasing  supply from lipid catabolism, and then, it could economise on the protein from  production to increase protein deposition in grass carp. Besides, LA might directly promote protein synthesis through activating the mTOR pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729072>Recycling of food waste for fuel precursors using an integrated bio-refinery approach.</a></h2><p>The main aim was to integrate FW-recycling with cultivation of Rhodotorula glutinis and anaerobic digestion (AD) for bio- and -fuel recovery. Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250gL water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry weight biomass (5.18gL) and total fatty  contents (1.03gg DW). Dominant fatty  methyl esters (FAME) were  - (C-26%); Stearic - (C-17%) and Oleic acids (C-38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139mkg volatile solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS. Thus integrated FW recycling approaches will be more feasible for generating  and economic incentives.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the fed state, hSTC-1 decreases the incorporation of C from glucose into lipids in the rat BAT. The data support the hypothesis that the capacity of the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)-generating pathway (glycolysis) from glucose is regulated by hSTC-1, decreasing the adequate supply of G3P needed for fatty  esterification and triacylglycerol (TG) storage in BAT. The results also suggest the effect of hSTC-1 on de novo fatty  synthesis from pyruvate generated by C-glucose in the glycolysis pathway. In addition, by decreasing lipogenesis, hSTC-1 increased ATP levels and these two factors may decrease BAT thermogenic function. The presence of hSTC-1 in the incubation medium did not alter C-glucose and C-1- oxidation. The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expression was not altered by hSTC-1 either. In conclusion, hSTC-1 is one of the hormonal factors that control glucose metabolism in BAT in the fed state. The decrease of TG capacity synthesis from C-glucose by hSTC-1 compromises the BAT thermogenic capacity. Furthermore, the increase in ATP levels would inhibit a futile cycle via UCP-1, which dissipates oxidative  as heat.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

A total of 120 Genetiporc 6.0 × Genetiporc F25 (PIC, Inc., Hendersonville, TN) individually housed barrows were studied for 56 d. These barrows (initial BW of 9.9 ± 0.6 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 15 dietary treatments. Each experimental diet included 95% of a corn-soybean meal basal diet plus 5% either corn starch or 1 of 14 dietary fat sources. The 14 dietary fat sources (animal-vegetable blend, canola oil, choice white grease source A, choice white grease source B, coconut oil, corn oil source A, corn oil source B, fish oil, flaxseed oil, palm oil, poultry fat, soybean oil source A, soybean oil source B, and tallow) were selected to provide a diverse and robust range of unsaturated fatty :SFA ratios (U:S). Pigs were limit-fed experimental diets from d 0 to 10 and from d 46 to 56, providing a 7-d adaption for fecal collection on d 7 to 10 (13 kg BW) and d 53 to 56 (50 kg BW). At 13 kg BW, the average  content of the 14 sources was 8.42 Mcal DE/kg, 8.26 Mcal ME/kg, and 7.27 Mcal NE/kg. At 50 kg BW, the average  content was 8.45 Mcal DE/kg, 8.28 Mcal ME/kg, and 7.29 Mcal NE/kg. At 13 kg BW, the variation of dietary fat DE content was explained by DE (Mcal/kg) = 9.363 + [0.097 × (FFA, %)] - [0.016 × omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids ratio] - [1.240 × (arachidic , %)] - [5.054 × (insoluble impurities, %)] + [0.014 × (, %)] ( = 0.008, = 0.82). At 50 kg BW, the variation of dietary fat DE content was explained by DE (Mcal/kg) = 8.357 + [0.189 × U:S] - [0.195 × (FFA, %)] - [6.768 × (behenic , %)] + [0.024 × (PUFA, %)] ( = 0.002, = 0.81). In summary, the chemical composition of dietary fat explained a large degree of the variation observed in the  content of dietary fat sources at both 13 and 50 kg BW.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496314>Increased triacylglycerol - Fatty  substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells exposed to eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with oleic  (OA) and  (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled oleic  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108757>Effect of co-culture with Tetragenococcus halophilus on the physiological characterization and transcription profiling of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.</a></h2><p>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus are widely existed and play vital roles during the manufacture of fermented foods such as soy sauce. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the volatile compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane fatty  showed that co-culture improved the content of  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and oleic  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation,  metabolism, and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii. Results presented in this study may contribute to further understand the interactions between Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Tetragenococcus halophilus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo.  substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of  for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is a pathology associated primarily with FA and secondarily with glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27760195>Prolyl Oligopeptidase Inhibition Attenuates Steatosis in the L02 Human Liver Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) is a serine endopeptidase that is widely distributed in vivo, particularly in the liver. Significant changes in functional mitochondrial proteins involved with mitochondrial oxidoreductases/transporters and nucleic  binding proteins were observed after POP inhibition in the liver, which suggested a role of POP in regulating liver  metabolism. Steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with disturbances in lipid and  metabolism in hepatocytes. Here, we aimed to study the effect of POP on hepatocyte steatosis.The human liver cell line L02 was used to investigate the biological effects of POP. An in vitro cell model of steatosis was successfully induced with oleic  and . L02 cells were also subjected to S17092 (a POP inhibitor) at different concentrations for 24 or 48 h. Ac-SDKP levels and POP activity were measured to assess the rate of inhibition of POP by S17092. The POP gene and protein expression levels were detected using real-time PCR and Western blots, respectively. Oil red O staining was performed and the triglyceride levels in the L02 cells were also measured. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism was detected using real-time PCR. The effects of POP inhibition on LC3B II were detected by Western blot.Compared with the control, the POP mRNA levels increased by approximately 30%, and the POP protein levels increased by almost 60% in the steatotic L02 cells. After S17092 (0.026~130 μM) incubation for 24 or 48 h, cell proliferation was significantly decreased in the free fatty  (FFA)-treated cells at 26-130 μM; however, S17092 did not affect the proliferation of L02 cells after 24 h of incubation with S17092 at 0.026-65 μM without FFA treatment. S17092 treatment (13 and 26 μM) also elicited no significant effect on apoptosis in normal L02 cells, but FFA treatment increased cell apoptosis, which was attenuated by S17092 incubation. S17092 treatment inhibited intracellular POP activity and decreased the AcSDKP level at the concentration of 0.026-26 μM. After treatment with FFA for 24 h, oil red O staining revealed significant lipid accumulation in the cells in the model group compared with the controls; however, lipid accumulation was suppressed after the administration of S17092 (13 and 26 μM). Accordingly, the triglyceride levels in the FFA-treated cells were approximately 5-fold greater than those of the controls and were decreased by approximately 25% and 45% after the administration of S17092 at 13 and 26 μM, respectively. The mRNA levels of FASN, PPAR-γ, and SREBP-1c were higher in the FFA-treated cells than in the normal controls, and all of these levels were significantly inhibited in the presence of S17092 at both 13 and 26 μM. S17092 treatment did not affect LC3B II in the FFA-treated cells compared with FFA treatment alone.The expression of POP increases with hepatocyte steatosis, and POP inhibitors can significantly reduce intracellular lipid accumulation, which might be related to the inhibition of genes involved in lipid synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130531>Acute hypoxic preconditioning prevents -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via switching metabolic GLUT4-glucose pathway back to CD36-fatty  dependent.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Myocardial cell damage leads to an imbalance of  metabolism, and many studies have indicated that short-term hypoxia during myocardial cell injury has a protective effect. In our previous animal studies, we found that short-term hypoxia in the heart has a protective effect, but long-term hypoxia increases myocardial cell injury.  (PA)-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat ventricle cardiomyocytes were used to simulate hyperlipidemia model, which suppress cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and activate glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). We exposed the cells to short- and long-term hypoxia and investigated the protective effects of hypoxic preconditioning on PA-induced lipotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Preconditioning with short-term hypoxia enhanced both CD36 and GLUT4 metabolism pathway protein levels. Expression levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-Akt, phospho-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC1α, PPARα, CD36, and CPT1β induced by PA was reversed by short-term hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. PA-induced increased GLUT4 membrane protein level was reduced in the cells exposed to short-term hypoxia and si-PKCζ. Short-term hypoxia, resveratrol and si-PKCζ rescue H9c2 cells from apoptosis induced by PA and switch the metabolic pathway from GLUT4 dependent to CD36 dependent. We demonstrate short-term hypoxic preconditioning as a more efficient way as resveratrol in maintaining the  metabolism of hearts during hyperlipidemia and can be used as a therapeutic strategy.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074677>Potential of Whole Pequi ( spp.) Fruit-Pulp, Almond, Oil, and Shell-as a Medicinal Food.</a></h2><p>Pequi () pulp, the most consumed component of pequi fruit, is one of the richest Brazilian carotenoid sources, and the most important carotenoid food source native to the Cerrado.

Toxicological and environmental issues were not considered. Participants agreed that: no evidence does exist on the specific health effects of palm oil consumption as compared to other saturated fatty acids-rich fats; the stereospecific distribution of saturated fatty acids in the triacylglycerol molecule of palm oil limits their absorption rate and metabolic effects; in agreement with International guidelines, saturated fatty acids intake should be kept <10% of total , within a balanced diet; within these limits, no effect of palm oil consumption on human health (and specifically on CVD or cancer risk) can be foreseen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501397>Effect of conjugated linoleic  and acetate on milk fat synthesis and adipose lipogenesis in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>During biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression (MFD), nutrients are spared from milk fat synthesis and are available for other metabolic uses. Acetate is the major carbon source spared and it may increase lipid synthesis in adipose tissue during MFD. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and the amount of acetate spared during CLA-induced MFD on adipose tissue lipogenesis. Nine multiparous, lactating, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows (244 ± 107 d in milk; 25 ± 8.4 kg of milk/d; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Experimental periods were 4 d followed by a 10-d washout. Treatments were control (CON), ruminal infusion of acetate (AC; continuous infusion of 7 mol/d adjusted to pH 6.1 with sodium hydroxide), or abomasal infusion of CLA (10 g/d of both trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA). Dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein yield and percentage were not affected by treatments. Compared with CON, milk fat yield decreased 23% and fat percent decreased 28% in CLA, and milk fat yield increased 20% in AC. Concentration and yield of milk de novo synthesized fatty acids (<C16) were reduced and concentration of preformed fatty acids (>C16) was increased by CLA, compared with CON. Yield of de novo synthesized fatty acids and  was increased by AC, compared with CON. Lipogenesis capacity of adipose tissue explants was decreased 72% by CLA, but was not affected by AC. Acetate oxidation by adipose explants was not affected by treatments. Treatments had no effect on expression of key lipogenic factors, lipogenic enzymes, and leptin; however, expression of fatty  binding protein 4 was reduced in CLA compared with CON. Additionally, hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin 1 were decreased by CLA and acetate. Plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations were not affected by treatments; however, CLA increased nonesterified fatty acids 17.7%, β-hydroxybutyrate 16.1%, and insulin 27.8% compared with CON, and AC increased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate 18%. In conclusion, during CLA-induced MFD in low-producing cow adipose tissue was sensitive to the anti-lipogenic effects of CLA, while spared acetate did not stimulate adipose lipogenesis. However, acetate may play an important role in stimulating lipogenesis and improving  status in the mammary gland under normal conditions.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Currently, effective treatments for OXPHOS defects, with complex I deficiency being the most prevalent, are not available. Yet, clinical practice has shown that some complex I deficient patients benefit from a high-fat or ketogenic diet, but it is unclear how these therapeutic diets influence mitochondrial function and more importantly, which complex I patients could benefit from such treatment. Dietary studies in a complex I deficient patient with exercise intolerance showed increased muscle endurance on a high-fat diet compared to a high-carbohydrate diet. We performed whole-exome sequencing to characterize the genetic defect. A pathogenic homozygous p.G212V missense mutation was identified in the  gene, encoding an early assembly factor of complex I. A complementation study in fibroblasts confirmed that the p.G212V mutation caused the complex I deficiency. The mechanism turned out to be an incomplete assembly of the peripheral arm of complex I, leading to a decrease in the amount of mature complex I. The patient clinically improved on a high-fat diet, which was supported by the 25% increase in maximal OXPHOS capacity in TMEM126B defective fibroblast by the saturated fatty  , whereas oleic  did not have any effect in those fibroblasts. Fibroblasts of other patients with a characterized complex I gene defect were tested in the same way. Patient fibroblasts with complex I defects in NDUFS7 and NDUFAF5 responded to , whereas ACAD9, NDUFA12, and NDUFV2 defects were non-responding. Although the data are too limited to draw a definite conclusion on the mechanism, there is a tendency that protein defects involved in early assembly complexes, improve with , whereas proteins defects involved in late assembly, do not. Our data show at a clinical and biochemical level that a high fat diet can be beneficial for complex I patients and that our cell line assay will be an easy tool for the selection of patients, who might potentially benefit from this therapeutic diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569538>Serum metabolomics study of nutrient metabolic variations in chronic heat-stressed broilers.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of heat stress on broiler metabolism, we assigned 144 broilers to normal control (NC), heat stress (HS) or pair-fed (PF) groups and then monitored the effects using growth performance, carcass characteristics, biochemical assays and GC-MS-based metabolomics.

Altogether, these overexpressing strains significantly augmented higher lipid contents when compared to wild type by partly overcoming the limitation of lipid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29074588>GLP-1 Elicits an Intrinsic Gut-Liver Metabolic Signal to Ameliorate Diet-Induced VLDL Overproduction and Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Perturbations in hepatic lipid and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and hepatic insulin resistance. The objective of this study is to delineate the mechanism of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in preventing obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.By subjecting the complete subdiaphragmatic vagotomized mice to various nutritional conditions and investigating hepatic de novo lipogenesis pathway, we found that complete disruption of subdiaphragmatic vagal signaling resulted in a significant decrease of circulating VLDL-triglyceride compared with the mice obtained sham procedure. Vagotomy further prevented overproduction of VLDL-triglyceride induced by an acute fat load and a high-fat diet-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed that plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 was significantly raised in the vagotomized mice, which was associated with significant reductions in mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), and FASN (fatty  synthase), as well as enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In vitro, treating mouse primary hepatocytes with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, for 48 hours inhibited free fatty ,  treatment induced de novo lipid synthesis, and VLDL secretion from hepatocytes.Elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1 in vagotomized mice may prevent VLDL overproduction and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet. These novel findings, for the first time, delineate an intrinsic gut-liver regulatory circuit that is mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 in regulating hepatic  metabolism.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500968>Effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in α-linolenic  on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in overweight and obese patients with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived α-linolenic  (ALA) may exert cardioprotective effects. Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an -restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid oleic  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk -restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion.

However, their effects on heat shock response (HSR) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigate whether the GLP-1 analogue, exendin-4, triggers the expression of HSR and increases MAPK activity under metabolic stress.The effects of exendin-4 in the presence or absence of  (PA; 400 μm) or glucose (30 mm) in the HepG2 liver cell line are assessed using Western blots, quantitative real-time PCR, and label-free proteomics.Heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP72, HSP90, and GRP78) and other chaperones are not significantly affected by exendin-4 under the conditions tested. In contrast, the presence of exendin-4 alone increases the MAPK phosphorylation levels (JNK, ERK1/2, and p38). For short incubation periods, in the presence of PA or glucose, treatment with exendin-4 exhibits limited effects but significantly attenuates MAPK phosphorylation after a 24-h incubation. Interestingly, canonical signaling pathways, such as EIF2, ILK, PKA, and Rho, are modulated by exendin-4.Identifying new pathways modulated by GLP-1 analogues will provide further insights into their benefits beyond their currently recognized roles in glycemic control, such as MAPK activity,  homeostasis, and body weight decrease.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The reactors were fed with mixtures containing (on volatile solids basis): 40% of sewage sludge, 30% of organic fraction of municipal waste and 30% of grease trap sludge. The change of hydraulic retention time did not significantly affect process stability. However, methane yields as well as volatile solids removal decreased from 0.54 to 0.47 l per kg of added volatile solids and 65% to 60% respectively, with the decrease of hydraulic retention time. Despite the fact that the best process performance was achieved for hydraulic retention time of 20 days, the obtained results showed that it is also possible to carry out the co-digestion process at shorter hydraulic retention times with good results. Furthermore, gas production rate as well as biogas production at the shortest hydraulic retention time were approximately 46% higher in comparison to results obtained at the longest hydraulic retention time. In this context, the proposed solution seems to be an interesting option, because it provides an unique opportunity for wastewater treatment plants to improve their profitability by enhancing  recovery from sludge as well as full utilisation of the existing infrastructure and hence creates a new potential place for alternative treatment of organic industrial waste such as: fat-rich materials or food waste. However, implementation of the solution at wastewater treatment plants is still a big challenge and needs studies including identification of optimal digesting conditions, information about substrate pumping, inhibition thresholds and processing properties. Additionally, due to the characteristics of both co-substrates their introduction to the full-scale digester should be carefully planned due to a potential risk of overloading of the digester. For this reason, a gradual increase of the share of these wastes in the co-digestion mixture is highly recommended, because it will allow for the acclimatization of bacteria as well as prevent overloading. The results of this study show the importance of gradual acclimatization of microorganisms to the changing environmental conditions. It was found that concentration of long chain fatty acids in effluents increased with the reduction of hydraulic retention time, but this phenomenon did not significantly influence the performance and stability of the process probably due to changes hydraulic retention time being gradual. Although for  a moderate negative correlation with volatile solids removal was observed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we aim to investigate the global metabolic feature of serum for three types of seizures.We recruited 27 patients who had experienced a seizure within 48h (including 11 who had a generalized seizure, nine who had a generalized seizure secondary to partial seizure and seven who had a partial seizure) and 23 healthy controls. We analyzed the global metabolic changes of serum after seizures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Based on differential metabolites, the metabolic pathways and their potential to diagnose seizures were analyzed, and metabolic differences among three types of seizures were compared.The metabolic profiles of serum were distinctive between the seizure group and the controls but were not different among the three types of seizures. Compared to the controls, patients with seizures had higher levels of lactate, butanoic , proline and glutamate and lower levels of , linoleic , elaidic , trans-13-octadecenoic , stearic , citrate, cysteine, glutamine, asparagine, and glyceraldehyde in the serum. Furthermore, these differential metabolites had common change trends among the three types of seizures. Related pathophysiological processes reflected by these metabolites are  deficit, inflammation, nervous excitation and neurotoxicity. Importantly, transamination inhibition is suspected to occur in seizures. Lactate, glyceraldehyde and trans-13-octadecenoic  in serum jointly enabled a precision of 92.9% for diagnosing seizures.There is a common metabolic feature in three types of seizures.

The progressive recovery of insulin sensitivity as cows advance toward late lactation is accompanied by reductions in circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and milk yield. Because  can promote insulin resistance in monogastrics through sphingolipid ceramide-dependent mechanisms,  (C16:0) feeding may enhance milk production by restoring homeorhetic responses. We hypothesized that feeding C16:0 to mid-lactation cows would enhance ceramide supply and ceramide would be positively associated with milk yield. Twenty multiparous mid-lactation Holstein cows were enrolled in a study consisting of a 5-d covariate, 49-d treatment, and 14-d posttreatment period. All cows were randomly assigned to a sorghum silage-based diet containing no supplemental fat (control; n=10; 138±45 d in milk) or C16:0 at 4% of ration dry matter (PALM; 98% C16:0; n=10; 136±44 d in milk). Blood and milk were collected at routine intervals. Liver and skeletal muscle tissue were biopsied at d 47 of treatment. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (300mg/kg of body weight) were performed at d -1, 24, and 49 relative to start of treatment. The plasma and tissue concentrations of ceramide and glycosylated ceramide were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using a mixed model with fixed effects of treatment and time, and milk yield served as a covariate. The PALM treatment increased milk yield, -corrected milk, and milk fat yield. The most abundant plasma and tissue sphingolipids detected were C24:0-ceramide, C24:0-monohexosylceramide (GlcCer), and C16:0-lactosylceramide. Plasma concentrations of total ceramide and GlcCer decreased as lactation advanced, and ceramide and GlcCer were elevated in cows fed PALM.  feeding increased hepatic ceramide levels, a response not observed in skeletal muscle tissue. Plasma ceramides (e.g., C24:0-ceramide) were positively correlated with plasma NEFA and milk yield, and positively correlated with NEFA levels following a glucose challenge. Our data demonstrate a remodeled plasma and hepatic sphingolipidome in mid-lactation dairy cows fed PALM. The potential involvement in ceramide in homeorhetic nutrient partitioning to support lactation requires further consideration.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Here, we show that, as the radius of a clinical lung surfactant monolayer-covered bubble decreases to ∼100 µm, the monolayer morphology changes from dispersed circular liquid-condensed (LC) domains in a continuous liquid-expanded (LE) matrix to a continuous LC linear mesh separating discontinuous LE domains. The curvature-associated morphological transition cannot be readily explained by current liquid crystal theories based on isotropic domains. It is likely due to the anisotropic bending  of the LC phase of the saturated phospholipids that are common to all natural and clinical lung surfactants. This continuous LC linear mesh morphology is also present on bilayer vesicles in solution. Surfactant adsorption and the dilatational modulus are also strongly influenced by the changes in morphology induced by interfacial curvature. The changes in morphology and dynamics may have physiological consequences for lung stability and function as the morphological transition occurs at alveolar dimensions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623851>Alterations to the microbiota-colon-brain axis in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice compared to diet-resistant mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is underpinned by both genetic and environmental factors, including a high-saturated-fat diet. Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

Especially insulin signaling in the brain seems to impact whole body glucose homeostasis and interacts with fatty  signaling. In humans circulating saturated fatty acids are negatively associated with brain insulin action while animal studies suggest both positive and negative interactions of fatty acids and insulin brain action. This apparent discrepancy might reflect a difference between acute and chronic fatty  signaling. To address this question we investigated the acute effect of an intracerebroventricular  administration on peripheral glucose homeostasis. We developed and implemented a method for simultaneous monitoring of brain activity and peripheral insulin action in freely moving mice by combining radiotelemetry electrocorticography (ECoG) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. This method allowed gaining insight in the early kinetics of brain fatty  signaling and its contemporaneous effect on liver function , which, to our knowledge, has not been assessed so far in mice.Insulin-induced brain activity in the theta and beta band was decreased by acute intracerebroventricular application of . Peripherally it amplified insulin action as demonstrated by a significant inhibition of endogenous glucose production and increased glucose infusion rate. Moreover, our results further revealed that the brain effect of peripheral insulin is modulated by  load in the brain.These findings suggest that insulin action is amplified in the periphery and attenuated in the brain by acute  application. Thus, our results indicate that acute  signaling in the brain may be different from chronic effects.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27456117>Energetic and conformational features linked to the monomeric and dimeric states of bovine BLG.</a></h2><p>Bovine β-lactoglobulin (BLG) belong to the lipocalin family.

Experimental and theoretical reports have stated its complex structural behavior in solution, with coupled effects between homodimerization and ligand recognition. Nonetheless, structural evidence at the atomic level about the cause of this coupled effect has not been reported to date.

MD simulations, coupled to the MM/GBSA method, revealed that dimerization exerts contrasting effects on the ligand-binding capacity of BLG. Protein dimerization decreases PLM affinity, promoting dimer association. For SDS the dimeric state increases affinity, enhancing dimer dissociation. MD simulations based on PCA revealed that while few differences in the conformational subspace are observed between the free and bound monomer and dimer coupling for PLM, substantial changes are observed between the free and bound monomer and dimer coupling for SDS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the histopathological result was consistent with that of the serum metabolomic analysis, and the changes in serum metabolites in each sausage diet group and the NDMA group were consistently associated with disorders of lipids, amino , and  metabolism.This work indicates that excessive NDMA content in sausage may cause liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28453990>Thermo-chemo-sonic pre-digestion of waste activated sludge for yeast cultivation to extract lipids for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>The low cost biosynthesis of microbial lipids are an efficient feedstock to replace plant based oil for biodiesel production. The present study objective is to explore the effect of thermo-chemo-sonic pre-digestion of municipal Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) to cultivate oleaginous L. starkeyi MTCC-1400 as a model organism to produce high yield biomass and lipid. Higher Suspended Solids (SS) reduction (20 and 15.71%) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) solubilization (27.6 and 22.3%) were achieved at a Specific  (SE) input of 5569 kJ/kg for WAS digested with NaOH and KOH, respectively. The maximum biomass of 17.52 g L and lipid 64.3% dwt were attained in NaOH pre-digested sample. The analyzed lipid profile exhibited high content of  (45.6%) and oleic  (38.7%) which are more suitable for biofuel production. Thus, these results strongly motivate the use of pre-digested WAS as an efficient and economical substrate for biodiesel production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The average oil content was found (≈ 13% w/w). All samples (before and after extraction) were tested for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), calorific value, surface analysis and porosity, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and elemental analysis to assess their potential towards fuel properties. Elemental analysis indicated that carbon represents the highest percentages (49.59% and 46.42%, respectively), followed by nitrogen (16.7% and 15.5%), hydrogen (6.74% and 6.04%), and sulfur (0.851% and 0.561%). These results indicate that SCG can be utilized as compost, as it is rich in nitrogen. Properties of the extracted oil were examined, followed by biodiesel production. The quality of biodiesel was compared with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751 standards, and all the properties complied with standard specifications. The fatty  compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography. It was observed that coffee waste methyl ester (CWME) is mainly composed of  (35.8%) and arachidic (44.6%) acids, which are saturated fatty acids. The low degree of unsaturation provides an excellent oxidation stability (10.4 hr). CWME has also excellent cetane number, higher heating value, and iodine value with poor cold flow properties. The studies also investigated blending of biodiesel with Euro diesel and butanol. Following this, a remarkable improvement in cloud and pour points of biodiesel was obtained. Spent coffee grounds after oil extraction is an ideal material for garden fertilizer, feedstock for ethanol, biogas production, and as fuel pellets. The outcome of such research work produces valuable insights on the recycling importance of SCG in Turkey.Coffee is a huge industry, and coffee has been widely used due to its refreshing properties. This industry generates large quantities of waste. Therefore, recycling of spent coffee grounds for producing alternative fuels and compounds of added value is crucial. Elemental analysis indicated that coffee waste can be utilized as compost, as it is rich in nitrogen. Coffee waste after oil extraction is an ideal feedstock for ethanol and biogas production, garden fertilizer, and as fuel pellets.

Enzymatic synthesis of ascorbyl palmitate in tert-butyl alcohol was carried out using indigenously immobilized lipase preparation PyCal with ascorbic  and  as starting material. The developed batch process under optimized reaction conditions resulted in conversion of 90% with relatively shorter reaction time of 6 h. Continuous process in packed bed reactor gave conversion of 50% with space time yield of 15.46 g/L/h which was found to be higher than the reported literature on enzymatic synthesis of ascorbyl palmitate. The immobilized lipase used in the present work showed good reusability. Characterization of formed ascorbyl palmitate was carried out by FTIR, MS/MS, H-NMR, and C-NMR. The enzymatic process resulted in selective synthesis of 6-O-L-ascorbyl palmitate with purity of 98.6% and no side product formation. The use of underivatized starting materials, high space time yield of 15.46 g L h, high recyclability of catalyst, and no by-product formation make the overall process highly efficient and clean in terms of  consumption and waste generation, respectively. The optimized reaction parameters for ascorbyl palmitate synthesis in the present study can be used as a useful reference for industrial synthesis of fatty  esters of ascorbic  by enzymatic route.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592955>[Exploration about the protection mechanism of 5-hydroxy-1-methylhydantoin on paraquat poisoning model].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of 5-hydroxy-1-methylhydantoin (HMH) on kidney injury induced by paraquat (PQ).Fifteen SPF healthy Kunming mice were randomly divided into normal saline (NS) control group, PQ poisoning model group and HMH intervention group, with 5 mice in each group. PQ poisoning model was challenged by one-time gavage of 30 mg/kg PQ solution. The NS group received the same amount of NS by gavage. The HMH group was given 100 mg/kg of HMH immediately after the model was made and continued to be gavaged. Mice in each group were sacrificed 1 day after HMH gavage and heart blood and renal tissue were harvested for examination. The morphological changes of renal tissue were observed under light microscope by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in renal tissue were detected according to the instructions of the kit. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in renal tissues were detected by Western Blot. The serum metabolites were detected by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), the overall distribution of each sample was observed by principal component analysis (PCA), the accuracy of the model was evaluated by multidimensional analysis orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and the difference metabolites were screened by variable importance in the projection (VIP) value > 1.Light microscopic observation showed that: glomerular structure in NS group was clear, there was no hyperemia and inflammatory cell infiltration in renal interstitium and blood vessels. In PQ group, some glomeruli atrophy and necrosis, capillary congestion in glomeruli, infiltration of inflammatory cells around glomeruli, swelling of renal tubular epithelial cells, slight stenosis of lumen, and occasional necrosis and exfoliation of epithelial cells occurred.

Although baru oil is used in domestic cuisine, the chemical characterization of this oil and its effects on lipid metabolism are still poorly understood. Therefore, this study evaluated the fatty  (FA) profile and the effects of baru oil on liver and aorta in a murine model of dyslipidemia. The chromatographic profile of baru oil showed high levels of unsaturated FAs, especially oleic . Saturated FAs, such as  and lignoceric acids, were found in lower amounts. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in male Wistar rats by daily administration of a lipid emulsion by gavage for 15 weeks. Biochemical and histopathological analysis were performed on serum, aorta, and liver. The results demonstrated that animals developed marked hypercholesterolemia, liver steatosis, and increased lipid peroxidation in the aorta. Treatment with baru oil attenuated lipid peroxidation and drastically reduced liver damage, especially ballooning degeneration and steatosis.

The preimplantation embryo can utilize the fatty acids (FA) therein via direct incorporation into cell membrane lipid bilayers and for  production via β-oxidation. The FA concentration and composition of the oviduct (OF) and uterine fluid (UF) might be regulated by ovarian hormones to meet the changing needs of the growing embryo. In our study, we analyzed the FA profile of blood plasma (BP) and reproductive fluid samples obtained post mortem from slaughtered mares by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Cycle stage was determined by visual evaluation of the ovary and measurement of plasma progesterone. No major effect of cycle stage on the FA profile was observed. However, the composition of FA was different between BP and both OF and UF. While linoleic, stearic, oleic and  were the four most prevalent FA in both BP and reproductive fluids, the latter contained higher concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and dihomo-γ-linolenic . The finding suggests selective endometrial transport mechanisms from plasma into the reproductive fluids or increased endometrial synthesis of selected FA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic  (32%),  (15.88%), oleic  (10.00%), linoleic  (9.95%) and malvalic  (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample weight, volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation  (E), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS) and Gibbs free  in transition state theory (ΔG) were 37.91 kJ mol, 35.14 kJ mol, - 239.58 J mol K and 79.81 kJ mol respectively.

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of  (C16:0) on milk production and insulin sensitivity in cows. Twenty multiparous mid-lactation Holstein cows were enrolled in a study consisting of a 5-d covariate, 49-d treatment, and 14-d posttreatment period. All cows received a common sorghum silage-based diet and were randomly assigned to a diet containing no supplemental fat (control; n=10; 138±45d in milk) or C16:0 at 4% of ration DM (PALM; 98% C16:0; n=10; 136±44d in milk). Blood and milk were collected at routine intervals. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (300mg/kg of body weight) were performed at d -1, 24, and 49 relative to start of treatment. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using a mixed model with fixed effects of treatment and time, and milk yield served as a covariate. The PALM treatment increased milk yield by wk 7. Furthermore, PALM increased milk fat yield and -corrected milk at wk 3 and 7. Changes in milk production occurred in parallel with enhanced  intake. Increased milk fat yield during PALM treatment was due to increased C16:0 and C16:1 incorporation; PALM had no effect on concentration of milk components, BW, or body condition score. Two weeks posttreatment, -corrected milk and milk fat yield remained elevated in PALM-fed cows whereas yields of milk were similar between treatments. Increased milk fat yield after PALM treatment was due to increased de novo lipogenesis and uptake of preformed fatty acids. The basal concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in plasma increased by d 4, 6, and 8 of PALM treatment, a response not observed thereafter. Although PALM supplementation did not modify insulin, glucose, or triacylglycerol levels in plasma, total cholesterol in plasma was elevated by wk 3. Estimated insulin sensitivity was lower during the first week of PALM treatment; however, glucose disposal following glucose tolerance tests was not modified. In contrast, C16:0 feeding reduced glucose-stimulated NEFA disappearance by wk 7. Results demonstrate that increasing dietary  from C16:0 for 7wk improves milk yield and milk composition without modifying systemic glucose tolerance. Reduced glucose-stimulated NEFA disappearance with C16:0 feeding and elevated circulating NEFA may reflect changes in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Whether the association with myocardial infarction (MI) also differs across individual SFAs is unclear. We examined the association between consumption of individual SFAs, differing in chain lengths ranging from 4 through 18 carbons, and risk of MI.We used data from 22,050 and 53,375 participants from EPIC-Norfolk (UK) and EPIC-Denmark, respectively. Baseline SFA intakes were assessed through validated, country-specific food frequency questionnaires. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate associations between intakes of individual SFAs and MI risk, for each cohort separately.During median follow-up times of 18.8 years in EPIC-Norfolk and 13.6 years in Denmark, respectively, 1204 and 2260 MI events occurred. Mean (±SD) total SFA intake was 13.3 (±3.5) en% in EPIC-Norfolk, and 12.5 (±2.6) en% in EPIC-Denmark. After multivariable adjustment, intakes of C12:0 (lauric ) and C14:0 (myristic ) inversely associated with MI risk in EPIC-Denmark (HR upper versus lowest quintile: 0.80 (95%CI: 0.66, 0.96) for both SFAs). Intakes in the third and fourth quintiles of C4:0-C10:0 also associated with lower MI risk in EPIC-Denmark. Moreover, substitution of C16:0 () and C18:0 (stearic ) with plant proteins resulted in a reduction of MI risk in EPIC-Denmark (HR per 1 %: 0.86 (95%CI: 0.78, 0.95) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.79, 0.96) respectively). No such associations were found in EPIC-Norfolk.The results from the present study suggest that the association between SFA and MI risk depends on the carbon chain-length of the SFA.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The labeling of viruses can be achieved noncovalently but site-specifically by linking the cluster to the hydrophobic pocket of a virus via a lipid-like pocket factor. We have estimated the binding affinities of three different pocket factors of echovirus 1 (EV1) in molecular dynamics simulations combined with non-equilibrium free- calculations. We have also studied the effects on binding affinities with a pocket factor linked to the AupMBA nanocluster in different protonation states. Although the absolute binding affinities are over-estimated for all the systems, the trend is in agreement with recent experiments.3 Our results suggest that the natural pocket factor () can be replaced by molecules pleconaril (drug) and its derivative Kirtan1 that have higher estimated binding affinities. Our results also suggest that including the gold nanocluster does not decrease the affinity of the pocket factor to the virus, but the affinity is sensitive to the protonation state of the nanocluster, i.e., to pH conditions.

PA is the most common saturated fatty  accounting for 20-30% of total fatty acids in the human body and can be provided in the diet or synthesized endogenously via  lipogenesis (DNL). PA tissue content seems to be controlled around a well-defined concentration, and changes in its intake do not influence significantly its tissue concentration because the exogenous source is counterbalanced by PA endogenous biosynthesis. Particular physiopathological conditions and nutritional factors may strongly induce DNL, resulting in increased tissue content of PA and disrupted homeostatic control of its tissue concentration. The tight homeostatic control of PA tissue concentration is likely related to its fundamental physiological role to guarantee membrane physical properties but also to consent protein palmitoylation, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) biosynthesis, and in the lung an efficient surfactant activity. In order to maintain membrane phospholipids (PL) balance may be crucial an optimal intake of PA in a certain ratio with unsaturated fatty acids, especially PUFAs of both n-6 and n-3 families. However, in presence of other factors such as positive  balance, excessive intake of carbohydrates (in particular mono and disaccharides), and a sedentary lifestyle, the mechanisms to maintain a steady state of PA concentration may be disrupted leading to an over accumulation of tissue PA resulting in dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, increased ectopic fat accumulation and increased inflammatory tone via toll-like receptor 4. It is therefore likely that the controversial data on the association of dietary PA with detrimental health effects, may be related to an excessive imbalance of dietary PA/PUFA ratio which, in certain physiopathological conditions, and in presence of an enhanced DNL, may further accelerate these deleterious effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405968>Resistance exercise training and in vitro skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in older adults.</a></h2><p>Whether resistance exercise training (RET) improves skeletal muscle substrate oxidative capacity and reduces mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species in older adults remains unclear. To address this, 19 older males (≥60 years) were randomized to a RET (n = 11) or to a waitlist control group (n = 8) that remained sedentary for 12 weeks. RET was comprised of three upper body and four lower body movements on resistance machines. One set of 8-12 repetitions to failure of each movement was performed on three nonconsecutive days/week. Improvements in chest press and leg press strength were assessed using a three-repetition maximum (3 RM). Body composition was assessed via dual  X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at baseline and at both 3 weeks and 12 weeks. Palmitate and pyruvate oxidation rates were measured from the (14)CO2 produced from [1-(14)C]  and [U-(14)C] pyruvate, respectively, during incubation of muscle homogenates. PGC-1α, TFAM, and PPARδ levels were quantified using qRT-PCR Citrate synthase (CS) and β-HAD activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay. There were no significant changes in body weight or body composition following the intervention. Chest press and leg press strength (3RM) increased ~34% (both P < 0.01) with RET There were no significant changes in pyruvate or fatty  oxidation or in the expression of target genes with the intervention. There was a modest increase (P < 0.05) in βHAD activity with RET at 12 weeks but the change in CS enzyme activity was not significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in ROS production in either group following RET Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that 12 weeks of low volume RET does not increase skeletal muscle oxidative capacity or reduce ROS production in older adults.© 2016 The Authors.

In recent years, research has made significant advances in terms of understanding the impact of dietary components on metabolic-inflammation, within the context of obesity, type-2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD risk. Our work demonstrated that different fatty acids differentially modulate metabolic-inflammation, initially focusing on Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing three protein (NLRP3) inflammasome mediated IL-1β biology and insulin signalling. However, the paradigm is more complex, wherein data from the immunology field clearly show that nature of cellular  metabolism is a key determinant of inflammation. Whilst metabolic-inflammation is a critical biological interaction, there is a paucity of data in relation to the nature and the extent to which nutritional status affects metabolic-inflammation. The complex paradigm will be discussed within the context of if/how dietary components, in particular fatty acids, may modulate obesity, T2D and CVD risk, via inflammatory and metabolic processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085382>Variant Amino  Residues Alter the Enzyme Activity of Peanut Type 2 Diacylglycerol Acyltransferases.</a></h2><p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final step in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis via the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of diacylglycerol. This reaction is a major control point in the Kennedy pathway for biosynthesis of TAG, which is the most important form of stored metabolic  in most oil-producing plants. In this study, Arachis hypogaea type 2 DGAT (AhDGAT2) genes were cloned from the peanut cultivar 'Luhua 14.' Sequence analysis of 11 different peanut cultivars revealed a gene family of 8 peanut DGAT2 genes (designated AhDGAT2a-h). Sequence alignments revealed 21 nucleotide differences between the eight ORFs, but only six differences result in changes to the predicted amino  (AA) sequences. A representative full-length cDNA clone (AhDGAT2a) was characterized in detail. The biochemical effects of altering the AhDGAT2a sequence to include single variable AA residues were tested by mutagenesis and functional complementation assays in transgenic yeast systems. All six mutant variants retained enzyme activity and produced lipid droplets in vivo. The N6D and A26P mutants also displayed increased enzyme activity and/or total cellular fatty  (FA) content. N6D mutant mainly increased the content of palmitoleic , and A26P mutant mainly increased the content of . The A26P mutant grew well both in the presence of oleic and C18:2, but the other mutants grew better in the presence of C18:2. AhDGAT2 is expressed in all peanut organs analyzed, with high transcript levels in leaves and flowers. These levels are comparable to that found in immature seeds, where DGAT2 expression is most abundant in other plants. Over-expression of AhDGAT2a in tobacco substantially increased the FA content of transformed tobacco seeds. Expression of AhDGAT2a also altered transcription levels of endogenous tobacco lipid metabolic genes in transgenic tobacco, apparently creating a larger carbon 'sink' that supports increased FA levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585412>Pex11a deficiency causes dyslipidaemia and obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes play a central role in lipid metabolism. We previously demonstrated that Pex11a deficiency impairs peroxisome abundance and fatty  β-oxidation and results in hepatic triglyceride accumulation. The role of Pex11a in dyslipidaemia and obesity is investigated here with Pex11a knockout mice (Pex11a ). Metabolic phenotypes including tissue weight, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fatty  profile, oxygen consumption, physical activity were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Pex11a fed with a high-fat diet. Molecular changes and peroxisome abundance in adipose tissue were evaluated through qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence. Pex11a showed increased fat mass, decreased skeletal muscle, higher cholesterol levels, and more severely impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Pex11a consumed less oxygen, indicating a decrease in fatty  oxidation, which is consistent with the accumulation of very long- and long-chain fatty acids. Adipose  (C16:0) levels were elevated in Pex11a , which may be because of dramatically increased fatty  synthase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Pex11a deficiency increased ventricle size and macrophage infiltration, which are related to the reduced physical activity. These data demonstrate that Pex11a deficiency impairs physical activity and energy expenditure, decreases fatty  β-oxidation, increases de novo lipogenesis and results in dyslipidaemia and obesity.© 2018 The Authors.

Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic  supplementation do not modify ewe and lamb metabolic status and performance through weaning.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are involved in the regulation of many physiological pathways, including those involved in gene expression and  metabolism. Through effects on these pathways, fatty acids may have lifelong impacts on offspring development and metabolism via maternal supplementation. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the impact of supplementing a source of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) during late gestation on productive and metabolic responses of ewes and their offspring. Eighty-four gestating ewes (28 pens) were blocked and randomly assigned to a diet with 0.39% added fat during the last 50 d of gestation (d -0). The fat sources were Ca salts of a  fatty  distillate (PFAD) or EPA + DHA. After lambing (d 1), all ewes and lambs were placed on the same pasture. The ewes were weighed and BCS was measured on d -50, -20, 30, and 60 (weaning) of the experiment. Blood samples were taken from the ewes on d -50, -20, 1 (lambing), 30, and 60. Milk yield and composition were measured at 30 d postpartum. Lambs were weighed and bled at d 1, 30, and 60, and ADG was calculated. All plasma samples were analyzed for glucose and NEFA. Ghrelin, prostaglandin E metabolites (PGEM), and the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 11β-PGF2α were measured in d -20 ewe samples. Insulin and adropin were measured in lamb samples at d 60. There was no difference on ewe BW (P = 0.48) or BCS (P = 0.55), or plasma concentrations of glucose (P = 0.57), NEFA (P = 0.44), ghrelin (P = 0.36), PGEM (P = 0.32), and 11β-PGF2α (P = 0.86) between ewes supplemented with PFAD or EPA + DHA. Neither milk yield nor its composition was different (P > 0.10) among treatments. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD or EPA + DHA did not have different BW (P = 0.22), ADG (P = 0.21) or plasma NEFA (P = 0.52), glucose (P = 0.50), insulin (P = 0.59), and adropin (P = 0.72) concentrations. These results suggest that supplementation of EPA and DHA during late gestation did not affect ewe metabolic profile or milk production. Lamb performance and metabolism through weaning were not affected by maternal supplementation with an enriched source of EPA and DHA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27455558>[THE EXCESS OF  FATTY  IN FOOD AS MAIN CAUSE OF LIPOIDOSIS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT CELLS: SKELETAL MYOCYTES, CARDIO-MYOCYTES, PERIPORTAL HEPATOCYTES, KUPFFER MACROPHAGES AND B-CELLS OF PANCREAS].</a></h2><p>In phylogenesis, becoming of biologicalfunctions and biological reactions proceeds with the purpose ofpermanent increasing of "kinetic perfection ".

Although its toxicity has been thoroughly studied at high concentrations, there is still insufficient knowledge on possible alterations of cell function at subtoxic concentrations, which are in fact more representative concentrations of intoxication scenarios. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate the metabolic changes in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) exposed to two subtoxic concentrations of MDMA (LC and LC) for 24 h. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that the metabolic pattern of cells exposed to MDMA discriminates from the controls in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to LC MDMA induces a significant increase in some intracellular metabolites, including oleic  and , and a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, 5-oxoproline, fumarate, malate, phosphoric , α-ketoglutarate and citrate. Extracellular metabolites such as acetophenone, formaldehyde, pivalic , glyoxal and 2-butanone were found significantly increased after exposure to MDMA, compared to controls, whereas 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, nonanal, among others, were found significantly decreased. The panel of discriminatory metabolites is mainly involved in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, fatty  metabolism, glutamate metabolism, antioxidant defenses and possibly changes in the liver enzyme machinery. Overall, these results highlight the potential of the intra- and extracellular metabolome to study alterations triggered by subtoxic concentrations of MDMA in hepatic cell functions, which represents a more realistic appraisal of early toxicity events posed by exposure to this drug. In addition, these results also revealed some metabolites that may be used as potential biomarkers indicative of early events in the hepatotoxicity induced by MDMA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27789474>P66Shc-Induced MicroRNA-34a Causes Diabetic Endothelial Dysfunction by Downregulating Sirtuin1.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus causes vascular endothelial dysfunction and alters vascular microRNA expression. We investigated whether endothelial microRNA-34a (miR-34a) leads to diabetic vascular dysfunction by targeting endothelial sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and asked whether the oxidative stress protein p66Shc governs miR-34a expression in the diabetic endothelium.MiR-34a is upregulated, and Sirt1 downregulated, in aortic endothelium of db/db and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Systemic administration of miR-34a inhibitor, or endothelium-specific knockout of miR-34a, prevents downregulation of aortic Sirt1 and rescues impaired endothelium-dependent aortic vasorelaxation induced by diabetes mellitus. Moreover, overexpression of Sirt1 mitigates impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation caused by miR-34a mimic ex vivo. Systemic infusion of miR-34a inhibitor or genetic ablation of endothelial miR-34a prevents downregulation of endothelial Sirt1 by high glucose. MiR-34a is upregulated, Sirt1 is downregulated, and oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) is induced in endothelial cells incubated with high glucose or the free fatty  palmitate in vitro. Increase of hydrogen peroxide and induction of endothelial miR-34a by high glucose or palmitate in vitro is suppressed by knockdown of p66shc. In addition, overexpression of wild-type but not redox-deficient p66Shc upregulates miR-34a in endothelial cells. P66Shc-stimulated upregulation of endothelial miR-34a is suppressed by cell-permeable antioxidants. Finally, mice with global knockdown of p66Shc are protected from diabetes mellitus-induced upregulation of miR-34a and downregulation of Sirt1 in the endothelium.These data show that hyperglycemia and elevated free fatty acids in the diabetic milieu recruit p66Shc to upregulate endothelial miR-34a via an oxidant-sensitive mechanism, which leads to endothelial dysfunction by targeting Sirt1.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128217>Altering the ratio of dietary , stearic, and oleic acids in diets with or without whole cottonseed affects nutrient digestibility,  partitioning, and production responses of dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of varying the ratio of dietary  (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and oleic (cis-9 C18:1) acids in basal diets containing soyhulls or whole cottonseed on nutrient digestibility,  partitioning, and production response of lactating dairy cows. Twenty-four mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows were used in a split-plot Latin square design. Cows were allocated to a main plot receiving either a basal diet with soyhulls (SH, n = 12) or a basal diet with whole cottonseed (CS, n = 12) that was fed throughout the experiment. Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty  (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased body weight (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased  partitioning toward body reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased  partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased  partitioned to body reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased  output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased  storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

In recent years, numerous reports have studied the alterations in gene expressions and protein profiles in heat-stressed pigs. However, the use of metabolome to unravel adaptive mechanisms of finishing pig in response to chronic HS have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic HS on serum metabolome in finishing pigs, and to identify the biomarkers of heat stress. Pigs (n = 8 per treatment) were exposed to either thermal neutral (TN; 22 °C) or heat stress (HS, 30 °C) conditions for three weeks. Serum metabonomics of TN- and HS-treated pigs were compared using the GC-MS approach. Metabonomics analysis revealed that twenty-four metabolites had significantly different levels in TN compared to HS (variable importance in the projection values >1 and  < 0.05). These metabolites are involved in carbohydrate, amino , fatty , amines metabolism, and gut microbiome-derived metabolism. Three serum monoses (glucose, mannose 2, and galactose) and 6-phosphogluconic  were decreased, indicating insufficient source of fuel for  supply, resulting in negative  balance (NEB) in heat-stressed pigs. Increased levels of non-esterified fatty  (myristic , , and linoleic ) and short-chain fatty acids (3-hydroxybutanoic  and maleic ) suggested fat decomposition compensating for  shortage, which was an adaptive response to NEB. Increased concentrations of fluorine, lyxose 1, and D-galacturonic  were significantly correlated with the levels of acute phase proteins (HP, LBP, α2-HSG, and Lysozyme), suggesting acute phase response in HS-stressed pigs. These metabolites are expected to be novel biomarkers of chronic HS in pigs, yet the use of which awaits further validation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554895>Palmitoleic  (16:1n7) increases oxygen consumption, fatty  oxidation and ATP content in white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated that palmitoleic  (16:1n7) increases lipolysis, glucose uptake and glucose utilization for  production in white adipose cells. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that palmitoleic  modulates bioenergetic activity in white adipocytes.For this, 3 T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes in the presence (or absence) of  (16:0) or palmitoleic (16:1n7)  at 100 or 200 μM. The following parameters were evaluated: lipolysis, lipogenesis, fatty  (FA) oxidation, ATP content, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass, citrate synthase activity and protein content of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes.Treatment with 16:1n7 during 9 days raised basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, FA incorporation into triacylglycerol (TAG), FA oxidation, oxygen consumption, protein expression of subunits representing OXPHOS complex II, III, and V and intracellular ATP content. These effects were not observed in adipocytes treated with 16:0.Palmitoleic , by concerted action on lipolysis, FA esterification, mitochondrial FA oxidation, oxygen consumption and ATP content, does enhance white adipocyte  expenditure and may act as local hormone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28663370>Short-term starvation is a strategy to unravel the cellular capacity of oxidizing specific exogenous/endogenous substrates in mitochondria.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial oxidation of nutrients is tightly regulated in response to the cellular environment and changes in  demands.  studies evaluating the mitochondrial capacity of oxidizing different substrates are important for understanding metabolic shifts in physiological adaptations and pathological conditions, but may be influenced by the nutrients present in the culture medium or by the utilization of endogenous stores. One such influence is exemplified by the Crabtree effect (the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial respiration) as most  experiments are performed in glucose-containing media. Here, using high-resolution respirometry, we evaluated the oxidation of endogenous or exogenous substrates by cell lines harboring different metabolic profiles. We found that a 1-h deprivation of the main energetic nutrients is an appropriate strategy to abolish interference of endogenous or undesirable exogenous substrates with the cellular capacity of oxidizing specific substrates, namely glutamine, pyruvate, glucose, or palmitate, in mitochondria. This approach primed mitochondria to immediately increase their oxygen consumption after the addition of the exogenous nutrients. All starved cells could oxidize exogenous glutamine, whereas the capacity for oxidizing palmitate was limited to human hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells and to C2C12 mouse myoblasts that differentiated into myotubes. In the presence of exogenous glucose, starvation decreased the Crabtree effect in Huh7 and C2C12 cells and abrogated it in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells. Interestingly, the fact that the Crabtree effect was observed only for mitochondrial basal respiration but not for the maximum respiratory capacity suggests it is not caused by a direct effect on the electron transport system.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012856>Increased FNDC5/Irisin expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5)/Irisin, a novel -regulating hormone, is associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. It is produced in low amounts by normal hepatic tissue, while in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which aberrant de novo lipogenesis (DNL) occurs, the hepatic expression of FNDC5/Irisin is still unknown. The gene expression of FNDC5/Irisin, associated to key regulators of DNL, inflammation and cancer progression was evaluated in liver tissue of 18 patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation and of 18 deceased donors. Hepatic mRNA expression of FNDC5/Irisin and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), main enzymatic regulator of DNL, were significantly higher in HCC patients than in donors (p<0.0001 and p=0.015, respectively). The hepatic mRNA expression of the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) tended to be higher in HCC patients than in donors (p=0.06). Only in HCC patients, hepatic FNDC5/Irisin strongly correlated with the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, SCD-1, NOTCH1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-6 mRNA expression. Further, in HCC patients, FNDC5/Irisin mRNA tended to correlate to plasma lipid profile namely triglycerides, /linoleic  and polyunsaturated fatty /saturated fatty  ratios. In conclusion, HCC-liver tissue over-expressed FNDC5/Irisin in association with gene expression of mediators involved in lipogenesis, inflammation and cancer, suggesting a possible protective role of the hormone from the liver damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, the changes in the climate and soil topography influence the growth and development as well as canopy level of the lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, Zilla spinosa Turr (Zilla) plants with similar age and size were collected from three main sectors (upstream, midstream, and downstream) of Wadi Hagul during spring (April) and summer (July) seasons. Environmental stresses evoked reduction in the  trapping pigments concomitant with increments in chlorophyll fluorescence in summer harvested plants particularly at downstream. Furthermore, the biofuels generating compounds including carbohydrate, lignin, and lipid making the plant biomasses are greatly affected by environmental conditions. Greater amount of lignin was estimated in summer harvested Z. spinosa shoots particularly at downstream. Moreover, the total oil content which is a promising source of biodiesel was considerably decreased during summer season particularly at downstream. The physical properties of the lipids major constituent fatty  methyl esters determine the biofuel properties and contribute in the adaptation of plants against environmental stresses. Hence, the analysis of fatty  profile showed significant modifications under combined drought and heat stress displayed in the summer season. The maximum increase in saturated fatty  levels including tridecanoic  (C13:0), pentadeanoic  (C15:0),  (C16:0), and stearic  (C18:0) were estimated in spring harvested Z. spinosa aerial portions particularly at midstream. In spite of the reduction in the total oil content, a marked increase in the value of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids ratio and thereby the unsaturation index were achieved during the dry summer period. Henceforth, these seasonal and spatial variations in fatty acids profiles may contribute in the acclimatization of Z. spinosa plants to soil water scarcity associated with heat stress experienced during summer. In addition, the alterations in the fatty  profiles may match biofuel requirements. In conclusion, the most adequate growing season (spring) will be decisive for achieving high lipid productivity associated with improved biofuel quality in terms of high saturated fatty acids percentage that improves its cetane number. However, the dry summer season enhanced the accumulation of greater amount of lignin that may enhance the biodiesel quantity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820744>Chemical composition, in vitro gas production, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silage (Brassica napus) with four levels of molasses.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four levels of molasses on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, methane production and fatty  profile of canola silages.

These events are highly dependent on glucose utilization and inhibited by vitamin E (VE) (α-tocopherol) administration. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing lipid metabolism in the gastric mucosa and ethanol-induced gastric damage and the effect of α-tocopherol administration. For this, rates of fatty  β-oxidation and lipogenesis were tested in gastric mucosa samples. Through histological analysis, we found loss of the mucosa's superficial epithelium, which became gradually normalized during the recovery period. Proliferation of gastric mucosa occurred with augmented formation of β-oxidation by-products, diminished synthesis of triacylglycerols (TGs), as well as of phospholipids, and a reduced cytoplasmic NAD/NADH ratio, whereas the mitochondrial redox NAD/NADH ratio was much less affected. In addition, α-tocopherol increased  utilization in the gastric mucosa, which was accompanied by the induction of 'mirror image' effects on the cell redox state, reflected in an inhibited cell gastric mucosa proliferation by the vitamin administration. In conclusion, the present study shows, for the first time, the role of lipid metabolism in the adaptive cell gastric mucosa changes that drive proliferation after a chronic insult. Moreover, α-tocopherol increased gastric mucosa utilization of  associated with  production. These events could be associated with its antioxidant properties in co-ordination with regulation of genes and cell pathways, including changes in the cell NAD/NADH redox state.© 2018 The Author(s).

Biodiesel, an alternative fuel, derived from oleaginous microbes has been promising because of short incubation time and easy to scale up. Oleaginous yeast Trichosporon sp. is capable of utilizing glycerol and agro-residues for enhanced lipid synthesis. Lipid extraction from Trichosporon sp. biomass showed highest lipid content with ultrasonic assisted extraction (43 ± 0.33%, w/w) coupled with process parameters than the conventional Soxhlet (30 ± 0.28%, w/w) and Binary solvent [choloroform:methanol, (2:1, v/v)] methods (36 ± 0.38%, w/w), respectively. The standardized process parameters of ultrasonic assisted extraction coupled with chloroform/methanol solvent system resulted 95-97% of conversion efficiency in 20 min at 30 °C with a frequency of 50 Hz and 2800 W power, respectively. Enzymatic transesterification of yeast biomass lipid obtained 85% of fatty  methyl esters that are predominant with oleic  methyl ester followed by  and stearic  methyl esters, respectively. These results substantiate that the ultrasonic assisted extraction is a potential green extraction technique that had reduced time, energy and solvent consumption without compromising on lipid quality.

However, the biochemical mechanisms regarding asthma are not completely understood. Thus, we performed of metabolomic study for understanding of the biochemical events by monitoring of altered metabolism and biomarkers in asthma. In mice plasma, 27 amino acids(AAs), 24 fatty acids(FAs) and 17 organic acids(OAs) were determined by ethoxycarbonyl(EOC)/methoxime(MO)/tert-butyldimethylsilyl(TBDMS) derivatives with GC-MS. Their percentage composition normalized to the corresponding mean levels of control group.

The Mann-Whitney test revealed 25 metabolites, including eight AAs, nine FAs and eight OAs, which were significantly different (p<0.05), and orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis revealed a clear separation of the two groups. In classification analysis,  and methionine were the main metabolites for discrimination between asthma and the control followed by pipecolic, lactic, α-ketoglutaric, and linoleic acids for high classification accuracy as potential biomarkers.

Up to concentrations of 1 mM Ca2+, each system reached equilibrium, and Ca2+:PA surface complexation gave rise to a lower  state revealed by elevated surface pressures relative to water. We show that PA films are not thermodynamically stable at marine aerosol-relevant Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] ≥ 10 mM). IRRAS and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy were used to investigate the surface presence of PA on high concentration Ca2+ aqueous subphases. Non-equilibrium relaxation (NER) experiments were also conducted and monitored by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) to determine the effect of the Ca2+ ions on PA stability. At high surface pressures, the relaxation mechanisms of PA varied among the systems and were dependent on Ca2+ concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899329>Proteomic profiling and integrated analysis with transcriptomic data bring new insights in the stress responses of  after an arrest during high-temperature ethanol fermentation.</a></h2><p>The thermotolerant yeast  is a potential candidate for high-temperature fermentation. When  was used for high-temperature ethanol fermentation, a fermentation arrest was observed during the late fermentation stage and the stress responses have been investigated based on the integration of RNA-Seq and metabolite data. In order to bring new insights into the cellular responses of  after the fermentation arrest during high-temperature ethanol fermentation, quantitative proteomic profiling and integrated analysis with transcriptomic data were performed in this study.Samples collected at 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 h during high-temperature fermentation were subjected to isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic profiling and integrated analysis with transcriptomic data. The correlations between transcripts and proteins for the comparative group 16 h vs 14 h accounted for only 4.20% quantified proteins and 3.23% differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), respectively, much higher percentages of correlations (30.56%-59.11%) were found for other comparative groups (i.e., 18 h vs 14 h, 20 h vs 14 h, and 22 h vs 14 h). According to Spearman correlation tests between transcriptome and proteome (the absolute value of a correlation coefficient between 0.5 and 1 indicates a strong correlation), poor correlations were found for all quantified proteins ( = - 0.0355 to 0.0138), DEPs ( = - 0.0079 to 0.0233) and the DEPs with opposite expression trends to corresponding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( = - 0.0478 to 0.0636), whereas stronger correlations were observed in terms of the DEPs with the same expression trends as the correlated DEGs ( = 0.5593 to 0.7080). The results of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) verification indicate that the iTRAQ results were reliable. After the fermentation arrest, a number of proteins involved in transcription, translation, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  metabolism were down-regulated, some molecular chaperones and proteasome proteins were up-regulated, the ATPase activity significantly decreased, and the total fatty acids gradually accumulated. In addition, the contents of , oleic , C16, C18, C22 and C24 fatty acids increased by 16.77%, 28.49%, 14.14%, 26.88%, 628.57% and 125.29%, respectively.This study confirmed some biochemical and enzymatic alterations provoked by the stress conditions in the specific case of : such as decreases in transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation, alterations in cellular fatty  composition, and increases in the abundance of molecular chaperones and proteasome proteins. These findings provide potential targets for further metabolic engineering towards improvement of the stress tolerance in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955643>Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data of early and middle season Hass avocados under heat treatment.</a></h2><p>Ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocados results in inconsistent quality fruit delivered to the triggered and ready to eat markets. This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver  for the alternative ripening pathways. l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples. Our study provides new insights into the effectiveness of HS in synchronizing ripening of Hass avocados.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial  supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of  and oleic  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing  and oleic  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

It has been reported that the injection of hemin improves lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in various genetic models. However, the effect of hemin supplementation in food on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity is still unclear, and whether hemin directly affects cellular insulin sensitivity is yet to be elucidated. Here we show that hemin enhances insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptors, Akt, Gsk3β, FoxO1 and cytoplasmic translocation of FoxO1 in cultured primary hepatocytes under insulin-resistant conditions. Furthermore, hemin diminishes the accumulation of triglyceride and increases in free fatty  content in primary hepatocytes induced by palmitate. Oral administration of hemin decreases body weight,  intake, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and improves insulin and glucose tolerance as well as hepatic insulin signaling and hepatic steatosis in male mice fed a high-fat diet. In addition, hemin treatment decreases the mRNA and protein levels of some hepatic genes involved in lipogenic regulation, fatty  synthesis and storage, and increases the mRNA level and enzyme activity of CPT1 involved in fatty  oxidation. These data demonstrate that hemin can improve lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in both cultured hepatocytes and mice fed a high-fat diet, and show the potential beneficial effects of hemin from food on lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27146317>Utilization of milk fatty acids by the suckling Iberian piglets.</a></h2><p>A total of 16 pure-bred Iberian (IB) sows, all of them suckling six piglets, were used, eight of them in each of the two consecutive trials (1 and 2). Daily milk yield and composition were determined weekly over a 34-day lactation period. Within each litter, one piglet at birth and four piglets on day 35 of life were slaughtered. Milk intake per piglet tended to be greater in trial 2 (832 v. 893 g/day; P=0.066), but piglets grew at 168±3.3 g/day, irrespective of the trial. In the IB sow milk, the linoleic (LA) : linolenic (LNA)  ratio averaged 14.6 and 15.2 in trial 1 and trial 2, respectively. A fivefold increase in piglet body fat content was observed over lactation (P<0.001). Most of this fat (81.4%) was present in the carcass. After 34 days of lactation, whole-body relative content of , palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids were very close to those in the milk consumed, suggesting direct deposition. Daily deposition of LA derivatives and of LNA and its derivatives was found to be extremely low (<0.02 g, on average). Moreover, some of the arachidonic  (ARA) in tissues of the IB piglet at birth disappeared throughout the lactating period. An overall fractional deposition for total fatty acids (FA) was 0.409. Fractional oxidation (disappearance) rates were 0.939 and 0.926 for n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated FA. The overall rate of disappearance for the major non-essential FA (myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids), estimated as 1-the overall fractional deposition rate, was 0.546. It is concluded that the high degree of FA unsaturation, high oxidation rate of LA and LNA, and poor synthesis of ARA from LA and of docosahexaenoic  from LNA found in the suckling piglet might increase the  cost of whole-body fat accretion, a contributor to the observed low efficiency of use of milk  for growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879815>Milk production and nutrient digestibility responses to triglyceride or fatty  supplements enriched in .</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of feeding triglyceride and fatty  (FA) supplements enriched in  (PA; C16:0) on production and nutrient digestibility responses of mid-lactation dairy cows. Fifteen Holstein cows (137 ± 49 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a control diet (CON; no added PA) or 1.5% FA added as either a FA supplement (PA-FA) or a triglyceride supplement (PA-TG). The PA supplements replaced soyhulls, and diets were balanced for glycerol content. Periods were 21 d in length with sample and data collection occurring during the final 5 d. Compared with CON, PA treatments increased dry matter (66.5 vs. 63.9%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) apparent digestibility (42.0 vs. 38.2%). Although PA treatments tended to increase 18-carbon FA apparent digestibility (79.1 vs. 77.9%), PA treatments decreased 16-carbon (63.1 vs. 75.8%) and total FA (72.0 vs. 76.5%) apparent digestibilities compared with CON. The PA treatments increased milk fat content (3.60 vs. 3.41%), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.60 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (570 vs. 471 g/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk (47.6 vs. 46.5 kg/d), and -corrected milk (47.4 vs. 46.6 kg/d) compared with CON. The PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake (28.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d), milk yield (47.0 vs. 47.4 kg/d), milk protein yield (1.42 vs. 1.45 kg/d), milk lactose yield (2.29 vs. 2.31 kg/d), yield of <16-carbon milk FA (360 vs. 370 g/d), yield of >16-carbon milk FA (642 vs. 630 g/d), body weight (720 vs. 723 kg), or body condition score (3.14 vs. 3.23). We did not observe differences in digestibilities of dry matter, NDF, and 18-carbon FA between PA-TG and PA-FA. In contrast, PA-FA increased 16-carbon (68.6 vs. 57.6%) and total FA apparent digestibility (73.8 vs. 70.1%) compared with PA-TG. This resulted in PA-FA supplementation increasing the apparent digestibility of the PA supplement by ∼10 percentage points compared with PA-TG. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased 16-carbon FA intake by 60 g/d, absorbed 16-carbon FA by 86 g/d, and absorbed total FA by 85 g/d. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased dry matter intake (29.1 vs. 27.8 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (596 vs. 545 g/d), and tended to increase milk yield (47.6 vs. 46.4 kg/d), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.66 kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk (48.1 vs. 47.2 kg/d). In conclusion, the production response of dairy cows to PA tended to be greater for a FA supplement compared with a triglyceride supplement. Overall, PA increased NDF digestibility, milk fat yield, -corrected milk, and feed efficiency in mid-lactation dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Phthalate has been considered an obesogen and contributing to overweight and obesity in children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in urine metabolites in response to the environmental phthalate exposure among overweight or obese children, and to investigate the metabolic mechanisms involved in the obesogenic effect of phthalate on children at puberty.Within the national Puberty Timing and Health Effects in Chinese Children (PTHEC) study, 69 overweight/obese children and 80 normal weight children were selected into the current study according to their puberty timing and WGOC (The Working Group for obesity in China) references. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate monoesters (MMP, MEP, MnBP, MEHP, MEOHP and MEHHP) were measured using API 2000 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESIMS/MS). Metabolomic profiling of spot urine was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed urinary metabolites associated with phthalate monoesters exposure were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and multiple linear regression models. In addition, the candidate metabolites were regressed to obesity indices with multiple linear regression models and logistic regression models in all subjects.Compared with normal weight children, higher levels of MnBP were detected in urinary samples of children with overweight and obesity. After adjusting for confounders including chronological age, gender, puberty onset, daily  intake and physical activity and socio-economic level, positive association remained between urinary MnBP concentration and childhood overweight/obesity [OR = 1.586, 95% CI:1.043,2.412]. We observed elevated MnBP concentration was significantly correlated with increased levels of monostearin, 1-monopalmitin, stearic , itaconic , glycerol 3-phosphate, 5-methoxytryptamine, kyotorphin, 1-methylhydantoin, d-alanyl-d-alanine, pyrrole-2-carboxylic , 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol, and butyraldehyde. Meanwhile, increased MnBP concentration was also significantly correlated with decreased levels of lactate, glucose 6-phosphate, d-fructose 6-phosphate, , 4-acetamidobutyric , l-glutamic , n-acetyl-l-phenylalanine, iminodiacetic , hydroxyproline, pipecolinic , l-ornithine, n-acetyl-l-glutamic , guanosine, cytosin, and (s)-mandelic  in the normal weight subjects. The observations indicated that MnBP exposure was related to global urine metabolic abnormalities characterized by disrupting arginine and proline metabolism and increasing oxidative stress and fatty  reesterification. Among the metabolic markers related to MnBP exposure, 1-methylhydantoin, pyrrole-2-carboxylic  and monostearin were found to be positively correlated with obesity indices, while hydroxyproline, l-ornithine, and lactate were negatively associated with overweight/obesity in children.Our results suggested that the disrupted arginine and proline metabolism associated with phthalate exposure might contribute to the development of overweight and obesity in school-age children, providing insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms involved in childhood obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The IVP assay was performed by measuring acylcarnitines (ACs) in the cell culture medium of fibroblasts incubated with  for 96h in the presence of 0-800μM BEZ using tandem mass spectrometry.The IVP assay showed that 100μM BEZ markedly reduced the level of palmitoylcarnitine (C16) in the neonatal-onset, infantile-onset, and myopathic forms of GA2, either increasing or maintaining a high level of acetylcarnitine (C2), which serves as an index of  production via β-oxidation. In the prenatal-onset form, although a small reduction of C16 was also observed in the presence of 100μM BEZ, the level of C2 remained low. At concentrations higher than 100μM, BEZ further decreased the level of ACs including C16, but a concentration over 400μM decreased the level of C2 in most cases.BEZ at 100μM was effective for all GA2 phenotypes except for the prenatal-onset form, as a reduction of C16 without deterioration of C2 is considered to indicate improvement of β-oxidation. The effects of higher doses BEZ could not be estimated by the IVP assay but might be small or nonexistent.Copyright © 2016 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ultrasound pretreatment is a mechanical cell disruption method that has been shown to enhance lipid recovery from algae due to cavitation effects that disrupt algae cell walls. In this study, a locally grown mixture of Chlorella vulgaris/Cyanobacteria leptolyngbya was sonicated in an ultrasonic reactor with a clamp-on transducer prior to solvent lipid extraction. This configuration allows for a non-contact delivery method of ultrasonic  with improved operational advantages (no fouling of transducer, continuous operation, and fully scalable design). A central composite design (CCD) was implemented to statistically analyze and evaluate the effect of ultrasonic power (350-750 W) and treatment time (5-30 min) on lipid yield. Lipid recovery was found to increase with both ultrasonic power and treatment time. Total lipid yields (on dry biomass basis) extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method from Chlorella vulgaris/cyanobacteria co-culture ranged from 8.3% for untreated algae to 16.9% for algae sonicated with 750 W power for 30 min, which corresponds to more than a doubling of lipid recovery due to ultrasound pretreatment. Increased power and treatment times were found to increase the degree of cell disruption as observed in the SEM and TEM images after ultrasonic pretreatment. Additionally, hexane (1:1 v/v) was evaluated as an alternative to the standard Bligh & Dyer (2:2:1.8 v/v/v chloroform/methanol/cell suspension) lipid extraction solvent system. On average, the Bligh and Dyer method extracted on average over twice the amount of lipids compared to hexane extraction. The lipid profile of the algae extracts indicates high concentrations of lauric  (12:0),  (16:0), stearic  (18:0), oleic  (18:1), and linoleic  (18:2). This particular configuration of an ultrasonic system proved to be a viable method for the pretreatment of algae for enhanced lipid yields. Future research should focus on identifying alternative extraction solvents and expanding the range of treatment conditions to optimize the ultrasonic power and treatment times for maximum lipid recovery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs:  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05), alpha linolenic  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Six cows were used, 3/4 American Swiss × Zebu, under a rotational grazing system in a mixed sward with Cynodon plectostachyus, Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha. Furthermore, each cow received daily 4 kg concentrates and 8 kg sorghum silage, which made up the basal diet. The cows were distributed into three two-cow groups. Three treatments were randomly assigned to the groups, using a cross design: (1) control (basal diet), (2) basal diet + CLA (50 g/d) and (3) basal diet + CLA (50 g/d) + PA (412 g/d). The following variables were evaluated: forage intake, milk production, protein, fat and lactose concentration in milk, and milk fatty  (FA) profile. There were no differences in forage intake between treatments; however, there were differences in milk production, protein, fat and lactose yield and fat concentration, which increased significantly in group CLA + PA when compared with group CLA. The concentration of FA synthesised de novo was lower when PA was included in the diet. Adding PA to the diet of grazing cows mitigates the milk fat decline caused by including trans-10, cis-12 CLA in the diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31137596>Impact of Maternal Diet on Human Milk Composition Among Lactating Women in Latvia.</a></h2><p>: Many studies indicate that the maternal diet is an important factor affecting human milk composition. Human milk composition among lactating women in Latvia, as well as the maternal diet during lactation, has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this research was to assess dietary habits and macronutrient intake among lactating women in Latvia and to examine the effect of diet on human milk composition. : Research was conducted between November 2016 and December 2017. Mature human milk samples ( = 61) along with a 72h food diary, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a questionnaire about maternal and infant characteristics were obtained from voluntary women who were recruited via an invitation published in a social media member group for nursing mothers. Fat content in human milk was determined by LVS ISO 2446:2008, protein content was determined by LVS EN ISO 8968-1:2014, lactose was determined by ISO 22662:2007, and the fatty  profile was analyzed using gas chromatography. Dietary data were evaluated using the Finnish food composition database Fineli, release 19 (3 March 2018). : Median values for fat, protein, and lactose in mature human milk were 4.40%, 1.08%, and 6.52%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids in human milk were oleic  (C18:1 n9),  (C16:0), and linoleic  (C18:2 n6) at 34.60%, 24.00%, and 11.00% of total fatty acids, respectively. The  elaidic  (C18:1 n9) level was <0.10% in all human milk samples. Significant, positive associations ( < 0.05) were found between maternal dietary intake of linoleic, α-linolenic, docosahexaenoic, total -monounsaturated, total -polyunsaturated, and total n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of n-6/n-3, and the level of these fatty acids in human milk. Total  and carbohydrate intake among participants were lower, but total fat, saturated fat, and sugar intake were higher than recommended. Protein, linoleic , and α-linolenic  intake were adequate, but docosahexaenoic  intake was noticeably lower than recommended. Women should be supported with information regarding their nutritional needs during lactation and the possible impact of diet on human milk composition. : Macronutrient (fat, protein, and lactose) content in human milk is not affected by maternal diet. Conversely, the human milk fatty  profile is affected by the immediate diet consumed by the mother. Habitual dietary habits can also impact the fatty  profile of human milk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881409>Intake of individual saturated fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease in US men and women: two prospective longitudinal cohort studies.</a></h2><p> To investigate the association between long term intake of individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the risk of coronary heart disease, in two large cohort studies. Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Health professionals in the United States. 73 147 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2012) and 42 635 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010), who were free of major chronic diseases at baseline. Incidence of coronary heart disease (n=7035) was self-reported, and related deaths were identified by searching National Death Index or through report of next of kin or postal authority. Cases were confirmed by medical records review. Mean intake of SFAs accounted for 9.0-11.3%  intake over time, and was mainly composed of lauric  (12:0), myristic  (14:0),  (16:0), and stearic  (18:0; 8.8-10.7% ). Intake of 12:0, 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0 were highly correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficients between 0.38 and 0.93 (all P<0.001). Comparing the highest to the lowest groups of individual SFA intakes, hazard ratios of coronary heart disease were 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.15; P=0.05) for 12:0, 1.13 (1.05 to 1.22; P<0.001) for 14:0, 1.18 (1.09 to 1.27; P<0.001) for 16:0, 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28; P<0.001) for 18:0, and 1.18 (1.09 to 1.28; P<0.001) for all four SFAs combined (12:0-18:0), after multivariate adjustment of lifestyle factors and total  intake. Hazard ratios of coronary heart disease for isocaloric replacement of 1%  from 12:0-18:0 were 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.96; P<0.001) for polyunsaturated fat, 0.95 (0.90 to 1.01; P=0.08) for monounsaturated fat, 0.94 (0.91 to 0.97; P<0.001) for whole grain carbohydrates, and 0.93 (0.89 to 0.97; P=0.001) for plant proteins. For individual SFAs, the lowest risk of coronary heart disease was observed when the most abundant SFA, 16:0, was replaced. Hazard ratios of coronary heart disease for replacing 1%  from 16:0 were 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96; P=0.002) for polyunsaturated fat, 0.92 (0.83 to 1.02; P=0.10) for monounsaturated fat, 0.90 (0.83 to 0.97; P=0.01) for whole grain carbohydrates, and 0.89 (0.82 to 0.97; P=0.01) for plant proteins. Higher dietary intakes of major SFAs are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Owing to similar associations and high correlations among individual SFAs, dietary recommendations for the prevention of coronary heart disease should continue to focus on replacing total saturated fat with more healthy sources of .Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is linked to insulin resistance and a number of serine/threonine kinases including JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K have been implicated in this process. Activation of the  sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases muscle glucose uptake, and in recent years AMPK has been viewed as an important target to counteract insulin resistance. We reported recently that rosemary extract (RE) increased muscle cell glucose uptake and activated AMPK. However, the effect of RE on FFA-induced muscle insulin resistance has never been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of RE in palmitate-induced insulin resistant L6 myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and decreased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Importantly, exposure to RE abolished these effects and the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was restored. Treatment with palmitate increased the phosphorylation/activation of JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K whereas RE completely abolished these effects. RE increased the phosphorylation of AMPK even in the presence of palmitate. Our data indicate that rosemary extract has the potential to counteract the palmitate-induced muscle cell insulin resistance and further studies are required to explore its antidiabetic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748562>Disentangling the photochemical salinity tolerance in Aster tripolium L.: connecting biophysical traits with changes in fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>A profound analysis of A. tripolium photochemical traits under salinity exposure is lacking in the literature, with very few references focusing on its fatty  profile role in photophysiology. To address this, the deep photochemical processes were evaluated by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry coupled with a discrimination of its leaf fatty  profile. Plants exposed to 125-250 mm NaCl showed higher photochemical light harvesting efficiencies and lower  dissipation rates. under higher NaCl exposure, there is evident damage of the oxygen evolving complexes (OECs). On the other hand, Reaction Centre (RC) closure net rate and density increased, improving the  fluxes entering the PS II, in spite of the high amounts of  dissipated and the loss of PS II antennae connectivity.  dissipation was mainly achieved through the auroxanthin pathway. Total fatty  content displayed a similar trend, being also higher under 125-250 mm NaCl with high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The increase in oleic  and  allows the maintenance of the good functioning of the PS II. Also relevant was the high concentration of chloroplastic C16:1t in the individuals subjected to 125-250 mm NaCl, related with a higher electron transport activity and with the organization of the Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC) and thus reducing the activation of  dissipation mechanisms. All these new insights shed some light not only on the photophysiology of this potential cash-crop, but also highlight its important saline agriculture applications of this species as forage and potential source of essential fatty acids.© 2016 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30886030>Environmental temperature alters the overall digestive energetics and differentially affects dietary protein and lipid use in a lizard.</a></h2><p>Processing food (e.g. ingestion, digestion, assimilation) requires  referred to as specific dynamic action (SDA) and is at least partially fuelled by oxidation of the nutrients (e.g. proteins and lipids) within the recently ingested meal. In ectotherms, environmental temperature can affect the magnitude and/or duration of the SDA, but is likely to also alter the mixture of nutrients that are oxidized to cover these costs. Here, we examined metabolic rate, gut passage time, assimilation efficiency and fuel use in the lizard  digesting cricket meals at three ecologically relevant temperatures (20, 25 and 32°C). Crickets were isotopically enriched with C-leucine or C- tracers to distinguish between protein and lipid oxidation, respectively. Our results show that higher temperatures increased the magnitude of the SDA peak (by 318% between 32 and 20°C) and gut passage rate (63%), and decreased the duration of the SDA response (by 20% for males and 48% for females). Peak rate of dietary protein oxidation occurred sooner than peak lipid oxidation at all temperatures (70, 60 and 31 h earlier for 20, 25 and 32°C, respectively). Assimilation efficiency of proteins, but not lipids, was positively related to temperature. Interestingly, the SDA response exhibited a notable circadian rhythm. These results show that temperature has a pronounced effect on digestive energetics in  , and that this effect differs between nutrient classes. Variation in environmental temperatures may thus alter the  budget and nutrient reserves of these animals.© 2019.

The experiment lasted 230 d, with 1 to 120 d in milk (DIM) for indoor feeding (P1), 120 to 200 DIM for mountain grazing (P2), and 200 to 230 DIM for indoor feeding (P3). Grass silage was fed according to appetite during indoor feeding periods. After an adjustment period (1-60 DIM) when the control diet was given to the goats, the animals were subdivided into 3 groups of 10 goats. Treatments (60-230 DIM) were (1) basal concentrate (control; no added fat); (2) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) hydrogenated palm oil enriched with  (POFA); and (3) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) rapeseed oil (RSO). Individual  balances based on  intake and milk production were estimated on 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 200, and 230 DIM. At the same times, body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), body mass index, and body tissue stores using computed tomography were monitored. Silage intake was depressed by POFA throughout the experimental period. Reduced BW and body mass index were observed in the POFA and RSO groups, whereas no effect on BCS or body composition was observed throughout lactation. Generally, a minor decrease in BW was observed from 10 to 120 DIM (only 0.6 kg on average) and the total amount of body lipid was reduced by 4.4 kg. During the mountain grazing period, a further reduction in body lipid stores (2.7 kg) was observed, and BW was reduced by 3.9 kg in the same period. The goats mobilized, on average, 72% of their fat reserves during the first 200 DIM. In this period, dietary fat supplementation did not reduce the mobilization of adipose tissue but resulted in greater milk fat yield (2 kg more, on average, compared with the control group). Milk yield was not affected by POFA or RSO supplementation. Milk fat content was higher in the POFA group than in the control and RSO groups. Milk protein and lactose contents were not affected by lipid supplements. In late lactation, a rapid accumulation of fat deposits followed the intense mobilization during the grazing period. Dietary lipid supplements had no effect on milk fat yield at this stage. Milk production depends heavily on the ability to mobilize body lipid stores, and neither POFA nor RSO supplements at rates used in our study affected this mobilization.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

We hypothesized that increasing PUFA intake in mice would increase peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) expression and activity, and we sought to examine the effect of different PUFA-enriched oils on muscle PPARδ expression. One of the oils we tested was cottonseed oil (CSO) which is primarily linoleic  (53%) and  (24%). Mice fed a CSO-enriched diet (50%  from fat) displayed no change in muscle PPARδ expression; however, in the liver, it was consistently elevated along with its transcriptional coactivator Pgc-1. Male mice were fed chow or CSO-, saturated fat (SFA)-, or linoleic  (18:2)-enriched diets that were matched for macronutrient content for 4 weeks. There were no differences in food intake, body weight, fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, or  expenditure between chow- and CSO-fed mice, whereas SFA-fed mice had increased fat mass and 18:2-fed mice were less glucose tolerant. Metabolomic analyses revealed that the livers of CSO-fed mice closely matched those of chow-fed but significantly differed from SFA- and 18:2-enriched groups. Fatty  composition of the diets and livers revealed an impairment in desaturase activity and the presence of dihydrosterculic  (DHSA) in the CSO-fed mice. The effect of DHSA on PPARδ and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression mimicked that of the CSO-fed mice. Taken together, these data suggest that DHSA from CSO may be an effective means to increase PPARδ expression with concomitant suppression of liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Piglets in all parenteral lipid groups showed differential organ growth versus ENT piglets; whole body growth rate was lowest in IL piglets, yet there were no differences in either  expenditure or (13)C-palmitate oxidation. Plasma homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance demonstrated insulin resistance in IL, but not OV or SL, compared with ENT. The fatty  and acyl-CoA content of the liver, muscle, brain, and plasma fatty acids reflected the composition of the dietary lipids administered. Free carnitine and acylcarnitine (ACT) levels were markedly reduced in the PN groups compared with ENT piglets. Genes associated with oxidative stress and inflammation were increased, whereas those associated with alternative pathways of fatty  oxidation were decreased in all PN groups. Our results show that new generation lipid emulsions directly enrich tissue fatty acids, especially in the brain, and lead to improved growth and insulin sensitivity compared with a soybean lipid emulsion. In all total PN groups, carnitine levels are limiting to the formation of ACTs and gene expression reflects the stress of excess lipid on liver function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28820912>Impact of novel palmitoylated prolactin-releasing peptide analogs on metabolic changes in mice with diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Analogs of anorexigenic neuropeptides, such as prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), have a potential as new anti-obesity drugs. In our previous study,  attached to the N-terminus of PrRP enabled its central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration. In this study, two linkers, γ-glutamic  at Lys11 and a short, modified polyethylene glycol at the N-terminal Ser and/or Lys11, were applied for the palmitoylation of PrRP31 to improve its bioavailability. These analogs had a high affinity and activation ability to the PrRP receptor GPR10 and the neuropeptide FF2 receptor, as well as short-term anorexigenic effect similar to PrRP palmitoylated at the N-terminus. Two-week treatment with analogs that were palmitoylated through linkers to Lys11 (analogs 1 and 2), but not with analog modified both at the N-terminus and Lys11 (analog 3) decreased body and liver weights, insulin, leptin, triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty  plasma levels in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, the expression of uncoupling protein-1 was increased in brown fat suggesting an increase in  expenditure. In addition, treatment with analogs 1 and 2 but not analog 3 significantly decreased urinary concentrations of 1-methylnicotinamide and its oxidation products N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, as shown by NMR-based metabolomics.

Therefore, we used a C to C diet shift experiment and compound-specific δC analysis to estimate the turnover rates of FAs in the polar and neutral fractions of flight muscle lipids (corresponding to membranes and lipid droplets) of exercised and sedentary zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Turnover was fastest for linoleic  (LA; 18:2n6) and  (PA; 16:0), with 95% replacement times of 10.8-17.7 d in the polar fraction and 17.2-32.8 d in the neutral fraction, but was unexpectedly slow for the long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) arachidonic  (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n3) in the polar fraction, with 95% replacement in 64.9-136.5 d. Polar fraction LA and PA turnover was significantly faster in exercised birds (95% replacement in 8.5-13.3 d). Our results suggest that FA turnover in intramuscular lipid droplets is related to FA tissue concentrations and that turnover does not change in response to exercise. In contrast, we found that muscle membrane FA turnover is likely driven by a combination of selective LC-PUFA retention and consumption of shorter-chain FAs in  metabolism. The unexpectedly fast turnover of membrane-associated FAs in muscle suggests that songbirds during migration could substantially remodel their membranes within a single migration stopover, and this may have substantial implications for how the FA composition of diet affects  metabolism of birds during migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28500736>High density lipoprotein (HDL) reverses  induced  metabolism imbalance by switching CD36 and GLUT4 signaling pathways in cardiomyocyte.</a></h2><p>In our previous study  (PA) induced lipotoxicity and switches  metabolism from CD36 to GLUT4 in H9c2 cells. Low level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) is an independent risk factor for cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we in the present study investigated whether HDL can reverse PA induced lipotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. In this study, we treated H9c2 cells with PA to create a hyperlipidemia model in vitro and analyzed for CD36 and GLUT4 metabolic pathway proteins. CD36 metabolic pathway proteins (phospho-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC1α, PPARα, CPT1β, and CD36) were decreased by high PA (150 and 200 μg/μl) concentration. Interestingly, expression of GLUT4 metabolic pathway proteins (p-PI3K and pAKT) were increased at low concentration (50 μg/μl) and decreased at high PA concentration. Whereas, phospho-PKCζ, GLUT4 and PDH proteins expression was increased in a dose dependent manner. PA treated H9c2 cells were treated with HDL and analyzed for cell viability. Results showed that HDL treatment induced cell proliferation efficiency in PA treated cells. In addition, HDL reversed the metabolic effects of PA: CD36 translocation was increased and reduced GLUT4 translocation, but HDL treatment significantly increased CD36 metabolic pathway proteins and reduced GLUT4 pathway proteins. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes showed similar results. In conclusion, HDL reversed palmatic -induced lipotoxicity and  metabolism imbalance in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells and in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cells.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27359060>A new approach of microalgal biomass pretreatment using deep eutectic solvents for enhanced lipid recovery for biodiesel production.</a></h2><p>The biomass of Chlorella sp. was pretreated with three different aqueous deep eutectic solvents (aDESs), i.e. aqueous choline chloride-oxalic  (aCh-O), aqueous choline chloride-ethylene glycol (aCh-EG) and aqueous urea-acetamide (aU-A).

Here, we examined the effect of ACA on learning and memory in senescence-accelerated mice prone 8 (SAMP8). In mice that were fed a control diet containing 0.02% ACA for 25 weeks, the learning ability in the Morris water maze test was significantly enhanced in comparison with mice that were fed the control diet alone. In the Y-maze test, SAMP8 mice showed decreased spontaneous alterations in comparison with senescence-accelerated resistant/1 (SAMR1) mice, a homologous control, which was improved by ACA pretreatment. Serum metabolite profiles were obtained by GC-MS analysis, and each metabolic profile was plotted on a 3D score plot. Based upon the diagram, it can be seen that the distribution areas for the three groups were completely separate. Furthermore, the contents of β-hydroxybutyric  and  in the serum of SAMP8-ACA mice were higher than those of SAMP8-control mice and SAMR1-control mice. We also found that SAMR1 mice did not show histological abnormalities, whereas histological damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in SAMP8-control mice was observed.

Outcome measures were assessed at the end of each phase.Fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic  and oleic  diets than the  diet (all P < 0.01). Fasting HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic  diet than the  and oleic  diets (P < 0.01). The stearic  diet resulted in lower lithocholic  (P = 0.01) and total secondary bile  (SBA) concentrations (P = 0.04) than the oleic  diet. All other outcome measures were similar between diets. Lithocholic  concentrations were positively correlated with fasting LDL-cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.33; P = 0.011). Total SBA, lithocholic , and deoxycholic  concentrations were negatively correlated with fasting HDL cholesterol (r = -0.51 to -0.44; P < 0.01) concentrations and positively correlated with LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol (r = 0.37-0.54; P < 0.01) ratios.Dietary stearic  and oleic  had similar effects on fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations and more favorable ones than .

During digestion, palmitate in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions is hydrolyzed to free  that can subsequently complex with calcium to form insoluble soaps; this may partially explain why formula-fed infants have harder stools than breast-fed infants.This large (n = 488) randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial investigated whether increasing the sn-2 palmitate content of infant formula improves stool consistency and bone mineral content (measured by dual- x-ray absorptiometry), without affecting growth or health. From ∼1 week to 4 months of age, infants were exclusively fed one of three formulae: i) control formula (CF; 16% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 162), (ii) experimental formula 1 (EF1; 43% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 166) or (iii) experimental formula 2 (EF2; 51% of total palmitate at sn-2; n = 160).Intention-to-treat analysis showed softer stools in both EF groups (vs. CF) at ages 2 weeks and 1 and 2 months (p ≤ 0.01), but not 3 and 4 months. At 4 months, all groups had similar growth outcomes while bone mineral content was significantly higher in EF1 (p = 0.0012) and EF2 (p = 0.0002) compared with CF. Comparison of reported adverse events up to 12 months revealed no differences among groups.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of applying a novel method, using either 400 or 500 g fat/kg (treatments FL40 and FL50, respectively), which was enriched in PA and SA at different ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100), on physical and chemical characteristics, ruminal degradability, solubility and in vitro intestinal protein digestibility (IVIPD) of the obtained products. Encapsulation of SBM in fat resulted in greater mean particle size and lower bulk density and protein solubility than unprotected SBM (USBM). Treatment FL50 resulted in increased (p < 0.01) rumen-undegraded protein (RUP) compared to USBM. There were no differences in RUP of SBM when different PA: SA ratios were used. The mean RUP content of treatments FL40 and FL50 (306 and 349 g/kg, respectively) was greater compared to USBM (262 g/kg, p < 0.05), but lower than that for a standard heat-treated SBM (431 g/kg). Values of IVIPD did not differ among SBM, heat-treated SBM and FL40 and FL50 samples, all being greater than 97.8%. In conclusion, encapsulation of SBM with fats enriched in PA and SA proved to be effective in reducing protein solubility and increasing RUP without depressing protein digestibility in the intestine. For validation of the method, in vivo research to investigate the effects of these products on the production of dairy cows is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28655313>Lipids characterization of ultrasound and microwave processed germinated sorghum.</a></h2><p>Cereal crops and oilseeds provide diverse pool of fatty acids with characteristic properties. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of  and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination.Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US: 40%; US: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (t: 5 min; t: 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW: 450 watt; MW: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (t: 15 s; t: 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T, T, T, T) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW, MW) (100-900 watt power) & US (US, US) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (t, t). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty  composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography.The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 ± 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained  (13.73 ± 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 ± 0.02%), stearic (1.07 ± 0.04%), oleic (37.15 ± 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 ± 0.21%), linolenic (1.55 ± 0.04%), arachidic  (0.13 ± 0.01%) and eicosenoic  (0.37 ± 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty  percentage for , stearic and arachidic  was 13.75 ± 0.07%, 1.11 ± 0.09% and 0.15 ± 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 ± 0.09% of linolenic  while amount of eicosenoic  decreased from 0.37 ± 0.02% to 0.31 ± 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic  increased from 0.35 ± 0.02% to 0.40 ± 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted.The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty  analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty  in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739863>Effects of high-fat diet and AMP-activated protein kinase modulation on the regulation of whole-body lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Metabolic flexibility, the capacity to adapt to fuel availability for  production, is crucial for maintaining whole-body  homeostasis. An inability to adequately promote FA utilization is associated with lipid accumulation in peripheral tissues and contributes to the development of insulin resistance. In vivo assays to quantify whole-body lipid oxidation in mouse models of insulin resistance are lacking. We describe a method for assessing whole-body FA oxidation in vivo, as well as tissue-specific lipid uptake in conscious mice. The method relies on intravenous administration of [9,10-H(N)] combined with a non-β-oxidizable palmitate analog, [1-C]2-bromopalmitic . Pretreatment with etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor that prevents the shuttling of FAs into mitochondria, markedly reduced the appearance of the β-oxidation product HO in circulation and reduced lipid uptake by oxidative tissues including heart and soleus muscle. Whole-body fatty oxidation was unaltered between chow- or high-fat-fed WT and transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of the AMPK γ3 subunit (AMPKγ3) in skeletal muscle. High-fat feeding increased lipid oxidation in WT and AMPKγ3 transgenic mice. In conclusion, this technique allows for the assessment of the effect of pharmaceutical agents, as well as gene mutations, on whole-body FA oxidation in mice.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241534>Integrating Extracellular Flux Measurements and Genome-Scale Modeling Reveals Differences between Brown and White Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>White adipocytes are specialized for  storage, whereas brown adipocytes are specialized for  expenditure. Explicating this difference can help identify therapeutic targets for obesity. A common tool to assess metabolic differences between such cells is the Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XF) Analyzer, which measures oxygen consumption and media acidification in the presence of different substrates and perturbagens. Here, we integrate the Analyzer's metabolic profile from human white and brown adipocytes with a genome-scale metabolic model to predict flux differences across the metabolic map. Predictions matched experimental data for the metabolite 4-aminobutyrate, the protein ABAT, and the fluxes for glucose, glutamine, and palmitate. We also uncovered a difference in how adipocytes dispose of nitrogenous waste, with brown adipocytes secreting less ammonia and more urea than white adipocytes. Thus, the method and software we developed allow for broader metabolic phenotyping and provide a distinct approach to uncovering metabolic differences.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, recent advances in molecular toxicology have revealed that NP exposure can promote cytotoxicity and oxidative damage, which has raised health concerns in the use of NPs in personal care products. Nevertheless, the mechanistic basis for the toxicity and safety of cosmetic NPs is poorly understood. The goal of the study was to determine the cytotoxicity and intracellular distribution of titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs containing fatty  composites (palmitoleic , , stearic  and oleic ) commonly used in cosmetic products. Two types of cells, human fibroblast skin cells and adenocarcinoma lung cells, were exposed to either bare TiO2 NPs or TiO2 NPs mixed with fatty acids for up to 48 hr. NMR analysis confirmed that the fatty  composites remained in the NPs after wash. The cytotoxicity of TiO2 NPs was determined by cell viability measurement using quantitative confocal microscopy, and the localization of two different forms of TiO2 NPs were assessed using electron spectroscopic imaging with transmission electron microscopy. TiO2 NPs containing fatty acids posed significantly reduced cytotoxicity (80-88% decreases) than bare NPs in both cell types. Furthermore, there was less intracellular penetration of the NPs containing fatty  composites compared with bare NPs. These results provide important insights into the role of fatty acids in protecting the cells from possible toxicity caused by NPs used in the production of cosmetic products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30014940>Stabilizing mixed fatty  and phthalate ester monolayer on artificial seawater.</a></h2><p>Phthalate esters which are widely used as industrial chemicals have become widespread contaminants in the marine environment. However, little information is available on the interfacial behavior of phthalate esters in the seawater, where contaminants generally occur at elevated concentrations and have the potential to transfer into the atmosphere through wave breaking on sea surface. We used artificial seawater coated with fatty acids to simulate sea surface microlayer in a Langmuir trough. The interactions of saturated fatty acids (stearic  (SA) and  (PA)) with one of the most abundant phthalate esters (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)), were investigated under artificial seawater and pure water conditions. Pure DEHP monolayer was not stable, while more stable mixed monolayers were formed by SA and DEHP on the artificial seawater at relatively low surface pressure. Sea salts in the subphase can lower the excess Gibbs free  to form more stable mixed monolayer. Among the ten components in the sea salts, Ca ions played the major role in condensation of mixed monolayer. The condensed characteristic of the mixed SA (or PA)/DEHP monolayers suggested that the hydrocarbon chains were ordered on artificial seawater. By means of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), we found that multiple sea salt mixtures induced deprotonated forms of fatty acids at the air-water interface. Sea salts can improve the stability and lifetime of mixed fatty  and phthalate ester monolayer on aqueous droplets in the atmosphere. Interfacial properties of mixed fatty  and phthalate ester monolayers at the air-ocean interface are important to help understand their behavior and fate in the marine environment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we combined PET, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), nonimaging MS, and transcriptomic analyses to interrogate changes in lipid metabolism in a transgenic zebrafish model of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia progression. Exogenous fatty  uptake was detected in melanoma tumor nodules by PET using the  surrogate tracer 14(R,S)-18F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic  ([18F]-FTHA), consistent with upregulation of genes associated with fatty  uptake found through microarray analysis. DESI-MS imaging revealed that FTHA uptake in tumors was heterogeneous. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses further highlighted dysregulation of glycerophospholipid pathways in melanoma tumor nodules, including increased abundance of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline species, corroborated by DESI-MS, which again revealed heterogeneous phospholipid composition in tumors. Overexpression of the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which was upregulated in zebrafish melanocyte tumor nodules and expressed in the majority of human melanomas, accelerated progression of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia in zebrafish. Depletion or antagonism of LPL suppressed human melanoma cell growth; this required simultaneous fatty  synthase (FASN) inhibition when FASN expression was also elevated. Collectively, our findings implicate fatty  acquisition as a possible therapeutic target in melanoma, and the methods we developed for monitoring fatty  uptake have potential for diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring pharmacologic response. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the translational potential of monitoring fatty  uptake and identify lipoprotein lipase as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959350>Utilization of lactic  in human myotubes and interplay with glucose and fatty  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Once assumed only to be a waste product of anaerobe glycolytic activity, lactate is now recognized as an  source in skeletal muscles. While lactate metabolism has been extensively studied in vivo, underlying cellular processes are poorly described. This study aimed to examine lactate metabolism in cultured human myotubes and to investigate effects of lactate exposure on metabolism of oleic  and glucose. Lactic , fatty  and glucose metabolism were studied in myotubes using [C(U)]lactic , [C]oleic  and [C(U)]glucose, respectively. Myotubes expressed both the MCT1, MCT2, MCT3 and MCT4 lactate transporters, and lactic  was found to be a substrate for both glycogen synthesis and lipid storage. Pyruvate and  inhibited lactic  oxidation, whilst glucose and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic  inhibited lactic  uptake. Acute addition of lactic  inhibited glucose and oleic  oxidation, whereas oleic  uptake was increased. Pretreatment with lactic  for 24 h did not affect glucose or oleic  metabolism. By replacing glucose with lactic  during the whole culturing period, glucose uptake and oxidation were increased by 2.8-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and oleic  oxidation was increased 1.4-fold. Thus, lactic  has an important role in  metabolism of human myotubes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519174>Diosgenin ameliorates -induced lipid accumulation via AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A and SREBP-1c/FAS signaling pathways in LO2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation.

The effects of DSG on lipid metabolism, glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that  induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty  synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty  β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29576935>Homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9-fatty  desaturase from a Cold-tolerant  sp.

The Δ9-fatty  desaturase strictly creates the first double bond between C9 and 10 positions of most saturated substrates. As the three-dimensional structures of the bacterial membrane fatty  desaturases are not available, relevant information about the enzymes are derived from their amino  sequences, site-directed mutagenesis and domain swapping in similar membrane-bound desaturases.

In this paper we report homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9-fatty  desaturase from a Cold-tolerant  sp. AMS8 for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Three dimensional structure of the enzyme was built using MODELLER version 9.18 using a suitable template. The protein model contained the three conserved-histidine residues typical for all membrane-bound desaturase catalytic activity. The structure was subjected to  minimization and checked for correctness using Ramachandran plots and ERRAT, which showed a good quality model of 91.6 and 65.0%, respectively. The protein model was used to preform MD simulation and docking of  using CHARMM36 force field in GROMACS Version 5 and Autodock tool Version 4.2, respectively.

After activation of AMPK, the messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) expressions in myocardial tissue- and myocardial cell hypertrophy-related genes, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), were detected. The production rate of 14C-labeled 14CO2 from  was quantitatively determined to detect the fatty  and glucose oxidation of hypertrophic myocardial tissues or cells, and the glucose uptake of myocardial cells was studied using [14C] glucose. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to detect the changes in SIRT1 mRNA and protein expressions in hypertrophic myocardial tissues. Moreover, SIRT1 small interfering ribonucleic  (siRNA) was used to interfere in SIRT1 expression to further investigate the role of SIRT1 in the effect of AMPK activation on myocardial hypertrophy.AMPK activation could significantly reduce the mRNA expressions of ANP and β-MHC in vitro and in vivo. AMPK could increase the ejection fraction (EF) and decrease the protein synthesis rate in myocardial cells in mice with myocardial hypertrophy. Besides, AMPK activation could increase the fatty  oxidation, improve the glucose uptake and reduce the glucose oxidation. After AMPK activation, both SIRT1 mRNA and protein expressions in hypertrophic myocardial tissues and myocardial cells were increased. After SIRT1 siRNA was further used to interfere in SIRT1 expression in myocardial cells, it was found that mRNA expressions and protein synthesis rates of ANP and β-MHC were increased.The activation of AMPK can inhibit the myocardial hypertrophy, which may be realized through regulating the myocardial  metabolism via SIRT1 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527986> and nitrogen partitioning in dairy cows at low or high metabolizable protein levels is affected differently by postrumen glucogenic and lipogenic substrates.</a></h2><p>This study tested the effects of  from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels on whole-body  and N partitioning of dairy cattle. Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net  and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible  basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are , oleic, and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine  and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross  intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated  retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk  output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable  intake, increased milk fat yield and milk  output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on  retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable  intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk  output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total  retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted  retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra  intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Wettst. plant (CH) and its nectar (NCH) were nutritionally and chemically characterized. The proximate composition of CH and NCH were very similar in terms of , ash, and carbohydrate content. Protein and fat were approximately 2-fold higher in NCH, and crude fiber was 4.6-fold higher in CH compared to NCH. Fructose, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose were the free sugars present in both samples. Oxalic, malic, and citric acids were the identified organic acids in both samples, with citric  as the most abundant molecule. For both samples, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids (PUFA and SFA, respectively) predominate over monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) due to the significant contribution of linoleic and  acids, respectively. However, unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) prevail over SFA in CH and NCH. Therefore, CH proved to be an excellent source of nutritional compounds, which supports its use during past periods of scarcity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558710>High-fat diet feeding and  increase CRC growth in β2AR-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Epidemiology studies indicate that consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is directly associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the exact component in HFD and the mechanism underlying its effect on CRC growth remained unclear. Our study shows that HFD feeding increases β2AR expression in the xenograft tissues of CRC-bearing mouse model; the elevated β2AR expression is reduced when HFD is replaced by control diet, which strongly suggests an association between HFD feeding and β2AR expression in CRC. HFD feeding increases  and stearic  levels in CRC; however, only  increases β2AR expression, which is dependent upon Sp1. β2AR plays the dominant role in promoting CRC cell proliferation among all the β-AR subtypes. More importantly, knockout of β2AR or knockdown of Sp1 abolishes the  increased CRC cell proliferation, suggesting  increases CRC cell proliferation in β2AR-dependent manner. HFD or -rich diet (PAD) also fails to increase the tumor growth in xenograft mouse models bearing β2AR-knockout CRC cells. β2AR promotes CRC growth by increasing the phosphorylation of HSL at the residue S552. The phosphorylated and activated HSL (S552) changes the metabolic phenotype of CRC and increases  production, which promotes CRC growth. Our study has revealed the unique tumorigenic properties of  in promoting CRC growth, and have delineated the underlying mechanism of action. We are also the first to report the linkage between HFD feeding and β-adrenergic signaling pathway in relation to CRC growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28372558>Fatty  composition in serum cholesterol esters and phospholipids is linked to visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue content in elderly individuals: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and truncal fat predict cardiometabolic disease. Intervention trials suggest that saturated fatty acids (SFA), e.g. , promote abdominal and liver fat storage whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), e.g. linoleic , prevent fat accumulation. Such findings require investigation in population-based studies of older individuals. We aimed to investigate the relationships of serum biomarkers of PUFA intake as well as serum levels of , with abdominal and total adipose tissue content.In a population-based sample of 287 elderly subjects in the PIVUS cohort, we assessed fatty  composition in serum cholesterol esters (CE) and phospholipids (PL) by gas chromatography and the amount of VAT and abdominal subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liver fat by MR spectroscopy (MRS), and total body fat, trunk fat and leg fat by dual- X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Insulin resistance was estimated by HOMA-IR.VAT and trunk fat showed the strongest correlation with insulin resistance (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). Linoleic  in both CE and PL was inversely related to all body fat depots (r = -0.24 to -0.33, P < 0.001) including liver fat measured in a sub-group (r = -0.26, P < 0.05, n = 73), whereas n-3 PUFA showed weak inverse (18:3n-3) or positive (20:5n-3) associations.  in CE, but not in PL, was directly correlated with VAT (r = 0.19, P < 0.001) and trunk fat (r = 0.18, P = 0.003). Overall, the significant associations remained after adjusting for  intake, height, alcohol, sex, smoking, education and physical activity. The inverse correlation between linoleic  and VAT remained significant after further adjustment for total body fat.Serum linoleic  is inversely related to body fat storage including VAT and trunk fat whereas  was less consistently but directly associated, in line with recent feeding studies. Considering the close link between VAT and insulin resistance, a potential preventive role of plant-based PUFA in VAT accumulation warrants further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30328346>Apoptotic germ cells regulate Sertoli cell lipid storage and fatty  oxidation</a></h2><p>The presence of lipid droplets (LDs) and the utilization of fatty acids (FAs) as a source of  are Sertoli cell (SC) putative characteristics. It is well known that SCs can phagocyte and degrade apoptotic germ cells (AGCs) resulting in increasing lipid content and ATP levels. A relationship between the regulation of lipid storage and of lipid oxidation in SC might be envisaged. The aim of this study was to analyze whether AGCs and FAs are able to simultaneously regulate molecular mechanisms involved in lipid storage and in FA oxidation in SC. The experimental model utilized in this study consisted in SC cultures obtained from 20-day-old rats that were co-cultured with AGC or treated with  (PA, 500 μM) for 24 and 48 h. AGC and PA increase LD, triacylglycerol (TAG) content and mRNA levels of Plin1, Plin2, Plin3 (proteins involved in TAG storage). Simultaneously, AGC and PA rise the extent of FA oxidation and mRNA levels of Cpt1 and Lcad (proteins involved in FA degradation). Results also show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) transcriptional activity, transcription factor which participate in lipid metabolism regulation, increases by AGC and PA treatment in SC. Additionally, the presence of a PPARg antagonist decreases the upregulation of LD content and Plin1 expression. Similarly, the presence of a PPARb/d antagonist reduces the increase in FA oxidation and Cpt1 mRNA levels. Altogether these results suggest that AGC and FA, which probably generate PPAR ligands, regulate lipid storage and fatty  utilization, contributing to the  homeostasis in the seminiferous tubules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31046041>Calculation of apparent pK values of saturated fatty acids with different lengths in DOPC phospholipid bilayers.</a></h2><p>We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and calculated free  profiles and apparent pKa values for neutral and anionic forms of single myristic (C14:0),  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) fatty  embedded in a DOPC bilayer and explicit water solvent. We showed that the neutral forms of the fatty acids are stabilized inside the bilayer by hydrogen bonding of a fatty  carboxylic group with DOPC phosphate and carbonyl groups. In contrast to the neutral form, the anionic forms of the fatty acids are shifted towards the water-membrane interface and are instead stabilized by hydrogen bonding to interfacial water. By using umbrella sampling simulations, we calculated free energies of stabilization and revealed that the free  of stabilization inside the bilayer increases with the chain length for both the neutral and deprotonated forms. On the other hand, the free energies of flip-flop of both the neutral and anionic forms are constant upon the prolongation of the fatty . Based on the free  curves, we also calculated apparent fatty  pKa,app values in the bilayer, which are 7.0, 7.2 and 6.3 for myristic,  and stearic  and are increased by several pKa units compared to the corresponding pKa values in water. By further analysis of the calculated curves we found that spontaneous protonation of fatty  anions takes place in the bilayer interior at ca. 1.4 nm from the bilayer center for all studied fatty acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27566521>Selective synthesis of human milk fat-style structured triglycerides from microalgal oil in a microfluidic reactor packed with immobilized lipase.</a></h2><p>Human milk fat-style structured triacylglycerols were produced from microalgal oil in a continuous microfluidic reactor packed with immobilized lipase for the first time. A remarkably high conversion efficiency was demonstrated in the microreactor with reaction time being reduced by 8 times, Michaelis constant decreased 10 times, the lipase reuse times increased 2.25-fold compared to those in a batch reactor. In addition, the content of  at sn-2 position (89.0%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids at sn-1, 3 positions (81.3%) are slightly improved compared to the product in a batch reactor. The increase of melting points (1.7°C) and decrease of crystallizing point (3°C) implied higher quality product was produced using the microfluidic technology. The main cost can be reduced from $212.3 to $14.6 per batch with the microreactor. Overall, the microfluidic bioconversion technology is promising for modified functional lipids production allowing for cost-effective approach to produce high-value microalgal coproducts.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular  sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D. Thus, further studies are essential to identify the effect of compound C on these diseases in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631357>Loss of biliverdin reductase-A promotes lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in mouse proximal tubule cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity and increased lipid availability have been implicated in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. One of the major sites of renal lipid accumulation is in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, suggesting that these cells may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that loss of hepatic biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) causes fat accumulation in livers of mice on a high-fat diet. To determine the role of BVRA in mouse proximal tubule cells, we generated a CRISPR targeting BVRA for a knockout in mouse proximal tubule cells (BVRA KO). The BVRA KO cells had significantly less metabolic potential and mitochondrial respiration, which was exacerbated by treatment with , a saturated fatty . The BVRA KO cells also showed increased intracellular triglycerides which were associated with higher fatty  uptake gene cluster of differentiation 36 as well as increased de novo lipogenesis as measured by higher neutral lipids. Additionally, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin 1 expression, annexin-V FITC staining, and lactate dehydrogenase assays all demonstrated that BVRA KO cells are more sensitive to -induced lipotoxicity than wild-type cells. Phosphorylation of BAD which plays a role in cell survival pathways, was significantly reduced in -treated BVRA KO cells. These data demonstrate the protective role of BVRA in proximal tubule cells against saturated fatty -induced lipotoxicity and suggest that activating BVRA could provide a benefit in protecting from obesity-induced kidney injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28531788>Association of dietary factors with severity of coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease has taken epidemic proportions during past decades. Cardiovascular risk factors contribute to progression of coronary lesions, worsening the patient's prognosis. This study was planned to analyze the association of dietary factors with severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Indian patients.Three hundred patients with known coronary disease above the age of 25 years were included in this study. Blood samples were collected for biochemical markers. Patients were stratified according to severity of CAD [number of vessel involved-single (SVD), double (DVD), triple (TVD)].Mean age of the patient was 60.9 ± 12.4 years. Subjects with TVD, DVD, SVD in the study were 52.3%, 25.3% and 22.3% respectively. Patients with TVD had higher body mass index, triglycerides, HOMA-Insulin Resistance, hsCRP and lower high density cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia were more common in TVD patients. Among macronutrients, patients with TVD had higher intake of carbohydrate and lower intake of protein and dietary fibers. There was no association of total fat intake with CAD, however, intake of  was higher among patients with TVD. Intake of vitamins namely niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, B6, and vitamin-C decreased with increase in severity. With increase in severity of CAD, mineral intake (potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, chromium, copper, manganese, and zinc) decreased.Dietary factors are associated with severity of coronary artery disease. Low intake of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and high intake of carbohydrate and fat was associated with higher probability of having severe CAD.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

As such, non-catalytic transesterification of dried SS was carried out, to enhance its value. Note that picking a waste material such as SS as an inexpensive lipid feedstock for biodiesel production, without lipid extraction, greatly increases the economic viability of biodiesel. Also, to enhance biodiesel sustainability, ethanol (EtOH) was employed as the acyl acceptor, in this study, and this was experimentally justified by results showing that employing EtOH as an acyl acceptor provided an effective means for compensating for the lower heating value arising from the large amount of  (C)  in SS. This study experimentally proved that the fatty  ethyl ester (FAEE) yield at 380 °C reached up to 13.33 wt% of dried SS. Given that the lipid content of dried SS is 14.01 ± 0.64 wt%, the FAEE yield of 13.33 wt% implied that 95.14 wt% of lipid in dried SS had been converted into FAEEs. The introduced SS valorization in this study offered an excellent opportunity to address diverse environmental hazards arising from SS and associated emerging contaminants. Given that the optimal temperature for the non-catalytic conversion for biodiesel production from SS was found to be 380 °C, emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobials, were simultaneously degraded, due to their inferior thermal stabilities. Lastly, considering that the introduced biodiesel conversion process is thermally induced, the SS reside after the biodiesel conversion process can be further used in thermo-chemical processes as raw materials for gasification and pyrolysis (future work).Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Four thousand 28-day-old male Arbor Acres (AA) broilers were randomly assigned to 5 groups (4 replicates / group, 20 chicks / replicate), in which group 1 was normal control group fed with basic ration; groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were fed with the basic ration with a supplementation of 0.2% Vitamin C ( VC: ), or 0.2%, 0.3%, or 0.4% of PICB respectively. After 1 wk of adaptation, heat stress was applied for 7 consecutive days. On d 3 and d 7 of heat stress, the chicks were sacrificed and sampled. The mRNA expression of heat stress protein 70 (HSP70), glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-PX: ), ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC: ), epidermal growth factor ( EGF: ) and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR: ) were detected by real-time PCR using samples from jejunum mucosa. The serum and jejunum mucosa metabolomic profiles of PICB group showing best antioxidative effects and control group at d 3 were studied using the method of the gas chromatography - time of flight mass spectrometry ( GT-TOF-MS: ), followed by principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminate analysis. Potential biomarkers were found using Student's t-test. The results showed mRNA expressions of HSP70, GSH-Px, ODC, EGF, and EGFR were altered by the supplementation of PICB. PICB exhibited antioxidative and growth promoting effects, and 0.3% PICB supplementation level exhibited the best. Three metabolites in the serum and 5 in the jejunum mucosa were identified as potential biomarkers. They were considered to be in accordance with antioxidative and growth promoting effects of PICB, which involved in the  metabolism (sorbitol, ), carbohydrate metabolism, amino acids metabolism (serine, L-ornithine), glutathione metabolism (glutamate, L-ornithine), GnRH signaling pathway (inositol), etc. These findings provided novel insights into our understanding of molecular mechanism of PICB effects on heat-stressed chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697336>DGAT1-Dependent Lipid Droplet Biogenesis Protects Mitochondrial Function during Starvation-Induced Autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) provide an "on-demand" source of fatty acids (FAs) that can be mobilized in response to fluctuations in nutrient abundance. Surprisingly, the amount of LDs increases during prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation. Why cells store FAs in LDs during an  crisis is unknown. Our data demonstrate that mTORC1-regulated autophagy is necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced LD biogenesis. The ER-resident diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) selectively channels autophagy-liberated FAs into new, clustered LDs that are in close proximity to mitochondria and are lipolytically degraded. However, LDs are not required for FA delivery to mitochondria but instead function to prevent acylcarnitine accumulation and lipotoxic dysregulation of mitochondria. Our data support a model in which LDs provide a lipid buffering system that sequesters FAs released during the autophagic degradation of membranous organelles, reducing lipotoxicity. These findings reveal an unrecognized aspect of the cellular adaptive response to starvation, mediated by LDs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh (FR) period (1-24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a C16:0-supplemented diet [PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter (DM)]. During the peak (PK) period (25-67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA diet (1.5% of diet DM) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, compared with CON, PA increased DM digestibility by 3.0 percentage units and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility by 4.4 percentage units, and the increase in these variables was consistent over time. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon fatty  (FA) digestibility, it decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 10.8 percentage units and total FA digestibility by 4.7 percentage units compared with CON. We observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for total FA digestibility and 16-carbon FA digestibility due to the difference in FA digestibility between PA and CON reducing over time. Compared with CON, PA increased digestible  intake by 3.9 Mcal/d, metabolizable  intake by 3.5 Mcal/d, and net  for lactation intake by 2.5 Mcal/d. The PA diet also increased milk  output, negative  balance, and plasma nonesterified fatty  concentration and reduced plasma insulin concentration. We also observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for  balance due to cows receiving the PA treatment being in a greater negative  balance over time. During the PK period, PA increased DM digestibility by 2.9 percentage units and NDF digestibility by 3.5 percentage units compared with CON. Although PA decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 7.0 percentage units, PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility or total FA digestibility. Feeding PA during the PK period increased  intake and milk  output and did not affect  balance. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased DM and NDF digestibilities and  intake compared with a control diet containing no supplemental fat. Feeding C16:0 markedly increased milk  output in both the FR and PK periods but increased negative  balance only in the FR period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

For lactating sows,  is one of the most abundant fatty acids in milk, providing 10~12% of the suckling pig total dietary  supply. However, the effects of exogenous  on milk fat synthesis in sow mammary glands are not well-known. In this study, we investigated the effects of  on lipogenic genes in porcine mammary epithelial cells (pMECs) to explore the role of exogenous  in mediating milk triacylglycerols (TAG) synthesis.Porcine mammary epithelial cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of different concentrations of palmitate (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 μM). The effect of palmitate on cell viability was tested via MTT assay. Intracellular lipid accumulation was measured through Oil Red O staining, and TAG levels were quantified by enzymatic colorimetric methods. Expression of genes and proteins involved in milk fat biosynthesis were assayed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting, respectively.Incubation with palmitate promoted cellular lipid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, as reflected by the increased TAG content and enhanced formation of cytosolic lipid droplets. The increased lipid synthesis by palmitate was probably attributable to the upregulated mRNA expression of genes associated with milk fat biosynthesis, including long-chain fatty  uptake (, ), intracellular activation and transport , ), TAG synthesis (, , ), lipid droplet formation (), and regulation of transcription (). Western blot analysis of CD36 and DGAT1 proteins confirmed the increased lipid synthesis with increasing incubation of palmitate. However, the genes involved in fatty  de novo synthesis (, ), fatty  desaturation (), and regulation of transcription (, ) were inversely affected by incubation with increasing concentrations of palmitate. Western blot analysis of ACACA protein confirmed this decrease associated with increasing levels of palmitate.Results from this study suggest that palmitate stimulated the cytosolic TAG accumulation in pMECs, probably by promoting lipogenic genes and proteins that are involved in lipid synthesis. However, addition of palmitate decreased the fatty  de novo synthesis in pMECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527982>Effects of timing of  supplementation on production responses of early-lactation dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of timing of  (C16:0) supplementation on production responses of early-lactation dairy cows. Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh period (FR; 1-24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a diet supplemented with C16:0 (, PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter). During the peak (PK) period (25-67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA (1.5% of diet dry matter) diet in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, we did not observe treatment differences for dry matter intake or milk yield. Compared with CON, PA increased the yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 5.30 kg/d, yield of -corrected milk (ECM) by 4.70 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.41% units, milk fat yield by 280 g/d, and protein yield by 100 g/d. The increase in milk fat associated with the PA treatment during the FR period occurred due to an increase in yield of 16-carbon milk fatty acids (FA) by 147 g/d (derived from both de novo synthesis and extraction from plasma) and preformed milk FA by 96 g/d. Compared with CON, PA decreased body weight (BW) by 21 kg and body condition score (BCS) by 0.09 units and tended to increase BW loss by 0.76 kg/d. Although PA consistently increased milk fat yield and ECM over time, a treatment × time interaction was observed for BW and BCS due to PA inducing a greater decrease in BW and BCS after the second week of treatments. Feeding PA during the PK period increased milk yield by 3.45 kg/d, yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 4.50 kg/d, yield of ECM by 4.60 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.22% units, milk fat yield by 210 g/d, protein yield by 140 g/d, and lactose yield by 100 g/d but tended to reduce BW by 10 kg compared with CON. Also, during the PK period we observed an interaction between diet fed in the FR and PK periods for milk fat yield due to feeding PA during the PK period increasing milk fat yield to a greater extent in cows that received the CON diet (+240 g/d) rather than the PA diet (+180 g/d) during the FR period. This difference was associated with the yield of preformed FA because feeding PA during the PK period increased the yield of preformed milk FA only in cows that received the CON diet during the FR period. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased the yield of ECM in both the FR and PK periods compared with a control diet. For some variables, the effect of feeding C16:0 was affected by timing of supplementation because milk yield increased only during the PK period and BW decreased to a greater extent in the FR period. Regardless of diet fed in the FR period, feeding a C16:0 supplement during the PK period increased yields of milk and milk components.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Western blot analyses were performed to examine the expression of LC3-II/LC3-I, p62, mTOR and PI3K, while mitochondrial integrity and oxidative stress were observed by fluorescence staining of JC-1 and reactive oxygen species. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control group ( = 10), high fat (HF) group ( = 13) and JZG group ( = 13); and, histological staining was carried out to detect inflammation and lipid content in the liver.The cell trauma induced by PA was aggravated in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and hepatic function was improved by JZG. PA had dual effects on autophagy by activating autophagy induction and blocking autophagic flux. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and the fusion of isolated hepatic autophagosomes and lysosomes were critically involved in this process. JZG activated autophagy progression by either induction of autophagosomes or co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes as well as degradation of autolysosomes to protect against PA-induced hepatocyte injury, and protected mitochondrial integrity against oxidative stress in PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, JZG ameliorated lipid droplets and inflammation induced by HF diet , leading to improved metabolic disorder and associated liver injury in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Metabolic stress-induced hepatocyte injury exhibited dual effects on autophagy and JZG activated the entire process, resulting in beneficial effects in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28144888>Characterization and robust nature of newly isolated oleaginous marine yeast Rhodosporidium spp. from coastal water of Northern China.</a></h2><p>A total of ten marine yeast strains isolated from Bohai Sea, Northern China were identified to be members of three genera Rhodosporidium, Rhodotorula, and Cryptococcus.

These species are characterized by diverse levels of organization (solitary or colonial) and trophic strategies (symbiotic or non-symbiotic). Fatty acids have manifold fundamental roles comprehensive of membrane structure fluidity, cell signaling and  storage.

These results suggest that, in the limits of the studied species, intra-skeletal fatty  composition and concentration may be used for specific cases as a proxy of level of organization and trophic strategy, and eventually coral age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572772>Hydroxyhydroquinone impairs fat utilization in mice by reducing nitric oxide availability.</a></h2><p>Habitual consumption of chlorogenic  compounds (CGAs) from coffee increases fat catabolism and reduces body fat; however, the contribution of roasted coffee remains unclear. Hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ) impairs the vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects of CGAs by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Since HHQ also reduces fat catabolism, we hypothesized that HHQ does so by decreasing NO availability. Therefore, we investigated the effect of HHQ on  metabolism in KKAy mice. In HHQ-treated mice, fat oxidation was significantly low and dose-dependent, serum and urinary hydrogen peroxide were high, and plasma NO metabolites and S-nitrosylated liver proteins were low. In HHQ-treated mouse hepatocytes, the palmitate-induced increase in cellular oxygen consumption was negatively affected, and HHQ or L-NAME reduced cellular fatty  utilization. In conclusion, HHQ can impair fat utilization by reducing NO availability in mice. Protein S-nitrosylation reduction in liver cells after HHQ consumption may be associated with impaired fatty  oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904018>Dyslipidemia impairs mitochondrial trafficking and function in sensory neurons.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial trafficking plays a central role in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cell survival and neurotransmission by transporting mitochondria from the neuronal cell body throughout the bundles of DRG axons. In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia damage DRG neurons and induce mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the impact of free fatty acids and glucose on mitochondrial trafficking in DRG neurons remains unknown. To evaluate the impact of free fatty acids compared to hyperglycemia on mitochondrial transport, primary adult mouse DRG neuron cultures were treated with physiologic concentrations of palmitate and glucose and assessed for alterations in mitochondrial trafficking, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Palmitate treatment significantly reduced the number of motile mitochondria in DRG axons, but physiologic concentrations of glucose did not impair mitochondrial trafficking dynamics. Palmitate-treated DRG neurons also exhibited a reduction in mitochondrial velocity, and impaired mitochondrial trafficking correlated with mitochondrial depolarization in palmitate-treated DRG neurons. Finally, we found differential bioenergetic effects of palmitate and glucose on resting and energetically challenged mitochondria in DRG neurons. Together, these results suggest that palmitate induces DRG neuron mitochondrial depolarization, inhibiting axonal mitochondrial trafficking and altering mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity.-Rumora, A.

Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate  homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by oleic , whereas it is decreased in response to  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340432>Enhanced lipid production by Rhodosporidium toruloides using different fed-batch feeding strategies with lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the sole carbon source.</a></h2><p>Industrial biotechnology that is able to provide environmentally friendly bio-based products has attracted more attention in replacing petroleum-based industries. Currently, most of the carbon sources used for fermentation-based bioprocesses are obtained from agricultural commodities that are used as foodstuff for human beings. Lignocellulose-derived sugars as the non-food, green, and sustainable alternative carbon sources have great potential to avoid this dilemma for producing the renewable, bio-based hydrocarbon fuel precursors, such as microbial lipid. Efficient bioconversion of lignocellulose-based sugars into lipids is one of the critical parameters for industrial application. Therefore, the fed-batch cultivation, which is a common method used in industrial applications, was investigated to achieve a high cell density culture along with high lipid yield and productivity.In this study, several fed-batch strategies were explored to improve lipid production using lignocellulosic hydrolysates derived from corn stover. Compared to the batch culture giving a lipid yield of 0.19 g/g, the dissolved-oxygen-stat feeding mode increased the lipid yield to 0.23 g/g and the lipid productivity to 0.33 g/L/h. The pulse feeding mode further improved lipid productivity to 0.35 g/L/h and the yield to 0.24 g/g. However, the highest lipid yield (0.29 g/g) and productivity (0.4 g/L/h) were achieved using an automated online sugar control feeding mode, which gave a dry cell weight of 54 g/L and lipid content of 59 % (w/w). The major fatty acids of the lipid derived from lignocellulosic hydrolysates were predominately  and oleic , which are similar to those of conventional oilseed plants.Our results suggest that the fed-batch feeding strategy can strongly influence the lipid production. The online sugar control feeding mode was the most appealing strategy for high cell density, lipid yield, and lipid productivity using lignocellulosic hydrolysates as the sole carbon source.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658532>Changes of albumin secondary structure after  binding. FT-IR spectroscopic study.</a></h2><p>Albumin is an universal transport protein. Plasma pool of free fatty acids arising from triglyceride hydrolysis, critical in  metabolism and etiology of metabolic disorders is transported by albumin. According to various studies albumin has from seven to nine binding sites with diverse affinity to long chain fatty acids. X-ray diffraction crystallography measurements have provided data only for pure human serum albumin or albumin with fully saturated binding sites. These results have shown that amount of -helices is higher after fatty acids binding. Molecular mechanics simulations suggest that binding of fatty acids in two high-affinity sites leads to major conformational changes in albumin structure. The aim of this research was to investigate albumin secondary structure upon gradually increasing fatty acids to protein mole ratio.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to study changes of bovine serum albumin (as an analogue of human serum albumin) -helical structures after binding  in a range of 0-20 : albumin molar ratios representing pure protein, partial, full saturation and excess binding sites capacity.Amount of -helices was increasing along with the amount of : bovine serum albumin molar ratio and reached maximum value around 2 mol/mol.Our studies confirmed molecular mechanics simulations and crystallographic studies.  binding in two high-affinity sites leads to major structural changes, filling another sites only slightly influenced bovine serum albumin secondary structure. The systematic study of fatty acids and albumin interactions, using an experimental model mimicking metabolic disorders, may results in new tools for personalized nanopharmacotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27931182>Exposure of bovine oocytes and embryos to elevated non-esterified fatty  concentrations: integration of epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures in resultant blastocysts.</a></h2><p>Metabolic stress associated with negative  balance in high producing dairy cattle and obesity in women is a risk factor for decreased fertility. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are involved in this pathogenesis as they jeopardize oocyte and embryo development. Growing evidence indicates that maternal metabolic disorders can disturb epigenetic programming, such as DNA methylation, in the offspring. Oocyte maturation and early embryo development coincide with methylation changes and both are sensitive to adverse environments. Therefore, we investigated whether elevated NEFA concentrations affect establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation in oocytes and embryos, subsequently altering transcriptomic profiles and developmental competence of resultant blastocysts.Bovine oocytes and embryos were exposed to different NEFA concentrations in separate experiments. In the first experiment, oocytes were matured in vitro for 24 h in medium containing: 1) physiological ("BASAL") concentrations of oleic (OA),  (PA) and stearic (SA)  or 2) pathophysiological ("HIGH COMBI") concentrations of OA, PA and SA. In the second experiment, zygotes were cultivated in vitro for 6.5 days under BASAL or HIGH COMBI conditions. Developmental competence was evaluated by assessing cleavage and blastocyst rate. Overall gene expression and DNA methylation of resultant blastocysts were analyzed using microarray. DNA methylation data were re-evaluated by pyrosequencing. HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos displayed a lower competence to develop into blastocysts compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts (19.3% compared to 23.2% and 18.2% compared to 25.3%, respectively) (P < 0.05). HIGH COMBI-exposed oocytes and embryos resulted in blastocysts with altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic fingerprints, compared to BASAL-exposed counterparts. Differences in gene expression and methylation were more pronounced after exposure during culture compared to maturation suggesting that zygotes are more susceptible to adverse environments. Main gene networks affected were related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell death, immune response and metabolic disorders.Overall, high variation in methylation between blastocysts made it difficult to draw conclusions concerning methylation of individual genes, although a clear overview of affected pathways was obtained. This may offer clues regarding the high rate of embryonic loss and metabolic diseases during later life observed in offspring from mothers displaying lipolytic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925464>Elevated free fatty acids affect bovine granulosa cell function: a molecular cue for compromised reproduction during negative  balance.</a></h2><p>High-yielding dairy cows postpartum face the challenge of negative  balance leading to elevated free fatty acids levels in the serum and follicular fluid thus affecting the ovarian function. Here, we investigated effects of physiological concentrations of  (PA), stearic  (SA) and oleic  (OA) on the viability, steroid production and gene expression in a bovine granulosa cell (GC) culture model. Treatment with individual and combined fatty acids increased the CD36 gene expression, while no significant apoptotic effects were observed. Both PA and SA significantly upregulated the expression of FSHR, LHCGR, CYP19A1, HSD3B1, CCND2 and increased 17β-estradiol (E2) production, while OA downregulated the expression of these genes and reduced E2. Interestingly, STAR was equally downregulated by all fatty acids and combination treatment. E2 was significantly reduced after combination treatment. To validate the effects of OA, in vivo growing dominant follicles (10-19 mm) were injected with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with/without conjugated OA. The follicular fluid was recovered 48 h post injection. As in our in vitro model, OA significantly reduced intrafollicular E2 concentrations. In addition, expression of CD36 was significantly up- and that of CYP19A1 and STAR significantly downregulated in antral GC recovered from aspirated follicles. The ovulation rates of OA-injected follicles tended to be reduced. Our results indicate that elevated free fatty  concentrations specifically target functional key genes in GC both in vitro and in vivo. Suggestively, this could be a possible mechanism through which elevated free fatty acids affect folliculogenesis in dairy cows postpartum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039380>Detection of organic compounds in impact glasses formed by the collision of an extraterrestrial material with the Libyan Desert (Africa) and Tasmania (Australia).</a></h2><p>Impact glasses are rich silica melted formed at high temperature and pressure by the impact of an extraterrestrial body on Earth. Here, Libyan Desert glasses (LDGs) and Darwin glasses (DGs) were studied. Two non-destructive analytical techniques were used to detect and characterize organic compounds present in their inclusions: Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled to -dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Phytoliths, humboldtine, , myristic , oleic , 4-methyl phthalic , and S-H stretching vibrations of amino acids were identified. The presence of these particular organic compounds in such materials has not been reported so far, providing information about (a) the ancient matter of the area where the impact glasses were formed, (b) organic matter belonging to the extraterrestrial body which impacted on the Earth, or (c) even to current plant or bacterial life, which could indicate an active interaction of the LDG and DG with the surrounding environment. Moreover, the identification of fullerene allowed us to know a pressure (15 GPa) and temperatures (670 K or 1800-1900 K) at which samples could be subjected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713651>Novel Mechanisms Modulating Palmitate-Induced Inflammatory Factors in Hypertrophied 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by AMPK.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to not only  metabolic homeostasis but also the inhibition of inflammatory responses. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate the role of AMPK, in this study, we observed the effects of AMPK activation on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.We observed signal transduction pathways regulating MCP-1, which increased in obese adipocytes, in an  model of hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes preloaded with palmitate.Palmitate-preloaded cells exhibited significant increase in MCP-1 release and triglyceride (TG) deposition. Increased MCP-1 release and TG deposition were significantly decreased by an AMPK activator. In addition, the AMPK activator not only markedly diminished MCP-1 secretion but also augmented phosphorylation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In contrast, MCP-1 release suppression was abolished by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and the MEK inhibitor U0126.MCP-1 release from hypertrophied adipocytes is suppressed by AMPK activation through the NF-B and ERK pathways. These findings provide evidence that AMPK plays a crucial role in ameliorating obesity-induced inflammation.</p></html>
