<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511226>Quantitative profiling of oxylipins in plasma and atherosclerotic plaques of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins are oxidation products of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) that affect a broad range of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, inflammation, inflammation resolution, and vascular function. Moreover, oxylipins are readily detectable in plasma, and certain subsets of oxylipins have been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions. Taken together, we set out to produce a detailed quantitative assessment of plasma and plaque oxylipins in a widely used model of atherosclerosis, to identify potential biomarkers of disease progression. We administered regular chow or regular chow supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol (HC) to male New Zealand white rabbits for 12 weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Our targeted lipidomic analyses of oxylipins on plaques isolated from rabbits fed the HC diet detected 34 oxylipins, 28 of which were in compliance with our previously established quality control acceptance criteria. The arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite derived from the COX pathway, 6-keto-PGF1α was the most abundant plaque oxylipin, followed by the linoleic acid (LA) metabolites , 13-HODE and 9,12,13-TriHOME and the arachidonic acid (AA)-derivatives 11-HETE and 12-HETE. We additionally found that the most abundant oxylipins in plasma were three of the five most abundant oxylipins in plaque, namely 11-HETE, 13-HODE, and . The studies reported here make the first step towards a comprehensive characterization of oxylipins as potentially translatable biomarkers of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and  Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized  acids  (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of  and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse , with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and  steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p></html>
