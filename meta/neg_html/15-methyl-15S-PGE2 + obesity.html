Protein kinases are implicated in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. Molecular mechanisms underlying OIR involving global kinase activities remain incompletely understood.To investigate abnormal kinase activity associated with OIR in human skeletal muscle.Stable isotopic labeling-based quantitative proteomics combined with affinity-based​​ active enzyme probes to profile in vivo kinase activity in skeletal muscle from lean control (Lean) and OIR participants.Eight Lean and eight OIR non-diabetic human adults who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with muscle biopsy.We identified the 1st active kinome comprised of 54 active protein kinases in human skeletal muscle. The activities of 23 kinases were different in OIR compared to Lean muscle (11 hyper- and 12 hypo-active), while their protein abundance was the same between the two groups. The activities of multiple kinases involved in AMPK and p38 signaling were lower in OIR compared to Lean. On the contrary, multiple kinases in the JNK signaling pathway exhibited higher activity in OIR vs. Lean. The kinase-substrate-prediction based on experimental data further confirmed a potential down-regulation of insulin signaling (e.g., inhibited phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT1/2).These findings provide a global view of the kinome activity in OIR and Lean muscle, pinpoint novel specific impairment in kinase activities in signaling pathways important for skeletal muscle insulin resistance and may provide potential drug targets (i.e., abnormal kinase activities) to prevent and/or reverse skeletal muscle insulin resistance in humans.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Along with , diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Anthropometric measurements, body composition (BIA), aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and food preferences were assessed in 19 healthy normal-weight young adults (21 ± 0.5 years old, 10 men). They randomly completed 3 experimental sessions: i) control session without exercise (CON); ii) High Intensity exercise session (HIE); iii) Low intensity exercise session (LIE). Thirty minutes after exercise or rest, then received a fixed lunch. Food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire) was assessed before and after the meal. Appetite sensations were assessed at regular intervals, SQ was calculated from the lunch meal and self-reported food intake was collected for the rest of the day. Mean body weight was 66.7 ± 9.2 kg, body mass index was 22.3 ± 2.9 kg/m and FM% was 18.7 ± 6.8%. Appetite feelings did not differ between conditions and were not affected by exercise. SQ for satiety was not different between conditions. SQ hunger on CON was significantly higher than on LIE and HIE (p ≤ 0.05) with no difference between exercise conditions. SQ for desire to eat was significantly higher on CON versus HIE (p ≤ 0.01) with no differences between CON and LIE and between exercise sessions. SQ PFC was significantly lower on HIE compared with CON (p = 0.02) with no differences between LIE and CON and between LIE and HIE. Food reward was not significantly different between the three condition as well as self-reported total food and macronutrient intake for the rest of the days. Acute exercise, depending on its intensity, might affect the satiating response to food intake in healthy adults, without altering food reward.Copyright © 2019.

More specifically, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in people with  could produce chronic inflammation and an altered profile expression of key transcription factors that promote a favorable microenvironment to colorectal carcinogenesis. For this, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between adipogenic and inflammatory transcription factors in VAT from nonobese, obese, and/or CRC patients. To test this idea, we studied the expression and methylation of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein type alpha (C/EBP-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in VAT from non-obese control, non-obese CRC subjects, overweight/obese control, and overweight/obese CRC patients and their correlation with anthropometric and biochemical variables. We found decreased expression of C/EBP-α in overweight/obese CRC patients in comparison with overweight/obese control subjects. PGC-1α and NF-κB were overexpressed in CRC patients independently of the BMI. NF-κB promoter was hypomethylated in overweight/obese CRC patients when compared to overweight/obese control individuals. In addition, multiple significant correlations between expression, methylation, and biochemical parameters were found. Finally, linear regression analysis showed that the expression of C/EBP-α and NF-κB and that NF-κB methylation were associated with CRC and able to explain up to 55% of CRC variability. Our results suggest that visceral adipose tissue may be a key factor in tumor development and inflammatory state. We propose C/EBP-α, PGC-1α and NF-κB to be interesting candidates as potential biomarkers in adipose tissue for CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658012>Peritoneal dialysis catheter removal at the time of renal transplantation: Choosing the optimal candidate.</a></h2><p>Concurrent peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter removal during renal transplantation is controversial, with limited evidence supporting this practice. Our objective was to determine the rate of delayed graft function (DGF) in patients on preoperative PD. Additionally, we sought to identify which patients can safely have their PD catheter removed during transplantation due to a low risk of DGF.We conducted a retrospective observational study between June 2011 and December 2015. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of DGF, defined as the need for dialysis within the first week of transplantation. Clinical and transplant factors, including graft type and donor criteria, were assessed for association with the primary outcome. Catheter-related complication rates were also compared between post-transplant PD and hemodialysis (HD).Of our cohort of 567 patients, 145 patients (25.6%) developed DGF.  (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.11; p=0.04) and increased perioperative blood loss (OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p=0.03) were predictors of DGF. Protective factors included living donor (LD) grafts (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05-0.49; p=0.002) and intraoperative graft urine production (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65; p<0.001). In our PD cohort, only LD grafts demonstrated lower DGF rates (0 LD vs. 20.8% deceased donor; p=0.003). In terms of post-transplant renal replacement therapy, patients on PD and HD had similar duration of temporary dialysis (one day PD vs. two days HD; p=0.48) and catheter-related complication rates (4.5% PD vs. 2.6% HD; p=0.30).Carefully selected patients, such as those receiving LD grafts, may benefit from concurrent PD catheter removal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653580> in Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia: Prevalence, clinical correlates and relationship with cognitive deficits.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of  in schizophrenia patients is high, especially in chronic and medicated patients.

This study was designed to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of  and its relationship to cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. We recruited 633 inpatients and collected clinical, demographic data and lipid parameters. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and its five-factor model were adopted for psychopathological symptoms. The prevalence of comorbid  in schizophrenia patients was 16.4%. The plasma levels of glucose, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein B, and cholesterol were higher, but high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were lower in obese patients than those in non-obese patients (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, obese patients had lower PANSS negative symptom, cognitive factor and total scores than non-obese patients (all p < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between BMI and the following variables: age, marriage, gender, negative symptoms, general psychopathological symptoms, cognitive factor, PANSS total score, glucose, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (all p < 0.05). Further multiple regression showed that PANSS cognitive factor, PANSS total score, and triglyceride were important independent predictors of .

BMI was derived from objectively measured heights and weights. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time (SED), and sleep duration were assessed by waist-worn Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Linear models were used to describe the distributions of BMI z-scores, MVPA, SED, and sleep among sites across varying Human Development Indices (HDIs).Mean MVPA, SED, and sleep duration were 63.1 ± 27.3 minutes/day, 508.7 ± 72.4 minutes/day, and 8.8 ± 0.9 hours/night, respectively. Overall, 2.1% of the sample were thin, 19.5% overweight, and 11.7% were obese. Density curves (BMI z-scores and SED) for urban children in Mozambique showed significantly higher mean values compared with rural children. Boys had significantly higher mean MVPA compared with girls. Mean BMI z-scores were positively associated (β = .02; P = .004) with HDI, mean daily MVPA minutes were negatively associated (β = -.38; P = .025) with HDI, and mean SED time was positively associated with HDI (β = 1.18; P = .049). No significant association (β = .01; P = .29) was observed between sleep duration and HDI.Our findings show distinct differences in BMI and movement behavior profiles between urban and rural children in Mozambique. Mean BMI z-scores, MVPA, and SED differed by country HDI. These findings support the need to include both rural and urban participants in study samples.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651803>Childhood : A Risk Factor for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Adolescence.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as fat accumulation >5% in hepatocytes, may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis later in life.

Major facilitator superfamily domain 3 (MFSD3) is a family of membrane-bound solute carriers whose expression has been recently associated with nutrient intake and adipose tissue homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate a possible association between MFSD3 preoperative methylation pattern and weight regain after bariatric surgery.This is a longitudinal study comprising 24 obese (body mass index > 35 m/kg) women submitted to gastric bypass. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated at preoperative time and 1, 2, and 3 y after surgery, and then weight regain was calculated. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was bisulfite modified by specific kits, according manufacturer's instructions. Methylation analysis was performed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K bead chip technology, and methylation level was expressed as a β value ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Shapiro-Wilk, repeated-means analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t tests were used in statistical analysis (P < 0.05).A total of 25% of patients regained significant weight. Weight regain after bariatric surgery was positively correlated with cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation levels (r = 0.6804, P = 0.0126). Moreover, cg00010266 MFSD3 baseline methylation levels were significantly higher in regainer patients than non-regainers (6.2 ± 1.5 versus 3.9 ± 1.2%, P = 0.026). Patients allocated in the higher cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation group had higher weight regain (4.1 ± 1.8 versus 6.7 ± 2.2 kg, P = 0.037).Preoperative hypermethylation of MFSD3 gene is significantly associated with weight regain and a worse response to gastric bypass.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The urban environment differs greatly from that in which humans evolved, with potentially important consequences for health. Rates for allergic, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases appear to rise with urbanization and be higher in the more urbanized nations of the world which has led some to suggest that cities promote the occurrence of these diseases. However, there are no syntheses outlining what urban-associated diseases are and what characteristics of cities promote their occurrence.To synthesize the current understanding of "urban-associated diseases", and discover the common, potentially modifiable features of cities that may be driving these associations.We focus on any diseases that have been associated with cities or are particularly prominent in today's urban societies. We draw on expertise across diverse health fields to examine the evidence for urban connections and drivers.We found evidence for urban associations across allergic, auto-immune, inflammatory, lifestyle and infectious disease categories. Some conditions (e.g.  and diabetes) have complex relationships with cities that have been insufficiently explored. Other conditions (e.g. allergies and asthma) have more evidence demonstrating their relationship with cities and the mechanisms driving that association. Unsurprisingly, air pollution was the characteristic of cities most frequently associated with disease. Other identified urban risk factors are not as widely known: altered microbial exposure and a disconnect from environmental microbiomes, vitamin D deficiency, noise and light pollution, and a transient, over-crowded, impoverished population. However, many complexities and caveats to these relationships beg clarification; we highlight the current knowledge gaps and outline ways to fill those gaps. Identifying urban-associated diseases and their drivers will allow us to prepare for the urban-disease burden of the future and create healthy cities that mitigate that disease burden.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Interestingly, the trend of this association in older individuals is not clear, given the conflicting results of multiple studies. Since aging is accompanied by changes in body fat distribution, we questioned whether age is a modulator of such association. This study explores the role of age in the association between mood and general (BMI) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference - WC) in older adults characterizing the different abdominal adipose tissue compartments (subcutaneous adipose tissue - SAT and visceral adipose tissue - VAT) with magnetic resonance imaging techniques (MRI).120 aged community-dwelling individuals, (≥50 year of age), were assessed regarding depressive mood (Geriatric depression scale), and adiposity (BMI and WC). From these, 96 were assessed for SAT and VAT using MRI.Using multiple linear regression models depressive mood was positively associated with BMI, WC and VAT. Age was a significant moderator of the association between depressive mood and BMI, WC and SAT: positive in younger participants and null or negative the older. On the other hand, higher VAT was significantly associated with a more depressive mood, independently of age.This study identifies age as a relevant moderator in the association between depressive mood and adiposity in the elderlies. Furthermore, the body fat compartment analysis revealed that the effect of age is specific for the SAT, suggesting its protective role in depressive mood.This article is protected by copyright.

We postulated that Chinese women with PCOS would have higher risk of incident diabetes and cardiometabolic abnormalities than those without PCOS during long-term follow-up.One hundred ninety-nine Chinese women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria and with a mean age of 41.2 years (SD = 6.4) completed a follow-up evaluation after an average of 10.6 ± 1.3 years. Two hundred twenty-five women without PCOS (mean age: 54.1 ± 6.7 years) who underwent baseline and follow-up evaluation over the same period were used for comparison. Progression of glycaemic status of women both with and without PCOS was assessed by using 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening with the adoption of 2009 American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria. The frequency of impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia of women with PCOS at follow-up has increased from 31.7% (95% CI 25.2%-38.1%) to 47.2% (95% CI 40.3%-54.2%), 16.1% (95% CI 11.0%-21.2%) to 34.7% (95% CI 28.1%-41.3%), and 52.3% (95% CI 45.3%-59.2%) to 64.3% (95% CI 57.7%-71.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in follow-up women with PCOS is 26.1% (95% CI 20.0%-32.2%), almost double that in the cohort of women without PCOS (p < 0.001). Age-standardised incidence of diabetes among women with PCOS was 22.12 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 10.86-33.37) compared with the local female population incidence rate of 8.76 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.72-8.80) and 10.09 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.92-15.26, p < 0.001) for women without PCOS in our study. Incidence rate for women with PCOS aged 30-39 years was 20.56 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 12.57-31.87), which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the age-matched general female population in Hong Kong (1.88 per 1,000 person-years, [95% CI 1.85-1.92]). The incidence rate of type 2 DM (T2DM) of both normal-weight and overweight women with PCOS was around double that of corresponding control groups (normal weight: 8.96 [95% CI 3.92-17.72] versus 4.86 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 2.13-9.62], p > 0.05; overweight/obese: 28.64 [95% CI 19.55-40.60] versus 14.1 per 1,000 person-years [95% CI 8.20-22.76], p < 0.05).

Age, gender, employment, marital status, region, , and the number of cardiovascular conditions were covariates. Race and ethnicity were the effect modifiers. Logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the data.From all participants, 16.2% were Black and 11.6 were Hispanic, with a mean age of 51 years old. Overall, higher education levels were associated with lower odds of hospitalization, independent of all confounders. Educational attainment showed significant interactions with race (OR =1.04, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.08) and ethnicity (OR = 1.04, 95% CI =1.01 -1.07) on hospitalization, indicating smaller protective effects of educational attainment on hospitalization of Hispanics and Blacks than non-Hispanic Whites.The protective effect of educational attainment on population health is smaller for Blacks and Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic Whites. To prevent health disparities, there is a need to minimize diminished returns of educational attainment for racial and ethnic minorities. To do so, there is a need for innovative and bold economic, public, and social policies that do not limit themselves to equalizing socioeconomic status but also help minorities leverage their available resources and gain tangible outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656174>Later achievement of infant motor milestones is related to lower levels of physical activity during childhood: the GECKO Drenthe cohort.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to investigate whether age of infant motor milestone achievement is related to levels of physical activity (PA), weight status and blood pressure at age 4-7 years of age.In the Dutch GECKO (Groningen Expert Center of Kids with ) Drenthe cohort, the age of achieving the motor milestone 'walking without support' was reported by parents.

The therapeutic use of synthetic HDL (sHDL) containing the recombinant form of apoA-IMilano (sHDL-apoA-IM), originating from the observation that carriers of this mutation have low levels of HDL-cholesterol without increased atherosclerosis, still on open question. Additionally, recent data uncover new therapeutic applications of this sHDL-apoA-IM. This review provides an overview of all potential application of sHDL-apoA-IM in some inflammatory-based disease.   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A recent study demonstrated that the delivery of therapeutic apoA-IM full-length proteins via oral administration of rice seeds protein extracts proved effective in reducing atherosclerosis development in Apoe-deficient mice. Moreover, the rice milk-apoA-IM preserved both in-vitro and in-vivo anti-inflammatory properties, as already observed when sHDL-apoA-IM were given by intravascular infusion. In addition, various studies suggested that sHDL-apoA-IM could positively affect other inflammatory-based disease. Altogether these data might represent a new starting point for "sHDL-apoA-IM-based therapies" in chronic degenerative disease. .The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655323>Night-time cardiac autonomic modulation as a function of sleep-wake stages is modified in otherwise healthy overweight adolescents.</a></h2><p>Even though sympathetic dominance during the daytime period is well known, currently, scarce data exist on autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation during sleep in pediatric . We aimed to evaluate sleep cardiac ANS regulation in normal-weight (NW) and overweight and obese (OW) adolescents.In this study, 60 healthy adolescents (15.7 ± 0.7 years) belonging to a birth cohort since infancy were classified based on body mass index percentiles criteria as: OW (N = 27) or NW (N = 33). Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography (PSG) during two consecutive in-lab overnight sessions. Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep stages (stages 1, 2, and slow-wave sleep [SWS]), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and wakefulness (Wake) were scored. R-waves were detected automatically in the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. An all-night heart rate variability analysis was conducted in the ECG signal, with several time- and frequency-domain measures calculated for each sleep-wake stage. Sleep time was divided into thirds (T1, T2, T3). The analysis was performed using a mixed-effects linear regression model.Sleep organization was comparable except for reduced REM sleep percentage in the OW group (p < 0.04). Shorter R-R intervals were found for all sleep stages in the OW group; time-domain measured standard deviation of all R-R intervals (RRSD) was lower during stage 2, SWS and REM sleep (all p < 0.05). The square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) was also lower only during wake after sleep onset (WASO) in T1 and T3 (p < 0.05). The OW group had increased very low- and low-frequency (LF) power during WASO (in T1 and T2), and LF power during stage 2 and REM sleep (in T2). During WASO in the OW group, high-frequency (HF) power was lower (in T1 and T2), and LF/HF ratio was higher (in T2, p < 0.007).Several sleep-stage-dependent changes in cardiac autonomic regulation characterized the OW group. As sleep-related ANS balance was disturbed in the absence of concomitant metabolic alterations in this sample of otherwise healthy OW adolescents, their relevance for pediatric  should be further explored throughout development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There is scarce research pertaining to the diagnostic accuracy of a preoperative diagnostic modality in comparison to intraoperative diagnosis, along with patient characteristics and related factors contributing to hiatal hernia.To identify the prevalence and associations of hiatal hernia in the bariatric patient population, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of upper gastrointestinal series and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with the intraoperative findings across various patient characteristics.Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, Teaching Hospital, New York, USA.Retrospective study of patients from 2015 to 2018 who met National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery.There were 1094 patients included (135 males, 959 females), with an age range of 18 to 74 years. The diagnostic accuracy was determined by a sensitivity of 64.71% (95% confidence interval [CI] .55-.70), specificity of 74.38% (95% CI .71-.70), positive predictive value of 29.86% (95% CI .24-.30), negative predictive value of 92.59% (95%CI .89-90), likelihood ratio of 2.526, and P value < .0001 for esophagogastroduodenoscopy; a sensitivity of 14.02% (95% CI .08-0), specificity of 98.23% (95% CI .96-.90), positive predictive value of 71.43% (95% CI .50-.80), negative predictive value of 78.35% (95% CI .74-.80), likelihood ratio 7.921, and P value < .0001 were used for upper gastrointestinal series. Hiatal hernia with age <60 years was 17.09% versus 48.44% at >60 years (P < .0001). Hiatal hernia incidence was 17% in Hispanics, 22.5% in Caucasians, and 23.10% in blacks.The prevalence of hiatal hernia is 18.92%. There is strong association between hiatal hernia and age and ethnicity and no association based on sex and body mass index. The diagnostic accuracy of upper gastrointestinal series is very low compared with that of esophagogastroduodenoscopy for hiatal hernia. Preoperative diagnosis of hiatal hernia in the bariatric population is not required based on our study. Not only does it lessen the economic burden, patient wait time, and discomfort of an additional study, but preoperative diagnosis does not change, alter, or aid in the intraoperative management of hiatal hernia considering the suboptimal accuracy of preoperative diagnostics, thus deeming them unwarranted.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Despite evidence of negative attitudes towards students who are overweight, comparatively little research has examined whether teachers provide biased assessments of student work.The purpose of this study was to experimentally test whether middle and high school teachers unfairly assess students who are overweight and perceive them to be less competent.Participants included 133 teachers from first-ring suburban middle and high schools (M  = 16 years; 38% male).Teachers evaluated the quality of a bogus student essay assignment accompanied by photographs that portrayed the student as either not overweight or overweight. Weight bias was assessed by having teachers grade the essay and provide perceptions of student sufficiency (perceived effort, need for tutoring, and overall success in school). Opinions about bias in grading for other teachers and self were also assessed.Essays for students who were overweight were judged to be similar in structural quality, but were assigned lower grades compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Further, teachers estimated that students who were overweight put forth more effort, needed more remedial assistance, and had lower overall grades in school. Teachers' beliefs about grading bias showed low levels of supposed bias among other teachers and a significantly lesser degree for themselves.This study confirms prior research on anti-fat attitudes and provides new evidence of biased attitudes in school settings.© 2019 The British Psychological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655530>Relationship of mesenteric panniculitis with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) is an idiopathic benign disease characterized by fat necrosis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice , insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA. Together, our studies identify an important role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in maintaining hepatic homeostasis by ameliorating steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress  the NF-κB-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic scheme for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.-Zhou, L., Li, Q., Chen, A., Liu, N., Chen, N., Chen, X., Zhu, L., Xia, B., Gong, Y., Chen, X.

All patients were examined before and 3 months after the correspondent bariatric surgery. Gut microbiome profile was assessed by the sequencing of amplicons from the 16S rDNA gene by next-generation sequencing.Gut microbiota profiles significantly differed between surgical procedures. RYGB suffered the largest changes in the microbiota population. SG and RYGB differed in their profiles with higher levels of Akkermansia, Eubacterium, Haemophilus, and Blautia for SG, while Veillonella, Slackia, Granucatiella, and Acidaminococcus occurred with greater levels in RYGB. RYGB microbiota changes were reflected also at the level of functionality, especially in pathways related to environmental adaptation. A biomarker discovery analysis revealed the genus Blautia as characteristic in SG, while Veillonella was of RYGB.Our study shows a shift of the gut microbiome after a bariatric surgery in a procedure-related manner.

As effective pharmacological treatment has recently been developed, diagnosing LepR deficiency is urgent. However, recognition is challenging and prevalence is unknown. We aim to elucidate the clinical spectrum and to estimate prevalence of LepR deficiency in Europe.Comprehensive epidemiologic analysis and systematic literature review.We curated a list of LEPR variants described in patients and elaborately evaluated their phenotypes. Subsequently, we extracted allele frequencies from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), consisting of sequencing data of 77,165 European individuals. We then calculated the number of individuals with biallelic disease-causing LEPR variants.Worldwide, 86 patients with LepR deficiency are published. We add two new patients, bringing the total of published patients to 88, of which 21 are European. All patients had early-onset ; 96% had hyperphagia; 34% had one or more pituitary hormone deficiencies. Our calculation results in 998 predicted patients in Europe, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.34 per 1 million people (95% CI 0.95-1.72).This study shows that LepR deficiency is more prevalent in Europe (n=998 predicted patients) than currently known (n=21 patients), suggesting that LepR deficiency is underdiagnosed. An important cause for this could be lack of access to genetic testing. Another possible explanation is insufficient recognition, as only one-third of patients has pituitary hormone deficiencies.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The micro strains on the femur during single-leg stance of gait were measured on critical stress points based on the Gruen femoral zones.The micro strains increase as the weight increases implying that the displacement in the hip joint endoprosthesis is higher for overweight subjects enhancing the risk of failure. The highest increase was measured in Gruen zone 1 by 5.60% indicating that the great trochanter is subjected to higher stress shielding with increasing the weight. Also, the statistically significant increase of the micro strain values with increasing the weight in Gruen Zones 3 (2.91%), 5 (1.56%), and 11 (1.75%) may enhance the risk for a periprosthetic fracture at the lower region of the prosthesis.This is the first biomechanical study which quantifies the effect of increasing weight loading conditions on the mechanical environment of the hip joint endoprosthesis considering different positions of evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a higher oxygen saturation target would increase arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO in obese patients after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).Obese patients having CABG were recruited. With a randomized crossover design, we compared two oxygenation strategies for 30 min each, immediately after extubation: a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO) target of ≥ 95% achieved with manual oxygen titration (liberal) and a SpO target of 90% achieved with FreeO, an automated oxygen titration device (conservative). The main outcome was end-of-period arterial PaCO.Thirty patients were included. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) body mass index (BMI) was 34 (3) kg·m and mean (SD) baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO) was 40.7 (3.1) mmHg. Mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO was 42.0 (5.4) mmHg in the conservative period, compared with 42.6 (4.6) mmHg in the liberal period [mean difference - 0.6 (95% confidence interval - 2.2 to 0.9) mmHg; P = 0.4]. Adjusted analysis for age, BMI, narcotics, and preoperative PaCO did not substantively change the results. Fourteen patients were retainers, showing an elevation in mean (SD) PaCO in the liberal period of 3.3 (4.1) mmHg. Eleven patients had the opposite response, with a mean (SD) end-of-period PaCO decrease of 1.8 (2.2) mmHg in the liberal period. Five patients had a neutral response.This study did not show a clinically important increase in PaCO associated with higher SpO values in this specific population of obese patients after CABG.

In this review we summarize historical data highlighting the effects of exogenous OXT as a short-term regulator of food intake in a context specific manner and the receptor populations that may mediate these effects.

We describe recent data on the effectiveness of chronic CNS administration of OXT to decrease food intake and weight gain or to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese mice and rats. Of clinical importance is the finding that both chronic central and peripheral OXT treatment evoke weight loss in obese animal models with impaired leptin signaling at doses that are not associated with visceral illness, tachyphylaxis, or adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these results have been largely recapitulated following chronic subcutaneous or intranasal treatment in DIO nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) and obese humans, respectively.

All types of clinical studies were considered. A total of 2 independent reviewers assessed quality using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. Ratings were used to provide an overall score for each study (low, moderate, or high). Data were synthesized in evidence tables.From 233 potentially relevant publications, only 28 studies were included. Of these, 13 (46%) were randomized control trials, 11 were single-arm studies (39%), 3 were nonrandomized controlled trials (11%), and 1 study was a cluster randomized trial (4%). The studies were classified as low (15), high (7), and moderate (6) quality according to SIGN criteria.

Using qualitative methods to augment understanding of intervention success may be one way to gain insight into the types of behavior change strategies that are most effective in childhood  interventions.COACH was a randomized controlled trial of 117 Latino parent-child (ages 3-5) pairs in Nashville, TN that resulted in improved child BMI in intervention vs. control families at 1-year follow-up. All participant parents were invited to focus groups after the trial. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated into English. A hierarchical coding scheme was generated, and qualitative analysis done using an inductive/deductive approach. Both theme saturation and consensus between the coders were achieved. Responses were compared between intervention and control groups.We conducted seven focus groups with 43 participants. 4 themes emerged from the intervention group: 1) perceived barriers to health behavior change; 2) strategies learned to overcome perceived barriers; 3) behavioral changes made in response to the program; and 4) knowledge, skills, and agency for family health behaviors. 4 themes emerged from the control group: 1) a desire to engage in health behaviors without specific strategies; 2) common set of barriers to health behavior change; 3) engagement in literacy activities, including creative problem-solving strategies; and 4) changes made in response to study visits. Analysis of coded data showed the intervention increased healthy behaviors (e.g., fruit/vegetable consumption) despite barriers (e.g., time, cost, culture, family dynamics). Intervention participants described using specific behavior change strategies promoted by the intervention including: substituting ingredients in culturally-normative recipes; avoiding grocery shopping when hungry; and coping with inability to meet goals with acceptance and problem-solving. Control participants reported little success in achieving healthy changes for their family. Intervention participants described successful health behavior changes that were shared across generations and were maintained after the program. Intervention participants reported increased awareness of their own agency in promoting their health.Qualitative evaluation of COACH provides a more detailed understanding of the intervention's quantitative effectiveness: child and adult health behaviors and personal agency were improved.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651422>Very Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Sequesters Lipopolysaccharide Into Adipose Tissue During Sepsis.</a></h2><p>Obese patients have lower sepsis mortality termed the " paradox."

Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Caucasian septic shock patients.We measured lipopolysaccharide uptake into adipose tissue 6 hours after injection of fluorescent lipopolysaccharide into mice. Lipopolysaccharide uptake and very low density lipoprotein receptor protein expression were measured in adipocytes. To determine relevance to humans, we genotyped the VLDLR rs7852409 G/C single-nucleotide polymorphism in 519 patients and examined the association of 28-day survival with genotype.Lipopolysaccharide injected into mice was found in adipose tissue within 6 hours and was dependent on very low density lipoprotein receptor but not low density lipoprotein receptors. In an adipocyte cell line decreased very low density lipoprotein receptor expression resulted in decreased lipopolysaccharide uptake. In septic shock patients, the minor C allele of VLDLR rs7852409 was associated with increased survival (p = 0.010). Previously published data indicate that the C allele is a gain-of-function variant of VLDLR which may increase sequestration of very low density lipoprotein (and lipopolysaccharide within very low density lipoprotein) into adipose tissue. When body mass index less than 25 this survival effect was accentuated and when body mass index greater than or equal to 25 this effect was diminished suggesting that the effect of variation in very low density lipoprotein receptor function is overwhelmed when copious adipose tissue is present.Lipopolysaccharide may be sequestered in adipose tissue via the very low density lipoprotein receptor and this sequestration may contribute to improved sepsis survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655283>A case report of an adjustable gastric band erosion and migration into the jejunum resulting in biliary obstruction.</a></h2><p>Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band is a bariatric operation which has lost popularity due to its high rate of reoperation and complications such as band erosion.

The patient did well and was discharged home on postoperative day 8.Once completely eroded into the gastric lumen, a gastric band can migrate into the small bowel with the distance traveled being limited by the length of the connecting tube. The stretched tubing can result in distortion of the ampulla leading to biliary obstruction. Band erosion should be managed with band removal which can be completed using endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open approach.Band migration should be suspected in patients with a history of gastric band placement presenting with bowel or biliary obstruction. Its management depends on the location of the band as well as the expertise of the surgical team.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The adiponectin subsequently imparts a crucial role in metabolic and hepato-inflammatory diseases. The most recent evidences indicate that lipotoxicity-induced inflammation in the liver is associated with -derived alterations and remolding in adipose tissue that culminates in most prevalent liver pathology named as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A comprehensive crosstalk of adiponectin and its cognate receptors, specifically adiponectin receptor-2 in the liver mediates ameliorative effects in -induced NAFLD by interaction with hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Recent studies highlight the implication of molecular mediators mainly involved in the pathogenesis of  and -driven NAFLD, however, the plausible mechanisms remain elusive. The present review aimed at collating the data regarding mechanistic approaches of adiponectin and adiponectin-activated PPARs as well as PPAR-induced adiponectin levels in attenuation of hepatic lipoinflammation. Understanding the rapidly occurring adiponectin-mediated pathophysiological outcomes might be of importance in the development of new therapies that can potentially resolve  and -associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657456>Predictors of postoperative overall and severe complications after surgical treatment for endometrial cancer: The role of the fragility index.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the predictive value of , comorbidities, and fragility on overall and severe complication rate and survival among patients surgically treated for endometrial cancer.Consecutive patients with endometrial cancer treated at the Royal Infirmary Hospital of Edinburgh from June 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, were retrospectively enrolled in an observational study. Considering pre-existing medical conditions, comorbidities, and complications, modified fragility index (mFI) was calculated. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predicting variables of overall (G1-G4) and severe (G3-G4) complication rate.One hundred patients were surgically treated for endometrial cancer. Elevated mFI >3 was related to a statistically higher access rate to the high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ITU) (33.3% vs 6.6%, P=0.013). Overall, 31% of women had postoperative complications. Using multivariate analysis, it was shown that undergoing laparotomy (odds ratio [OR] 7.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-19.71; P<0.001) and having an mFI >3 (OR 7.19, 95% CI 1.43-36.25; P=0.021) were independent predictors of overall complications (G1-G4). Moreover, only smoking (OR 5.01, 95% CI 1.15-21.75; P=0.031) and mFI >3 (OR 5.16, 95% CI 1.07-24.94; P=0.047) were independent factors for severe complications (G3-G4).Modified fragility index was an important predictor of complications among patients treated for endometrial cancer and could be a useful tool for assisting clinicians in perioperative management.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652512>The Metabolic and Hepatic Impact of Two Personalized Dietary Strategies in Subjects with  and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Fatty Liver in  (FLiO) Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide. NAFLD management is mainly focused on weight loss, but the optimal characteristics of the diet demand further investigation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two personalized energy-restricted diets on the liver status in overweight or obese subjects with NAFLD after a 6 months follow-up. Ninety-eight individuals from the Fatty Liver in  (FLiO) study were randomized into two groups and followed different energy-restricted diets. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months. Diet, anthropometry, body composition, and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Liver assessment included ultrasonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, elastography, and determination of transaminases. Both dietary groups significantly improved their metabolic and hepatic markers after the intervention, with no significant differences between them. Multivariate regression models evidenced a relationship between weight loss, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), and a decrease in liver fat content, predicting up to 40.9% of its variability after 6 months. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of the diet was inversely associated with liver fat content. Participants in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet showed a greater reduction in body weight, total fat mass, and hepatic fat. These results support the benefit of energy-restricted diets, high adherence to the MedDiet, and high antioxidant capacity of the diet for the management of NAFLD in individuals with overweight or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654177>Mechanisms underlying electro-mechanical dysfunction in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat heart: a model of  and type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major and worsening global health problem, currently affecting over 450 million people and reducing their quality of life.

How long-term dietary BCAAs impact late-life health and lifespan is unknown. Here, we show that when dietary BCAAs are varied against a fixed, isocaloric macronutrient background, long-term exposure to high BCAA diets leads to hyperphagia,  and reduced lifespan. These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino acid quality in energy balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648012>Recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor decreases fat accumulation via the IIS pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (BTI) is a low molecular weight polypeptide that can help to prevent metabolic diseases such as , hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Herein, the effects of recombinant BTI (rBTI) on fat accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans were studied. rBTI prevented fat accumulation under normal and high glucose conditions, and led to significantly shorter body widths without affecting C. elegans feeding behavior. Results also indicate that rBTI altered fat breakdown, synthesis, and accumulation by altering the transcription, expression and activity of key enzymes in lipolysis and fat synthesis. In daf-2 and daf-16 mutants, rBTI did not prevent fat accumulation, indicating that rBTI activity relies on the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) pathway. Overall rBTI may regulate changes in lipolysis and fat synthesis by down-regulating the IIS pathway, which can affect fat accumulation. These findings support the application of rBTI in preventing , hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.Copyright © 2018.

Using 17,370 term labor inductions without documented medical indications occurring at 14 U.S. hospitals, 2007-2012, we created and evaluated a model predicting cesarean delivery. We assessed model calibration and discrimination, and we used bootstrapping for internal validation. We externally validated the model by using 2122 labor inductions from a hospital not included in the development cohort.  The model contained eight variables-gestational age, maternal race, parity, maternal age, , fibroids, excessive fetal growth, and history of herpes-and was well calibrated with good risk stratification at the extremes of predicted probability. The model had an area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.83), and it performed well on internal validation. The AUC in the external validation cohort was 0.82.

The major cell type in the adipose tissue, the adipocytes or fat cells, are remarkably plastic and can increase or decrease their size and number to adapt to changes in systemic or local metabolism. Changes in adipocyte size occur through hypertrophy or atrophy, and changes in cell numbers mainly involve de novo generation of new cells or death of existing cells. Recently, dedifferentiation, whereby a mature adipocyte is reverted to an undifferentiated progenitor-like status, has been reported as a mechanism underlying adipocyte plasticity. Dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes has been observed under both physiological and pathological conditions. This review covers several aspects of adipocyte dedifferentiation, its relevance to adipose tissue function, molecular pathways that drive dedifferentiation, and the potential of therapeutic targeting adipocyte dedifferentiation in human health and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Author(s).

Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is frequently documented in chronic kidney disease, , diabetes and advanced age, all of which are risk factors for resistant hypertension. Sympathetic overactivity and chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system are salient features of resistant hypertension. Interestingly, recent data indicate that renal sympathetic overactivity can reduce the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the paraventricular nucleus. Reduced NO levels in the paraventricular nucleus can increase sympathetic outflow and this can create a vicious cycle contributing to resistant hypertension. Angiotensin II can reduce l-arginine transport and hence NO production. Reduced NO levels may reduce the formation of angiotensin 1-7 dampening the cardio-protective effects of the renin-angiotensin system contributing to resistant hypertension. In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is demonstrated to be independently associated with resistant hypertension, and IL-6 can reduce NO synthesis. Despite this, NO levels have not been quantified in resistant hypertension. Findings from a small proof of concept study indicate that NO donors can reduce blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension but more studies are required to validate these preliminary findings. In the present paper, we put forward the hypothesis that reduced NO bioavailability contributes substantially to the development of resistant hypertension.© 2019 The Author(s).

Almost all respondents recommended reduction of body mass and lifestyle changes, and less than half (46.4%) recommended pharmacological treatment.NAFLD was the most common liver disease that was the reason for medical consultations, but its incidence seems to be underestimated due to referral for further diagnostics only in patients with abnormal aminotransferases. The diagnostic methods used to assess the severity of the liver fibrosis and the recommended pharmacological treatment varied depending on the physician's specialisation and the centre's reference level.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652358>Predicted Basal Metabolic Rate and Cancer Risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (Epic).</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence suggests that a metabolic profile associated with  may be a more relevant risk factor for some cancers than adiposity per se. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on cancer risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 -related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and cancer risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with . However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; 5.03), and distal colon cancer (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal colon (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain cancer types, and may be a useful predictor of cancer risk independent of body fatness.

The mechanisms by which maternal  can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational . The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational  and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal . High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal  lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational  enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational , focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

Microbiota-derived metabolites act both as nutrients and as messenger molecules and can signal to distant organs in the body to shape host pathophysiology. In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of microbiota-derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new microbiota-based therapies to treat  and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the microbiota-host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651309>A predictive model for non-completion of an intensive specialist  service in a public hospital: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>Despite the growing evidence base supporting intensive lifestyle and medical treatments for severe , patient engagement in specialist  services is difficult to achieve and poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe , termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type 2 diabetes or fatty liver disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist  management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic.

However, the role of bariatric surgery is not well understood in this subgroup.A total of 2244 morbid obese individuals aged 18-65 years undergoing bariatric surgery were selected. Patients were considered MHMO according to the joint interim statement (JIS) definition, as having two or less abnormalities in these five parameters: waist circumference (WC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic or diastolic blood pressure (SBP or DBP), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Otherwise, they were considered metabolically unhealthy morbid obese (MUMO). Follow-up data were collected at 6, 12, and 24 months post-surgery.Prior to surgery, 36.2% of participants were MHMO and had significantly lower BMI, WC, TG, FPG, SBP, and DBP and higher HDL-C compared to MUMO. Both MHMO and MUMO participants showed a significant decrease in BMI, WC, TG, SBP, DBP, and FPG and increase in HDL-C and the percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). Two-year post-operative changes (from baseline) of BMI, WC, and %EWL were greater in MHMO subjects and changes of TG, HDL-C, DBP, SBP, and FPG were greater in MUMO subjects. Further multivariate regression analysis for delta (∆) change in these characteristics revealed that only the delta (∆) changes of WC and %EWL were statistically different between the two phenotypes and were greater in MHMO subjects, 2 years after the surgery (- 3.077 cm decrease in WC and + 3.612% higher %EWL compared to MUMO subjects).Bariatric surgery is an effective method for reduction of metabolic abnormalities and weight loss in both MUMO and MHMO phenotypes.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650016>The Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN) cohort: A data set for biomarker discovery and validation in neurodegenerative disorders.</a></h2><p>The SPIN (Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration) cohort is a multimodal biomarker platform designed for neurodegenerative disease research following an integrative approach.Participants of the SPIN cohort provide informed consent to donate blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples, receive detailed neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, and undergo a structural 3T brain MRI scan.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between hepatic steatosis and IOP in an adult Taiwanese population.Seven thousand seven hundred twelve males and 6325 females who received a health examination at the Tri-Service General Hospital during the period from 2010 to 2016 were included in this study.IOP was measured by noncontact tonometry. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound examination. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the associations among various anthropometric parameters and IOP.After adjusting for pertinent covariables, hepatic steatosis had a closer association with increased IOP than percentage body fat, body mass index, or waist circumference (β = 0.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.006, 0.028). This relationship remained significant among males in the study population (β = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.001, 0.029). Furthermore, hepatic steatosis was significantly correlated with increased risk of high IOP (odd ratios = 1.235, 95% CI = 1.041-1.465).Our study highlights that hepatic steatosis is a better index for assessing the relationship with increased IOP than other anthropometric parameters. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms regulating the association between hepatic steatosis and increasing IOP and even the risk of glaucoma should be examined in further studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649999>Racial discrimination and the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children: Does the timing of first exposure matter?</a></h2><p>Racial discrimination has been observed to negatively impact on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, although evidence surrounding periods of greater vulnerability to the stressor of racism have not yet been explored in this population. We compared first exposure to interpersonal racism at either ages 4-5 years or 7 years with no exposure to examine the influence of sensitive periods of racism exposure on mental health and physiological outcomes during middle childhood (7-12 years). The study cohort comprised 1,759 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 4-12 years from waves 2-8 (2009-2015) of the Footprints in Time: 1The Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC) dataset. Multilevel logistic regression was used in all analysis. We observed a larger effect (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4-5.4) for negative mental health with first exposure at 4-5 years compared to 7 years (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2-3.6), referenced to children with no exposure. Effect sizes were similar in both exposure groups for the significantly increased risk of sleep difficulties, while a stronger adverse effect on behavioural issues was found at 7 years (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-4.0) relative to 4-5 years (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 0.8-3.7). No significant associations were found with general health,  or being underweight. This study generates new evidence surrounding sensitive periods of exposure to racism in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. A pattern of consistently greater adverse effects on mental and physiological health was not observed with first exposure at 4-5 compared to 7 years, although initial evidence indicates that first exposure to racism at these ages increases the likelihood of negative mental health relative to children without racism exposure. Longitudinal data extending from earlier to later developmental periods will allow further investigations into the presence of sensitive periods of exposure to racism in these children.© 2019 The Authors.

However, it is difficult to treat because its inherent genetic heterogeneity results in activation of numerous signaling pathways. Kinases have been targeted for decades with varying results, but the development of therapeutic resistance is a major challenge. Areas covered The key roles of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC1, TP53 microRNAs (miRs) as therapeutic targets are discussed and we suggests novel approaches for targeting miRs or their downstream targets to combat HCC. We performed literature searches using the Medline Database from 2000 to the present. Expert Opinion. The involvement of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC and TP53 pathways as drivers of the disease and drug resistance is a challenge. Moreover, miRs regulate the expression of key genes in these pathways. What we and others are proposing is the prospect of targeting miRs and their downstream targets to improve conventional approaches to treat HCC. Combination approaches are often promising because multiple signaling pathways are deregulated due to diverse mutations and events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654260>Neuroendocrinological mechanisms underlying impulsive and compulsive behaviors in : a narrative review of fMRI studies.</a></h2><p>Impulsivity and compulsivity are multidimensional constructs that are increasingly considered determinants of .

Fifty-two young sedentary men with excess body weight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg·m) were enrolled in a randomized-crossover controlled trial [six weeks of a systematic physical exercise with  or placebo supplementation (4.5 g·day)]. Body composition, blood lipid profile, and maximal oxygen uptake were determined pre/post intervention. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant improvement ( < 0.01) on blood lipid profile in the group of exercise plus . Moreover, correlations of absolute changes of BMI, body fat percentage, blood lipids and maximal oxygen uptake were statistically significant ( < 0.01). These results indicate that the  supplementation could be acting in a synergistic way with exercise due to the enhanced effects on body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood lipid profile.

The Bill established the requirement of a 100% pass-through of the tax to the final consumer and two levels of the tax: 0.08 euro/liter for products with 5-less than 8 g of sugar and 0.12 euro/liter for products with 8 g of sugar or more. Previous literature focusing on the impact of SSB taxes finds that pass-though is only complete in the long-term. Our paper provides new evidence that, when the tax increases prices substantially and immediately, the sales response is also significant. In particular, we estimate that the new SSB tax in Catalonia reduced SSB purchases by 7.7%. We document that part of this reduction is substituted by an increase in sales of zero/light drinks (substitution effect).

Several systemic inflammatory conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease, both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, poor diet and the presence of  may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

In addition, current body mass index (BMI) was measured, and maximum acceptable and dream BMI were assessed.The sample comprised 996 patients with  (age 52.3 [SD = 16.0] years; BMI 41.8 [SD = 7.8] kg/m ; 65.7% women; 52.2% married or living with a partner). Network analysis showed that interpersonal sensitivity and shape-weight concern, but also internalized weight stigma, were the most central and highly interconnected nodes in the network. In contrast, objective binge-eating episodes and dietary restraint were the most peripheral and least connected nodes. Eating disorder features and psychological distress formed two clearly separate clusters. No difference in network structure was found between men and women.The pattern of network node connections supports the importance of assessing psychological distress, interpersonal sensitivity, shape-weight concern, and internalized weight stigma in patients seeking treatment for .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655180>Vascular mechanisms of testosterone: the non-genomic point of view.</a></h2><p>Testosterone (T) is the predominant endogenous androgen in the bloodstream. At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, , atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. In summary, in this paper we consider the non-genomic vascular mode of action of androgen in physiological conditions and the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of  and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649740>The Challenge of Stratifying : Attempts in the Quebec Family Study.</a></h2><p>  is a major health problem worldwide. Given the heterogeneous  phenotype, an optimal  stratification would improve clinical management. Since  has a strong genetic component, we aimed to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) to stratify  according to the genetic background of the individuals.  A total of 231 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated to body mass index (BMI) from 21 genome-wide association studies were genotyped or imputed in 881 subjects from the Quebec Family Study (QFS). The population was randomly split into discovery (80%; n = 704) and validation (20%; n = 177) samples with similar  (BMI ≥ 30) prevalence (27.8% and 28.2%, respectively). Family-based associations with  were tested for every SNP in the discovery sample and a weighed and continuous PRS was constructed. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to test the association of PRS with  in the QFS discovery sample and validated in the QFS replication sample. Furthermore, the Fatty Acid Sensor (FAS) Study (n = 141; 27.7%  prevalence) was used as an independent sample to replicate the results.  The linear trend test demonstrated a significant association of PRS with  in the QFS discovery sample (OR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.24]; P = 2.0x10). We also found that the  prevalence was significantly greater in the higher PRS quintiles compared to the lowest quintile. Significant and consistent results were obtained in the QFS validation sample for both the linear trend test (OR = 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]; P = 6.7x10), and  prevalence across quintiles. These results were partially replicated in the FAS sample (OR = 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24]; P = 2.2x10). PRS explained 7.5%, 3.2%, and 1.2% of BMI variance in QFS discovery, QFS validation, and FAS samples, respectively.  These results revealed that genetic background in the form of a 231 BMI-associated PRS has a significant impact on , but a limited potential to accurately stratify it.

However, its outcomes among elderly patients are unclear. Consecutive patients with SAO were recruited at Jiamusi University First Hospital, China between January 2008 and December 2016. Stroke subtype, severity, and risk factors were collected; outcomes at 3, 12, and 36 months after stroke onset were assessed. A total of 1464 SAO patients were included in this study. Participants aged ≥75 years had higher dependency rates than Participants aged <75 years with SAO in all three follow-up periods, in addition to a higher recurrence rate at 12 months and a higher mortality rate 36 months after stroke. After adjusting for confounders, elevated triglyceride level was found to be a protective factor against mortality 36 months after stroke. Stroke severity, diabetes mellitus, artery stenosis, gender, , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were independently associated with the risk of dependency; elevated triglyceride level was an independent risk factor for recurrence at 3 months point after stroke onset. These findings suggest that it is vital to manage risk factors that may affect prognosis of stroke among elderly patients with SAO to improve patient prognosis and reduce the burden of stroke in China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655800>Second Trimester Maternal Leptin Levels Are Associated with Body Mass Index and Gestational Weight Gain but not Birth Weight of the Infant.</a></h2><p> is increasing among the pregnant population. Leptin has an important role in the regulation of energy balance and hunger. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal leptin levels with maternal , gestational weight gain (GWG), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the leptin gene, and the age-adjusted birth weight of the child.Maternal leptin levels (n = 740) and SNPs (n = 504) were analyzed in blood samples taken within the Uppsala Biobank of Pregnant women at pregnancy weeks 16-19.Maternal leptin levels differed significantly between body mass index (BMI) groups. Normal weight women had the lowest median leptin levels and levels increased with each BMI group. Leptin SNP genotype was not associated with leptin levels or BMI. There was also no association between maternal leptin levels and age-adjusted birth weight of the child except for a negative association between leptin levels and birth weight in the morbid obese group.Maternal BMI was identified as the best positive explanatory factor for maternal leptin levels. Leptin was a strong positive explanatory factor for GWG. Birth weight of children of uncomplicated pregnancies was, however, dependent on maternal height, BMI, GWG, and parity but not leptin levels, except for in morbid obese women where a negative association between maternal leptin levels and birth weight was found. We speculate that this indicates altered placental function, not manifested in pregnancy complication. We conclude that maternal leptin levels do not affect the birth weight of the child more than BMI, GWG, and parity.© 2019 S.

However, in the last few years a new entity has emerged, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual. This category encompasses obese individuals without the presence of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Several studies have thus been undertaken to determine the risk of these MHO individuals for diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases compared with the 'unhealthy' obese. Data are still controversial on this matter, but one trend seems to be emerging: MHO is but a transient phase in the path toward insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We investigated the predictive value of sex on associated symptoms and prevalent cardiovascular disease, after adjustment for relevant confounding factors including age, , and comorbidities.Most of the patients (90%) had OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 5 events/h), and 66% were obese. Women were older than men and had a higher body mass index; however, men had a thicker neck circumference, a higher waist-to-hip ratio, and increased OSA severity (AHI 36 versus 27 events/h, P < .001). Female sex independently predicted prevalent CVD after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.476 [1.154-1.887], P = .002). Men independently were more likely to report driving problems (3.359 [2.470-4.569], P < .001) and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS ≥ 16) (1.355 [1.036-1.773], P = .027).

LP success can depend on the size and anatomy of the patient and the skill of the hematologist. The main objective was to determine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on LP outcomes.  Adults with lymphoid malignancies requiring LP were included prospectively over one year; hematology residents performed most procedures. A 22-gauge Quincke needle was employed. Comparison between non-traumatic vs. traumatic LPs according to BMI, CNS relapse, and residents' year was performed.  Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 31.5±15.57 years were included. Diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-B (74%), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-T (13%) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (13%). 227 LPs were performed, 121 (53.3%) successful, 98 (43.2%) traumatic, 11 (11.2%) TLPs were macroscopically detectable and 87 (88%) microscopic; 8 (3.5%) were dry-taps. Median time between punctures was 11 days (1-202). Median BMI was 25 (22.8-39.6).

We find that exercise enhances resolution of acute inflammation by augmenting resolvin D1 (RvD1) levels and by promoting macrophage phagocytosis. When compared with sedentary controls, mice that performed a four-week treadmill exercise regimen displayed higher macrophage phagocytic activity, enhanced RvD1 levels, and earlier neutrophil clearance following an acute inflammatory challenge. In acute inflammatory cell extracts from exercised mice, we found elevated expression of  and  and higher RvD1 levels. Because exercise stimulates release of epinephrine, which has immunomodulatory effects, we questioned whether epinephrine exerts proresolving actions on macrophages. Epinephrine-treated macrophages displayed higher RvD1 levels and 15-lipoxygenase-1 protein abundance, which were prevented by incubation with the α1 adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) antagonist prazosin. Likewise, stimulation of the α1-AR with phenylephrine enhanced macrophage phagocytosis and RvD1 production. During acute inflammation, prazosin abrogated exercise-enhanced neutrophil clearance, macrophage phagocytosis, and RvD1 biosynthesis. These results suggest that exercise-stimulated epinephrine enhances resolution of acute inflammation in an α1-AR-dependent manner. To our knowledge, our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the proresolving effects of exercise that could lead to the identification of novel pathways to stimulate resolution.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653108>Caffeine and Clinical Outcomes in Premature Neonates.</a></h2><p>Caffeine is the most widely used drug by both adults and children worldwide due to its ability to promote alertness and elevate moods. It is effective in the management of apnea of prematurity in premature infants. Caffeine for apnea of prematurity reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very-low-birth-weight infants and improves survival without neurodevelopmental disability at 18-21 months. Follow-up studies of the infants in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial highlight the long-term safety of caffeine in these infants, especially relating to motor, behavioral, and intelligence skills. However, in animal models, exposure to caffeine during pregnancy and lactation adversely affects neuronal development and adult behavior of their offspring. Prenatal caffeine predisposes to intrauterine growth restriction and small growth for gestational age at birth. However, in-utero exposure to caffeine is also associated with excess growth, , and cardio-metabolic changes in children.

Its known association with  and smoking indicate correlation with other environmental factors, such as diet, suggesting a larger role for lifestyle modifications in disease treatment. This study seeks to assess the contribution of weight loss and dietary intake in HS management. A primary literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL in November 2018 to include association and intervention studies on the influence of diet and weight on HS. Twenty-five articles were included. Meta-analysis of nine case-control studies across Asia, Europe, and the United States showed that HS patients are four times more likely to be obese compared to the general population; random effects pooled odds ratio 4.022 (2.667-6.065), P < 0.001. Five articles assessed weight-loss interventions and revealed mixed findings. The remaining articles included three association studies on micronutrient levels, eight dietary intervention studies, and one article analyzing both micronutrient association and dietary intervention. Included articles in this systematic review reveal that low serum zinc and vitamin D levels are associated with increased lesion count in HS. Supplementation of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B12, or exclusion of dairy or brewer's yeast can be effective in partial or complete lesion resolution. Reviewed data show that weight loss from bariatric surgery may lead to HS improvement but often results in more severe malnutrition that worsens or even leads to new onset HS post bariatric surgery.

This study, determined if -associated proteomic expression patterns in mice sperm parallel those in spermatozoa obtained from obese humans.An obese mouse model was established via feeding a high-fat diet (HFD). Histological analysis identified testicular morphology and a computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA) evaluated sperm parameters. Proteome analysis was performed using a label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS system. Western blot, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses characterized protein expression levels and localization in testis, sperm and clinical samples.Bodyweight gains on the HFD induced hepatic steatosis. Declines in sperm motility accompanied sperm deformity development. Differential proteomic analysis identified reduced cytoskeletal proteins, centrosome and spindle pole associated protein 1 (CSPP1) and Centrin 1 (CETN1), in sperm from obese mice. In normal weight mice, both CSPP1 and CETN1 were localized in the spermatocytes and spermatids. Their expression was appreciable in the post-acrosomal region parallel to the microtubule tracks of the manchette structure in spermatids, which affects spermatid head shaping and morphological maintenance. Moreover, CSPP1 was localized in the head-tail coupling apparatus of the mature sperm, while CETN1 expression was delimited to the post-acrosomal region within the sperm head. Importantly, sperm CSPP1 and CETN1 abundance in both the overweight and obese males decreased in comparison with that in normal weight men.These findings show that regionally distinct expression and localization of CETN1 and CSPP1 is strongly related to spermiogenesis and sperm morphology maintaining.  is associated with declines in the CETN1 and CSPP1 abundance and compromise of both sperm morphology in mice and relevant clinical samples.

This research aimed to uncover the role of adipsin in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population with early cognitive dysfunction and determine whether adipsin contributes to diabetic MCI caused by IR.In our study, 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Demographic data and neuropsychological test results were evaluated. Plasma adipsin level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The MCI group (n = 57) presented higher plasma adipsin levels compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.018). After adjustment for educational attainment, and age, begative correlations were found between plasma adipsin levels and MoCA, Mini Mental State Exam, and Verbal Fluency Test scores(r = - 0.640, p < 0.001; r = - 0.612, p < 0.001; r = - 0.288, p = 0.035; respectively).

This study aims to establish metabolic factors in -related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with -related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum lipid levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In  animal model, rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk metabolism and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid, and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty acid (palmitic acid, PA) to gauge its effects on cell metabolism and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649216>Association of -174 G>C interleukin-6 gene polymorphism with interleukin-6 and c-reactive protein levels and : A case-control study among people/residents of Western Indonesia.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are mediators of inflammatory responses and increase in people who are obese .

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced  and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced , hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658469>Geographic Variation in Prevalence of Adult  in China: Results From the 2013-2014 National Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655950>Cross-Country Comparison of School Neighborhood Food Environments in Houston, Texas and Guadalajara, Mexico.</a></h2><p>Studies in the U.S. and Mexico have observed the clustering of food resources around schools, which may promote the use of these resources.

This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.BA profiles in serum and liver tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts.

This cross-sectional study investigates the contributions of MVRFs to regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and verbal learning & memory among middle-aged adults. We used partial least squares (PLS) analysis to create latent risk factor profiles and examine their associations to CBF in 93 regions of interest among 451 participants (age 50.3 ± 3.5 years) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults. This multivariate analysis revealed regional CBF was lower in relation to  (higher body mass index and waist circumference), dysregulated glucose homeostasis (higher fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance, and higher fasting insulin), and adverse fasting lipid profile (lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides). In a sensitivity analysis, we found that significant associations between MVRFs and CBF were prominent in the hypertension-medicated subgroup. In a mediation model, the PLS-based MVRFs profile was associated with memory performance (rey auditory verbal learning test); however, CBF was not a significant mediator of this association.

Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of , the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive oxygen species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive. These data reveal a new direct role of leptin receptors in the control of vascular homeostasis and present leptin as a potential therapy for the treatment of vascular disease associated with low leptin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652794>The Exploration of Natural Compounds for Anti-Diabetes from Distinctive Species Garcinia  with Comprehensive Review of the Garcinia Family.</a></h2><p>Approximately 400 Garcinia species are distributed around the world.

Unhealthy weight status is a significant public health issue for developing countries, of which Ghana is not excluded. This study evaluated the prevalence of overweight,  and underweight and its related factors among school-aged children and adolescents.A total of 1004 participants were randomly selected from six schools. A structured questionnaire on demography and socioeconomic status of students' parents/guardians was completed by the selected students. Anthropometric parameters were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. BMI-for-age z-scores were used to categorize anthropometric data of the children as underweight, normal, overweight or obese. A cut-off value of > 0.50 was used to define  by WHtR.Overweight prevalence of 13.8% and 12.6 was observed among basic school and high school students respectively based on BMI classification.  prevalence of 8.8% was found in basic school students and 8.9% among high school students. Underweight was observed in 114 (11.3%) basic school students and 86 (8.6%) high school students. There was a difference in sex prevalence in unhealthy weight-behaviours; with more girls being overweight (19.4% vs 7.6%, p < 0.001) and obese (10.2% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.177) compared to boys. High WHtR found in 10.5% of basic students and 5.0% of high school students, with a statistical difference.

Post-occlusion: 4811.3 [4068.9] vs. 7072.8 [7298.8]; p = 0.021), while PAT revealed similar values of reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In entire population, fat mass % (FM%) was an independent determinant of both pre-and post-occlusion skin perfusion. Finally, being obese was associated with a higher risk to have a reduction of both pre- and post-occlusion skin perfusion (OR = 5,82 and 9,27, respectively).LDF showed very early, pre-clinical, vascular involvement in obese adolescents, characterized by impaired skin microcirculation, possibly reflecting a more diffuse microvascular dysfunction to other body tissues. Whether changing life style and improving weight may reverse such pre-clinical alterations remains to be established.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Details of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cutaneous markers were collected for both the groups.Prevalence of hypertension (30.3 vs. 13.6%),  (28.8 vs. 12.2%), hair thinning (36.3 vs. 14.6%), premature graying (49.6 vs. 29.9%), AGA (49.1 vs. 27.4%), and lipid abnormalities (total cholesterol - 16.7 vs. 8.8%; low-density lipoprotein - 7.3 vs. 2.2%; and high-density lipoprotein - 92.5 vs. 88.7%) were higher in cases as compared with control. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AGA [5.619, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.025-7.845, <0.0001] is the strongest predictor of CAD among young Asian male individuals, closely followed by premature graying (5.267, 95% CI: 3.716-7.466, <0.0001),  (4.133, 95% CI: 2.839-6.018, <0.0001), and hair thinning (3.36, 95% CI: 2.452-4.621, <0.0001). SYNTAX score, left ventricle ejection fraction, and degree of disease severity were also found to be independent associates of premature graying and AGA.Our findings support the hypothesis that cutaneous markers are independently associated with underlying CAD irrespective of other classical cardiovascular risk factors. This, in combination with classical markers, could be effectively used for early identification and risk stratification of young patients with occult or established CAD.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', 'diabetes', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655012>Hypocretin/orexin modulates body weight and the metabolism of glucose and insulin.</a></h2><p>The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/orexin) unit affects the functions of several organ systems including the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the reproductive systems. This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to , and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces  by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure. Taken together, hcrt/orexin modulates  and the metabolism of glucose and insulin. The Hcrt/orexin system may thus be a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.This article is protected by copyright.

This study assessed whether participation in a lifestyle intervention improved body mass index (BMI) percentile, BMI z-score, blood pressure, and lipid levels for children and adolescents.The Live Light Live Right program is a lifestyle intervention that uses medical assessment, nutritional education, access to physical fitness classes, and behavioral modification to improve health outcomes. Data was analyzed for 144 subjects aged 2-19 who participated for a minimum of 12 consecutive months between 2002 and 2016. McNemar tests were used to determine differences in the proportion of participants who moved from abnormal values at baseline to normal at follow-up for a given clinical measure. Paired sample t-tests assessed differences in blood pressure and lipid levels. Multiple linear regression assessed the change in blood pressure or lipid levels associated with improvement in BMI% and BMI z-score.The majority were female (62.5%), mean age was 9.6, and 71% were Black. At baseline, 70.1% had severe , systolic hypertension was present in 44, and 13.9% had diastolic hypertension. One-third had abnormally low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at baseline, 35% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 47% had abnormal total cholesterol (TC). The average difference in percentage points of BMI% at follow-up compared was - 3.0 (95% CI: - 5.0, - 1.1; p < 0.003). The mean difference in BMI z-score units at follow-up was - 0.15 (95% CI: - 0.2, - 0.1; p < 0.0001).

Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (△SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; =0.001) or in DBP (△DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (=0.018), months 12 (=0.007), and months 24 (=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all  values >0.05). Our data indicate that genetic susceptibility may affect BP changes in response to weight-loss diet interventions, and protein intake may modify the genetic associations with changes in BP.

However, the role of adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of GDM remains to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of vitamin D (VD) levels, VD receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression with GDM in overweight or obese women.One hundred and forty pregnant women with full-term single-birth cesarean-section were selected as the study subjects and grouped (70 GDM women, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group G1] and 35 women with overweight or  [group G2]; 70 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, including 35 non-overweight/non-obese women [group N1] and 35 overweight/obese women [group N2]). The levels of serum VD, blood biochemistry, and adiponectin were compared in these women. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was isolated from the abdominal wall incision. VDR and PPARγ messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels in these adipose tissues were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The differences between the levels of PPARγ protein and phosphorylated PPARγ Ser273 were detected by Western blotting.The serum VD level of GDM women was lower in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (G1 vs. N1: 20.62 ± 7.87 ng/mL vs. 25.85 ± 7.29 ng/mL, G2 vs. N2: 17.06 ± 6.74 ng/mL vs. 21.62 ± 7.18 ng/mL, P < 0.05), and the lowest in overweight/obese GDM women. VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression was higher in the adipose tissues of GDM women in comparison to that of women with normal glucose tolerance (VDR mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 210.00 [90.58-311.46] vs. 89.34 [63.74-159.92], G2 vs. N2: 298.67 [170.84-451.25] vs. 198.28 [119.46-261.23], PPARγ mRNA: G1 vs. N1: 100.72 [88.61-123.87] vs. 87.52 [66.37-100.04], G2 vs. N2: 117.33 [100.08-149.00] vs. 89.90 [76.95-109.09], P < 0.05), and their expression was the highest in GDM + overweight/obese women. VDR mRNA levels positively correlated with the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), pre-delivery BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and PPARγ mRNA while it negatively correlated with the VD and the adiponectin levels (r = 0.395, 0.336, 0.240, 0.190, 0.235, -0.350, -0.294, respectively, P < 0.05). The degree of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation increased in obese and GDM pregnant women. PPARγ mRNA levels positively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-delivery BMI, FBG, HOMA-IR, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and VDR mRNA, while it negatively correlated with the VD and adiponectin levels (r = 0.276, 0.199, 0.210, 0.230, 0.182, 0.214, 0.270, 0.235, -0.232, -0.199, respectively, P < 0.05).Both GDM and overweight/obese women had decreased serum VD levels and up-regulated VDR and PPARγ mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which was further higher in the overweight or obese women with GDM.

Impaired intestinal barrier functions play a major role in chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI)-associated , but the regulation of BCRP during  and its role in maintaining the intestinal barrier function during CLGI-associated  are unknown. In the present study, using several approaches, including efflux assays, immunoprecipitation/-blotting/-histochemistry, paracellular permeability assay, fluorescence activated cell sorting, cytokine assay, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we report that obese individuals have compromised intestinal BCRP functions and that diet-induced obese mice recapitulate these outcomes. We demonstrate that the compromised BCRP functions during  are due to loss of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of BCRP. Our results indicate that JAK3-mediated phosphorylation of BCRP promotes its interactions with membrane-localized β-catenin essential not only for BCRP expression and surface localization, but also for the maintenance of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions. We observed that reduced intestinal JAK3 expression during human  or JAK3 knockout in mouse or siRNA-mediated β-catenin knockdown in human intestinal epithelial cells all result in significant loss of intestinal BCRP expression and compromised colonic drug efflux and barrier functions. Our results uncover a mechanism of BCRP-mediated intestinal drug efflux and barrier functions and establish a role for BCRP in preventing CLGI-associated  both in humans and in mice.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654282>Multimodal non-invasive monitoring to apply an open lung approach strategy in morbidly obese patients during bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the use of non-invasive variables for monitoring an open-lung approach (OLA) strategy in bariatric surgery. Twelve morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery received a baseline protective ventilation with 8 cmHO of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP). Then, the OLA strategy was applied consisting in lung recruitment followed by a decremental PEEP trial, from 20 to 8 cmHO, in steps of 2 cmHO to find the lung's closing pressure. Baseline ventilation was then resumed setting open lung PEEP (OL-PEEP) at 2 cmHO above this pressure. The multimodal non-invasive variables used for monitoring OLA consisted in pulse oximetry (SpO), respiratory compliance (Crs), end-expiratory lung volume measured by a capnodynamic method (EELV), and esophageal manometry. OL-PEEP was detected at 15.9 ± 1.7 cmHO corresponding to a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (P) of 0.9 ± 1.1 cmHO. ROC analysis showed that SpO was more accurate (AUC 0.92, IC95% 0.87-0.97) than Crs (AUC 0.76, IC95% 0.87-0.97) and EELV (AUC 0.73, IC95% 0.64-0.82) to detect the lung's closing pressure according to the change of P from positive to negative values. Compared to baseline ventilation with 8 cmHO of PEEP, OLA increased EELV (1309 ± 517 vs. 2177 ± 679 mL) and decreased driving pressure (18.3 ± 2.2 vs. 10.1 ± 1.7 cmHO), estimated shunt (17.7 ± 3.4 vs. 4.2 ± 1.4%), lung strain (0.39 ± 0.07 vs. 0.22 ± 0.06) and lung elastance (28.4 ± 5.8 vs. 15.3 ± 4.3 cmHO/L), respectively; all p < 0.0001.

Sedentary women aged 40 and older with overweight and  were recruited. Intervention participants (eight towns) attended twice weekly exercise and nutrition classes for 24 weeks (48 total). Individual-level components included aerobic exercise, progressive strength training, and healthy eating practices; a civic engagement component was designed to address social and built environment factors to support healthy lifestyles. The control group (eight towns) attended didactic healthy lifestyle classes monthly (six total). Dietary and physical activity data were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Dietary data were collected using automated self-administered 24-h dietary recalls, and physical activity data were collected by accelerometry and self-report. Data were analyzed using multilevel linear regression models with town as a random effect.At baseline, both groups fell short of meeting many recommendations for cardiovascular health. Compared to the control group, the intervention group realized significant improvements in intake of fruit and vegetables combined (difference: 0.6 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1, p = .026) and in vegetables alone (difference: 0.3 cup equivalents per day, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6, p = .016). For physical activity, there were no statistically significant between-group differences based on accelerometry. By self-report, the intervention group experienced a greater increase in walking MET minutes per week (difference: 113.5 MET-minutes per week, 95% CI 12.8 to 214.2, p = .027).Between-group differences in dietary and physical activity behaviors measured in this study were minimal.

For avoidant attachment, it was evident only for fathers (SBP: B = -0.70, [-1.33, -0.17]; DBP: B = -0.48, [-0.92, -0.15]) and partners (SBP: B = -0.78, [-1.64, -0.09]; DBP: B = -0.53, [-1.10, -0.11]). These findings suggest that insecure attachment is associated with lower levels of reactivity, which have been linked to negative health outcomes such as poor self-reported health, depression, and . Overall, this research expands on the support and relationship science literature by incorporating under-researched aspects of social relationships (i.e., specific attachment styles) and focusing on the mechanisms by which they are associated with physiological stress responses.© 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654335>Sarcopenic : Epidemiologic Evidence, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutic Perspectives.</a></h2><p>This review provides a comprehensive update on the definition, assessment, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical implications, and therapeutic approach of sarcopenic  (SO) and highlights the challenges, limitations, and knowledge gaps in SO research.The confluence of a rapidly aging population with rising  rates has led to the phenotype of SO, defined as the concurrent presence of sarcopenia and . Despite efforts, a standardized definition of SO is still lacking. Its prevalence varies widely between studies, depending on population characteristics and different definitions. The major pathogenetic mechanisms include age-related changes in body composition and hormonal milieu, positive energy balance, pro-inflammatory pathways, and insulin resistance.

Early screening and prevention of  is critical for averting associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Ethiopia has been using the international (WHO's) BMI cut-off for diagnosing  even though its validity among Ethiopian population was questioned. To address this problem, a new body mass index cut-off was developed for Ethiopian adults using population-specific data. However, its performance in diagnosing  has not been validated. Therefore, this study determined the performance of the newly developed Ethiopian and World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cut-offs in detecting  among Ethiopian adults.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 704 employees of Jimma University from February to April 2015. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique based on their payroll. Data on sociodemographic variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters including body weight and height were measured according to WHO recommendation. Body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using the air displacement plethysmography (ADP) after calibration of the machine. The diagnostic accuracy of the WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) for  in both sexes and Ethiopian BMI cut-off (> 22.2 kg/m for males and >  24.5 kg/m for females) were compared to  diagnosed using ADP measured body fat percentage (> 35% for females and >  25% for males). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa agreements were determined to validate the performance of the BMI cut-offs.In males, WHO BMI cut-off has a sensitivity of 5.3% and specificity of 99.4% (Kappa = 0.047) indicating a slight agreement. However, the Ethiopian cut-off showed a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 87.7% (Kappa = 0.752) indicating a substantial agreement. Similarly, in females, the WHO BMI cut-off showed a sensitivity of 46.9%, while its specificity was 100% (Kappa = 0.219) showing a fair agreement. The Ethiopian BMI cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity 80.0% and a specificity 95.6% (Kappa = 0.701) showing a substantial agreement. The WHO BMI cut-off underestimated the prevalence of  by a maximum of 73.7% and by a minimum of 28.3% among males, while the values for underestimation ranged from 31.4-54.1% in females. The misclassification was minimal using the newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off. The prevalence of  was underestimated by a maximum of 9.2% and overestimated by a maximum of 6.2%. The WHO BMI cut-off failed to identify nearly half (46.6%) of Ethiopian adults who met the criteria for  using BF% in the overall sample.The findings suggest that WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) is not appropriate for screening  among Ethiopian adults. The newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off showed a better performance with excellent sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and agreement indicating the diagnostic significance of it use as a simple, cost-effective, and valid indicator in clinical and community setups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic acid damages gut epithelium integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during  are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the gut alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

To understand how these interactions contribute to metabolic homeostasis and disease states, we analysed the steady state response of metabolic regulation (catabolic or anabolic) with respect to structural and input perturbations in the integrated signalling network, for varying levels of plasma glucose. Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >5.5 mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4.5 mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino acids and fatty acids from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others. The network perturbations that may contribute to disease states such as diabetes,  and cancer are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between  and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h2><p> traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of  traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of  traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three  traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the  traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that  causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women.  traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death.

Identification of the factors that regulate PPARγ expression and activity is therefore crucial for combating . Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor with a known role in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent studies have suggested that AhR also plays essential roles in energy metabolism. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that experiments with adipocyte-specific Cullin 4b (Cul4b)-knockout mice showed that CUL4B suppresses adipogenesis by targeting PPARγ. Here, using immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, real-time PCR and Gst-pulldown assays, we report that AhR functions as the substrate receptor in CUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complex and is required for recruiting PPARγ. AhR overexpression reduced PPARγ stability and suppressed adipocyte differentiation, and AhR knockdown stimulated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, we found that two lysine sites on residues 268 and 293 in PPARγ are targeted for CRL4B-mediated ubiquitination, indicating cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a critical role of AhR in regulating PPARγ stability and suggest that the AhR-PPARγ interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing metabolic diseases arising from PPARγ dysfunction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648078>The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolism in bone and joint pathologies and ectopic calcification.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipids display important functions in various pathologies such as cancer, , diabetes, cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases. Sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and ceramide are the central molecules of sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) catalyze the conversion of the sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine into S1P. The balance between the levels of S1P and its metabolic precursors ceramide and sphingosine has been considered as a switch that could determine whether a cell proliferates or dies. This balance, also called « sphingolipid rheostat », is mainly under the control of SKs. Several studies have recently pointed out the contribution of SK/S1P metabolic pathway in skeletal development, mineralization and bone homeostasis. Indeed, SK/S1P metabolism participates in different diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cancer-derived bone metastasis or calcification disorders as vascular calcification. In this review, we will summarize the most important data regarding the implication of SK/S1P axis in bone and joint diseases and ectopic calcification, and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting SK/S1P metabolism for the treatment of these pathologies.Copyright © 2019.

Rosiglitazone is a synthetic ligand while 15-deoxy-Δ -prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ ) is the endogenous agonist of PPARγ. Reticulon 4B (Nogo-B) is the detectable Nogo protein family member in the liver and secreted into circulation. Herein, we determined if rosiglitazone can alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis in mice.Wild type, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ or Nogo-B knockout mice received intragastric administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and/or rosiglitazone, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the involved mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from PBC patients and non-PBC controls to analyze cholestasis-related serum parameters.Rosiglitazone prevented wild type but not hepatocyte-specific PPARγ deficient mice from ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis by activating expression of bile homeostatic molecules, reducing hepatic necrosis, and correcting abnormal serum parameters and bile enterohepatic circulation. Nogo-B deficiency had similar protections to rosiglitazone. ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis reduced 15d-PGJ but increased Nogo-B in serum, and both were corrected by rosiglitazone. Nogo-B deficiency in the liver boosted 15d-PGJ production, thereby activating expression of PPARγ and bile homeostatic molecules. Rosiglitazone and Nogo-B deficiency also alleviated cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia. Furthermore, reduced 15d-PGJ and increased Nogo-B in PBC patients' serum were determined, with a negative or positive correlation to classical cholestatic parameters. In addition, rosiglitazone reduced symptoms of the established intrahepatic cholestasis.Our study demonstrates that 15d-PGJ and Nogo are important biomarkers for intrahepatic cholestasis. Synthetic PPARγ ligands can be used for treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia potentially.This article is protected by copyright.

To better understand the effects of whole diets on stress system responsiveness, we examined randomized control trial effects of a whole food diet based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) on cortisol responsiveness. A randomized, double-blind, controlled 8-week intervention was conducted in overweight and obese women to examine differentiated effects between two diet intervention groups: one based on the 2010 DGA and the other one based on a typical American diet (TAD). During a test week that occurred at baseline and again after 8 weeks of the intervention, we assessed salivary cortisol collected at 14 selected times across the day, including upon awakening, at bedtime, and during a test visit, and administered a standardized social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). There were no statistical differences between the diet groups in salivary cortisol at baseline or after 8 weeks. However, when considering differences in dietary carbohydrate, but not fat or protein, from the pre-intervention (habitual) to the intervention period, there was a significant ( = 0.0001) interaction between diet group, intervention week, saliva sample, and level of intervention-based change in carbohydrate consumption. This interaction was reflected primarily by an 8-week reduction in salivary cortisol during a period just prior to (log Δ -0.35 ± 0.12 nmol/L) and 30 (log Δ -0.49 ± 0.12 nmol/L), 60 (log Δ -0.50 ± 0.13 nmol/L), 90 (log Δ -0.51 ± 0.13 nmol/L), and 120 (log Δ -0.4476 ± 0.1231 nmol/L) min after the TSST in the DGA group having the highest increase (90th percentile) in carbohydrate consumption.

Together, increasing dietary carbohydrate as part of a DGA-based diet may reduce circulating cortisol and dampen psychological stress-related cortisol responsiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648221>Plasma midkine concentrations in healthy children, children with increased and decreased adiposity, and children with short stature.</a></h2><p>Midkine (MDK), one of the heparin-binding growth factors, is highly expressed in multiple organs during embryogenesis. Plasma concentrations have been reported to be elevated in patients with a variety of malignancies, in adults with , and in children with short stature, diabetes, and . However, the concentrations in healthy children and their relationships to age, nutrition, and linear growth have not been well studied.Plasma MDK was measured by immunoassay in 222 healthy, normal-weight children (age 0-18 yrs, 101 boys), 206 healthy adults (age 18-91 yrs, 60 males), 61 children with BMI ≥ 95th percentile (age 4-18 yrs, 20 boys), 20 girls and young women with anorexia nervosa (age 14-23 yrs), and 75 children with idiopathic short stature (age 3-18 yrs, 42 boys). Body fat was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset of subjects. The associations of MDK with age, sex, adiposity, race/ethnicity and stature were evaluated.In healthy children, plasma MDK concentrations declined with age (r = -0.54, P < 0.001) with values highest in infants. The decline occurred primarily during the first year of life. Plasma MDK did not significantly differ between males and females or between race/ethnic groups. MDK concentrations were not correlated with BMI SDS, fat mass (kg) or percent total body fat, and no difference in MDK was found between children with anorexia nervosa, healthy weight and . For children with idiopathic short stature, MDK concentrations did not differ significantly from normal height subjects, or according to height SDS or IGF-1 SDS.In healthy children, plasma MDK concentrations declined with age and were not significantly associated with sex, adiposity, or stature-for-age. These findings provide useful reference data for studies of plasma MDK in children with malignancies and other pathological conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648235>Roles of leptin in the recovery of muscle and bone by reloading after mechanical unloading in high fat diet-fed obese mice.</a></h2><p>Muscle and bone masses are elevated by the increased mechanical stress associated with body weight gain in .

Transforming food systems to optimize human health, ecological health, social equity and economic prosperity will require major changes in power dynamics between players to shift the status quo. The purpose of this paper is to assess these power dynamics and the opportunities for the Great Intergenerational Food Transformation (GIFT)-how this current generation in power can transform food systems within one generation for future generations. The current 'policy inertia' preventing food policy action is due to the strong opposition from the commercial food sector, the reluctance of governments to regulate and tax, and the lack of demand for policy action from civil society. The translation of the market power of large food industries into self-serving political power is the dominant barrier to action. The most promising systemic lever for holding the major power players (governments and food industries) to account for the GIFT is increasing the power of civil society (including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), researchers, professional societies and the public) to demand changes in the political economy of food.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654345>Laparoscopic One-Anastomosis Gastric Bypass with Band-Separated Gastric Pouch (OAGB-BSGP): a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>One-anastomosis gastric bypass with band-separated gastric pouch (OAGB-BSGP) is a novel "staplerless" version of OAGB.

Both groups received standard pregnancy dietary orientation at recruitment, while the intervention group received 8 weeks of real-time food coaching via a smartphone app. This food-coaching smartphone app (Glycoleap, Holmusk, Singapore) aimed to improve care and outcomes for people with diabetes. Pregnant women using this app were able to upload food images (eg, a picture of a meal, a drink, or a dessert) and received real-time and detailed food-coaching comments and guidance provided by professional dietitians during the day (8 AM to 8 PM). We recorded detailed characteristics during recruitment and examined anthropometry at all visits. We compared the mean differences of the 8-week gestational weight gain and macronutrient intake between the two groups.Upon study completion, three subjects dropped out from the intervention, and one gave birth prematurely in the control group. The acceptance rate of the smartphone app was 90%. More participants achieved optimal gestational weight gain per week in the intervention group (8/12, 67%) than in the control group (5/14, 36%). After the 8-week intervention, women in the intervention group appeared to have lower gestational weight gain (mean difference=-0.08 kg; 95% CI -1.80 to 1.63) and cholesterol intake (mean difference=-31.73 mg; 95% CI -102.91 to 39.45) than those in the control group.Our findings showed that this food-coaching smartphone app is feasible and favorable for weight gain control and cholesterol intake control among overweight and obese pregnant women. Although our results were not significant (perhaps, attributed to the small sample size), it provided proof of concept for the feasibility of applying such technology in future randomized controlled trials with a larger sample size, an earlier intervention onset, and a longer follow-up for overweight and obese pregnant women.©Ling-Jun Li, Izzuddin M Aris, Wee Meng Han, Kok Hian Tan.

However, little is known about the effect of acute mood states on vascular function. Here we examine the relation between vascular function and mood state in individuals with bipolar disorder.This prospective study followed 40 individuals with bipolar disorder for up to 6 months. Participants were assessed for mood state and vascular function at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 months. Mood state was determined using clinician-administered Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Vascular function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, forearm vascular resistance (FVR), and arterial stiffness.Participants had a mean age of 30.1 years and 75% were male. Primary outcome measures FMD and nitroglycerine-mediated dilation were not found to have statistically significant associations with depressive or manic symptoms. In unadjusted models, higher manic symptoms were significantly associated with increased FVR nitroprusside-mediated dilation and diastolic blood pressure. In adjusted models, higher depressive symptoms were significantly associated with increases in augmentation index adjusted for heart rate of 75 bpm, and higher manic symptoms remained associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.FMD may have limited sensitivity as a biomarker for measuring short-term effects of mood state. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to clarify the temporal relation between chronic mood symptoms and vascular function in bipolar disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656624>Association between adiposity levels and cognitive impairment in the Chilean older adult population.</a></h2><p>Although both  and ageing are risk factors for cognitive impairment, there is no evidence in Chile on how  levels are associated with cognitive function. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between adiposity levels and cognitive impairment in older Chilean adults. This cross-sectional study includes 1384 participants, over 60 years of age, from the Chilean National Health Survey 2009-2010. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination. BMI and waist circumference (WC) were used as measures of adiposity. Compared with people with a normal BMI, the odds of cognitive impairment were higher in participants who were underweight (OR 4·44; 95 % CI 2·43, 6·45;  < 0·0001), overweight (OR 1·86; 95 % CI 1·06, 2·66;  = 0·031) and obese (OR 2·26; 95 % CI 1·31, 3·21;  = 0·003). The associations were robust after adjustment for confounding variables. Similar results were observed for WC.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal  and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-B, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651605>Non Communicable Disease risk factors among a cohort of mine workers in Mongolia.</a></h2><p>Prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is growing among workers globally, causing 71% of all premature deaths.

Activity limitations negatively impact social connectedness and psychological well-being, reducing the quality of life (QoL) of patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing information on QoL in KOA patients and share the reported individual factors, which may influence it.We conducted a systematic review examining the literature up to JAN/2017 available at MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO using KOA and QOL related keywords. Inclusion criteria were QOL compared to at least one demographic factor (e.g., age, gender), lifestyle factor (e.g., functional independence), or comorbidity factor (e.g., diabetes, ) and a control group. Analytical methods were not considered as part of the original design.A total of 610 articles were reviewed, of which 62 met inclusion criteria. Instruments used to measure QoL included: SF-36, EQ-5D, KOOS, WHOQOL, HAS, AIMS, NHP and JKOM. All studies reported worse QoL in KOA patients when compared to a control group. When females were compared to males, females reported worse QOL.  as well as lower level of physical activity were reported with lower QoL scores. Knee self-management programs delivered by healthcare professionals improved QoL in patients with KOA. Educational level and higher total mindfulness were reported to improve QoL whereas poverty, psychological distress, depression and lacking familial relationships reduce it. Surgical KOA interventions resulted in good to excellent outcomes generally; although, results varied by age, weight, and depression.KOA has a substantial impact on QoL. In KOA patients, QoL is also influenced by specific individual factors including gender, body weight, physical activity, mental health, and education. Importantly, education and management programs designed to support KOA patients report improved QoL. QoL data is a valuable tool providing health care professionals with a better comprehension of KOA disease to aid implementation of the most effective management plan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652865>Development of a Food-Based Diet Quality Score from a Short FFQ and Associations with  Measures, Eating Styles and Nutrient Intakes in Finnish Twins.</a></h2><p>We constructed a food-based diet quality score (DQS) and examined its association with  measures, eating styles and nutrient intakes. Participants were 3592 individuals (764 dizygotic [DZ] and 430 monozygotic [MZ] twin pairs) from the FinnTwin16 study. The DQS (0-12 points) was constructed from a short 14 item food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures and eating styles were self-reported. Nutrient intakes were calculated from food diaries completed in a subsample of 249 individuals (45 same-sex DZ and 60 MZ twin pairs). Twins were analyzed both as individuals and as twin pairs. The DQS was inversely associated with body mass index (β = -0.12, per one-unit increase in DQS,  < 0.001), waist circumference (β = -0.34,  < 0.001),  (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95,  = 0.004) and abdominal  (OR: 0.88,  < 0.001), independent of sex, age, physical activity and education. A higher DQS was associated with health-conscious eating, having breakfast, less snacking, fewer evening meals, and a higher frequency and regularity of eating. The DQS was positively correlated with the intakes of protein, fiber and magnesium and negatively correlated with the intakes of total fat, saturated fat and sucrose. Within twin pairs, most of the associations between the DQS with eating styles and some nutrients remained, but the DQS was not associated with  measures within twin pairs. The DQS is an easy-to-use tool for ranking adults according to diet quality and shows an association with  measures, eating styles and key nutrients in the expected direction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648154>Indoor light pollution and progression of carotid atherosclerosis: A longitudinal study of the HEIJO-KYO cohort.</a></h2><p>Exposure to light at inappropriate times in relation to the solar cycle can disturb circadian endocrine and metabolic rhythms. Previous studies have suggested an association between light exposure at night (LAN) and , an important risk factor of atherosclerosis, although it remains unclear whether LAN associates with progression of atherosclerosis. To evaluate the longitudinal association between bedroom LAN intensity and progression of carotid atherosclerosis, light intensity in the bedroom at baseline and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) at baseline and follow-up were measured in 989 elderly participants (945 at baseline and 780 at a median follow-up time of 34 months). The mean age of the participants was 71.4 ± 6.9 years. The average mean and maximal carotid IMT at baseline were 0.88 ± 0.15 and 1.10 ± 0.32 mm, respectively. The median intensity of bedroom LAN was 0.68 lx (IQR, 0.07-3.29). In multivariable analysis adjusted for potential confounders, the highest LAN group exhibited a significant increase in mean carotid IMT (adjusted β, 0.028; 95% CI, 0.005-0.052; P = 0.019) compared with the lowest LAN quartile group. A similar relationship was found between LAN and maximal carotid IMT (adjusted β, 0.083; 95% CI, 0.037-0.129; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found a clear and significant association between bedroom LAN intensity and progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, which was independent of known risk factors for atherosclerosis, including age, , smoking, economic status, hypertension, and diabetes. Indoor light pollution may be a potential risk factor for atherosclerosis in the general population.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, observational studies revealed both negative and positive associations between body shape (BS) and AD, thereby making it difficult to confirm causality due to residual confounds and reverse causation. Thus, using genome-wide association study summary data, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were applied to identify whether there exists a causal association between BS and AD. BS was measured using anthropometric traits (ATs) in this study, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-hip ratio adjusted by body mass index (WHRadjBMI), and waist circumference (WC). The associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with each AT and AD were obtained separately from aggregated data from the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary data (17,008 cases with AD and 37,154 controls). An inverse-variance weighted method was applied to obtain the overall causal estimate for multiple instrumental SNPs. The odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for AD risk per 1-SD difference in BMI was 1.04 (0.88, 1.23), in WHR was 1.01 (0.77, 1.33), in WHRadjBMI was 1.12 (0.89, 1.41), and in WC was 1.02 (0.82, 1.27). Furthermore, simulation analyses of survivor bias indicated the overall causal effect of BMI on risk of AD was not biased. In conclusion, the evidence from MR analyses showed no casual effect of BS on AD risk, which is inconsistent with the results from previous observational studies. The biological mechanism underlying the findings warrants further study.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Sun and Zhou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649841>Structural simplification: an efficient strategy in lead optimization.</a></h2><p>The trend toward designing large hydrophobic molecules for lead optimization is often associated with poor drug-likeness and high attrition rates in drug discovery and development.

However, it is unclear whether this effect extends to the extremely obese. In this large multicenter registry-based study, we sought to examine the relationship between BMI and long-term clinical outcomes following PCI, and in particular to evaluate the association between extreme  and long-term survival after PCI. Methods and Results This cohort study included 25 413 patients who underwent PCI between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2017, who were prospectively enrolled in the Melbourne Interventional Group registry. Patients were stratified by World Health Organization-defined BMI categories. The primary end point was National Death Index-linked mortality. The median length of follow-up was 4.4 years (interquartile range 2.0-7.6 years). Of the study cohort, 24.8% had normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m), and 3.3% were extremely obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m). Patients with greater degrees of  were younger and included a higher proportion of diabetics (<0.001). After adjustment for age and comorbidities, a J-shaped association was observed between different BMI categories and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (normal BMI, HR 1.00 [ref]; overweight, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93, <0.001; mild , HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94, =0.002; moderate , HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80-1.12, =0.54; extreme  HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65, =0.01).

Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human , apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human . Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in .Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649277>Understanding childhood  in the US: the NIH environmental influences on child health outcomes (ECHO) program.</a></h2><p>Few resources exist for prospective, longitudinal analysis of the relationships between early life environment and later  in large diverse samples of children in the United States (US).

We describe demographics and overweight and  prevalence in ECHO, and ECHO's potential as a resource for understanding how early life environmental factors affect  risk.In this cross-sectional study of 70 extant US and Puerto Rico cohorts, 2003-2017, we examined age, race/ethnicity, and sex in children with body mass index (BMI) data, including 28,507 full-term post-birth to <2 years and 38,332 aged 2-18 years. Main outcomes included high BMI for age <2 years, and at 2-18 years overweight (BMI 85th to <95th percentile),  (BMI ≥ 95th percentile), and severe  (BMI ≥ 120% of 95th percentile).The study population had diverse race/ethnicity and maternal demographics. Each outcome was more common with increasing age and varied with race/ethnicity. High BMI prevalence (95% CI) was 4.7% (3.5, 6.0) <1 year, and 10.6% (7.4, 13.7) for 1 to <2 years; overweight prevalence increased from 13.9% (12.4, 15.9) at 2-3 years to 19.9% (11.7, 28.2) at 12 to <18 years. ECHO has the statistical power to detect relative risks for 'high' BMI ranging from 1.2 to 2.2 for a wide range of exposure prevalences (1-50%) within each age group.ECHO is a powerful resource for understanding influences of chemical, biological, social, natural, and built environments on onset and trajectories of  in US children.

From Nov 2013 to Jul 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Hainan and Shaanxi Provinces in China. Two thousand two hundred eighty-three children and adolescents aged 7-18 underwent anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Fasting blood was collected and serum total calcium was tested. Blood pressure standards from the updated Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents were used to classify BP groups based on age, sex and stature.  The overall prevalence of pre-hypertension and hypertension were 8.36 and 7.06%, respectively. Boys, older age, living in Hainan Province, excess adiposity and higher level of serum total calcium were found to be associated with EBP. Lean subjects had an average 3.87 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) than normal weight groups. In contrary, overweight/ had increased SBP (3.69 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (2.58 mmHg) than the normal weight group. Participants with high-level serum total calcium had a 1.60 mmHg increased SBP and 1.77 mmHg increased DBP than the low-level group. Compared with normal weight individuals, lean subjects appeared to have decreased odds of EBP (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.98) but overweight/obese individuals were more likely to have EBP (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.68-4.25). High-level of serum total calcium was associated with increased odds of EBP, the OR (95% CI) was 1.51 (1.17-1.94). The restrict cubic spline presented a linear relationship between serum total calcium and OR of EBP ( < 0.001).  Body composition and serum total calcium were positively associated with blood pressure in children and adolescents. Serum calcium could be considered as an untraditional risk factors for high blood pressure screening along with other body composition indexes in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019 He, Pan, Du, Liu, Jin, Ma, Wang, Jia, Hu and Shan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656196>Assisted conception as a potential prognostic factor predicting insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Advanced maternal age, family history of diabetes, pre-gestational , increased level of HbA1c, history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and poor pregnancy consequences are considered risk factors for antenatal insulin requirement in women with GDM. However, the role of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in increasing the risk of insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM remained elusive. The current study aimed to determine the role of ART in predicting insulin therapy in GDM women and investigate the clinical and biochemical factors predicting the need for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.In this prospective cohort study, 236 Iranian women with GDM were diagnosed by one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between October 2014 and June 2017. They were mainly assigned to two groups; the first group (n = 100) was designated as ART which was further subdivided into two subgroups as follows: 60 participants who received medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and 40 participants who received MNT plus insulin therapy (MNT-IT). The second group (n = 136) was labeled as the spontaneous conception (SC), consisting of 102 participants receiving MNT and 34 participants receiving MNT in combination with IT (MNT-IT). The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate prognostic factors for insulin therapy.A higher rate of insulin therapy was observed in the ART group as compared with the SC group (40% vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that maternal age ≥ 35 years [OR: 2.91, 95% CI: (1.28-6.62)], high serum FBS [1.10: (1.04-1.16)], HbA1c [1.91 (1.09-3.34)], and ART treatment [2.94: (1.24-6.96)] were independent risk factors for insulin therapy in GDM women.Apart from risk factors mentioned earlier, ART may be a possible prognostic factor for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653997>A call to action: advocating for the integration of oral health promotion and public health via sugar sweetened beverage taxation.</a></h2><p>We call on dental health professionals to advocate for the integration of oral health promotion into public health, and argue that a campaign for revenue from SSB taxation to be used for oral health promotion is a good place to start. The impact of sugar on health centres on , diabetes and dental caries; these also have a disproportionate impact upon low income communities. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) are recognised as a universal major source of sugar, and it has been recommended that the amount and frequency of intake of SSBs should be limited. SSB taxes are a possible way of reducing sugar intake, as well as an effective method of integrating oral health (OH) into general health promotion. There is widespread support for these taxes from PH professionals as they have the potential to improve diet and nutrition, and by OH professionals since nutrition is an integral component of OH, and sugar reduction can reduce the incidence of caries. SSB taxes can also generate revenues which can be reinvested in healthcare to further health improvement. Despite the self-evident benefits for integration, few countries have made a concentrated effort to integrate.

Semaphorins are involved in axonal guidance; however, the role of secretory semaphorin 3G (SEMA3G) in regulating adipocyte differentiation remains unclear. Microarray analysis showed that the SEMA3G gene was upregulated in an in vitro model of adipogenesis. In this study, SEMA3G was highly expressed in the white adipose tissue and liver. Analysis of 3T3-L1 cell and primary mouse preadipocyte differentiation showed that SEMA3G mRNA and protein levels were increased during the middle stage of cell development. In vitro experiments also showed that adipocyte differentiation was promoted by SEMA3G; however, SEMA3G inhibition using a recombinant lentiviral vector expressing a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed the opposite results. Mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet (HFD); knockdown of SEMA3G was found to inhibit weight gain, reduce fat mass in the tissues, prevent lipogenesis in the liver tissue, reduce insulin resistance and ameliorate glucose tolerance in HFD mice. Additionally, the effect of SEMA3G on HFD-induced  was activated through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling in the adipose tissue and the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway in the liver. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of SEMA3G and leptin were measured in 20 obese and 20 non-obese human subjects. Both proteins were increased in obese subjects, who also exhibited a lower level of adiponectin and presented with insulin resistance. In summary, we demonstrated that SEMA3G is an adipokine essential for adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and insulin resistance and is associated with .

New solutions, including digital technologies and community-based approaches are needed. Digital platforms, like social media, provide opportunity for participant co-creation (i.e., content co-generated by users and investigators) of health messages and may allow for adaptation of evidence-based weight management interventions to reduce participant burden. The BeFAB intervention, a branded, digital weight management program, tests this hypothesis.BeFAB content comprises culturally-specific nutrition, physical activity, stress management, health information seeking and related weight management messages and content designed for African American women. The intervention is 12 weeks in duration, delivered through a mobile phone app, and is designed to target specific behavioral predictor beliefs and attitudinal measures (e.g., self-efficacy to achieve weight management goals) based on the culturally-specific content. Use of personal, culturally-specific video-based narratives in the app, and through a secret Facebook group, are included to help model HEAL behaviors and brand BeFAB. Intervention development consisted of iterative formative research steps to engage African American women. The program will be evaluated in a small randomized trial among patients recruited at a clinical facility.BeFAB applies evidence-based content using a promising digital approach. It is novel in its use of branding, culturally-tailored content, and digital technology for behavior change.Evaluation of BeFAB will contribute to the growing literature on digital health behavior change interventions for weight management.© 2019 The Authors.

Hence, we aimed to map the course of human health by identifying the 50 most common health conditions in each decade of life and estimating the median age at first diagnosis.We developed phenotyping algorithms and codelists for physical and mental health conditions that involve intensive use of health-care resources. Individuals older than 1 year were included in the study if their primary-care and hospital-admission records met research standards set by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and they had been registered in a general practice in England contributing up-to-standard data for at least 1 year during the study period. We used linked records of individuals from the CALIBER platform to calculate the sex-standardised cumulative incidence for these conditions by 10-year age groups between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2015. We also derived the median age at diagnosis and prevalence estimates stratified by age, sex, and ethnicity (black, white, south Asian) over the study period from the primary-care and secondary-care records of patients.We developed case definitions for 308 disease phenotypes. We used records of 2 784 138 patients for the calculation of cumulative incidence and of 3 872 451 patients for the calculation of period prevalence and median age at diagnosis of these conditions. Conditions that first gained prominence at key stages of life were: atopic conditions and infections that led to hospital admission in children (<10 years); acne and menstrual disorders in the teenage years (10-19 years); mental health conditions, , and migraine in individuals aged 20-29 years; soft-tissue disorders and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in individuals aged 30-39 years; dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction in individuals aged 40-59 years; cancer, osteoarthritis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cataract, diverticular disease, type 2 diabetes, and deafness in individuals aged 60-79 years; and atrial fibrillation, dementia, acute and chronic kidney disease, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, anaemia, and osteoporosis in individuals aged 80 years or older. Black or south-Asian individuals were diagnosed earlier than white individuals for 258 (84%) of the 308 conditions. Bone fractures and atopic conditions were recorded earlier in male individuals, whereas female individuals were diagnosed at younger ages with nutritional anaemias, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urinary disorders.We have produced the first chronological map of human health with cumulative-incidence and period-prevalence estimates for multiple morbidities in parallel from birth to advanced age. This can guide clinicians, policy makers, and researchers on how to formulate differential diagnoses, allocate resources, and target research priorities on the basis of the knowledge of who gets which diseases when.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by  and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h2><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis. Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy.

Serum leptin and ApN levels were determined by radioimmunoassay.Our results showed that serum ApN levels were significantly associated with  measures in both men and women, and the greater effect was observed in men. In contrast, the relationship between ApN and BMD was sex-dependent. Levels of ApN were negatively associated with BMD in women, but not in men. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for potential confounding factors, such as leptin and body mass index. Moreover, serum ApN was found to be a major determinant of BMD in women on the multivariate regression analysis.Our results suggest that ApN, an adipocyte-derived hormone, may affect bone metabolism, which may be mediated by sex hormones.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since,  leads to deterioration of liver function and associated liver diseases, in this study the effect of APPH on high fat diet (HFD) associated liver damages was investigated.Six week old male hamsters were randomly separated to six groups (n = 8) as control, HFD (HFD fed obese), L-APPH (HFD + 15 mg/kg/day of APPH), M-APPH (HFD + 30 mg/kg/day), H-APPH (HFD + 75 mg/kg/day of APPH) and PB (HFD + 500 mg/kg/day of probucol). HFD fed hamsters were administered with APPH 50 days through oral gavage. The animals were euthanized and the number of apoptotic nuclei in liver tissue was determined by TUNEL staining and the extent of interstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining. Modulation in the molecular events associated with apoptosis and fibrosis were elucidated from the western blotting analysis of the total protein extracts.Hamsters fed with high fat diet showed symptoms of liver damage as measured from serum markers like alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. However a 50 day long supplementation of APPH effectively ameliorated the effects of HFD. HFD also modulated the expression of survival and apoptosis proteins in the hamster liver. Further the HFD groups showed elevated levels of fibrosis markers in liver. The increase in fibrosis and apoptosis was correlated with the increase in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK1/2) revealing a potential role of ERK in the HFD mediated liver damage. However APPH treatment reduced the effect of HFD on the apoptosis and fibrosis markers considerably and provided hepato-protection.APPH can therefore be considered as an efficient therapeutic agent to ameliorate high fat diet related liver damages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652917>Metabolic Cytokines at Fasting and During Macronutrient Challenges: Influence of , Female Androgen Excess and Sex.</a></h2><p>Cytokines have pleiotropic functions within the organism and their levels may be influenced by , visceral adiposity and sex hormones.

Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and  on the circulating levels of a panel of metabolic cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-2, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most metabolic cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by .

The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by  and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657648>Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors Reduce Adipogenesis of Orbital Fibroblasts and Enhance Myofibroblastic Differentiation in Graves' Orbitopathy.</a></h2><p>: Orbital fibroblasts are involved in pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) affects fibroblasts of GO. This study aims to investigate the roles of FGF and FGF receptor (FGFR) in GO. : Serum FGF proteins and orbital fibroblast FGFR proteins and mRNAs were measured in GO patients and controls. Orbital fibroblasts of GO were cultured and accessed for changes in proliferation (by nuclei number and MTT), myofibroblastic differentiation (by α-SMA), and adipogenesis (by oil droplets using Oil Red O stain) under FGF1 with or without FGFR inhibitors (FGFRi). : Serum FGF1 and FGF2 were increased in GO patients. FGFR1 was the most abundantly expressed FGFR in GO orbital fibroblasts. FGF1 increased GO fibroblast proliferation/adipogenesis and suppressed myofibroblastic differentiation, while FGFRi reversed these effects. : FGF signaling may be involved in GO pathogenesis. Manipulation of FGF-FGFR pathway for GO treatment is worthy of further investigation. : .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653610>The Effect of Metabolic Syndrome on the Occurrence of Restenosis After Carotid Endarterectomy.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The effect of MetS on clinical outcome in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains largely unknown because conflicting results have been published. This study aimed to determine the influence of MetS on the occurrence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).All patients who underwent CEA between June 2003 and December 2014 in two tertiary academic referral centres in The Netherlands were included. MetS was defined if three or more of the following criteria were present: hypertension, , high fasting serum blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, or low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ipsilateral restenosis after index surgery. The secondary outcome measure was (all cause) mortality during follow up. For the primary analysis, missing data were multiply imputed using multivariable imputation by chained equations. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform an adjusted analysis on the multiply imputed data sets.A total of 1668 CEA procedures (in 1577 patients) were performed. The presence or absence of MetS could not be determined in 263 patients because of missing data. There was no significant difference in freedom from restenosis in the MetS group vs. the no-MetS group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.23; p = .10) or in all cause mortality (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94-1.54; p = .14).This study shows that MetS does not predict restenosis after CEA. Also, the presence of MetS did not influence patient survival negatively.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The high concentrations of these substances and other isothiazolinones such as benzisothiazolinone (BIT) and octylisothiazolinone (OIT) contained in cleaning products may cause allergic contact dermatitisin sensitized patients.To evaluate the exposure to isothiazolinones contained in cleaning products on the market and from sensitized patients, and verify the accuracy of labelling.A total of 34 cleaning products were collected (17 supplied by sensitized patients and 17 bought randomly). Analysis was made of the concentrations of MI, MCI, BIT and OIT using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).MI and BIT were the components most frequently detected. Of all the products analyzed, 76.5% contained at least one isothiazolinone. Twelve products had a MI concentration above the permitted level for rinse-off cosmetics. Most of them were coming into direct contact with the skin in daily use. Mislabelling occurred in 8 products.Some cleaning products with high concentrations of isothiazolinones may cause cutaneous symptoms in sensitized patients, especially in spray form.

A distinction can be made in an early and late onset type. The disease seems to have a predisposition for certain descends. Since the first publication of Blount's disease, different hypotheses on the aetiology are proposed but no consensus exists. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the available hypotheses on the aetiology of Blount's disease since its first description and assessment of the available level of evidence, the quality of evidence and the occurrence of bias supporting these individual hypotheses. A systematic search according to the PRISMA statement was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library using a broad combination of terminology to ascertain a complete selection. Proper MESH search criteria were formulated and the bibliographic search was limited to English and Dutch language articles. Articles with no mention of aetiology or a disease related to Blount's were excluded. Level of evidence and types of bias were assessed. Thirty-two articles that discuss the aetiology of Blount's disease were selected. A variety of hypotheses was postulated in these articles with most research in the field of increased mechanical pressure (, early walking age) and race (descend). Blount's disease most likely has a multifactorial origin with influence of genetic and racial predisposition, increased mechanical pressure on the growth plate as a consequence of  or early walking age and possibly also nutrition. However, the exact aetiology remains unclear, the probable explanation is that multifactorial factors are all contributing to the development of Blount's disease. Histological research has shown that a disorganization of bone and cartilage structures on the medial side of the proximal tibial physis is present in patients with Blount's disease. Based on the available evidence on the aetiology of Blount's disease, we conclude that it is multifactorial. Most papers focus only on one hypotheses of Blount's disease occurrence and all are characterized as low level of evidence. There seems to be a preference for certain descends. Further research on especially genetic predisposition is needed to provide more insight in this factor of Blount's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653188> and age as factors in leg amputations in fatal motorcycle crashes.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650640>Chronic ill health in a regional Victoria setting: A 13-year comparison.</a></h2><p>High-quality data regarding the prevalence of chronic disease in rural areas are essential in understanding the challenges faced by rural populations and for informing strategies to address health care needs. This study compared the prevalence of a range of self-reported chronic conditions and utilisation of GP services and emergency department in a regional Victorian setting between two studies conducted in the same region in 2001-2003 and 2014.Repeat cross-sectional studies conducted over a decade apart.The projects were conducted in the Goulburn Valley in regional Victoria.The earlier study randomly selected households from local government lists. The later study randomly selected householders from the telephone directory.Participants were asked whether they had been diagnosed with a range of chronic health conditions and how often they had visited a general practitioner or emergency department in the past 12 months.The age-standardised prevalence of depression was higher in the 2014 study than the 2001-2003 study in men (increased by 8.0% (95% CI 4.5, 11.5%)) and women (increased by 13.7% (95% CI 8.4, 19.0%)). Similarly, the prevalence of age-standardised diabetes and hypertension was higher in 2014 than 2001-2003 (men increased by 3.6% (95% CI 0.7, 6.5% (diabetes)) and 13.6% (95% CI 8.6, 18.6% (hypertension)), women increased by 3.1% (95% CI 0.3, 6.5% (diabetes)) and 8.4% (95% CI 2.3, 14.5% (hypertension))).The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of self-reported depression, diabetes and hypertension has increased in this regional Victorian area over the past 13 years. The reasons for these observed increases and the subsequent impact on the health care needs of regional communities warrants further investigation.© 2019 National Rural Health Alliance Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656225>Pediatric Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: Evidence, Barriers, and Best Practices.</a></h2><p>Severe  among youth is an "epidemic within an epidemic" and portends a shortened life expectancy for today's children compared with those of their parents' generation.

However, findings of the association between grocery store and childhood  are controversial. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between access to grocery stores and childhood . A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published before January 1, 2019, using the combinations of three groups of keywords separately for grocery store, children and adolescents, and weight-related behaviours and outcomes. A total of 27 cross-sectional and eight longitudinal studies were identified. Controversial results existed among 24 studies, which examined the association between the access to grocery stores and weight-related outcomes. A null association was observed in almost all meta-analyses conducted by different measures of grocery stores and weight status, except the analysis between presence of grocery stores and overweight, which reached borderline significance. For weight-related behaviours, mixed findings were reported between grocery stores and dietary behaviours, and no significant associations were found for physical activity. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that access to grocery stores may have a rather small influence on child weight.© 2019 The Authors.

Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), a preadipocyte secreted protein, plays an inhibitory role in adipogenic differentiation. However, the role of Pref-1 in adipose tissue browning remains unknown. We investigated whether Pref-1 regulates thermogenic program and beige fat biogenesis.Pref-1 expression levels were examined in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes in thermogenic conditions induced by cold exposure or a beta-adrenergic stimulus (CL316,243). Overexpression and knockdown studies were performed both in vivo and in vitro to clarify the role of Pref-1 in iWAT browning.Cold exposure or CL316,243 induced a thermogenic program in adipose tissue of C57BL/6 N mice and in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Notably, Pref-1 levels were down-regulated in iWAT and adipocytes under these conditions. Overexpressing Pref-1 showed reduced thermogenic gene expressions in response to CL316,243 treatment, whereas depletion of Pref-1 augmented thermogenic program in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. Correspondingly, treating C57BL/6 N mice with Pref-1 resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic and beige fat markers, a reduced rate of oxygen consumption, blunting of UCP1 expression and beige fat formation in iWAT in response to cold exposure or CL316,243 injection compared to the untreated mice. The opposite phenotype was observed in mice with inducible fat-specific knock-out of Pref-1. Mechanistically, these effects were regulated by modulation of TNF-α-converting enzyme activity and Pref-1 cleavage.Our findings establish a novel role of Pref-1 that regulates adaptive thermogenesis.

As a consequence, this stressor may cause an imbalance of HPA stress axis leading to increased eating behavior, and ultimately, weight gain. However, the direct link between internalized weight bias and stress response to acute stressors via cortisol secretion has not been investigated so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between internalized weight stigma as a stressor and cortisol reactivity in an acute psychosocial stress situation induced by the Trier Socials Stress Test for groups (TSST-G). Participants with BMI >30 kg/m (n = 79) were included in the study. Results reveal that while individuals with low internalized stigma reacted as predicted with an increase in cortisol secretion to acute psychosocial stress, individuals with medium or high internalized stigma did not show a typical cortisol response. However, these findings depend on the several factors, for instance on gender. In sum, acute stress in individuals with internalized weight bias seems to blunt HPA axis reactions to acute psychosocial stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the psychological and endocrinological consequences of internalized weight bias and underlines the importance of interventions to reduce stigmatization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650091>The Role of Brown Adipose Tissue in Cardiovascular Disease Protection: Current Evidence and Future Directions.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655472>Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are two sides of the same coin paid for .</a></h2><p> is characterized by adipose tissue expansion and chronic low-grade inflammation. Among the inflammatory mediators related to  development are the adipokines. These cytokines are released from fatty tissues and act in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner. Adipocytes influence the comorbidities of  such as osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA). It is still controversial as to whether OP is associated with either a low or high body mass index, but it is quite clear that the latter condition increases the risk for OA development. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs) have the same precursors of osteoblasts, which are the primary cells involved in bone formation, and the amount of BMAs appears to be inversely related to bone mineral density. Although adipokines released by these adipocytes influence bone loss progress, their exact role remains controversial. Differently, the infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) is indicated to protect the function of joint regarding OA. However, there is relatively limited information about the secretion of adipokines and other inflammatory mediators by the IPFP. Despite some inconsistencies, nutritional interventions targeting  may also benefit patients with OP and OA. The association among , OP, and OA is quite complex, and many factors need to be explored that are mainly related to the role of adipokines derived locally rather than from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Also, nutritional intervention may affect fatty tissue mass and secretion of inflammatory mediators that may, at least in part, influence other tissues in the organism such as bone and articular cartilage. The aim of this review was to present the latest knowledge about the interrelationship between  and OA or OP and to discuss whether a dietary intervention for  will hold promise for patients with OA or OP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, the authors explored the association between types of fat and survival in patients treated with immunotherapy.A retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were treated with immunotherapy on phase 1 clinical trials at the Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2009 through 2017 was performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used to measure clinical outcomes. Baseline BMI and radiographic images at the middle of the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained. Fat densities were calculated and converted to indices (subcutaneous fat index [SFI], intermuscular fat index [IFI], and visceral fat index [VFI]) after dividing by height in meters squared. Risk groups were created using recursive partitioning and the regression trees method for SFI and IFI, which were selected by stepwise variable selection among all fat-related variables. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for the association with OS and PFS.The majority of patients (59%) were male and diagnosed with melanoma (33%) or gastrointestinal cancers (22%). The median BMI was 27.4 kg/m , the median SFI was 62.78, the median IFI was 4.06, and the median VFI was 40.53. Low-risk patients (those with an SFI ≥73) had a significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46 [P < .001]) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72 [P = .003]) compared with patients at intermediate risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI <3.4) and poor risk (those with an SFI <73 and IFI ≥3.4). The Uno concordance statistics were found to be higher for fat risk groups than BMI in predicting OS (0.603 vs 0.574; P = .581) and PFS (0.602 vs 0.586; P = .71).Increased BMI, increased SFI, and decreased IFI may be associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer who are treated with immunotherapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of adiposity on the host immune response to immunotherapy.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p></html>
