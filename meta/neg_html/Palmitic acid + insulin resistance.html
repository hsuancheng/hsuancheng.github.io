Here, we studied the alterations in hepatocellular autophagy by high cholesterol and high-fat diet (HC-HF) diet in C57BL/6J mice, and by  (PA), in AML-12 and HepG2 cells. Further, we analysed role of Trigonelline (TG), a plant alkaloid, in preventing NAFLD, by modulating autophagy. For this, C57BL/6J mice were fed with Standard Chow (SC) or HC-HF diet, with and without TG for 16 weeks. In-vitro; AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells, were exposed to PA with and without TG, for 24 h. Cellular events related to autophagy, lipogenesis, and lipo-toxicity were studied. The HC-HF diet fed mice showed hepatic autophagy blockade, increased triglycerides and steatosis. PA exposure to AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells induced impaired autophagy, ER stress, resulting in lipotoxicity. TG treatment in HC-HF fed mice, restored hepatic autophagy, and prevented steatosis. TG treated AML-12, and HepG2 cells exposed to PA showed autophagy restoration, and reduced lipotoxicity, however, these effects were diminished in Atg7-/- HepG2 cells, and in the presence of chloroquine. This study shows that HC-HF diet-induced impaired autophagy, and steatosis is prevented by TG, which attributes to its novel mechanism in treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Among these compounds, a 12-aa Bim-BH3 core sequence peptide conjugated to  (SM-6) displayed good PTP1B binding affinity (K = 8.38 nmol/L), inhibitory activity (IC = 1.20 μmol/L) and selectivity against other PTPs (TCPTP, LAR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Furthermore, SM-6 promoted HepG2 cell glucose uptake and inhibited the expression of PTP1B, indicating that SM-6 could improve the  effect in the -resistant HepG2 cell model. These results may indicate a new direction for the application of BH3 peptide mimetics and promising PTP1B peptide inhibitors could be designed and developed based on SM-6.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and  tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated . Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069585>Absence of Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein in Adipocytes Causes Systemic  and Impairs Glucose Transport.</a></h2><p>Lower adipose-ChREBP and de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are associated with  in humans. Here, we generated adipose-specific ChREBP knockout (AdChREBP KO) mice with negligible sucrose-induced DNL in adipose tissue (AT). Chow-fed AdChREBP KO mice are  resistant with impaired  action in the liver, muscle, and AT and increased AT inflammation. HFD-fed AdChREBP KO mice are also more  resistant than controls. Surprisingly, adipocytes lacking ChREBP display a cell-autonomous reduction in -stimulated glucose transport that is mediated by impaired Glut4 translocation and exocytosis, not lower Glut4 levels. AdChREBP KO mice have lower levels of  esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) in serum, and AT. 9-PAHSA supplementation completely rescues their  and AT inflammation. 9-PAHSA also normalizes impaired glucose transport and Glut4 exocytosis in ChREBP KO adipocytes. Thus, loss of adipose-ChREBP is sufficient to cause , potentially by regulating AT glucose transport and flux through specific lipogenic pathways.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Elevated saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) in obesity can cause insulin resistance (IR) in peripheral tissues. The high intra-follicular saturated FFAs may also account for IR in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). In the present study, we investigated the relationship between saturated FFAs and IR in GCs by the use of  (PA). We demonstrated that the glucose uptake in cultured GCs and lactate accumulation in the culture medium were stimulated by insulin, but the effects of insulin were attenuated by PA treatment. Besides, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was reduced by PA in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA increased phosphorylation of JNK and JNK blockage rescued the phosphorylation of Akt which was down-regulated by PA. These findings highlighted the negative effect of PA on GCs metabolism and may partially account for the obesity-related reproductive disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574508>Scopoletin intervention in pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a dynamic organelle, plays an essential role in organizing the signaling pathways involved in cellular adaptation, resilience, and survival. Impairment in the functions of ER occurs in a variety of nutritive disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Here, we hypothesize that (scopoletin) SPL, a coumarin, has the potential to alleviate ER stress induced in vitro and in vivo models by lipotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, the ability of SPL to restore the levels of proteins of ER stress was analyzed. Rat insulinoma 5f (RIN5f) cells and Sprague Dawley rats were the models used for this study. Groups of control and high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were treated with either SPL or 4-phenylbutyric . Status of ER stress was enumerated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies. Proximal proteins of ER stress inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were reduced in the β-cells by SPL. The subsequent signaling proteins X-box binding protein 1, eukaryotic initiation factor2α, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP homologous protein were also suppressed in their expression levels when treated with SPL. IRE1, PERK signaling leads to c-Jun-N-terminal kinases phosphorylation, a kinase that interrupts  signaling, which was also reverted upon scopoletin treatment. Finally, we confirm that SPL has the ability to suppress the stress proteins and limit pancreatic ER stress which might help in delaying the progression of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070572>Glucagon-like peptide-1 analog prevents obesity-related glomerulopathy by inhibiting excessive autophagy in podocytes.</a></h2><p>To investigate the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1) in high-fat diet-induced obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG).

Fasting blood glucose and  and the expression of podocin, nephrin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), glucose transporter type (Glut4), and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) were assayed. Glomerular morphology and podocyte foot structure were evaluated by periodic -Schiff staining and electron microscopy. Podocytes were treated with 150 nM GLP-1 and incubated with 400 μM  (PA) for 12 h. The effect on autophagy was assessed by podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA.  and autophagy were assayed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The high-fat diet resulted in weight gain, ectopic glomerular lipid accumulation, increased , and fusion of podophyte foot processes. The decreased translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane and excess autophagy seen in mice fed a high-fat diet and in PA-treated cultured podocytes were attenuated by GLP-1. Podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA promoted autophagy, and rapamycin-enhanced autophagy worsened the podocyte injury caused by PA. Excess autophagy in podocytes was induced by inhibition of Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane and was involved in the pathology of ORG. GLP-1 restored  sensitivity and ameliorated renal injury by decreasing the level of autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038536>Hydrogen Sulphide Treatment Increases  Sensitivity and Improves Oxidant Metabolism through the CaMKKbeta-AMPK Pathway in PA-Induced IR C2C12 Cells.</a></h2><p>Studies have reported attenuation of  (IR) by improving phosphorylation of the  signalling pathway. However, the upstream molecular signalling pathway is still elusive. In this study, Western blot was used to evaluate the phosphorylation level of the  signalling pathway and the AMPK pathway. 2-NBDG was used to evaluate glucose uptake. Ca imaging was used to assess change of intracellular Ca concentration. We found that NaHS enhanced the intracellular Ca concentration and glucose uptake and activated the  signalling cascade in a  (PA)-induced IR model in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, activation of the IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathway and glucose uptake were decreased when AMPK or CaMKKβ was inhibited. Our study also showed that the mitochondrial electron transport chain, ATP production, and intramitochondrial cAMP declined in the IR model but that this effect was reversed by NaHS, an effect that may be mediated by the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Our data indicate that HS improves activation of the  signalling cascade and glucose uptake via activation of the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK pathway and mitochondrial metabolism in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, NaHS protects mitochondrial function and maintains normal ATP production by activating the cAMP system and the Ca/CaMKK2/AMPK and PI3K/ATK pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006154>GCN2 deficiency protects against high fat diet induced hepatic steatosis and  in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic lipid deposition and oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is required to maintain hepatic fatty  homeostasis under conditions of amino  deprivation. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of NAFLD has not been investigated. In this study, we used Gcn2 mice to investigate the effect of GCN2 on high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. After HFD feeding for 12 weeks, Gcn2 mice were less obese than wild-type (WT) mice, and Gcn2 significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver dysfunction, hepatic steatosis and . In the livers of the HFD-fed mice, GCN2 deficiency resulted in higher levels of lipolysis genes, lower expression of genes related to FA synthesis, transport and lipogenesis, and less induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, -induced steatosis, oxidative & ER stress, and changes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS) and metallothionein (MT) expression in HepG2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidences that GCN2 deficiency protects against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and reducing oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit GCN2 activity in the liver may provide a novel approach to attenuate NAFLD development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, it is indispensable for cellular activity. Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various fatty acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter. This system could sensitively monitor ER stress levels that could not be detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. This system revealed that hyperglycemia does not induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in a short period of time in MIN6 cells, a mouse pancreatic β cell line. Physiological concentrations of , a saturated fatty , induced ER stress quickly, while physiological concentrations of oleic , an unsaturated fatty , did not. Docosahexaenoic , an n-3 unsaturated fatty , inhibited -induced ER stress. In this study, we have established a system that can sensitively detect ER stress levels of living cells in a short period of time. This system can be used to monitor the state of the ER in living cells and lead to the investigation of the significance of physiological or pathological ER stress levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012550>[Ozone oxidizes oleic fatty  with the highest rate constant and does not oxidize .

However, they largely stimulate adaptive functions of the organism, including the biological function of locomotion, cognitive function and the function of positioning in the environment. Biological, energy and kinetic perfection formed in vivo can be easily destroyed if phylogenetically herbivorous Homo sapiens abuses the diet of carnivorous animals (meat) which was not consumed by him and his ancestors during phylogenesis.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of directly elucidating T-cell activation under the obesity-induced metabolic stress condition, as T cells primed under such conditions were found to acquire a unique phenotype and function. Herein, we found a significant upregulation of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3) expression on T cells from T2D patients compared to those of healthy controls. Importantly, SLAMF3 upregulation was associated with an increased ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly increased SLAMF3 expression was seen in T2D patient T cells that produce IFN-γ or IL-17 upon short (4-h) stimulation, compared to non-cytokine-producing T cells. In line with this finding, SLAMF3 T cells were significantly more sensitive than SLAMF3 T cells to TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, treatment with  (PA) led to significant upregulation of SLAMF3 on human T cells primed by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and on Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. RNA sequencing revealed strong activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T cells that were primed with PA. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, or its upstream mediator STAT5 can prevent PA-induced SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells. These results indicate that SLAMF3 upregulation is associated with T-cell activation and cytokine production in T2D patients, and suggest that elevated saturated fatty acids in T2D patients may induce SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells via activation of the STAT5-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631760>Changes of the Fatty  Profile in Erythrocyte Membranes of Patients following 6-Month Dietary Intervention Aimed at the Regression of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to the metabolism disorders of fatty acids. The pathogenesis of the disease includes an increased concentration of FFA in blood, an increase in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, and disorders in the process of -oxidation.The aim of the study was to analyze the fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes among 55 patients with NAFLD who were subjected to a 6-month dietary intervention in order to reduce fatty liver.Basic anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. The profile of fatty acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dietary compliance was evaluated using 72-diary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements.With the reduction of fatty liver (p<0.01), the patients' biochemical and anthropometric parameters were significantly improved. A significant decrease in the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and asparagine aminotransferase (p<0.01) was observed, along with a decrease in the amount of  (p<0.05) and  (p<0.05). Significant changes in terms of the fatty  profile were observed among patients who followed the dietary intervention. There was a noticeable tendency in terms of the reduction  (p<0.055) and a significant reduction of stearic  (p<0.05). Significant changes in the profile of fatty acids were also associated with the reductionof palmitoleic (p<0.05) and oleic acids (p<0.05).

Our previous studies found that mangiferin could decrease serum FFA levels in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet. Our research was to determine the effects and mechanism of mangiferin on improving IR by regulating FFA metabolism in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. The model was used to quantify PA-induced lipid accumulation in the two cell lines treated with various concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased -stimulated glucose uptake, via phosphorylation of protein kinase B (P-AKT), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein expressions, and markedly decreased glucose content, respectively, in HepG2 and C2C12 cells induced by PA. Mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake and decreased intracellular FFA and triglyceride (TG) accumulations. The activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) protein and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the fatty  -oxidation rate corresponding to FFA metabolism were also markedly increased by mangiferin in HepG2 and C2C12 cells.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for weight loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting , inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (oleic , found in olive oil) are less likely to promote , inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and oleic  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

We aimed to investigate the effect of miR-181a in lipid metabolism and find new treatments for NAFLD. The expression level of miR-181a in NAFLD patient serum and a  (PA)-induced NAFLD cell model was examined by Q-PCR. Oil red O staining and triglyceride assays were used to assess lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and the fatty  β-oxidation-related genes. Direct interactions were validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. MiR-181a expression was significantly upregulated in the serum of NAFLD patients and PA-induced hepatocytes. Inhibition of miR-181a expression resulted in the increased expression of PPARα and its downstream genes, and PA-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was also inhibited. Upregulation of miR-181a resulted in the downregulation of its direct target PPARα and downstream gene expression of PPARα as well as aggravated lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. At the same time, the increased expression of PPARα can offset lipid accumulation in hepatocytes induced by miR-181a mimics. This study demonstrates that reducing the expression of miR-181a may improve lipid metabolism in NAFLD.

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and -sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in -resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose- homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and -sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

Part of this capacity results from induction of brown-like adipocytes within classical white depots, making it difficult to determine the oxidative contribution of the more abundant white adipocytes. Avian genomes lack a gene for uncoupling protein 1 and are devoid of brown adipose cells, making them a useful model in which to study white adipocyte metabolism in vivo. We recently reported that a brief (5 hour) period of fasting significantly upregulated many genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation pathways in white adipose tissue of young broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to determine if the effects on gene expression manifested in increased rates of fatty  oxidation. Abdominal adipose tissue was collected from 21 day-old broiler chicks that were fasted for 3, 5 or 7 hours or fed ad libitum (controls). Fatty  oxidation was determined by measuring and summing CO production and C-labeled -soluble metabolites from the oxidation of [1-C] . Fasting induced a progressive increase in complete fatty  oxidation and citrate synthase activity relative to controls.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of . The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on  signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and  signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) mediated inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28656239>Erythropoietin ameliorates PA-induced  through the IRS/AKT/FOXO1 and GSK-3β signaling pathway, and inhibits the inflammatory response in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Erythropoietin (EPO) contributes to  in fat and muscle.

Hepatic  was induced by  (PA) in the HepG2 cells, which were then treated with EPO (5 or 10 U/ml) or specific phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002. EPO treatment significantly increased glycogen levels and reduced the protein expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in the PA‑induced HepG2 cells. EPO also inhibited the serine phosphorylation of  receptor substrate (IRS)‑1 (Ser307) and IRS‑2 (Ser473), and increased the protein expression levels of PI3K, phosphorylated (p)‑protein kinase B (AKT), p‑forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and p‑glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK‑3) β. In agreement with these result, the expression of p‑FOXO1 (Ser256) and p‑GSK‑3β (Ser9), downstream molecules of AKT, were enhanced by EPO treatment (P<0.05). The specific PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, markedly inhibited the EPO‑mediated increases in p‑AKT (Ser473), p‑FOXO1 (Ser256) and p‑GSK‑3β (Ser9) in the PA‑induced HepG2 cells (P<0.05). The gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin‑1β and monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1, and the p‑c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK)/total‑JNK ratio were markedly suppressed by EPO treatment. These findings suggested that EPO treatment improved hepatic glucose metabolism, potentially through the IRS/AKT/FOXO1 and GSK‑3β signaling pathway, which may be associated with its inhibitory effect on the inflammation-associated response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277329>Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model to study cardiac .</a></h2><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and/or  (IR) have an increased risk for the development of heart failure (HF). Evidence indicates that this increased risk is linked to an altered cardiac substrate preference of the  resistant heart, which shifts from a balanced utilization of glucose and long-chain fatty acids (FAs) towards an almost complete reliance on FAs as main fuel source. This shift leads to a loss of endosomal proton pump activity and increased cardiac fat accumulation, which eventually triggers cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of currently used in vitro models to study the underlying mechanism of IR-induced HF and provide insight into a human in vitro model: human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs). Using functional metabolic assays we demonstrate that, similar to rodent studies, hESC-CMs subjected to 16h of high palmitate (HP) treatment develop the main features of IR, i.e., decreased -stimulated glucose and FA uptake, as well as loss of endosomal acidification and  signaling. Taken together, these data propose that HP-treated hESC-CMs are a promising in vitro model of lipid overload-induced IR for further research into the underlying mechanism of cardiac IR and for identifying new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies.

It has also been reported to improve  sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of  secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and  secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved  secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662.

Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the  secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673191>[Biological role of : transformation of carnivores leaving in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land.

However, the role and molecular mechanism of IGFBP-7 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely unknown. Therefore, the potential function of IGFBP7 in the pathological progression of NAFLD was explored in this investigation. For in vivo experiments, an animal model of NAFLD was established in C57BL/6 mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD), and IGFBP7 was knocked down by injecting adeno-associated adenovirus (AAV)-mediated short-hairpin (sh)-IGFBP7 into the liver. We found that AAV-sh-IGFBP7 treatment significantly alleviated hepatocyte injury and inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation by reducing lipogenesis-associated gene expression. Furthermore, downregulation of IGFBP7 markedly ameliorated IR and restored impaired  signalling by elevating the phosphorylation levels of IRS-1, Akt and GSK3β in HFD-treated mice. Similar results were also confirmed by an in vitro study in a  (PA)-stimulated HepG2 cell model.

Here, we used cultured rat cortical neurons and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells to demonstrate that PA blocks -induced metabolic activation, inhibits the activation of the /PI3K/Akt pathway and activates mTOR kinase downstream of Akt. Despite the fact that fatty acids are not normally used as a significant source of fuel by neural cells, we also found that short-term neuronal exposure to PA reduces the NAD/NADH ratio, indicating that PA modifies the neuronal energy balance.

Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant  secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21.  and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

Nutrient excess, through overconsumption of a Western or high-fat diet, exposes the hypothalamus to high levels of free fatty acids, which induces neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulation of neuropeptide synthesis. Furthermore, exposure to a high-fat diet also disrupts normal circadian rhythms, and conversely, clock gene knockout models have symptoms of metabolic disorders.

Because of its complexity and heterogeneous nature, containing a diverse mix cell types, it is difficult to dissect the critical hypothalamic components involved in these processes. Of significance, we have the capacity to study these individual components using an extensive collection of both embryonic- and adult-derived, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell lines from rodents. These defined neuronal cell lines have been used to examine the impact of nutrient excess, such as palmitate, on circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine signaling pathways, as well as changes in vital neuropeptides, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation; the role of proinflammatory molecules in this process; and ultimately, restoration of normal signaling, clock gene expression, and neuropeptide synthesis in disrupted states by beneficial anti-inflammatory compounds in defined hypothalamic neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29395144>Hot topic: Ceramide inhibits  sensitivity in primary bovine adipocytes.</a></h2><p>In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide inhibits  sensitivity by inactivating protein kinase B (AKT) within the -signaling pathway.

Lipid availability was calculated as the increase in circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) at the end of exercise vs. the minimum NEFA (ΔNEFA). ΔRQ as a function of ΔNEFA was used to determine MetFlex-lip. On average, RQ and circulating NEFA changed similarly in both groups. However, ΔRQ correlated with ΔNEFA in High_IS ( r = -0.83, P < 0.01) but not in Low_IS ( r = -0.25, P = 0.48) subjects. Thus the slope of the ΔRQ vs. ΔNEFA relationship was steeper in High_IS vs. Low_IS subjects (-0.139 ± 0.03 vs. -0.025 ± 0.03 RQ·mmol·l, respectively; P < 0.05), with similar intercepts. We conclude that in subjects with High_IS lipid-to-carbohydrate oxidation ratio adapts to the increased circulating NEFA availability during exercise. Such MetFlex-lip appears impaired in subjects with Low_IS. Whether a cause-effect relationship exists between impaired MetFlex-lip and low  sensitivity remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942246>Inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b induces hepatic steatosis through DPP4/NOX1-mediated regulation of superoxide.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder that is closely associated with  and type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have suggested that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1b) ameliorates . However, the role of HNF1b in the regulation of lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis remains poorly understood. We found that HNF1b expression was decreased in steatotic livers. We injected mice with lentivirus (LV) expressing HNF1b shRNA to generate mice with hepatic knockdown of HNF1b. We also injected high fat (HF) diet-induced obese and db/db diabetic mice with LV expressing HNF1b to overexpress HNF1b. Knockdown of HNF1b increased hepatic lipid contents and induced  in mice and in hepatocytes. Knockdown of HNF1b worsened HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid contents, liver injury and  in mice and PA-induced lipid accumulation and impaired  signaling in hepatocytes. Moreover, overexpression of HNF1b alleviated HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and  in mice. Knockdown of HNF1b increased expression of genes associated with lipogenensis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. DPP4 and NOX1 expression was increased by knockdown of HNF1b and HNF1b directly bound with the promoters of DPP4 and NOX1. Overexpression of DPP4 or NOX1 was associated with an increase in lipid droplets in hepatocytes and decreased expression of DPP4 or NOX1 suppressed the effects of knockdown of HNF1b knockdown on triglyceride (TG) formation and  signaling. Knockdown of HNF1b increased superoxide level and decreased glutathione content, which was inhibited by downregulation of DPP4 and NOX1. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed HNF1b knockdown-induced ER stress, TG formation and .  (PA) decreased HNF1b expression which was inhibited by NAC. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HNF1b plays an essential role in controlling hepatic TG homeostasis and  sensitivity by regulating DPP4/NOX1mediated generation of superoxide.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanism in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. To explore the potential link between GPR120 and β-cell function, its agonists docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and GSK137647A were used in  (PA)-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, coupled with GPR120 knockdown (KD) in MIN6 cells and GPR120 knockout (KO) mice to identify the underlying signaling pathways.  and  treatments of MIN6 cells and islets isolated from wild-type (WT) mice with DHA and GSK137647A restored pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) expression levels and β-cell function via inhibiting PA-induced elevation of proinflammatory chemokines and activation of nuclear factor κB, c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinases1/2 and p38MAPK signaling pathways. On the contrary, these GPR120 agonism-mediated protective effects were abolished in GPR120 KD cells and islets isolated from GPR120 KO mice. Furthermore, GPR120 KO mice displayed glucose intolerance and  relative to WT littermates, and β-cell functional related genes were decreased while inflammation was exacerbated in islets with increased macrophages in pancreas from GPR120 KO mice. DHA and GSK137647A supplementation ameliorated glucose tolerance and  sensitivity, as well as improved  expression and islet inflammation in diet-induced obese WT mice, but not in GPR120 KO mice. These findings indicate that GPR120 activation is protective against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, via the mediation of PDX1 expression and inhibition of islet inflammation, and that GPR120 activation may serve as a preventative and therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes.© 2019 The Author(s).

It has been confirmed that statured  (PA) (the most abundant FFA) could bind MD2 to cause cellular inflammation. The natural compound celastrol could improve obesity, which is suggested via inhibiting inflammation, yet the detailed mechanism for celastrol is still unclear.

In this study, we found evidence to support our hypothesis: celastrol could reverse PA-caused TLR4/MD2 activation-dependent , as determined by glucose-lowering ability, cellular glucose uptake,  action-related proteins and TLR4/MD2/NF-κB activation. Bioinformatics and cellular experiments showed that both celastrol and PA could bind MD2, and that celastrol could expel PA from cells.

The putative actions of reduced  sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe  antagonism and body fat mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived fatty acids may impair  sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum fatty liver disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated fat-induced  that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of -stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit  action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that  feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and fatty  metabolism,  function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary metabolic pathways of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of  (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary metabolic pathways are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA.

The association of a combination of fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been evaluated.We measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids by gas chromatography in 27,296 adults, including 12,132 incident cases of T2D, over the follow-up period between baseline (1991-1998) and 31 December 2007 in 8 European countries in EPIC-InterAct, a nested case-cohort study. The first principal component derived by principal component analysis of 27 individual fatty acids (mole percentage) was the main exposure (subsequently called the fatty  pattern score [FA-pattern score]). The FA-pattern score was partly characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , stearic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very-long-chain saturated fatty acids and low concentrations of γ-linolenic , , and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, and it explained 16.1% of the overall variability of the 27 fatty acids. Based on country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analysis, the FA-pattern score was associated with lower incident T2D. Comparing the top to the bottom fifth of the score, the hazard ratio of incident T2D was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19-0.29) adjusted for potential confounders and 0.37 (95% CI 0.27-0.50) further adjusted for metabolic risk factors. The association changed little after adjustment for individual fatty acids or fatty  subclasses. In cross-sectional analyses relating the FA-pattern score to metabolic, genetic, and dietary factors, the FA-pattern score was inversely associated with adiposity, triglycerides, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, a genetic score representing , and dietary intakes of soft drinks and alcohol and was positively associated with high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and intakes of polyunsaturated fat, dietary fibre, and coffee (p < 0.05 each). Limitations include potential measurement error in the fatty acids and other model covariates and possible residual confounding.A combination of individual fatty acids, characterised by high concentrations of linoleic , odd-chain fatty acids, and very long-chain fatty acids, was associated with lower incidence of T2D.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered  signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria.

Global deletion of CAV1 in mice results in  and increases in atherogenic plasma lipids and cholesterol, but protects from diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis. Despite the fundamental role of the intestinal epithelia in the regulation of dietary lipid processing and metabolism, the contributions of CAV1 to lipid metabolism in this tissue have never been directly investigated. In this study the cellular dynamics of intestinal Cav1 were visualized in zebrafish and the metabolic contributions of CAV1 were determined with mice lacking CAV1 in intestinal epithelial cells (CAV1). Live imaging of Cav1-GFP and fluorescently labeled caveolae cargos shows localization to the basolateral and lateral enterocyte plasma membrane (PM), suggesting Cav1 mediates transport between enterocytes and the submucosa. CAV1 mice are protected from the elevation in circulating fasted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol associated with a high-fat diet (HFD), but have increased postprandial LDL cholesterol, total free fatty acids (FFAs), palmitoleic , and . The increase in circulating FAs in HFD CAV1 mice is mirrored by decreased hepatic FAs, suggesting a non-cell-autonomous role for intestinal epithelial cell CAV1 in promoting hepatic FA storage. In conclusion, CAV1 regulates circulating LDL cholesterol and several FA species via the basolateral PM of enterocytes. These results point to intestinal epithelial cell CAV1 as a potential therapeutic target to lower circulating FFAs and LDL cholesterol, as high levels are associated with development of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.© 2017.

This study was designed to examine the impact of ET-1 receptor A (ET) ablation on obesity-induced changes in cardiac geometry and contractile function, as well as the mechanisms involved with a focus on autophagy. Cardiomyocyte-specific ET receptor knockout (ETAKO) and WT mice were fed either low-fat (10% calorie from fat) or high-fat (45% calorie from fat) diet for 24 weeks. Glucose tolerance test was examined to confirm . High-fat diet intake compromised myocardial geometry (enlarged left ventricular diameters in systole and diastole), morphology (cardiac hypertrophy, increased wall thickness and interstitial fibrosis), contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, ejection fraction and cardiomyocyte shortening) and intracellular Ca handling, the effect of which was significantly attenuated by ETAKO. TUNEL staining revealed overt apoptosis in high-fat-fed group, the effect was reverted by ETAKO. Western blot analysis noted that high-fat intake downregulated leptin receptor and PPARγ,  signaling (elevated basal/dampened -stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and IRS1), phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, upregulated GATA-4, ANP, NFATc3, PPARα, m-TOR/p70s6k signaling, which were attenuated by ETAKO with the exception of AMPK/ACC. Furthermore, high-fat intake suppressed cardiac autophagy, which was abrogated by ETAKO. In cultured murine cardiomyocytes,  challenged mimicked high-fat diet-induced hypertrophic and autophagic responses, the effect of which were abolished by the ET receptor antagonist BQ123 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Inflammatory factor release was detected by ELISA, gene expression was tested by quantitative real-time PCR, and  signaling activation was determined by western blotting analysis. The changes of inflammatory factors and  signaling protein were also tested in T2D rats injected with UC-MSCs.Treating HepG2 cells with PA-LPS caused NLRP3 inflammation activation, including overexpression of NLRP3 and caspase-1, and overproduction of IL-1β and IL-18 as well as TNF-α from HepG2 cells. The elevated levels of these inflammatory cytokines impaired  receptor action and thereby prevented downstream signaling pathways, exacerbating  in HepG2 cells. Importantly, UC-MSCs cocultured with HepG2 could effectively alleviate PA and LPS-induced  by blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory agents. Furthermore, knockdown of NLRP3 or IL-1β partially improved PA and LPS-induced  signaling impairments in the presence of UC-MSCs. Similarly, UC-MSC infusion significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia in T2D rats and decreased inflammatory activity, which resulted in improved  sensitivity in  target tissues.Our results indicated that UC-MSCs could attenuate  and this regulation was correlated with their anti-inflammatory activity.

These dietary fats seem to exert beneficial nutritional properties through N-acylethanolamine tissue modulation. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of cow milk (CM), DM, and HM on inflammation and glucose and lipid metabolism, focusing on mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics in skeletal muscle, which is the major determinant of resting metabolic rate. Moreover, we also evaluated the levels of endocannabinoids and N-acylethanolamines in liver and skeletal muscle, since tissue fatty  profiles can be modulated by nutrient intervention.  To this aim, rats were fed with CM, DM, or HM for 4 weeks. Then, glucose tolerance and  were analyzed. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in serum and skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle was also processed to estimate mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics, oxidative stress, and antioxidant/detoxifying enzyme activities. Fatty  profiles, endocannabinoids, and N-acylethanolamine congeners were determined in liver and skeletal muscle tissue.  We demonstrated that DM or HM administration reducing inflammation status, improves glucose disposal and  and reduces lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle. Moreover, HM or DM administration increases redox status, and mitochondrial uncoupling, affecting mitochondrial dynamics in the skeletal muscle. Interestingly, HM and DM supplementation increase liver and muscle levels of the N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA), a key regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation.  HM and DM have a healthy nutritional effect, acting on inflammatory factors and glucose and lipid metabolism. This beneficial effect is associated to a modulation of mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics and to an increase of OEA levels in skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261289>Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the development of non-alcoholic steatosis and steatohepatitis in mice and humans.</a></h2><p> (IR) and obesity are important risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or fat mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis. GRK2 protein and mRNA levels were increased in human liver biopsies from simple steatosis or NASH patients in two different human cohorts. Our results describe a functional relationship between GRK2 levels and hepatic lipid accumulation and implicate GRK2 in the establishment and/or development of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that anthocyanins, natural phenols commonly present in food and vegetables from Mediterranean Diet, exert significant cardiovascular health-promoting activities. These effects are possibly mediated by a positive regulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 and activation of cellular antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. The present study examined, at a molecular level, the effects of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a widely distributed anthocyanin, on PA-induced endothelial dysfunction and  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results indicate that C3G pretreatment effectively reverses the effects of PA on PI3K/Akt axis, and restores eNOS expression and NO release, altered by PA. We observed that these effects were exerted by changes on the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on specific serine and tyrosine residues modulated by PA through the modulation of JNK and IKK activity. Furthermore, silencing Nrf2 transcripts demonstrated that the protective effects of C3G are directly related to the activation of Nrf2.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism by which long-chain saturated fatty acids trigger inflammation is still contentious. To elucidate this mechanism, the effect of fatty acids on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα was investigated in the mHypoE-N42 hypothalamic cell line (N42). N42 cells were treated with lauric  (LA) and  (PA). PA challenge was carried out in the presence of either a TLR4 inhibitor, a ceramide synthesis inhibitor (L-cycloserine), oleic  (OA) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). Intracellular ceramide accumulation was quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. PA but not LA upregulated IL-6 and TNFα. L-cycloserine, OA and EPA all counteracted PA-induced intracellular ceramide accumulation leading to a downregulation of IL-6 and TNFα. However, a TLR4 inhibitor failed to inhibit PA-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, PA induced the expression of IL-6 and TNFα in N42 neuronal cells independently of TLR4 but, partially, via ceramide synthesis with OA and EPA being anti-inflammatory by decreasing PA-induced intracellular ceramide build-up. Thus, ceramide accumulation represents one on the mechanisms by which PA induces inflammation in neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[ is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h2><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo.

Although the effect of azoramide in glucose-homeostasis in mammalians is not known very well, a limited number of experimental studies showed that it could improve the  sensitivity in genetically obese mice. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the direct effect of azoramide on  signaling in -resistant (IR) cardiomyocytes using IR-modelled ventricular cardiomyocytes. This model was established in H9c2 cells using  incubation (50-μM for 24-h). The development of IR in cells was verified by monitoring the cellular 2-DG6P uptake assays in these treated cells. The 2-DG6P uptake was 50% less in the IR-cells compared to the control cells, while azoramide treatment (20-μM for 48-h) could prevent fully that decrease. In addition, azoramide treatment markedly preserved the IR-induced less ATP production and high-ROS production in these IR-cells. Furthermore, this treatment prevented the functional changes in mitochondria characterized by depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial fusion or fusion-related protein levels as well as cellular ATP level. Moreover, this treatment provided marked protection against IR-associated changes in the  signaling pathway in cells, including recovery in the phosphorylation of IRS1 and Akt as well as the protein level of GLUT4 and Akt. Our present results, for the first time, demonstrated that azoramide plays an important protective role in IR-cardiomyocytes, at most, protective action on mitochondria. Therefore, one can suggest that azoramide, as a novel regulator, can provide direct cardioprotection in the IR-heart, at most, via affecting mitochondria and can be a good candidate as a new drug for the treatment of IR-associated cardiovascular disorders in mammalians with systemic IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29794037>Sphingolipid changes do not underlie fatty -evoked GLUT4  nor inflammation signals in muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Ceramides contribute to obesity-linked  and inflammation in vivo, but whether this is a cell-autonomous phenomenon is debated, particularly in muscle, which dictates whole-body glucose uptake.

The results showed that COS pretreatment for 12 h significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to PA for 24 h, accompanied by a reversing of the upregulated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators (SCD-1, ACC1, PCK1-α). In addition, COS treatment alleviated glucolipid metabolism disorder in mice fed with HFD for five months, including reduction in body weight and fasting glucose, restoration of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, and suppression of overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators. Furthermore, our study found that COS pretreatment significantly reversed the downregulation of PPARγ at transcriptional and translational levels in both PA-induced HepG2 cells and liver tissues of HFD-fed mice. In summary, the study suggests that COS can improve glucolipid metabolism disorder by suppressing inflammation and upregulating PPARγ expression.

All cows were randomly assigned to a sorghum silage-based diet containing no supplemental fat (control; n=10; 138±45 d in milk) or C16:0 at 4% of ration dry matter (PALM; 98% C16:0; n=10; 136±44 d in milk). Blood and milk were collected at routine intervals. Liver and skeletal muscle tissue were biopsied at d 47 of treatment. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (300mg/kg of body weight) were performed at d -1, 24, and 49 relative to start of treatment. The plasma and tissue concentrations of ceramide and glycosylated ceramide were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed as repeated measures using a mixed model with fixed effects of treatment and time, and milk yield served as a covariate. The PALM treatment increased milk yield, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat yield. The most abundant plasma and tissue sphingolipids detected were C24:0-ceramide, C24:0-monohexosylceramide (GlcCer), and C16:0-lactosylceramide. Plasma concentrations of total ceramide and GlcCer decreased as lactation advanced, and ceramide and GlcCer were elevated in cows fed PALM.  feeding increased hepatic ceramide levels, a response not observed in skeletal muscle tissue. Plasma ceramides (e.g., C24:0-ceramide) were positively correlated with plasma NEFA and milk yield, and positively correlated with NEFA levels following a glucose challenge. Our data demonstrate a remodeled plasma and hepatic sphingolipidome in mid-lactation dairy cows fed PALM. The potential involvement in ceramide in homeorhetic nutrient partitioning to support lactation requires further consideration.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Researchers have demonstrated the importance of impaired cardiac  signaling in this process.  (IR) is an important predictor of DCM. Previous studies examining the dynamic changes in autophagy during IR have yielded inconsistent results. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes in autophagy and apoptosis in the rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte IR model. H9c2 cells were treated with 500 M  (PA) for 24 hours, resulting in the induction of IR. To examine autophagy, monodansylcadaverine staining, GFP-LC3 puncta confocal observation, and Western blot analysis of LC3I-to-LC3II conversion were used. Results of these studies showed that autophagic  vesicles increased in numbers during the first 24 hours and then decreased by 36 hours after PA treatment. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of H9c2 cells with 500 M PA for 24 hours decreased the expression of Atg12-Atg5, Atg16L1, Atg3, and PI3Kp85. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry revealed that PA exposure for 24 hours increased the rate of apoptosis. Together, this study demonstrates that PA induces IR in H9c2 cells and that this process is accompanied by excessive activation of autophagy and increases in apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371918>Long-term administration of tacrolimus and everolimus prevents high cholesterol-high fructose-induced steatosis in C57BL/6J mice by inhibiting de-novo lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of tacrolimus (TC) and everolimus (EV) on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced by high fat, high cholesterol and fructose (fast food) diet in C57BL/6J mice.C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups (n=8). 1) Standard Chow (SC); 2) Fast food (FF) diet; 3) FF + Tacrolimus (TC, 1mg/kg) and; 4) FF + Everolimus (EV, 1mg/kg) and treated for 16 weeks. Serum and tissue samples were analyzed for evidence of inflammation, fibrosis, lipogenesis, and apoptosis.TC and EV treatments significantly reduced the hepatic lipid accumulation, improved liver-body weight ratio, blood biochemistry, and  in mice fed with FF diet.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased  sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, , and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, we sought to explore active, naturally occurring compounds that promote the recovery of HMW adiponectin secretion suppressed by  in our model. A total of 90 crude drug extracts were screened for the ability to augment HMW adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with . Panaxynol was isolated from Saposhnikovia divaricata as an active compound with HMW adiponectin promoting properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists are reported to increase the secretion of HMW adiponectin, although the effects of panaxynol were found to be independent of PPARγ activation. When the underlying mechanisms were further examined, panaxynol was found to inhibit the -induced downregulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) protein, and the anti-lipotoxic effects were abolished by a FoxO1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) mRNA levels were also increased by panaxynol. Reactive oxygen species have critical roles in the reduction in HMW adiponection secretion by ; however, panaxynol reduced this increase in reactive oxygen species generation, followed by reductions in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation. Taken together, these findings suggest that panaxynol ameliorates the impaired HMW adiponection secretion in adipocytes treated with  by restoring FoxO1 expression, owing to inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, in a PPARγ-independent manner.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide peptide (GLPP) has therapeutic effect on NAFLD.Ob/ ob mouse model and ApoC3 transgenic mouse model were used for exploring the effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Key metabolic pathways and enzymes were identified by metabolomics combining with KEGG and PIUmet analyses and key enzymes were detected by Western blot.

Pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty  metabolism and primary bile  biosynthesis were involved in the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Detection of key enzymes revealed that GLPP reversed low expression of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, FXR, SHP and high expression of FGFR4 in ob/ob mice and ApoC3 mice. Besides, GLPP inhibited fatty  synthesis by reducing the expression of SREBP1c, FAS and ACC via a FXR-SHP dependent mechanism. Additionally, GLPP reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the content of TG in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes induced by oleic  and .GLPP significantly improves NAFLD via regulating bile  synthesis dependent on FXR-SHP/FGF pathway, which finally inhibits fatty  synthesis, indicating that GLPP might be developed as a therapeutic drug for NAFLD.© 2018 The Author(s).

However, the related molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this research, we investigated the protective effects of theaflavins against  in HepG2 cells induced by . Theaflavins significantly increased glucose uptake of -resistant cells at noncytotoxic doses. This activity was mediated by upregulating the total and membrane bound glucose transporter 4 protein expressions, increasing the phosphor-Akt (Ser473) level, and decreasing the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307. Moreover, theaflavins were found to enhance the mitochondrial DNA copy number, down-regulate the PGC-1β mRNA level and increase the PRC mRNA expression. Mdivi-1, a selective mitochondrial division inhibitor, could attenuate TFs-induced promotion of glucose uptake in -resistant HepG2 cells.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and metabolism remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and -sensitizing properties, is synthesized from  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA, oleic  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls.

In blood, under hydrolysis of triglycerides, cells absorb ligand  and oleic very low density lipoproteins by force of апоЕ/В-100 endocytosis; they are not transformed into low density lipoproteins. The  saturated fatty acids in the form of polyether of cholesterol turn into linoleic very low density lipoproteins from high density lipoproteins at impact of protein transferring polyene ethers of cholesterol. They transform very low density lipoproteins into low density lipoproteins of the same name; the cells absorb them by force of апоЕ/В-100 endocytosis. In physiological sense, amount of oleic very low density lipoproteins are always more than  of very low density lipoproteins.

These very lipoproteins initiate hyperlipidemia, increase content of cholesterol of cholesterol-low density lipoproteins, lower cholesterol-high density lipoproteins, decrease bio-availability of polyene fatty acids for cells, trigger development of atherosclerosis and formation of atheromatosis in intima of arteries.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, , stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001).

For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect  and secretion.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood.In order to investigate this process the current study examined ectopic fat accumulation in rats with high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and  tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid metabolism- and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with  (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on  release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased body weight and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and , upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and  secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid metabolism, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes.

This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food.

Rats were given either a corn starch diet or a diet composed of simple carbohydrates together with 20% LA, MA, PA, SA or beef tallow for 16 weeks. Rats fed beef tallow, SA, MA or PA diets developed signs of metabolic syndrome, and also exhibited cartilage degradation and subchondral bone changes similar to OA. In contrast, replacement of beef tallow with LA decreased signs of metabolic syndrome together with decreased cartilage degradation. Furthermore, PA and SA but not LA increased release of matrix sulphated proteoglycans in cultures of bovine cartilage explants or human chondrocytes. In conclusion, we have shown that longer-chain dietary SFA in rats induce both metabolic syndrome and OA-like knee changes.

Ovariectomy (OVX) was performed on 6‑month‑old female rats treated with or without E2. Subsequently, various serum biochemical markers were measured. Additionally, pathological alterations of the uterus, liver and skeletal muscle were analyzed, and the content of triglycerides (TG) in muscle was detected. Differentiated myotubes formed by C2C12 cells were treated with  (PA) or pretreated with E2, estrogen receptor (ESR) 1 agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) and ESR2 agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN). Subsequently, the mRNA or protein expression levels of ESR1/2, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), CD36 molecule (CD36), fatty  synthase (FASN), perilipin 2 (PLIN2), phosphorylated acetyl‑CoA carboxylase α (p‑ACACA), p‑AKT serine/threonine kinase (p‑AKT) and p‑mitogen‑activated protein kinase 8 (p‑MAPK8) were analyzed in skeletal muscle or in C2C12 cells by reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The present results suggested that treatment with E2 inhibited OVX‑induced body weight gain, TG accumulation and . The protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR1, CD36, PPARα, p‑ACACA and p‑AKT were decreased, whereas the protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR2, PLIN2, FASN and p‑MAPK8 were increased in the OVX group. Of note, treatment with E2 restored the expression levels of the aforementioned factors. In C2C12 cells, treatment with E2 or PPT reversed the alterations induced by treatment with PA. In contrast, pretreatment with DPN did not influence the effect of PA. Collectively, E2 was able to interact with ESR1, thus activating the CD36‑PPARα pathway, decreasing the level of TG in the muscles and improving  in skeletal muscles and C2C12 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753653>Induction of Sphk1 activity in obese adipose tissue macrophages promotes survival.</a></h2><p>During obesity, adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) are increased in concert with local inflammation and . Since the levels of sphingolipid (SLs) in adipose tissue (AT) are altered during obesity we investigated the potential impact of SLs on ATMs. For this, we first analyzed expression of SL metabolizing genes in ATMs isolated from obese mice. A marked induction of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) expression was observed in obese ATM when compared to lean ATM. This induction was observed in both MGL-ve (M1) and MGL1+ve (M2) macrophages from obese WAT. Next, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to excessive palmitate, resulting in a similar induction of Sphk1. This Sphk1 induction was also observed when cells were treated with chloroquine, a lysosomotropic amine impacting lysosome function. Simultaneous incubation of RAW cells with palmitate and the Sphk1 inhibitor SK1-I promoted cell death, suggesting a protective role of Sphk1 during lipotoxic conditions. Interestingly, a reduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related genes was detected in obese ATM and was found to be associated with elevated Sphk1 expression. Altogether, our data suggest that lipid overload in ATM induces Sphk1, which promotes cell viability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972025> Reduces the Autophagic Flux and  Sensitivity Through the Activation of the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1) in the Hypothalamic Neuronal Cell Line N43/5.</a></h2><p>Chronic consumption of high fat diets (HFDs), rich in saturated fatty acids (SatFAs) like  (PA), is associated with the development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previous studies indicate that PA accumulates in the hypothalamus following consumption of HFDs; in addition, HFDs consumption inhibits autophagy and reduces  sensitivity. Whether malfunction of autophagy specifically in hypothalamic neurons decreases  sensitivity remains unknown. PA does activate the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1), also known as G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40); however, whether FFAR1 mediates the effects of PA on hypothalamic autophagy and  sensitivity has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to PA inhibits the autophagic flux and reduces  sensitivity in a cellular model of hypothalamic neurons (N43/5 cells). Furthermore, we show that inhibition of autophagy and the autophagic flux reduces  sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic flux, and the reduction in  sensitivity are prevented by pharmacological inhibition of FFAR1. Our findings show that dysregulation of autophagy reduces  sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. In addition, our data suggest FFAR1 mediates the ability of PA to inhibit autophagic flux and reduce  sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. These results reveal a novel cellular mechanism linking PA-rich diets to decreased  sensitivity in the hypothalamus and suggest that hypothalamic autophagy might represent a target for future T2DM therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29361517>Inhibition of galectin-3 ameliorates the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity in a rat model of diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is accompanied by metabolic alterations characterized by  and cardiac lipotoxicity. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in the context of obesity; however, its role in the metabolic consequences of obesity is not totally established. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive oxygen species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, glycolysis, oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels. These reductions were accompanied by amelioration of the mitochondrial damage observed in HFD rats, although no improvement was observed regarding .

Meteorin-like protein (METRNL), a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn, is induced after exercise in the skeletal muscle. Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated inflammation and  in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired  response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake. METRNL treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and PPARδ expression both in differentiated C2C12 cells and mouse skeletal muscle. siRNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and PPARδ abrogated the suppressive effects of METRNL on palmitate-induced inflammation and . Moreover, METRNL augmented the mRNA expression of fatty  oxidation-associated genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3). siRNAs for AMPK and PPARδ reversed these changes.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the liver of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in liver cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the liver steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment. It is concluded that FTZ extracts inhibit NASH by its action on both inflammatory response and liver lipid metabolism associated with NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615571>Fatty acids, epigenetic mechanisms and chronic diseases: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Chronic illnesses like obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases, are worldwide major causes of morbidity and mortality.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of Anxa2 in obesity-induced IR through the mediation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Microarray analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes associated with obesity. To verify whether Anxa2 was differentially expressed in IR triggered by obesity, IR mouse models were established in connection with a high-fat diet (HFD). In the mouse IR model, the role of differentially expressed Anxa2 in glycometabolism and IR was subsequently detected. To investigate the effect of Anxa2 on IR and its correlation with inflammation, a  (PA)-induced IR cell model was established, with the relationship between Anxa2 and the NF-κB signaling pathway investigated accordingly. Anxa2 was determined to be highly expressed in IR. Silencing Anxa2 was shown to inhibit IR triggered by obesity. When Anxa2 was knocked down, elevated expression of phosphorylated  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1a, and glucose tolerance and  sensitivity along with 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was detected, whereas decreased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and p50 was observed. Taken together, the current study ultimately demonstrated that Anxa2 may be a novel drug strategy for IR disruption, indicating that Anxa2 gene silencing is capable of alleviating PA or HFD-induced IR and inflammation through its negative regulatory role in the process of p50 nuclear translocation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721071>Adipocyte-Derived Exosomal MiR-27a Induces  in Skeletal Muscle Through Repression of PPARγ.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which adipocyte-derived endocrine factors promote  in skeletal muscle are not fully understood.

The expression and activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4),  receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and 9 microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-7, -34a, -96, -113, -126, -145, -150, -223 and -370) were detected before and after celastrol treatment using the PA-induced HepG2 IR model.The results showed that 250 µM PA for ≥2 days was optimal for inducing IR in HepG2 cells; 600 nM celastrol significantly attenuated the PA-induced IR in HepG2 cells. The PA-induced GLUT4 and IRS1 downregulation and Ser307 phosphorylation on IRS1 was reversed by subsequent treatment with 600 nM celastrol for 6 h. We next investigated which IR-related miRNAs were possible upstream regulators of celastrol-mediated reversal of PA-induced HepG2 IR. Two miRNAs, miR-150 and -223, were significantly downregulated by PA and were re-raised by subsequent celastrol treatment; and miR-223 was upstream of miR-150.

Here, we investigated whether chronic PAHSA treatment enhances  sensitivity and which receptors mediate PAHSA effects. Chronic PAHSA administration in chow- and HFD-fed mice raises serum and tissue PAHSA levels ∼1.4- to 3-fold. This improves  sensitivity and glucose tolerance without altering body weight. PAHSA administration in chow-fed, but not HFD-fed, mice augments  and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion.

TNFa promoter methylation levels, gene expression and secretion were different according to the diets and fatty  treatments associated with them. Cells treated with 5-AZA displayed higher TNFa levels than in the absence of 5-AZA, without differences between fatty acids. According to our results, dietary fatty  regulation of adipocyte TNFa levels may be mediated by epigenetic modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation levels.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Impairment of skeletal muscle function is closely associated with the progression of diabetes. However, the entire pathological characteristics and mechanisms of pre-diabetes in skeletal muscle remain fully unknown. Here, we established a mouse model of pre-diabetes, in which 6-week-old male C57BL6/J mice were fed either normal diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 or 16 weeks. Both non-fasting and fasting glucose levels and the results of glucose and  tolerance tests showed that mice fed an 8-week HFD developed pre-diabetes with IGT; whereas mice fed a 16-week HFD presented with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (IFG-IGT). Mice at both stages of pre-diabetes displayed decreased numbers of mitochondria in skeletal muscle. Moreover, IFG-IGT mice exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production in skeletal muscle and muscle degeneration characterized by a shift in muscle fibers from predominantly oxidative type I to glycolytic type II. Western blotting and histological analysis confirmed that myoblast differentiation was only inhibited in IFG-IGT mice. For primary skeletal muscle satellite cells, inhibition of differentiation was observed in -induced  model. Moreover, enhanced myoblast differentiation increased glucose uptake and  sensitivity. These findings indicate that pre-diabetes result in mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of myoblast differentiation in skeletal muscle. Therefore, interventions that enhance myoblast differentiation may improve  of diabetes at the earlier stage.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776912>Clinopodium chinense Attenuates -Induced Vascular Endothelial Inflammation and  through TLR4-Mediated NF-  B and MAPK Pathways.</a></h2><p>Elevated  (PA) levels are associated with the development of inflammation,  (IR) and endothelial dysfunction. Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced inflammation and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased -mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse  mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired  signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30129056>Nuciferine ameliorates hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet/streptozocin-induced diabetic mice through a PPARα/PPARγ coactivator-1α pathway.</a></h2><p>Nuciferine, an alkaloid found in Nelumbo nucifera leaves, alleviates dyslipidemia in vivo. However, whether it improves liver injury in diabetic conditions and the underlying mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nuciferine on lipid and glucose metabolism in a murine model of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects.A murine model of T2DM was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozocin (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were treated with nuciferine in their food. The underlying mechanism of the anti-steatotic effect of nuciferine was further explored in HepG2 hepatocytes cultured with . Major signalling profiles involved in fatty  oxidation were then evaluated, using Western blot, RT-qPCR and si-RNA techniques, along with immunohistochemistry.Nuciferine restored impaired glucose tolerance and  in diabetic mice. Hepatic levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL were decreased, as were the number of lipid droplets, by nuciferine treatment. Furthermore, nuciferine up-regulated β-oxidation related genes in livers of diabetic mice. Luciferase reporter cell assay showed that nuciferine directly reversed -induced inhibition of PPARα transcriptional activity. Silencing PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) expression in HepG2 cells abolished the effects of nuciferine in accelerating β-oxidation.Nuciferine improved lipid profile and attenuated hepatic steatosis in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice by activating the PPARα/PGC1α pathway.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds that have been studied in the case of metabolic disorders treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether enterolactone (ENL), a commonly known phytoestrogen, may affect sphingolipid metabolism and decrease hepatic  development in a lipid overload state.The study was conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (PA) for 16 h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and  signaling pathway proteins and glucose metabolism regulators were evaluated by Western Blot.In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased expression of -stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an increased expression of caspase-3.Enterolactone, in a higher fatty acids availability, led to the development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells. This phenomenon may be the result of elevated intracellular ceramide accumulation caused by increased de novo synthesis pathway what led to enhanced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The  study was performed using male C57BL/6 mice fed with methionine- choline-deficient diet and simultaneously treated with silibinin for 6 weeks. The  study was performed by using mouse NCTC-1469 cells which were respectively pretreated with oleic  plus , and adenovirus-down  for 24 h, then treated with silibinin for 24 h. After the drug treatment, the key indicators involved in CFLAR-JNK pathway including hepatic injury, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were determined.

These effects were confirmed by the  experiments. Silibinin prevented NASH by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway, and thereby on one hand promoting the -oxidation and efflux of fatty acids in liver to relieve lipid accumulation, and on the other hand inducing antioxidase activity (CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1) and inhibiting pro-oxidase activity (CYP2E1 and CYP4A) to relieve oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923306> Sphingomyelinase Down-regulation Alleviates Vascular Endothelial  in Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p> in endothelial cells contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.  sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a soluble glycoprotein which plays a vital role in the development and progression of various diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, it remains unknown if ASM regulates  in vascular endothelial cells in type 2 diabetes. ASM down-regulation with gene silencing and selective inhibitor amitriptyline was used in the rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) treated with  (PA), a common saturated free fatty , which is thought to be the major cause of . It was shown that ASM down-regulation increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter-4 (Glut4) expression and reversed the phosphorylation of pIRS-1-ser307 and AKT-ser473 via ceramide, consequently resulting in the decrease of the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide in PA-induced RAECs. We further found that ASM down-regulation blocked the Nox2- and Nox4-dependent superoxide (O  ) generation, which regulated glucose metabolism in RAECs during PA stimulation. In vivo, amitriptyline relieved the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and restored the level of ceramide, Nox2 and Nox4 in the aorta endothelium of high-fat diet-fed rats following an injection of streptozotocin. Taken together, these results suggest that ASM down-regulation can improve endothelial  which is attributed to inhibiting redox signalling in RAECs.

However, it is unknown whether ADMA is involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) is an enzyme that degrades ADMA. In this study, we used Ddah1 mice to investigate the effects of the ADMA/DDAH1 pathway on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis.After HFD feeding for 20 weeks, Ddah1 mice were more obese and had developed more severe hepatic steatosis and worse  compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In the livers of HFD-fed mice, loss of DDAH1 resulted in higher levels of lipogenic genes, lower expression of β-oxidation genes, and greater induction of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation than in the WT livers. Furthermore, ADMA treatment in HepG2 cells led to oxidative stress and steatosis, whereas overexpression of DDAH1 attenuated -induced steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Innovation and Conclusion: Our results provide the first direct evidence that the ADMA/DDAH1 pathway has a marked effect on hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis induced by HFD feeding. Our findings suggest that strategies to increase DDAH1 activity in hepatocytes may provide a novel approach to attenuate NAFLD development. Antioxid.

Food habit changes, such as the quality of fatty acids in the diet, are proposed to treat and prevent these disorders. Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower  sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters. On the other hand, a high intake of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids may promote positive effects, especially on triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are effective at limiting the hepatic steatosis process through a series of biochemical events, such as reducing the markers of non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, increasing the gene expression of lipid metabolism, decreasing lipogenic activity, and releasing adiponectin. This current review shows that the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids, MUFA, and PUFA, and especially EPA and DHA, which can be applied as food supplements, may promote effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as on metabolic inflammation, gut microbiota, and hepatic metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119530>Decreased lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis are coupled with changes in liver microRNAs in obese subjects with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Many controversies regarding the association of liver miRNAs with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) call for additional validations. This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with  (PA), a combination of palmitate and oleic , or high glucose, and  (HG) mimicking  in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased lipogenesis and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28694473>5-LO inhibition ameliorates -induced ER stress, oxidative stress and  via AMPK activation in murine myotubes.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway contributes to the development of  in adipose and hepatic tissues, but the role of LTB4 in skeletal muscle is relatively unknown.

Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of . FoxO1 plays a major role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as  signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) suppresses the activity of PI3K/Akt, which is an upstream pathway of FoxO1, and additionally promotes the pathological process of diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis via activating NF-κB pathway.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 via NF-κB pathway in  (PA)-induced -resistant HepG2 cells, thereby causing glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. We found that PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of glucokinase (GCK) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), in addition, promoted the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB.

Here, we demonstrate that HFD increases  deposition in the hippocampus and induces hippocampal  leading to FoxO3a-mediated overexpression of the palmitoyltransferase zDHHC3. The excess of  along with higher zDHHC3 levels causes hyper-palmitoylation of AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluA1, hindering its activity-dependent trafficking to the plasma membrane. Accordingly, AMPAR current amplitudes and, more importantly, their potentiation underlying synaptic plasticity were inhibited, as well as hippocampal-dependent memory. Hippocampus-specific silencing of Zdhhc3 and, interestingly enough, intranasal injection of the palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate, counteract GluA1 hyper-palmitoylation and restore synaptic plasticity and memory in HFD mice. Our data reveal a key role of FoxO3a/Zdhhc3/GluA1 axis in the HFD-dependent impairment of cognitive function and identify a novel mechanism underlying the cross talk between metabolic and cognitive disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28752031>Anti-diabetic effects and mechanisms of action of a Chinese herbal medicine preparation JQ-R  and in diabetic KK mice.</a></h2><p>Refined-JQ (JQ-R) is a mixture of refined extracts from  (Ranunculaceae),  (Leguminosae) and  (Caprifoliaceae), the three major herbs of JinQi-JiangTang tablet, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula. The mechanisms by which JQ-R regulates glucose metabolism and improves  sensitivity were studied in type 2 diabetic KK mice and -resistant L6 myotubes. To investigate the mechanisms by which JQ-R improves  sensitivity, a model of -resistant cells induced with  (PA) was established in L6 myotubes. Glucose uptake and expression of factors involved in  signaling, stress, and inflammatory pathways were detected by immunoblotting. JQ-R showed beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and  in a euglycemic clamp experiment and decreased fasting  levels in diabetic KK mice. JQ-R also improved the plasma lipid profiles. JQ-R directly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels in -resistant L6 cells, and elevated the -stimulated glucose uptake with upregulated phosphorylation of AKT. The phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B p65), inhibitor of NF-B (IB ), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) were also changed after JQ-R treatment compared with the control group. Together these findings suggest that JQ-R improved glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetic KK mice. JQ-R directly enhanced -stimulated glucose uptake in -resistant myotubes with improved  signalling and inflammatory response and oxidative stress. JQ-R could be a candidate to achieve improved glucose metabolism and  sensitivity in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27833848>Neutral ceramidase-enriched exosomes prevent -induced  in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Oversupply of free fatty acids such as  (PA) from the portal vein may cause liver . Production of reactive oxygen species plays a pivotal role in PA-induced  in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Recently, we found that exosomes secreted from INS-1 cells that were transfected with neutral ceramidase (NCDase) plasmids had raised NCDase activity; these NCDase-enriched exosomes could inhibit PA-induced INS-1 cell apoptosis.

It has been reported that the injection of hemin improves lipid metabolism and  sensitivity in various genetic models. However, the effect of hemin supplementation in food on lipid metabolism and  sensitivity is still unclear, and whether hemin directly affects cellular  sensitivity is yet to be elucidated. Here we show that hemin enhances -induced phosphorylation of  receptors, Akt, Gsk3β, FoxO1 and cytoplasmic translocation of FoxO1 in cultured primary hepatocytes under -resistant conditions. Furthermore, hemin diminishes the accumulation of triglyceride and increases in free fatty  content in primary hepatocytes induced by palmitate. Oral administration of hemin decreases body weight, energy intake, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and improves  and glucose tolerance as well as hepatic  signaling and hepatic steatosis in male mice fed a high-fat diet. In addition, hemin treatment decreases the mRNA and protein levels of some hepatic genes involved in lipogenic regulation, fatty  synthesis and storage, and increases the mRNA level and enzyme activity of CPT1 involved in fatty  oxidation. These data demonstrate that hemin can improve lipid metabolism and  sensitivity in both cultured hepatocytes and mice fed a high-fat diet, and show the potential beneficial effects of hemin from food on lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426858>-induced lipotoxicity promotes a novel interplay between Akt-mTOR, IRS-1, and FFAR1 signaling in pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>Free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1) is G-protein coupled receptor predominantly expressed in pancreatic β-cells that is activated by a variety of free fatty acids (FFAs). Once activated, it promotes glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS). However, increased levels of FFAs lead to lipotoxicity, inducing loss of β-cell function. FFAR1 plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and previous studies have indicated the importance of developing anti-diabetic therapies against FFAR1, although its role in the regulation of β-cell function remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of FFAR1 under lipotoxic conditions using  (PA). The rat insulinoma 1 clone 832/13 (INS-1 832/13) cell line was used as a model as it physiologically resembles native pancreatic β-cells. Key players of the  signaling pathway, such as mTOR, Akt, IRS-1, and the  receptor (INSR1β), were selected as candidates to be analyzed under lipotoxic conditions.We revealed that PA-induced lipotoxicity affected GSIS in INS-1 cells and negatively modulated the activity of both IRS-1 and Akt. Reduced phosphorylation of both IRS-1 S636/639 and Akt S473 was observed, in addition to decreased expression of both INSR1β and FFAR1. Moreover, transient knockdown of FFAR1 led to a reduction in IRS-1 mRNA expression and an increase in INSR1β mRNA. Finally, PA affected localization of FFAR1 from the cytoplasm to the perinucleus.In conclusion, our study suggests a novel regulatory involvement of FFAR1 in crosstalk with mTOR-Akt and IRS-1 signaling in β-cells under lipotoxic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of microbiota-GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and obesity. However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of  sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on  sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved  sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for ) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by  in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment. These data suggest that SA may restore the function of microbiota-GLP1 axis to improve glucose metabolism in the obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27806377>Fatty  synthesis configures the plasma membrane for inflammation in diabetes.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat promotes pathological  through chronic inflammation. The inactivation of inflammatory proteins produced by macrophages improves diet-induced diabetes, but how nutrient-dense diets induce diabetes is unknown. Membrane lipids affect the innate immune response, which requires domains that influence high-fat-diet-induced chronic inflammation and alter cell function based on phospholipid composition. Endogenous fatty  synthesis, mediated by fatty  synthase (FAS), affects membrane composition. Here we show that macrophage FAS is indispensable for diet-induced inflammation. Deleting Fasn in macrophages prevents diet-induced , recruitment of macrophages to adipose tissue and chronic inflammation in mice. We found that FAS deficiency alters membrane order and composition, impairing the retention of plasma membrane cholesterol and disrupting Rho GTPase trafficking-a process required for cell adhesion, migration and activation. Expression of a constitutively active Rho GTPase, however, restored inflammatory signalling. Exogenous palmitate was partitioned to different pools from endogenous lipids and did not rescue inflammatory signalling. However, exogenous cholesterol, as well as other planar sterols, did rescue signalling, with cholesterol restoring FAS-induced perturbations in membrane order. Our results show that the production of endogenous fat in macrophages is necessary for the development of exogenous-fat-induced  through the creation of a receptive environment at the plasma membrane for the assembly of cholesterol-dependent signalling networks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543975>Risk of diabetes associated with fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway is independent of  sensitivity and response: the  Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS).</a></h2><p>To examine the associations of fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, specifically myristic  (14:0),  (16:0), palmitoleic  (c16:1 n-7), myristoleic  (c14:1n5), stearic  (18:0) and oleic  (c18:1 n-9), with 5-year risk of type 2 diabetes.

However, the complete molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, zebrafish were fed a long-term high-fat diet to induce type 2 diabetes, which resulted in a higher body weight, body mass index, more lipid vacuoles in liver, increased  transcription level in liver, brain and muscle, and high fasting blood glucose in the high-fat diet zebrafish. Oppositely, the transcription levels of  substrate-2 and glucose transporter 2 were significantly decreased, indicating  signaling pathway and glucose transport impaired in the -targeting tissues. Transcription of the autophagy-related genes, ATG3, ATG4B, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, and FOXO3, were decreased but autophagy inhibitor gene m-TOR increased, and autophagy-flux was inhibited in liver of the high-fat diet zebrafish. Main of these changes were confirmed in -treated HepG2 cells. Further, in co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular co-localization experiments, the conjunction of preproinsulin with cargo-recognition protein p62 increased, but conjuncts of autophagosome with p62-cargo, lysosomes with p62-cargo, and autolysosomes decreased apparently. Interestingly, lysosomes, autolysosomes and conjuncts of p62- localized at the periphery of -treated cells, the margination of lysosomes may mediate deactivation of proteases activity. These findings suggest that intracellular high-lipid may trigger defective autophagy, defective downstream signaling of  and accumulated intracellular preproinsulin, leading to dysregulation of cell homeostasis mechanism, which may be one of reasons involved in  in type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428423>Dietary saturated fatty  type impacts obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and plasma lipidomic signatures in mice.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty  (SFA) intake is associated with obesity, , and hepatic steatosis, but scant work examines the impact of SFA type upon these outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of . Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

However, some data suggest heterogeneity within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depot with potential metabolic differences between the superficial SAT (sSAT) and deep SAT (dSAT) compartments. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-linolenic , 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes.

Therefore, we further explored the probable mechanism of VA on dismissing hepatic gluconeogenesis through the activation of adenosine-5' monophosphate kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro.We developed type 2 diabetic mice with STZ and oral administration with VA (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) once a day for 6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting  (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted.

Then, we further explored the mechanism of VA on hepatic gluconeogenesis in vitro experiments. Glucose production and the expression of AMPK, PEPCK and G6Pase proteins were detected after VA treatment with the presence of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.VA reduced FBG and caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance and  (HOMA-IR) in STZ-induced mice.

However, the detection is obstructed by the low contents, structural diversity, high structural similarity, and matrix interference. Herein, a fast cholamine-derivatization, within 1 min at room temperature, coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach was developed to determine LCFFAs in complex samples. After derivatization, the ionization and separation efficiency were significantly improved, which resulted in up to 2000-fold increase of sensitivity compared with non-derivatization method, and the limits of detection were at low femtogram level. As well, this approach was applied successfully in the rapid profiling or quantification of targeted and non-targeted LCFFAs in the sera of healthy human and asthma patients. The targeted metabolomics method showed that the contents of 17 PUFAs were significantly changed in asthma patients, especially hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (HPETEs) and prostaglandins (PGs). The non-targeted method resulted in the tentatively identification of 35 LCFFAs including 31 saturated and mono-unsaturated LCFFAs, and 4 bile acids, except for 27 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and the multivariate analysis indicated that eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), ursodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , isodeoxycholic , , 2-lauroleic  and lauric  also have significant difference between healthy and asthma groups except for 17 PUFAs.

Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %).

Ectopic expression of NPM in hepatocytes aggravated PA-induced , lipid droplet accumulation, glucose intake impairment as well as the expression of gluconeogenic genes. Coinciding with these results, interference of NPM using small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos ameliorated PA-induced , as revealed by increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β following  treatment. As predicted, PA-triggered alterations in glucose intake and the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes were attenuated following NPM depletion. Finally, we showed that NPM plays an indispensible role in PA-induced activation of NF-κB pathway. Both of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were impeded by NPM interference in PA-treated HepG2 cells.

In the current study, we investigated the effect of RE in palmitate-induced  resistant L6 myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate reduced the -stimulated glucose uptake, increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and decreased the -stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Importantly, exposure to RE abolished these effects and the -stimulated glucose uptake was restored.

In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05). In all subjects, the NAFLD score was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (r = 0.696), homeostasis model of assessment ratio-index (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.510), SCD1(16) (r = 0.273), and the delta-6 index (r = 0.494); and inversely associated with the delta-5 index (r = -0.443).Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with obesity, and .

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following weight loss. We investigated the effect of weight loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of body weight changes between groups revealed that the weight-loss group had greater reductions in body weight. The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the weight-loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the weight-loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, , and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the weight-loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following weight loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the weight-loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild weight loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Kukoamine A (KuA), a spermine alkaloid, is a major bioactive component extracted from the root barks of Lycium chinense (L. chinense) Miller. In the current study, we aimed to explore the possible effect of KuA on  and fatty liver. We showed that KuA significantly inhibited the increase of fasting blood glucose level and  level, and the glucose levels in response to glucose and  load in HFD-fed mice, which was in a dose-dependent manner. KuA dose-dependently decreased the histological injury of liver, levels of hepatic triglyceride (TG), and serum AST and ALT activities in HFD-fed mice. The increase of serum levels of TNFɑ, IL-1β, IL-6 and C reactive protein in HFD-fed mice was inhibited by KuA. HFD feeding-induced increase of hepatic expression of Srebp-1c and its target genes, including fatty  synthase (FAS) and acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), was significantly inhibited by KuA. Moreover, upregulation of Srebp-1c notably inhibited KuA-induced improvement of -stimulated glucose uptake, decrease of lipid accumulation and HO level in -treated AML-12 cells. In conclusion, we reported that KuA inhibited Srebp-1c and downstream genes expression and resulted in inhibition of lipid accumulation, inflammation,  and oxidative stress. Overall, our results provide a better understanding of the pharmacological activities of KuA against  and hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

These ceramides were analysed in a population-based risk factor study (FINRISK 2002, n = 8045), in a cohort of participants undergoing elective coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris (Western Norway Coronary Angiography Cohort [WECAC], n = 3344) and in an intervention trial investigating improved methods of lifestyle modification for individuals at high risk of the metabolic syndrome (Prevent Metabolic Syndrome [PrevMetSyn], n = 371). Diabetes risk score models were developed to estimate the 10 year risk of incident diabetes.Analysis in FINRISK 2002 showed that the Cer(d18:1/18:0)/Cer(d18:1/16:0) ceramide ratio was predictive of incident diabetes (HR per SD 2.23, 95% CI 2.05, 2.42), and remained significant after adjustment for several risk factors, including BMI, fasting glucose and HbA (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14, 1.57). The finding was validated in the WECAC study (unadjusted HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.53, 2.14; adjusted HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.16, 1.66). In the intervention trial, the ceramide ratio and diabetes risk scores significantly decreased in individuals who had 5% or more weight loss.The Cer(d18:1/18:0)/Cer(d18:1/16:0) ratio is an independent predictive biomarker for incident diabetes, and may be modulated by lifestyle intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30358799>Alterations in branched-chain amino  kinetics in nonobese but -resistant Asian men.</a></h2><p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are elevated in the -resistant (IR) state. The reasons for this increase remain unclear, but it may be related to abnormalities in BCAA metabolism and free fatty  (FFA) metabolism.In this study, we quantified BCAA and FFA kinetics of IR and -sensitive (IS) nonobese Asian men with the use of stable-isotope tracers. We hypothesized that in addition to greater substrate flux, the BCAA oxidative pathway is also impaired to account for the higher plasma BCAA concentration in the IR state.We recruited 12 IR and 14 IS nonobese and healthy Asian men. Oral-glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed to quantify  sensitivity, and subjects underwent 2 stable-isotope infusion studies. [U-13C6]Leucine was infused to measure leucine flux and oxidation as indexes of BCAA metabolism, whereas [U-13C16]palmitate was infused to measure palmitate flux and oxidation to represent FFA metabolism, The 2H2O dilution method was used to estimate body composition.IR subjects had greater adiposity and significantly higher fasting and post-OGTT glucose and  concentrations compared with the IS group. However, none of the subjects were diabetic. Despite similar dietary protein intake, IR subjects had a significantly higher plasma BCAA concentration and greater leucine flux. Leucine oxidation was also greater in the IR group, but the relation between leucine oxidation and flux was significantly weaker in the IR group than in the IS group (r = 0.530 compared with 0.695, P < 0.0388 for differences between slope). FFA oxidation was, however, unaffected despite higher FFA flux in the IR group.The higher plasma BCAA concentration in healthy nonobese individuals with IR is associated with a weaker relation between BCAA oxidation and BCAA flux and this occurs in the presence of accelerated FFA flux and oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101051>Histone methyltransferase G9a modulates hepatic  signaling via regulating HMGA1.</a></h2><p>Hepatic  sensitivity is critical for glucose homeostasis, and  is a fundamental syndrome found in various metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Despite considerable studies on the mechanisms of hepatic , the link between epigenetic regulation and the development of  remains elusive. Here, we reported that G9a/EHMT2, a histone methyltransferase, was markedly decreased in the liver of db/db mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In cultured hepatic cells, G9a knockdown resulted in downregulation of  receptor, p-AKT and p-GSK3β; while upon upregulation, G9a prevented the - or glucosamine-induced  by preserving the normal level of  receptor and integrity of  signaling. Further mechanistic study suggested that G9a regulated the expression level of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), a key regulator responsible for the transcription of  receptor (INSR) gene. Overexpression of HMGA1 normalized the impaired  signaling in G9a knockdown hepatic cells. Importantly, in db/db mice, restoring the expression level of G9a not only upregulated HMGA1 level and improved the impaired hepatic  signaling, but also alleviated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Together, our results revealed a novel role for G9a in modulating  signaling, at least in part, depending on its regulatory function on HMGA1.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Saturated free fatty acids, such as  (PA), are known inducers of apoptosis in numerous cell types. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of PA on cultured rat H9C2 cardiac myocytes cells and to investigate the PKR mediated harmful effects of PA in vitro in cultured cardiomyocytes.PKR expression was determined by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Oxidative stress and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry and assay kits. The expression of different gene markers of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.PKR expression, reactive oxygen species levels as well as apoptosis were increased in PA-treated cultured H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The harmful effects of PA were attenuated by a selective PKR inhibitor, C16.

Chronic  (CI) treatment of adipocytes and  (PAL) exposure of myotubes were used to induce IR in the presence, or not, of LCn-3PUFA. EPA (50 µM) and DPA (10 µM) improved PAL-induced IR in myotubes, but had only a partial effect in adipocytes. CM from adipocytes exposed to CI induced IR in C2C12 myotubes. Although DPA increased the mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty  (FA) beta-oxidation and  signaling in adipocytes, it was not sufficient to reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and prevent the induction of IR in myotubes exposed to adipocyte's CM.

We describe a method for assessing whole-body FA oxidation in vivo, as well as tissue-specific lipid uptake in conscious mice. The method relies on intravenous administration of [9,10-H(N)] combined with a non-β-oxidizable palmitate analog, [1-C]2-bromopalmitic . Pretreatment with etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor that prevents the shuttling of FAs into mitochondria, markedly reduced the appearance of the β-oxidation product HO in circulation and reduced lipid uptake by oxidative tissues including heart and soleus muscle. Whole-body fatty oxidation was unaltered between chow- or high-fat-fed WT and transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of the AMPK γ3 subunit (AMPKγ3) in skeletal muscle. High-fat feeding increased lipid oxidation in WT and AMPKγ3 transgenic mice.

However, the role of HPS in the development of  in skeletal muscle under obesity remains unclear. The effect of hyperlipidemia on hepatic HPS expression was evaluated in primary hepatocytes and liver of mice. HPS-mediated signal pathways were explored using small interfering (si) RNAs of specific genes or inhibitors. We found that treatment of primary hepatocytes with palmitate could induce HPS expression through C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, increased HPS expression was observed in the liver of high fat diet (HFD)-fed or tunicamycin-treated mice. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-BPA) (an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor) and suppression of p38 by siRNA abrogated the effect of palmitate on HPS expression in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of differentiated C2C12 cells with recombinant HPS caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and impairment of  sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK reduced the effect of HPS on  signaling.

Metabolic insults arising from obesity promote inflammation, which in turn impedes  signalling and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Key cells in the process are metabolically activated macrophages, which up-regulate both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in response to lipid spillover from adipocytes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are regulators of cellular homeostasis that influence both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Dietary fats, such as saturated fatty acids (SFAs), can differentially modulate metabolic inflammation. , in particular, is a well-characterized nutrient that promotes metabolic inflammation via the NLRP3 (the nod-like receptor containing a pyrin domain) inflammasome, which is partly attributable to AMPK inhibition. Conversely, some unsaturated fatty acids are less potent agonists of metabolic inflammation. For example, monounsaturated fatty  does not reduce AMPK as potently as SFA and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids actively resolve inflammation via resolvins and protectins. Nevertheless, the full extent to which nutritional state modulates metabolic inflammation requires greater clarification.© 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504232>Hepatic transcriptome analysis from HFD-fed mice defines a long noncoding RNA regulating cellular cholesterol levels.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the transcriptomic changes of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, we defined their hepatic transcriptome by RNA sequencing. Aberrant expression of 37 representative lncRNAs and 254 protein-coding RNAs was observed in the livers of HFD-fed mice with  compared with the livers from control mice. Of these, 24 lncRNAs and 179 protein-coding RNAs were upregulated, whereas 13 lncRNAs and 75 protein-coding RNAs were downregulated. Functional analyses showed that the aberrantly expressed protein-coding RNAs were enriched in various lipid metabolic processes and in the  signaling pathway. Genomic juxtaposition and coexpression patterns identified six pairs of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, consisting of five lncRNAs and five protein-coding genes.

Proliferative and synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) increase intimal thickness and destabilize atheromatous plaques. This study aimed to investigate whether saturated  (PA) and monounsaturated oleic  (OA) modulate autophagy activity, cell proliferation, and vascular tissue remodeling in an aortic VSMC cell line. Exposure to PA and OA suppressed growth of VSMCs without apoptotic induction, but enhanced autophagy flux with elevation of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3I/II. Cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors potentiated the FFA-suppressed VSMC growth and showed differential actions of PA and OA in autophagy flux retardation. Both FFAs upregulated lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) but only OA increased LDL uptake by VSMCs. Mechanistically, FFAs induced hyperphosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK. All pathways, except OA-activated PI3K/Akt cascade, were involved in the LOX-1 upregulation, whereas blockade of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK cascades ameliorated the FFA-induced growth suppression on VSMCs. Moreover, both FFAs exhibited tissue remodeling effect through increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and their gelatinolytic activities, whereas high-dose OA significantly suppressed collagen type I expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated LOX-1 knockdown significantly attenuated the OA-induced tissue remodeling effects in VSMCs. In conclusion, OA and PA enhance autophagy flux, suppress aortic VSMC proliferation, and exhibit vascular remodeling effect, thereby leading to the loss of VSMCs and interstitial ECM in vascular walls and eventually the instability of atheromatous plaques.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subchronic withdrawal from a high-carbohydrate, high-saturated fat (HCHF) diet during MetS with reference to changes in deleterious SFA (C12:0, lauric ; C14:0, myristic ; C16:0, ; C18:0, stearic ) distribution in liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and feces.MetS induced by prolonged feeding of an HCHF diet in Wistar albino rat is used as a model of human MetS. The MetS-induced rats were withdrawn from the HCHF diet and changed to a basal diet for final 4 wk of the total experimental duration of 16 wk. SFA distribution in target tissues and hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression were analyzed.Analyses of changes in SFA concentration of target tissues indicate that C16:0 and C18:0 reduced in WAT and liver after withdrawal of the HCHF diet. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in fecal C12:0 with HCHF feeding, which significantly (P < 0.01) increased after withdrawal of this diet. Also, an improvement in expression of hepatic LDLr was observed after withdrawal of HCHF diet.The prolonged consumption of an HCHF diet leads to increased SFA accumulation in liver and WAT, decreased SFA excretion, and reduced hepatic LDLr expression during MetS, which is prominently reversed after subchronic withdrawal of the HCHF diet. This can contribute to better understanding of the metabolic fate of dietary SFA during MetS and may apply to the potential reversal of complications by the simple approach of nutritional modification.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human relaxin-2 (25 or 75 μg/kg/day) or vehicle for 4 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 decreased systemic  and reduced body weight, epididymal fat mass and serum leptin and  concentrations. In livers of HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis and increased phosphorylation of  receptor substrate-1, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and activated genes that regulate fatty  oxidation and suppressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Relaxin-2 had no direct anti-steatotic effect on primary mouse hepatocytes, but S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine attenuated -induced steatosis and activated genes regulating fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes. In mice fed an MCD diet, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Relaxin-2 increased eNOS and Akt phosphorylation and transcript levels of cytochrome P450-4a10 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase in MCD-fed mouse livers. Moreover, expression levels of Kupffer cell activation, hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatocyte apoptosis were decreased in MCD diet-fed mice receiving relaxin-2. In conclusion, relaxin-2 reduces hepatic steatosis by activating intrahepatic eNOS in HFD-fed mice and further attenuates liver fibrosis in MCD diet-fed mice. Therefore, human relaxin-2 is a potential therapeutic treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28304381>TNF-α stimulates endothelial  transcytosis and promotes .</a></h2><p>Persistent elevation of plasma TNF-α is a marker of low grade systemic inflammation.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired  signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic . Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and  (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with  parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in  signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29607540>Melatonin improves  and hepatic steatosis through attenuation of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Melatonin plays an important role in regulating circadian rhythms. It also acts as a potent antioxidant and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, although the exact action mechanism is not clear. The α2-HS-glycoprotein gene (AHSG) and its protein, fetuin-A (FETUA), are one of the hepatokines and are known to be associated with  and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin improves hepatic  and hepatic steatosis in a FETUA-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells treated with 300 μmol/L of , phosphorylated AKT expression decreased, and FETUA expression increased, but this effect was inhibited by treatment with 10 μmol/L of melatonin. However, melatonin did not improve  in FETUA-overexpressing cells, indicating that improvement in  by melatonin was dependent on downregulation of FETUA. Moreover, melatonin decreased -induced ER stress markers, CHOP, Bip, ATF-6, XBP-1, ATF-4, and PERK. In addition, in the high-fat diet (HFD) mice, oral treatment with 100 mg/kg/day melatonin for 10 weeks reduced body weight gain to one-third of that of the HFD group and hepatic steatosis.  sensitivity and glucose intolerance improved with the upregulation of muscle p-AKT protein expression. FETUA expression and ER stress markers in the liver and serum of HFD mice were decreased by melatonin treatment. In conclusion, melatonin can improve hepatic  and hepatic steatosis through reduction in ER stress and the resultant AHSG expression.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, it is presently unknown whether BACE1 and the product of its activity, soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), contribute to lipid-induced inflammation and  in skeletal muscle cells.Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from Bace1mice and mice treated with sAPPβ and adipose tissue and plasma from obese and type 2 diabetic patients.We show that BACE1 inhibition or knockdown attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and  and prevents the reduction in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and fatty  oxidation caused by palmitate in myotubes. The effects of palmitate on ER stress, inflammation, , PGC-1α down-regulation, and fatty  oxidation were mimicked by soluble APPβ in vitro. BACE1 expression was increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and this was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α mRNA levels and by an increase in sAPPβ plasma levels of obese type 2 diabetic patients compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Acute sAPPβ administration to mice reduced PGC-1α levels and increased inflammation in skeletal muscle and decreased  sensitivity.Collectively, these findings indicate that the BACE1 product sAPPβ is a key determinant in ER stress, inflammation and  in skeletal muscle and gluconeogenesis in liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigates aortic vasoreactivity in high fat diet (HFD) induced  resistant iNOS KO mice. WT and iNOS KO mice were fed with 45% HFD/10% LFD for ten weeks. Systemic IR was assessed via measurement of circulating lipids, glucose, and ; while phenylephrine (PE)/acetylcholine (ACh) induced responses were monitored in the isolated aortic rings. To understand the mechanism, qPCR or Western blotting experiments were performed in aorta and Ea.hy926 cells. After 10 weeks of HFD feeding, significant increase in the body weight/fat mass, augmented circulating lipids, glucose,  and inflammatory cytokines along with impaired acetylcholine induced aortic vasorelaxation and enhanced iNOS expression was observed in the aortic tissue of WT mice. In the aminoguanidine (AG, 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks) treated WT mice and also in iNOS KO mice, acetylcholine induced vasorelaxation was significantly preserved. Further, acetylcholine mediated vasorelaxation correlated with increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 residue in the iNOS KO mice and same was also observed in the iNOS silenced Ea.hy926 cells. Moreover, treatment of Ea.hy926 cells with  or TNFα also caused a significant decrease in eNOS activity, which was reversed in iNOS silenced Ea.hy926 cells suggesting the role of iNOS in the reduction of eNOS activity. The study thus implies a critical role of iNOS in vascular diseases associated with dyslipidemia/IR.Copyright © 2019.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular energy sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, , and T2D.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is used to treat liver dysfunction; however, the effect and mechanism of HGF on hepatic lipid metabolism are still not fully understood.Male C57BL/6 mice were induced with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment of HGF or vehicle saline. The levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting  and homeostatic model assessment of  were calculated for  sensitivity. Biochemical plasma parameters were also measured to assess the effect of HGF on lipid accumulation. Additionally, genes in the lipid metabolism pathway were evaluated in -treated HepG2 cells and high-fat diet mice.HGF treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents. Additionally, HGF-regulated expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/fatty  synthase, peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor-α, and upstream nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner. Furthermore, c-Met inhibitor could partially reverse the effects of HGF.HGF treatment can ameliorate hepatic  and steatosis through regulation of lipid metabolism.

It has been demonstrated that resveratrol (RSV) may prevent T2DM by targeting Sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1), indicating that SIRT1 may be a novel therapeutic target for T2DM prevention. In the present study, a T2DM rat model was established by administering a high fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Measurements of blood glucose and  confirmed successful establishment of the T2DM model. RSV was used to treat rats with STZ-induced T2DM and the results indicated that RSV reversed the STZ-induced downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, SIRT1 and forkhead box protein O 3a. Furthermore, RSV modulated the activity of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, which are associated with oxidative stress. , cells from the insulinoma cell line clone 1E were pretreated with  (PA) to simulate a high fat environment. The results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that PA suppressed the expression of SIRT1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA modulated the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-associated, lipid metabolism-associated and β-cell-associated genes, whereas RSV treatment ameliorated the PA-induced changes in the expression of these genes via SIRT1. The results of the present study suggest that RSV participates in the prevention of T2DM by regulating the expression of mitochondrial genes associated with biogenesis, lipid metabolism and β-cells via SIRT1. The results of the current study provide an insight into the mechanisms by which SIRT1 inhibits T2DM and may be used as a basis for future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28531788>Association of dietary factors with severity of coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease has taken epidemic proportions during past decades.

This study was planned to analyze the association of dietary factors with severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Indian patients.Three hundred patients with known coronary disease above the age of 25 years were included in this study. Blood samples were collected for biochemical markers. Patients were stratified according to severity of CAD [number of vessel involved-single (SVD), double (DVD), triple (TVD)].Mean age of the patient was 60.9 ± 12.4 years. Subjects with TVD, DVD, SVD in the study were 52.3%, 25.3% and 22.3% respectively. Patients with TVD had higher body mass index, triglycerides, HOMA-, hsCRP and lower high density cholesterol. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia were more common in TVD patients. Among macronutrients, patients with TVD had higher intake of carbohydrate and lower intake of protein and dietary fibers. There was no association of total fat intake with CAD, however, intake of  was higher among patients with TVD. Intake of vitamins namely niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, B6, and vitamin-C decreased with increase in severity. With increase in severity of CAD, mineral intake (potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, chromium, copper, manganese, and zinc) decreased.Dietary factors are associated with severity of coronary artery disease.

Our previous study revealed that the upregulation of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long noncoding RNA, enhanced hepatic  via increased FoxO1 expression. The present study aimed to explore whether miR‑214 and ATF4 were involved in the MEG3‑mediated increase of FoxO1 expression. MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 expression were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The interaction among MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 was analysed using the luciferase reporter assay. MEG3‑targeting small interference RNAs were injected into high‑fat diet (HFD)‑fed mice to verify the role of MEG3 in hepatic  in vivo. MEG‑3 and ATF4 were demonstrated to be upregulated and miR‑214 was indicated to be downregulated in the livers of HFD‑fed and ob/ob mice. In mouse primary hepatocytes, palmitate time‑dependently increased MEG3 and ATF4 but decreased miR‑214 expression levels. Furthermore, MEG3 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression, while miR‑214 inhibition and ATF4 overexpression reversed the MEG3 knockdown‑mediated decrease in the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO1‑downstream targets phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose‑6‑phosphatase catalytic subunit. In HFD‑fed mice, MEG3 knockdown substantially improved impaired glucose and  tolerance, while downregulating HFD‑induced ATF4 expression and upregulating HFD‑suppressed miR‑214 expression. In conclusion, MEG3 promoted hepatic  by serving as a ceRNA of miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac  signaling are not fully understood. The regulatory role of tafazzin in the hearts of HF-diet-fed mice is investigated.Mice are fed a HF diet or low fat (LF) diet for up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, it is found that HF-diet-induced cardiac dysfunction is linked to overexpression of the mitochondrial protein tafazzin. Increased tafazzin promotes mitochondrial fission and impairs  signaling, which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, knockdown of tafazzin with siRNA inhibits -induced mitochondrial fission and restores  sensitivity. Moreover, miR-125b-5p as an upstream regulator targeting tafazzin is identified and palmitate-induced  further rescued.In HF-diet-fed mouse hearts, increased tafazzin contributes to  via mediating Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria, and a small non-coding RNA, miR-125b-5p, at least partially regulates this signaling pathway and alleviates .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Oleic  has been shown to blunt palmitate-induced  in muscle cells. However, there is no literature available regarding the effect of oleic  on palmitate-induced  in intact muscle. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of oleic  on palmitate-induced  in rat soleus muscle and its underlying mechanisms. For these purposes, oleic  (1 mM) was administered for 12 h in the absence or presence of palmitate (2 mM). At the end of the experiment, plasmalemmal GLUT4, the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2, and the total expression of these signaling proteins were examined. We found that treatment with palmitate for 12 h reduced -stimulated GLUT4 translocation and the phosphorylation of AS160 and Akt-2. However, the administration of oleic  fully restored -stimulated GLUT4 translocation (P < 0.05), as well as AS160 and Akt-2 phosphorylation (P < 0.05) despite the continuous presence of palmitate. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, only slightly prevented the oleic -induced improvements in -stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and AS160 phosphorylation. However, this treatment completely inhibited the oleic -induced improvement in -stimulated Akt-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the oleic -induced improvement in  signaling was not affected by compound C, an AMPK specific inhibitor. In conclusion, the results clearly indicate that oleic  administration alleviates palmitate-induced  by promoting GLUT4 translocation in muscle, at least in part, by activating the PI3K pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415760>Oxidative stress induced by  modulates K2.3 channels in vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acids level has been implicated in the development of , inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of  (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human body, on small-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (K2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent  arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on K2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. K2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of K2.3 and K3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased K2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored K2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of K2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated K2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Attenuates free fatty -induced steatosis in HepG2 cells and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to metabolic diseases such as obesity and .We studied whether an ethanol extract of Lycopus lucidus Turcz. ex Benth (LLE) exhibited effects on lipid metabolism in NAFLD.An in vitro modelwas established by treatment of HepG2 cells with a 1 mM free fatty  (FFA) mixture (oleic /, 2:1). C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, , leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, , leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

To co-relate the in vivo results we used the human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells, subjected to knockdown with small siRNAs of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα genes and treated with osmotin and  (P.A.). MTT assay, Western blotting, immunohistofluorescence assays, and plasma biochemical analyses were applied.Osmotin stimulated AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways in ob/ob and db/db mice, and HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Mechanistically, we confirmed that knockdown of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα by their respective siRNAs abolished the osmotin activity in HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro results suggested that osmotin protected against NAFLD through activation of AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways as shown by the reduced body weight, blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin, improved glucose tolerance, attenuated  and hepatic glucogenesis, regulated serum lipid parameters, and increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial functions.Our findings strongly suggest that novel osmotin might be a potential novel therapeutic tool against obesity/diabetes-induced NAFLD and other metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Meanwhile, suppressor of cytokine signaling3 (SOCS3) also regulates IR in NAFLD. Both PPARγ and SOCS3 play a role in NAFLD through regulating IR, while it is unclear whether these two proteins interact to regulate hepatic steatosis. PPARγ, SOCS3 and its associated JAK2/STAT3 pathway were analyzed using Kuppfer cells (KCs) treatment with LPS and BRL-3A cells treatment with , KC-conditioned medium (KCCM), PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (ROZ) or JAK2 inhibitor AG490 to demonstrate the role of PPARγ and SOCS3 in hepatocytes steatosis. As LPS concentration increasing, phagocytosis activity of KCs decreased; but releasing of TNF-α and IL-6 increased. After treatment with KCCM, mRNA level of SOCS3, JAK2 and STAT3 as well as protein expression of SOCS3, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in steatosis BRL-3A cells increased significantly, which were inhibited by AG490 or ROZ treatment. Taken together, these results indicated that KCCM attributed to KCs dysfunction facilitated hepatocyte steatosis through promoting expressing SOCS3; but PPARγ agonist ROZ alleviated steatosis through reducing SOCS3 expression by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ROS generation by infiltrating macrophages involves multiple mechanisms, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation. Here, we show that palmitate-stimulated CD11bF4/80 hepatic infiltrating macrophages, but not CD11bF4/80 Kupffer cells, generate ROS via dynamin-mediated endocytosis of TLR4 and NOX2, independently from MyD88 and TRIF. We demonstrate that differently from LPS-mediated dimerization of the TLR4-MD2 complex, palmitate binds a monomeric TLR4-MD2 complex that triggers endocytosis, ROS generation and increases pro-interleukin-1β expression in macrophages. Palmitate-induced ROS generation in human CD68CD14 macrophages is strongly suppressed by inhibition of dynamin. Furthermore, Nox2-deficient mice are protected against high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and . Therefore, endocytosis of TLR4 and NOX2 into macrophages might be a novel therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940201>Epigallocatechin gallate improves  in HepG2 cells through alleviating inflammation and lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>High levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), inflammation and oxidative stress are important causes for  (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of EGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells.HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose, 0.25 mM  (PA), or 50 μM EGCG for 24 h.EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCG markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and p53 protein, and markedly increased superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCG significantly downregulated the levels of FFAs, triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein and its downstream proteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1β were significantly increased, and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c (SREBP-1c) protein, and fatty  synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG in HepG2. Moreover, the foregoing effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GLUT2.Our data demonstrated that EGCG improved IR, possibly through ameliorating glucose (25 mM) and PA (0.25 mM)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and FFAs via the GLUT2/PGC-1β/SREBP-1c/FAS pathway in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, by proteomic analysis, we found that expression of heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) was induced by the AMP analog 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside in palmitate-induced -resistant cells. Overexpression of AMPKα2, or activation of AMPKα via acute/chronic exercise training, increased HSPB1 expression in the skeletal muscle. In AMPKα2 mice, HSPB1 expression was downregulated in the quadriceps muscles. Exercise did not increase HSPB1 expression in AMPKα2 mice. Moreover, overexpression of HSPB1 enhanced  sensitivity in palmitate-induced -resistant cells and restored metabolic phenotypes associated with defective AMPK. Finally, HSPB1 was required for AMPK-mediated activation of the class IIa histone deacetylases and glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle.

Propane-2-sulfonic  octadec-9-enyl-amide (N15) is a novel PPARα/γ dual agonist synthesized in our laboratory. The present study investigates the efficacy and safety of N15 on  regulation in high fat diet (HFD)-and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and in  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Our results showed that N15 remarkably ameliorated  and dyslipidemia in vivo, as well as rectified the glucose consumption and gluconeogenesis in vitro. Moreover, the glucose-lowering effect of N15 was associated with PPARγ mediated up-regulation of hepatic glucose consumption and down-regulation of gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, N15 exerted advantageous effects on glucose and lipid metabolism without triggering weight gain and hepatotoxicity in mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that by alleviating glucose and lipid abnormalities, N15 could be used as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining  sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol improves  sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of myricanol was evaluated on  (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by MitoTracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity, and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. Expression of mitochondria-related and  signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced -stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, myricanol treatment alleviated adiposity and  through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle and inducing browning of inguinal fat.Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk, to stimulate browning of adipose tissue and improve  sensitivity in skeletal muscle.

Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by oleic , whereas it is decreased in response to  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated body weight gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic . We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution, body weight regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p></html>
