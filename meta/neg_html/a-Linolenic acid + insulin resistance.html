Two months before insemination, the rabbits (15 animals/group) were fed different diets: commercial standard (group C), supplemented with 10% extruded linseed (group L), and 3% fish oil (group FO). The L group does showed both the highest feed intake before AI (P < 0.01) and the highest body weight (BW) throughout pregnancy (P < 0.001). The L does yielded less milk than the C does (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in either weight or size of litter at weaning. Regardless of diet, insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR values were higher during the first half of pregnancy (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, the L does showed higher mean insulin concentrations than FO rabbits (P < 0.01) and the lowest glucose clearance (P < 0.01) during pregnancy. On the other hand, pregnant FO rabbits showed the lowest glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and the lowest Homeostasis model assessment values for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, P < 0.05) as well as a faster restoration of baseline glucose levels following glucose load (P < 0.001). Before and during pregnancy, the BW of the rabbits was positively related to fasting sample- and tolerance test-derived indices of insulin resistance (P < 0.05) suggesting that a high pre-pregnancy BW predisposes to gestational insulin resistance. Linseed supplementation increased BW and predisposed to insulin resistance during pregnancy; whereas, fish oil improved insulin sensitivity without significant changes in BW.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

PPARγ activators are known to have potent antihyperglycemic activity and are used to treat insulin resistance associated with . Therefore, many natural and synthetic agonists of PPARγ are used in the treatment of glucose disorders. In the present study, we found that 13-oxo-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic  (13-oxo-OTA),   derivative, is present in the extract of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia). We also found that 13-oxo-OTA activated PPARγ and induced the mRNA expression of PPARγ target genes in adipocytes, thereby promoting differentiation. Furthermore, 13-oxo-OTA induced secretion of adiponectin and stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that 13-oxo-OTA induces adipogenesis through PPARγ activation and to present 13-oxo-OTA as a valuable food-derived compound that may be applied in the management of glucose metabolism disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ-linolenic  for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty , and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to  and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
