However, the mechanisms by which the Oatp and Mrp genes are down-regulated are largely unknown. Using in vivo and in vitro murine models of inflammation, we examined the role of cytokines and bile acids in regulating Oatp and Mrp. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, cholic , taurocholate, or taurodeoxycholate was administered in vivo to mice or in vitro to Hepa 1-6 mouse hepatoma cells. Mrp, Oatp, and Bsep mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Mrp efflux activity was measured using 5-carboxyfluorescein. In vivo, LPS treatment profoundly suppressed hepatic mRNA levels of Mrp2, Mrp3, Oatp1, Oatp2, and Bsep to 15, 60, 44, 30, and 32% of controls, respectively (p < 0.05), but did not significantly alter Mrp1 expression. IL-6 or IL-1beta administration suppressed Mrp2, Oatp1, Oatp2, and Bsep mRNA levels to 20 to 60% controls (p < 0.05). TNF-alpha administration affected mRNA levels of Mrp2, Mrp3, and Oatp2 but not Oatp1 or Bsep. Bile  treatment increased the in vivo expression of Bsep but not Mrp or Oatp. Likewise, significantly lower mRNA levels of Mrp2 with a corresponding decrease in cellular efflux of 5-carboxyfluorescein was seen in vitro in IL-6- and IL-1beta-treated Hepa 1-6 cells, whereas bile acids did not have significant effects. In conclusion, cytokines are key mediators in regulating hepatic expression of anion transporters in inflammatory cholestasis, whereas bile acids likely play a minor role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2821123>Polymyxin B moderates acidosis and hypotension in established, experimental gram-negative septicemia.</a></h2><p>Polymyxin B (PMB), an antibiotic, and sodium deoxycholate (NaD), a bile salt, are surface-active agents. Each protected mice against an otherwise lethal challenge with purified endotoxin (P less than .001). To determine if either of these agents was effective in treating established, overwhelming gram-negative septicemia, we infected rabbits by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli K1. Animals were treated with moxalactam 1 hr after infection, then randomly assigned to groups receiving either saline, PMB, or NaD. Serial samples of blood were assayed for bacterial concentration, levels of plasma endotoxin, arterial blood gases, and complete blood cell counts. Physiologic functions were monitored continuously. Although levels of bacteremia and  were similar in all three groups, rabbits receiving PMB had significantly higher mean arterial blood pressure, blood pH, and bicarbonate concentrations than did control rabbits (P less than .05). Rabbits receiving NaD fared no better than controls. In this model, PMB moderates some of the deleterious effects of established, overwhelming gram-negative bacterial sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12620498>Inhibitory effects of ursodeoxycholic  on the induction of nitric oxide synthase in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the resultant increased nitric oxide production are associated with endotoxemia and atherosclerotic lesions observed in transplant hearts or balloon-injured artery. Ursodeoxycholic  has been shown to have cardiovascular protective effects, such as inhibition of the development of transplant arteriosclerosis, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of ursodeoxycholic  on nitric oxide production and the expression of iNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from adult rat aorta and rabbit coronary artery. Nitrite released from cells in the culture medium was measured with the Griess reaction. iNOS mRNA and protein were measured by Northern and Western blot analyses. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic  (30-1000 microM) significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production in a concentration-dependent manner, but ursodeoxycholic  showed only small inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production that had already been induced by lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma. Ursodeoxycholic  by itself did not affect basal nitric oxide production. Ursodeoxycholic  also suppressed lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma-induced expression of iNOS mRNA and protein. Ursodeoxycholic  had the most potent inhibitory effect among various kinds of bile acids examined, i.e. chenodeoxycholic , , cholic  and conjugated bile acids such as tauroursodeoxycholic . These results suggest that ursodeoxycholic  inhibits the induction of iNOS and then nitric oxide production in aortic and coronary artery smooth muscle cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the cardiovascular protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  under various pathophysiological conditions such as endotoxemia and atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9017991>Protective effect of the intravenous administration of ursodeoxycholic  against  in rats with obstructive jaundice.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of the intravenous administration of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on  in rats with obstructive jaundice from the viewpoint of the biliary excretion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through hepatocytes. In rats with obstructive jaundice, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled LPS was administered via the portal vein and then its biliary excretion was examined. A significant increase in the LPS excretion was thus noticed in UDCA-treated rats at a dose of 0.1 micromol/100 g body wt. per min. In place of UDCA, sodium taurocholate at the same dose also enhanced the biliary excretion of LPS. Secondly, we also examined whether or not UDCA protects against . In this experiment, nonlabeled LPS was administered via the portal vein and its peripheral concentration was then measured. In UDCA-treated rats, the endotoxin concentration was significantly lower. Finally, to elucidate the effect of UDCA on Kupffer cells, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) was measured. But UDCA had no effect on the TNF-alpha level. These findings thus demonstrate that the intravenous administration of UDCA protects against  by enhancing the transport of LPS across the hepatocytes from blood to bile without affecting Kupffer cells, and that this biliary excretion of LPS is dependent on bile acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8743917>Differential effects between tauroursodeoxycholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acids in hepatic fibrosis: an assessment by primary cultured Ito and Kupffer cells from the rat liver.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in cholestasis is still unknown, except for . There is a possibility that the elevation of serum bile acids in cholestasis may play an important role in hepatic fibrogenesis due to a reaction to perisinusoidal cells, such as Ito or Kupffer cells. To assess the effects of bile acids, we investigated the cell proliferation and collagen formation of primary cultured Ito cells that were incubated with a Kupffer cell conditioned medium (KCCM) treated with either taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA) or tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) in short-term (8 h) or long-term (48 h) cultures. KCCM treated with TCDCA (100 mumol/L) but not with TUDCA increased cell proliferation of Ito cells in short-term cultures and also partially elevated collagen formation by Ito cells in long-term cultures. The release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) from Kupffer cells was increased by TCDCA in short-term cultures, but not in long-term cultures. The release of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) from Kupffer cells was increased by TCDCA in long-term cultures, but not in the short-term cultures. TUDCA showed no significant effect on the release of TNF alpha and TGF beta 1 from Kupffer cells. TUDCA or TCDCA itself showed no direct effect on the cell proliferation and collagen formation of Ito cells. In conclusion, these findings are thus considered to show the potentially important role of TCDCA on the development of hepatic fibrosis in the early phase of cholestasis without .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27821667>Obeticholic  Protects against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Fetal Death and Intrauterine Growth Restriction through Its Anti-Inflammatory Activity.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is expressed in human and rodent placentas. Nevertheless, its function remains obscure. This study investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on LPS-induced fetal death and intrauterine growth restriction. All pregnant mice except controls were i.p. injected with LPS (100 μg/kg) daily from gestational day (GD) 15 to GD17. Some pregnant mice were orally administered with OCA (5 mg/kg) daily from GD13 to GD17. As expected, placental FXR signaling was activated by OCA. OCA pretreatment protected against LPS-induced fetal death. In addition, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced reduction of fetal weight and crown-rump length. Additional experiments showed that OCA inhibited LPS-evoked TNF-α in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Moreover, OCA significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of placental proinflammatory genes including Tnf-α, Il-1β, IL-6, Il-12, Mip-2, Kc, and Mcp-1 By contrast, OCA elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and placenta. Further analysis showed that OCA blocked nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits in trophoblast giant cells of the labyrinth zone. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for placental FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory activity.

The colonic ileus and impaired intestinal barrier function that often accompany AHP may predispose to translocation. Sennoside is a naturally occurring cathartic and choleretic agent that stimulates intestinal mucous secretion and has potent promotility effects. The impact of sennoside-induced intestinal motility and secretory function on bacterial translocation and survival was studied in a rat model of AHP. Severe acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by the intraductal infusion of 2% sodium deoxycholate (DCA, 0.4 ml/kg). A group of sham-operated rats (group A) received intraductal saline, whereas experimental animals were subsequently administered distilled water (group B) or sennoside solution (group C) by gavage every 8 h. After 48 h, intestinal transit of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran, serum endotoxin, and amylase levels, and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and pancreatic tissue were determined. The pancreas and intestine were sampled for histologic study. All group A animals survived and did not develop pancreatitis or , whereas groups B and C all demonstrated severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis with evidence of necrosis. Mortality at 48 h was 55% in group B versus 12.5% in group C. Inhibition of intestinal motility was noted in 40% versus 20%, and endotoxin levels were 61.36+/-28.26 pg/L versus 5.41+/-3.58 pg/L in group B versus group C rats, respectively (p<0.001). Pancreatic tissue and MLN cultures were positive in 100% of group B survivors versus 14% of group C survivors (p<0.05). Histologic examination of the intestine in group C animals showed increased mucous secretion, proliferation of goblet cells, and evidence of rapid turnover/renewal of enterocytes. Treatment with the cathartic agent, sennoside, reduced translocation of endotoxin and bacteria, restored intestinal motility, increased mucous secretion, and reduced mortality in a model of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the rat. Other cathartics may have similar properties and may be useful in preventing infectious complications in acute pancreatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354219>Vascular Bed Molecular Profiling by Differential Systemic Decellularization In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Objective- Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key component of several major human diseases, but the molecular basis of this complex disorder has been difficult to determine in vivo. Previous attempts to identify key mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction in experimental models have been limited by the lack of suitable methods for system-wide analyses of vascular bed biology. Here, we aimed to develop a novel method for investigating vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis that enables system-wide analyses of molecular interactions between endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in murine. Approach and Results- We developed a new technique using whole-body differential perfusion with increasing concentrations of detergent buffer to selectively solubilize distinct layers of vascular bed tissue in rodents. When combined with proteomics techniques, our novel approach of differential systemic decellularization in vivo enabled quantitative profiling of vascular beds throughout the body. Initial perfusion with phosphate buffer was used to obtain the endothelial glycocalyx, followed by subsequent extraction of endothelial cell components, and finally by smooth muscle cell constituents with increasing concentrations of detergent. Differential systemic decellularization in vivo has also been successfully applied to characterize molecular events in the vascular bed pathology of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice. Conclusions- Together, these data indicate that differential systemic decellularization in vivo permits system-wide molecular characterization of vascular bed proteomes in rodent models and can be used to advance our current understanding of vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis and progression in a wide range of disease settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6626919>Prevention of postoperative renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice--the role of bile salts.</a></h2><p>Preoperative administration of the simple bile salt sodium deoxycholate has been shown in this study to prevent postoperative  and renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice. Fifty-four per cent of jaundiced patients not given the salt were found to have systemic , associated with renal impairment in two-thirds of the cases. No patient given sodium deoxycholate 500 mg 8 hourly for 48 hours before operation had portal or systemic , and none had evidence of renal impairment (P less than 0 X 02, X2 with Yates' correction). The incidence of  in untreated jaundiced patients was very significantly greater than in non-jaundiced patients undergoing elective upper abdominal surgery (P less than 0 X 005), but this difference is abolished by the prophylactic administration of the oral bile salt. The mechanism of action of bile salts in preventing endotoxin absorption from the small bowel has been investigated, and the lack of any significant alteration in the small bowel microbial flora in obstructive jaundice suggests that a direct effect on the endotoxin molecule is involved. Nearly 20 per cent of patients with obstructive jaundice still develop postoperative renal insufficiency, but preoperative prophylactic use of sodium deoxycholate should reduce this very significantly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190501>Beneficial effects of combined ursodeoxycholic  and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is considered to be effective in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), particularly in combination with other pharmacological agents. UDCA reportedly counteracts the effects of endotoxemia. Previously, we demonstrated attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis and suppression of activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC) with an angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). Here we evaluated the simultaneous effect of both agents on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect of UDCA and ARB was evaluated along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and intestinal barrier function. The direct inhibitory effect of both UDCA and ARB on Ac-HSC was assessed in vitro.Both UDCA and ARB had a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis with suppression of the HSC activation and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TLR4. UDCA decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) disruption induced by the CDAA diet. ARB was found to directly suppress regulation of Ac-HSC.UDCA and ARB have a synergistic repressive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing the activation of Ac-HSC. Because both agents are currently used in clinical practice, combined UDCA and ARB may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8165057>Ursodeoxycholic  modifies gut-derived  in neonatal rats.</a></h2><p>We developed a model for the translocation of intraluminal endotoxin in the neonatal animal and used it to examine the capacity of a nonhepatotoxic bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), to modify endotoxin translocation and cytokine response. Three-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive enterally either no drug, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/animal), or UDCA (400 micrograms/animal) alone, or UDCA followed by LPS 1 h later. One h after LPS administration, the rats were killed and plasma endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were measured. Control animals had low circulating endotoxin (21.2 +/- 7.6 endotoxin units) and TNF (0.06 +/- 0.02 ng/mL). Enteral administration of LPS 1 h before the rats were killed resulted in significant elevation of endotoxin (249.5 +/- 71.3, p = 0.008) and TNF (3.6 +/- 1.3, p = 0.019). UDCA alone did not alter endotoxin levels (8.7 +/- 2.1). UDCA 1 h before LPS prevented the rise in endotoxin (38.9 +/- 11.2 endotoxin units) and TNF (0.2 +/- 0.05) significantly. Chenodeoxycholic  was studied in a similar group of experiments and prevented neither the translocation of LPS nor the development of increased TNF levels in animals receiving LPS. In conclusion, LPS can cross the intestinal barrier in the normal neonatal rat. UDCA, administered before LPS, can decrease the translocation of LPS and prevent the cytokine response as measured by TNF levels. We speculate that UDCA, administered prophylactically, might reduce morbidity in clinical conditions leading to gut-derived .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3527321>A randomized clinical trial of oral ursodeoxycholic  in obstructive jaundice.</a></h2><p>Forty patients with obstructive jaundice (bilirubin greater than 100 mumol/l) were entered into a randomized trial of oral ursodeoxycholic  for 48 h before surgery versus no additional therapy.

The rats with such pancreatitis were orally fed with 10% rhubarb decoction 1.5 ml (treatment group n = 8) or normal saline 1.5 ml (control group n = 9) per 8 hours. Sham operated rats (sham group n = 8) were given intraductal infusion of normal saline 0.4 ml/kg. 48 hours after infusion, the rats were killed for studies of intestinal motility, serum endotoxin and amylase levels as well as bacterial cultures in messentary lymph nodes (MLN) and pancreas tissues. 5 rats died in the control group (5/9) and 1 died in the treatment group (1/8). Remarkable inhibition of gut motility was observed in control group, but gut motility was significantly improved by administration of rhubarb in treatment group. No rat died in the sham group and the rate therein were all free from  or positive cultures. Endotoxin level of control group is much higher (61.36 +/- 28.30 pg/L) than that of treatment group (5.41 +/- 3.58 pg/L), (P < 0.001).

Increasing levels of the primary bile  cholic  (CA) causes a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa and increasing production of the harmful secondary bile   (DCA). During progression of cirrhosis, the microbiome, both through their metabolism, cell wall components (LPS) and translocation lead to .  suppresses synthesis of bile acids in the liver leading to a positive-feedback mechanism. Decrease in bile acids entering the intestines appears to favor overgrowth of pathogenic and pro-inflammatory members of the microbiome including Porphyromonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Decreasing bile  concentration in the colon in cirrhosis is also associated with decreases in Clostridium cluster XIVa, which includes bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria which produce DCA. Rifaximin treatment appears to act by suppressing DCA production, reducing endotoxemia and harmful metabolites without significantly altering microbiome structure. Taken together, the bile  pool size and composition appear to be a major regulator of microbiome structure, which in turn appears to be an important regulator of bile  pool size and composition.
