This is due to differences in the nutritional and metabolic features between yak and other ordinary cattle combined with difficulties associated with farm-based research and a lack of technical guidance. A comprehensive analysis of the composition and alterations in ruminal metabolites is required to advance the development of modern yak husbandry. In the current study, we characterized the effect of feed type on the ruminal fluid  and metabolites in yak using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  and  were the predominant bacterial phyla in the yak rumen. At the genus level, the relative abundance of  and  was significantly ( < 0.01) higher in the forage group compared to that in the concentrate group, while the concentrate group harbored higher proportions of  and . Yak rumen metabolomics analysis combined with enrichment analysis revealed that feed type altered the concentrations of ruminal metabolites as well as the metabolic pattern, and significantly ( < 0.01) affected the concentrations of ruminal metabolites involved in protein digestion and absorption (e.g., L-arginine, ornithine, L-threonine, L-proline and β-alanine), purine metabolism (e.g., xanthine, hypoxanthine, deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine monophosphate) and fatty  biosynthesis (e.g., stearic , myristic  and ). Correlation analysis of the association of microorganisms with metabolite features provides us with a comprehensive understanding of the composition and function of microbial communities. Associations between utilization or production were widely identified between affected  and certain metabolites, and these findings will contribute to the direction of future research in yak.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208088>The effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities in mice.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities using mice as an animal model. Fecal  from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16% Oxygen and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11% Oxygen for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption, energy metabolism,  metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low oxygen had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443847>The impact of dietary sn-2 palmitic triacylglycerols in combination with docosahexaenoic  or  on lipid metabolism and host faecal  composition in Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Sn-2 palmitic  triacylglycerols (sn2PA fat) and polyunsaturated fatty acids are thought to influence the metabolic status and intestinal bacterial population of the host. In this study, the impact of sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA in the diet on lipid metabolism in the liver and faecal  composition were investigated in rats fed diets containing sn2PA fat, 90% sn2PA fat + 10% DHA oil (wt%), or 90% sn2PA fat + 10% ARA oil (wt%). Tissue fatty  composition was measured using gas chromatography (GC), whereas the faecal microbial composition was assessed using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. In addition, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed using ion chromatography. The results showed that sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly reduced liver triacylglyceride (TG) content compared with the sn2PA fat only group. Moreover, the supplementation with sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly promoted the growth of Lactobacillus in the feces at the genus level. On the other hand, the growth of the opportunistic pathogen Desulfovibrio was significantly inhibited by sn2PA fat in combination with ARA compared with the sn2PA fat group. In addition, sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly increased total SCFA concentration in the faeces, suggesting a beneficial effect on host intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051496>Increases in Colonic Bacterial Diversity after ω-3 Fatty  Supplementation Predict Decreased Colonic Prostaglandin E2 Concentrations in Healthy Adults.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  is an important determinant of inflammatory balance in the colon that may affect response to dietary agents.This is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial, the Fish Oil Study, to determine whether interindividual differences in colonic bacteria are associated with variability in the reduction of colonic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) concentrations after personalized supplementation with ω-3 (n-3) fatty acids.Forty-seven healthy adults (17 men, 30 women, ages 26-75 y) provided biopsy samples of colonic mucosa and luminal stool brushings before and after personalized ω-3 fatty  supplementation that was based on blood fatty  responses. Samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The data analyses focused on changes in bacterial community diversity. Linear regression was used to evaluate factors that predict a reduction in colonic PGE2.At baseline, increased bacterial diversity, as measured by the Shannon and Inverse Simpson indexes in both biopsy and luminal brushing samples, was positively correlated with dietary fiber intakes and negatively correlated with fat intakes. Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids increased the Yue and Clayton community dis-similarity index between the  in luminal brushings and colon biopsy samples post-supplementation (P = 0.015). In addition, there was a small group of individuals with relatively high Prevotella abundance who were resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 fatty  supplementation. In linear regression analyses, increases in diversity of the bacteria in the luminal brushing samples, but not in the biopsy samples, were significant predictors of lower colonic PGE2 concentrations post-supplementation in models that included baseline PGE2, baseline body mass index, and changes in colonic eicosapentaenoic -to- ratios. The changes in bacterial diversity contributed to 6-8% of the interindividual variance in change in colonic PGE2 (P = 0.001).Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids had little effect on intestinal bacteria in healthy humans; however, an increase in diversity in the luminal brushings significantly predicted reductions in colonic PGE2.

There are many studies dealing with the influence of lactobacilli on various pathological conditions, and some of the effects are strain-specific. This study was designed to test the effects of a particular Lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68 on fatty  composition of the liver and the brain of C57BL/6 mice in the absence of an underlying pathological condition. Female mice were supplemented with live L. rhamnosus LA68 bacteria for the duration of 1 month. Serum biochemistry was analyzed and liver and brain fatty  composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Significant changes in liver and brain fatty  composition were detected. In the liver tissue we detected an increase in palmitoleic  (p = 0.038), while in the brain compartment we found an increase in palmitic (p = 0.042), stearic (p = 0.017),  (p = 0.009) and docosahexaenoic  (p = 0.004) for control versus experimental group. These results show discrete changes caused by LA68 strain consumption. Even short duration of administration of LA68 influences the fatty  composition of the host which adds to the existing knowledge about Lactobacillus host interaction, and adds to the growing knowledge of metabolic intervention possibilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012235>A safflower oil based high-fat/high-sucrose diet modulates the gut  and liver phospholipid profiles associated with early glucose intolerance in the absence of tissue inflammation.</a></h2><p>Omega-6 (n-6) PUFA-rich diets are generally considered obesogenic in rodents. Here, we examined how long-term intake of a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet based on safflower oil affected metabolism, inflammation, and gut  composition.We fed male C57BL/6J mice a HF/HS diet based on safflower oil-rich in n-6 PUFAs-or a low-fat/low-sucrose diet for 40 wk. Compared to the low-fat/low-sucrose diet, intake of the safflower-based HF/HS diet only led to moderate weight gain, while glucose intolerance developed at week 5 prior to signs of inflammation, but concurrent with increased levels of linoleic  and  in hepatic phospholipids. Intake of the HF/HS diet resulted in early changes in the gut , including an increased abundance of Blautia, while late changes coincided with altered inflammatory profiles and increased fasting plasma insulin. Analysis of immune cells in visceral fat and liver revealed no differences between diets before week 40, where the number of immune cells decreased in the liver of HF/HS-fed mice.We suggest that a diet-dependent increase in the n-6 to omega-3 (n-3) PUFA ratio in hepatic phospholipids together with gut  changes contributed to early development of glucose intolerance without signs of inflammation.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6 fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating -driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut  composition, short-chain fatty acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators, browning process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut  composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory  and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin resistance via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces insulin resistance. Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing , up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte browning and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Our findings formulate recommendations of n-6 fatty acids like AA from dietary intake for obese subjects preferably in a sexually dimorphic way.Copyright © 2017.

Twenty smoker and 10 nonsmoker participants with no significant comorbidities were studied.Viruses that infect bacteria (phages) represented the vast majority of viruses in the lung. Though bacterial communities were statistically indistinguishable across smokers and nonsmokers as observed in previous studies, lung viromes and metabolic profiles were significantly different between groups. Statistical analyses revealed that changes in viral communities correlate most with changes in levels of  and IL-8, both potentially relevant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis based on prior studies.Our assessment of human lung DNA viral communities reveals that commensal viruses are present in the lower respiratory tract and differ between smokers and nonsmokers. The associations between viral populations and local immune and metabolic tone suggest a significant role for virome-host interaction in smoking related lung disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905346>Roles of secreted phospholipase A group IIA in inflammation and host defense.</a></h2><p>Among all members of the secreted phospholipase A (sPLA) family, group IIA sPLA (sPLA-IIA) is possibly the most studied enzyme. Since its discovery, many names have been associated with sPLA-IIA, such as "non-pancreatic", "synovial", "platelet-type", "inflammatory", and "bactericidal" sPLA Whereas the different designations indicate comprehensive functions or sources proposed for this enzyme, the identification of the precise roles of sPLA-IIA has remained a challenge. This can be attributed to: the expression of the enzyme by various cells of different lineages, its limited activity towards the membranes of immune cells despite its expression following common inflammatory stimuli, its ability to interact with certain proteins independently of its catalytic activity, and its absence from multiple commonly used mouse models. Nevertheless, elevated levels of the enzyme during inflammatory processes and associated consistent release of  from the membrane of extracellular vesicles suggest that sPLA-IIA may contribute to inflammation by using endogenous substrates in the extracellular milieu. Moreover, the remarkable potency of sPLA-IIA towards bacterial membranes and its induced expression during the course of infections point to a role for this enzyme in the defense of the host against invading pathogens. In this review, we present current knowledge related to mammalian sPLA-IIA and its roles in sterile inflammation and host defense.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs), mainly synthesized in eosinophils, are a class of inflammatory lipid mediators produced via multiple enzymatic reactions from . Multiple clinical studies have reported dysregulated fatty  metabolism in severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanism responsible for this metabolic abnormality has attracted a lot of attention. In eosinophils, various stimuli (including cytokines, chemokines, and pathogen-derived factors) prime and/or induce leukotriene generation and secretion. Cell-cell interactions with component cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts) also enhance this machinery to augment allergic responses. Nasal polyp-derived eosinophils from patients with eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present a characteristic fatty  metabolism with selectively higher production of leukotriene D. Interestingly, type 2 cytokines and microbiome components might be responsible for this metabolic change with altered enzyme expression. Here, we review the regulation of fatty  metabolism, especially cys-LT metabolism, in human eosinophils toward allergic inflammatory status.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society of Allergology.

The variables measured were fasting blood glucose and insulin levels; glucose tolerance; diacylglycerols as intracellular mediators of insulin resistance in adipose tissue (AT), liver, and muscle; inflammation markers (plasma IL-6 and leptin, and liver and AT histology markers); eicosanoids from  as lipid mediators of inflammation; and the populations of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Enterobacteriales, and Bifidobacteriales in feces. It was found that d-fagomine reduces fat-induced impaired glucose tolerance, inflammation markers, and mediators (hepatic microgranulomas and lobular inflammation, plasma IL-6, prostaglandin E , and leukotriene B ) while attenuating the changes in the populations of Enterobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales.d-Fagomine delays the development of a fat-induced prediabetic state in rats by reducing low-grade inflammation. We suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of d-fagomine may be linked to a reduction in fat-induced overpopulation of minor gut bacteria.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) are pivotal in brain and visual development. It is of interest to investigate whether and how specific pregnancy conditions, which alter fatty  metabolism (excessive pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain (GWG)), affect lipid supply to the foetus. For this purpose, we evaluated the erythrocyte FAs of mothers and offspring (cord-blood) at birth, in relation to pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. A total of 435 mothers and their offspring (237 males, 51%) were included in the study. Distribution of linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA), and their metabolites, , dihomogamma linoleic (DGLA) and ecosapentanoic , was significantly different in maternal and foetal erythrocytes. Pre-pregnancy BMI was significantly associated with maternal percentage of MUFAs (Coeff: -0.112; p = 0.021), LA (Coeff: -0.033; p = 0.044) and DHA (Coeff. = 0.055; p = 0.0016); inadequate GWG with DPA (Coeff: 0.637; p = 0.001); excessive GWG with docosaexahenoic  (DHA) (Coeff. = -0.714; p = 0.004). Moreover, pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with foetus percentage of PUFAs (Coeff: -0.172; p = 0.009), omega 6 (Coeff: -0.098; p = 0.015) and DHA (Coeff: -0.0285; p = 0.036), even after adjusting for maternal lipids.

Increased consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) that is abundant in Western diet contributes to obesity and related diseases. Although gut--related metabolic pathways of dietary PUFAs were recently elucidated, the effects on host physiological function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that gut  confers host resistance to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by modulating dietary PUFAs metabolism. Supplementation of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), an initial linoleic -related gut-microbial metabolite, attenuates HFD-induced obesity in mice without eliciting -mediated adipose inflammation and by improving metabolic condition via free fatty  receptors. Moreover, Lactobacillus-colonized mice show similar effects with elevated HYA levels. Our findings illustrate the interplay between gut  and host energy metabolism via the metabolites of dietary omega-6-FAs thereby shedding light on the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders by targeting gut microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746679>Abnormal fatty acids in Canadian children with autism.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are critical for pediatric neurodevelopment and are abnormal in autism, although prior studies have demonstrated conflicting results and methodological differences. To our knowledge, there are no published data on fatty  in Canadian children with autism. The aim of this study was to investigate red blood cell and serum fatty  status to identify whether abnormalities exist in Canadian children with autism, and to enhance future cross-study comparison.Eleven Canadian children with autism (3 girls, 8 boys; age 3.05 ± 0.79 y) and 15 controls (9 girls, 6 boys; age 3.87 ± 1.06 y) met inclusion criteria, which included prior Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, no recent medication or supplements, no specialty diets, and no recent illness.The children with autism demonstrated lower red blood cell docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.0003), eicosapentaenoic  (P < 0.03),  (P < 0.002), and ω-3/ω-6 ratios (P < 0.001). They also demonstrated lower serum docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.02),  (P < 0.05), and linoleic  (P < 0.02) levels.Fatty acids in both serum and red blood cells were abnormal in this small group of Canadian children with autism than in controls, underlining a need for larger age- and sex-matched investigations in this community. A potential role for fatty  abnormalities within the complex epigenetic etiology of autism is proposed in relation to emerging understanding of relationships between cobalamin metabolism, gut , and propionic  production.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a combination of the pyrosequencing and the mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques were used to investigate the effects of a raw potato starch (RPS, high in resistant starch) diet on microbial composition and microbial metabolites in the hindgut of pig. The results showed that Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter increased significantly, while Sarcina and Clostridium decreased in relative abundances in the hindgut of pigs fed RPS. The metabolimic analysis revealed that RPS significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolites, amino  turnover or protein biosynthesis, lipid metabolites, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, a Pearson's correlation analysis showed that Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate, maltose, , 9, 12-octadecadienoic , oleic , phosphate, but negatively correlated with α-aminobutyric . However, the correlation of Clostridium and Sarcina with these compounds was in the opposite direction. The results suggest that RPS not only alters the composition of the gut microbial community but also modulates the metabolic pathway of microbial metabolism, which may further affect the hindgut health of the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089111>The molecular landscape of colitis-associated carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>In spite of the well-established histopathological phenotyping of IBD-associated preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, their molecular landscape remains to be fully elucidated. Several studies have pinpointed the initiating role of longstanding/relapsing inflammatory insult on the intestinal mucosa, with the activation of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ), chemokines and metabolites of  resulting in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB. Longstanding inflammation may also modify the intestinal , prompting the overgrowth of genotoxic microorganisms, which may act as further cancer promoters. Most of the molecular dysregulation occurring in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis is documented in colitis-associated adenocarcinoma too, but marked differences have been established in both their timing and prevalence. Unlike sporadic cancers, TP53 alterations occur early in IBD-related carcinogenesis, while APC dysregulation emerges mainly in the most advanced stages of the oncogenic cascade. From the therapeutic standpoint, colitis-associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, are significantly involved in colitis-associated cancer development and progression. The focus now is on identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, with a view to ultimately designing patient-tailored therapies.Copyright © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral insulin resistance secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to β cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut , bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated insulin production by pancreatic β cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as , eicosapentaneoic , and docosahexaenoic  (which are unsaturated fatty acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut  that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic β cells, gut, liver, and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913299>Identification of diagnostic biomarkers and metabolic pathway shifts of heat-stressed lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Controlling heat stress (HS) is a global challenge for the dairy industry. However, simple and reliable biomarkers that aid the diagnoses of HS-induced metabolic disorders have not yet been identified. In this work, an integrated metabolomic and lipidomic approach using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra-fast LC-MS was employed to investigate the discrimination of plasma metabolic profiles between HS-free and HS lactating dairy cows. Targeted detection using LC-MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to verify the reliability of the metabolites as biomarker candidates. Overall, 41 metabolites were identified as candidates for lactating dairy cows exposed to HS, among which 13 metabolites, including trimethylamine, glucose, lactate, betaine, creatine, pyruvate, acetoacetate, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, C16 sphinganine, lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), phosphatidylcholine (16:0/14:0), and , had high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing HS status, and are likely to be the potential biomarkers of HS dairy cows. All of these potentially diagnostic biomarkers were involved in carbohydrate, amino , lipid, or gut microbiome-derived metabolism, indicating that HS affected the metabolic pathways in lactating dairy cows. Further research is warranted to evaluate these biomarkers in practical applications and to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of HS-induced metabolic disorders.Heat stress (HS) annually causes huge losses to global dairy industry, including animal performance decrease, metabolic disorder and health problem. So far, physiological mechanisms underlying HS of dairy cows still remain elusive. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to elucidate the HS-induced metabolic disorders of dairy cows using integrated (1)H NMR and LC-MS-based metabolic study. The results not only provided potential diagnostic biomarkers for HS lactating dairy cows, but also significantly explored the related physiological mechanisms of metabolic pathway shifts induced by HS environment. This work offers comprehensive insights into the global metabolic alterations of dairy cows exposed to HS and provides a new perspective for further study.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut  and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut  and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009873>A systemic combined nontargeted and targeted LC-MS based metabolomic strategy of plasma and liver on pathology exploration of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate induced cholestatic liver injury in mice.</a></h2><p>The pathology of cholestatic liver injury (CLI) was complicated, which has limited the development of anti-cholestatic drugs for a long period. Metabolomic researches focused on global and dynamic changes of the organism could shed some light on mechanism investigation. In order to characterize and validate metabolite alterations of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) induced CLI in C57BL/6 mice, a systemic metabolomic approach combining nontargeted HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and targeted UFLC-ESI-MS/MS technologies were developed innovatively. Multivariate data analysis was applied to determine the changes of metabolites in processed plasma and liver samples between control and model groups. Afterwards, 38 potential plasma biomarkers and 17 potential liver biomarkers involved in bile  (BA) biosynthesis, phospholipid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, alpha linolenic  and linoleic  metabolism, as well as  metabolism were found and attributed as potential biomarkers and influential pathways of cholestasis. Based on correlation analysis, BA biosynthesis played the most important role in ANIT induced CLI, thereinto, major BAs were carried out with quantitative analysis. Targeted metabolomic results showed that the increase of BAs might have an impact on intestinal microbial ecology which could aggravate liver injury probably, among which cholic  (CA) and taurocholic  (TCA) were the most sensitive indicators of ANIT induced CLI in both plasma and liver. In conclusion, CLI might correlate significantly with hepatocyte necrosis, metabolic disorders and imbalance of intestinal  ecology triggered by BA accumulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Sham-operated, AMI model (left anterior descending coronary artery ligation) and QSYQ-treated group. Cardiac tissues were obtained for analysing digital gene expression. Sequencing and transcriptome analyses were performed collaboratively, including analyses of differential gene expression, gene co-expression network, targeted attack on network and functional grouping. In this study, a new strategy known as keystone gene-based group significance analysis was also developed.  Analysis of top keystone QSYQ-regulated genes indicated that QSYQ ameliorated ventricular remodeling (VR), which is an irreversible process in the pathophysiology of AMI. At pathway level, both well-known cardiovascular diseases and cardiac signaling pathways were enriched. The most remarkable finding was the novel therapeutic effects identified from functional group analysis. This included anti-inflammatory effects mediated via suppression of  lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway and elevation of nitric oxide (NO); and amelioration of dyslipidaemia mediated via fatty  oxidation. The regulatory patterns of QSYQ on key genes were confirmed by western blot, immunohistochemistry analysis and measurement of plasma lipids, which further validated the therapeutic effects of QSYQ proposed in this study.  QSYQ exerts multipronged therapeutic effects on AMI, by concurrently alleviating VR progression, attenuating inflammation induced by  LOX pathway and NO production; and ameliorating dyslipidaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513935>Dysbiotic Subgingival Microbial Communities in Periodontally Healthy Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Studies that demonstrate an association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and dysbiotic oral microbiomes are often confounded by the presence of extensive periodontitis in these individuals. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of RA in modulating the periodontal microbiome by comparing periodontally healthy individuals with RA to those without RA.Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy individuals (22 with RA and 19 without RA), and the 16S gene was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial biodiversity and co-occurrence patterns were examined using the QIIME and PhyloToAST pipelines.The subgingival microbiomes differed significantly between patients with RA and controls based on both community membership and the abundance of lineages, with 41.9% of the community differing in abundance and 19% in membership. In contrast to the sparse and predominantly congeneric co-occurrence networks seen in controls, RA patients revealed a highly connected grid containing a large intergeneric hub anchored by known periodontal pathogens. Predictive metagenomic analysis (PICRUSt) demonstrated that  and ester lipid metabolism pathways might partly explain the robustness of this clustering. As expected from a periodontally healthy cohort, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were not significantly different between groups; however, Cryptobacterium curtum, another organism capable of producing large amounts of citrulline, emerged as a robust discriminant of the microbiome in individuals with RA.Our data demonstrate that the oral microbiome in RA is enriched for inflammophilic and citrulline-producing organisms, which may play a role in the production of autoantigenic citrullinated peptides in RA.© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951525>A randomised trial of the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  supplements on the human intestinal .</a></h2><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anticolorectal cancer (CRC) activity. The intestinal  has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary omega-3 PUFAs alter the mouse intestinal microbiome compatible with antineoplastic activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplements on the faecal microbiome in middle-aged, healthy volunteers (n=22).A randomised, open-label, cross-over trial of 8 weeks' treatment with 4 g mixed eicosapentaenoic /docosahexaenoic  in two formulations (soft-gel capsules and Smartfish drinks), separated by a 12-week 'washout' period. Faecal samples were collected at five time-points for microbiome analysis by 16S ribosomal RNA PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty  analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty  content, except that drinks were associated with a larger, and more prolonged, decrease in omega-6 PUFA  than the capsule intervention (p=0.02). There were no significant changes in α or β diversity, or phyla composition, associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation. However, a reversible increased abundance of several genera, including ,  and  was observed with one or both omega-3 PUFA interventions. Microbiome changes did not correlate with RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation or development of omega-3 PUFA-induced diarrhoea. There were no treatment order effects.Omega-3 PUFA supplementation induces a reversible increase in several short-chain fatty -producing bacteria, independently of the method of administration.

It is not clear which mechanisms explain how ETWB feeding affects hepatic metabolism, but factors (i.e., xenometabolites) associated with specific microbes may be involved.The objective of this study was to characterize ETWB-driven shifts in the cecal microbiome and to identify correlates between microbial changes and diet-related differences in liver metabolism in diet-induced obese mice that typically display steatosis.Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a 45%-lard-based fat diet supplemented with ETWB (20% wt:wt) or rapidly digestible starch (control) (n = 15/group) for 10 wk were characterized by using a multi-omics approach. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify variables that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups.Body weight and liver TGs were decreased by ETWB feeding (by 10% and 25%, respectively; P < 0.001), and an index of liver reactive oxygen species was increased (by 29%; P < 0.01). The cecal microbiome showed an increase in Bacteroidetes (by 42%; P < 0.05) and a decrease in Firmicutes (by 16%; P < 0.05). Metabolites that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups included decreased liver antioxidants (glutathione and α-tocopherol); decreased liver carbohydrate metabolites, including glucose; lower hepatic ; and increased liver and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. Liver transcriptomics revealed key metabolic pathways affected by ETWB, especially those related to lipid metabolism and some fed- or fasting-regulated genes.Together, these changes indicate that dietary fibers such as ETWB regulate hepatic metabolism concurrently with specific gut bacteria community shifts in C57BL/6J mice. It is proposed that these changes may elicit gut-derived signals that reach the liver via enterohepatic circulation, ultimately affecting host liver metabolism in a manner that mimics, in part, the fasting state.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245669>Differences in the Gut  Establishment and Metabolome Characteristics Between Low- and Normal-Birth-Weight Piglets During Early-Life.</a></h2><p>Low-birth-weight (LBW) piglets are at a high-risk for postnatal growth failure, mortality, and metabolic disorders later in life. Early-life microbial exposure is a potentially effective intervention strategy for modulating the health and metabolism of the host. Yet, it has not been well elucidated whether the gut  development in LBW piglets is different from their normal littermates and its possible association with metabolite profiles. In the current study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics was used to investigate differences in the fecal  and metabolites between LBW and normal piglets during early-life, including day 3 (D3), 7 (D7), 14 (D14), 21 (D21, before weaning), and 35 (D35, after birth). Compared to their normal littermates, LBW piglets harbored low proportions of  on D3,  on D7, , , and  on D21, as well as  on D21 and D35. However, the abundance of  on D7 and D21,  on D14 and D35,  and  on D14 and D21, and  on D21 was significantly higher in LBW piglets when compared with normal piglets. The results of the metabolomics analysis suggested that LBW significantly affected fecal metabolites involved in fatty  metabolism (e.g., linoleic , α-linolenic , and ), amino  metabolism (e.g., valine, phenylalanine, and glutamic ), as well as bile  biosynthesis (e.g., glycocholic , 25-hydroxycholesterol, and chenodeoxycholic ). Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant negative association between  and N1-acetylspermine on D7,  and linoleic  on D14,  and chenodeoxycholic  on D21, and  and phenylalanine on D35, respectively. Collectively, LBW piglets have a different gut bacterial community structure when compared with normal-birth-weight (NBW) piglets during early-life, especially from 7 to 21 days of age. Also, a distinctive metabolic status in LBW piglets might be partly associated with the altered intestinal . These findings may further elucidate the factors potentially associated with the impaired growth and development of LBW piglets and facilitate the development of nutritional interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349441>Association between sn-2 fatty  profiles of breast milk and development of the infant intestinal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that host diet and gut microbes are related. Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%), oleic  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C,  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period. The above results provided important information for designing the configuration of FAs in next-generation formulas for Chinese infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570689>Association between Maternal and Foetal Erythrocyte Fatty  Profiles and Birth Weight.</a></h2><p>Regular foetal development is crucial for assuring good health status in the offspring. The quality and quantity of maternal dietary fatty acids (FAs) can affect growth. The study aimed to: (1) investigate the association of maternal/foetal lipid profiles with birth weight (BW); and (2) compare these profiles in small, appropriate, and large for gestational age (SGA, AGA, and LGA) infants. FAs were measured in erythrocyte membranes using gas chromatography analysis in 607 mother-infant pairs (316 males, 52.1%). In the quantile regression, a significant association between BW and levels of maternal linoleic  (LA; C18:2, n-6; coefficient: 18.66;  = 0.010),  (AA; C20:4, n-6; coefficient: 11.35;  = 0.007), docosahexaenoic  (DHA; C22:6, n-3; coefficient: 29.73;  = 0.007), polyunsaturated FAs (coefficient: 8.55;  = 0.001), foetal DHA (coefficient: -22.82;  = 0.037), and saturated FAs (coefficient: -65.41;  = 0.002) was found. Myristic (C14:0) and pentadecanoic acids (C15:0), both maternal ( = 0.000;  = 0.017) and foetal ( = 0.009;  = 0.002), and maternal erucic  (C22:1, n-9;  = 0.026) were found at higher levels in SGA infants as compared to AGA ones. Conversely, maternal LA, AA, and omega 6 FAs levels were higher in AGA infants ( = 0.037;  = 0.003;  = 0.026, respectively). Maternal and foetal polyunsaturated and omega 6 FAs levels are positively related to BW, while a lipid profile rich in saturated FAs and erucic  may influence the risk of SGA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598081>Gut microbiome changes in overweight male adults following bowel preparation.</a></h2><p>Human gut microbiome has an essential role in human health and disease. Although the major dominant  within individuals have been reported, the change of gut microbiome caused by external factors, such as antibiotic use and bowel cleansing, remains unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the change of gut microbiome in overweight male adults after bowel preparation, where none of the participants had been diagnosed with any systemic diseases.A total of 20 overweight, male Taiwanese adults were recruited, and all participants were omnivorous. The participants provided fecal samples and blood samples at three time points: prior to bowel preparation, 7 days after colonoscopy, and 28 days after colonoscopy. The  composition in fecal samples was analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene amplicon sequencing.Our results demonstrated that the relative abundance of the most dominant bacteria hardly changed from prior to bowel preparation to 28 days after colonoscopy. Using the ratio of Prevotella to the sum of Prevotella and Bacteroides in the fecal samples at baseline, the participants were separated into two groups. The fecal samples of the Type 1 group was Bacteroides-dominant, and that of the Type 2 group was Prevotella-dominant with a noticeable presence Bacteroides. Bulleidia appears more in the Type 1 fecal samples, while Akkermensia appears more in the Type 2 fecal samples. Of each type, the gut microbial diversity differed slightly among the three collection times. Additionally, the Type 2 fecal  was temporarily susceptible to bowel cleansing. Predictive functional analysis of microbial community reveals that their activities for the mineral absorption metabolism and  metabolism differed significantly between the two types. Depending on their fecal type, the variance of triglycerides and C-reactive protein also differed between the two types of participants.Depending upon the fecal type, the microbial diversity and the predictive functional modules of microbial community differed significantly after bowel preparation. In addition, blood biochemical markers presented somewhat associated with fecal type. Therefore, our results might provide some insights as to how knowledge of the microbial community could be used to promote health through personalized clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662340>Lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes through JAK/STAT and AMPK-regulated cPLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes played important roles in the development of adipose tissue and contributed much to the processes of obesity. On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a key outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria in the gut , and has a dominant role in linking inflammation to high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of inflammation regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes. In addition, LPS-increased DNA synthesis, cell numbers and cell viability of preadipocytes were attenuated by AACOCF3, AG490, BML-275, cPLA2 siRNA, JAK2 siRNA or AMPK siRNA. Attenuation JAK2/STAT or AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression reduced LPS-mediated adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Stimulation of  or AMPK activator, A-769662, increased cell numbers and cell viability and promoted differentiation of preadipocytes. Collectively, these results indicated that LPS increased preadipocytes proliferation and adipogenesis via JAK/STAT and AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression. The mechanisms of LPS-stimulated cPLA2 expression may be a link between bacteria and obesity and provides the molecular basis for preventing metabolic syndrome or hyperplasic obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052232>Different functional genes of upper airway microbiome associated with natural course of childhood asthma.</a></h2><p>Microbial colonization of the airway plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma; however, the effect of the upper airway microbiome on childhood asthma is not fully understood. We analyzed the metagenome of airway microbiome to understand the associated role of upper airway microbiome with the natural course of childhood asthma.Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with asthma, those in asthma remission, and control groups. High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the structure and functional dynamics of the airway microbiome with respect to asthma phenotypes.The composition of  differed among healthy control, asthma, and remission groups. The relative abundance of Streptococcus was negatively associated with FEV predicted (P = .023) and that of Staphylococcus was negatively associated with methacholine PC (P = .013). Genes related to  metabolites, lysine residues, and glycosaminoglycans in the microbiome could be associated with airway inflammation. In particular, genes related to synthesis of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E (PGE ) were not detected from the airway microbiome in the asthma group.These data suggest that alterations in the composition and function of the upper airway microbiome could be related with the natural course of asthma in children.© 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Gut  linked compounds such as short chain fatty acids, bile acids, choline metabolites, indole derivatives, vitamins, polyamines, lipids, neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones have many biological functions. This review focuses on the gut  and host metabolism in liver cirrhosis. Dysbiosis in liver cirrhosis causes serious complications, such as bacteremia and hepatic encephalopathy, accompanied by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability. Gut dysbiosis in cirrhosis and intervention with probiotics and synbiotics in a clinical setting is reviewed and evaluated. Recent studies have revealed the relationship between gut  and host metabolism in chronic metabolic liver disease, especially, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and with the gut  metabolic interactions in dysbiosis related metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recently, our understanding of the relationship between the gut and liver and how this regulates systemic metabolic changes in liver cirrhosis has increased. The serum lipid levels of phospholipids, free fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially, eicosapentaenoic , , and docosahexaenoic  have significant correlations with specific fecal flora in liver cirrhosis. Many clinical and experimental reports support the relationship between fatty  metabolism and gut-. Various blood metabolome such as cytokines, amino acids, and vitamins are correlated with gut  in probiotics-treated liver cirrhosis patients. The future evaluation of the gut--liver metabolic network and the intervention of these relationships using probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics, with sufficient nutrition could aid the development of treatments and prevention for liver cirrhosis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505038>Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition protects from liver injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) is the last enzymatic step in triglyceride degradation, hydrolyzing monoglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids (FA) and converting 2-arachidonoylglycerol into  (AA), thus providing ligands for nuclear receptors (NRs) as key regulators of hepatic bile  (BA)/lipid metabolism and inflammation. We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry, liver histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal  were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and inflammation with reduced serum liver enzymes, increased FA/BA metabolism and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous liver injury, with improved liver enzymes, inflammation and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel metabolic target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

The complex cross-kingdom interactions are not well understood.A cross-sectional analysis identified conserved microbial signatures positively or negatively associated with STH infections across Liberia and Indonesia, and longitudinal samples analysis from a double-blind randomized trial showed that the gut  responds to deworming but does not transition closer to the uninfected state. The microbiomes of individuals able to self-clear the infection had more alike microbiome assemblages compared to individuals who remained infected. One bacterial taxon (Lachnospiracae) was negatively associated with infection in both countries, and 12 bacterial taxa were significantly associated with STH infection in both countries, including Olsenella (associated with reduced gut inflammation), which also significantly reduced in abundance following clearance of infection. Microbial community gene abundances were also affected by deworming. Functional categories identified as associated with STH infection included  metabolism;  is the precursor for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes that threaten helminth survival, and our findings suggest that some modulation of  activity in the STH-infected gut may occur through the increase of  metabolizing bacteria.For the first time, we identify specific members of the gut microbiome that discriminate between moderately/heavily STH-infected and non-infected states across very diverse geographical regions using two different statistical methods. We also identify microbiome-encoded biological functions associated with the STH infections, which are associated potentially with STH survival strategies, and changes in the host environment. These results provide a novel insight of the cross-kingdom interactions in the human gut ecosystem by unlocking the microbiome assemblages at taxonomic, genetic, and functional levels so that advances towards key mechanistic studies can be made.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782617>Effects of dietary fat on gut  and faecal metabolites, and their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors: a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut  and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate.In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20% energy), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30% energy) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut , faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated.The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of  (p=0.007) and  (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased  (p=0.04),  (p<0.001) and decreased  (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher-fat diet group in comparison with the other groups (p<0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in  and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention.Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut , faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.; Results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut , which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To date, no microbiome studies have been performed in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 2 (MODY2), a monogenic cause of diabetes. Gut  of type 1 diabetes, MODY2, and healthy control subjects was compared.This was a case-control study in 15 children with type 1 diabetes, 15 children with MODY2, and 13 healthy children. Metabolic control and potential factors modifying gut  were controlled. Microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing.Compared with healthy control subjects, type 1 diabetes was associated with a significantly lower  diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of , , , , and  genera, and a lower relative abundance of , , , and . Children with MODY2 showed a significantly higher  abundance and a lower  and  abundance. Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides were increased in type 1 diabetes, and gut permeability (determined by zonulin levels) was significantly increased in type 1 diabetes and MODY2. The PICRUSt analysis found an increment of genes related to lipid and amino  metabolism, ABC transport, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis,  metabolism, antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine signaling pathways in type 1 diabetes.Gut  in type 1 diabetes differs at taxonomic and functional levels not only in comparison with healthy subjects but fundamentally with regard to a model of nonautoimmune diabetes. Future longitudinal studies should be aimed at evaluating if the modulation of gut  in patients with a high risk of type 1 diabetes could modify the natural history of this autoimmune disease.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h2><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital  to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital . Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10),  and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty  metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p></html>
