We previously identified indole OXE-R antagonists that block 5-oxo-ETE-induced primate eosinophil activation. Although these compounds possess good oral absorption, their plasma levels decline rapidly due to extensive oxidation of their hexyl side chain. We have now succeeded in dramatically increasing antagonist potency and resistance to metabolism by replacing the hexyl group with phenylpentyl or phenylhexyl side chains. Compared with our previous lead compound S-230, our most potent antagonist, S-C025, has an IC (120 pM) over 80 times lower and a substantially longer plasma half-life. A single major metabolite, which retains antagonist activity (IC, 690 pM) and has a prolonged lifetime in plasma was observed. These new highly potent OXE-R antagonists may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of eosinophilic disorders like asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15801029>Leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis pathways in osteoarthritic synovial membranes: regulating factors for interleukin 1beta synthesis.</a></h2><p>To study the mechanisms responsible for the cross-talk between lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways in human osteoarthritic (OA) synovial explants, and to confirm the  (AA) shunting phenomenon and its influence on interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) synthesis.Synovial membrane explants were cultured in the absence or presence of different drugs that inhibit COX and/or LOX activities. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and IL-1beta were measured.When membrane explants were incubated with naproxen (COX inhibitor) under unstimulated conditions, the production of LTB4 was dose-dependently enhanced, reaching a 5-fold increase over the control. This shunt could be partially reversed by the addition of exogenous PGE2. Under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, both licofelone (COX/LOX inhibitor) at therapeutic concentrations and NDGA (LOX inhibitor) inhibited LTB4 production, whereas naproxen did not amplify the LPS-induced LTB4 production. Conversely, using NDGA, it was found that a shunt of AA from the LOX to the COX pathway did not occur. Under LPS conditions, both naproxen and licofelone inhibited LXA4, inducing an increase in the LTB4/LXA4 ratio with naproxen treatment but not with licofelone. Under these conditions, naproxen treatment induced a higher level of IL-1beta production.We demonstrated in OA synovium that a shunt from AA to the LOX pathway occurred and that treatment with a nonselective COX inhibitor could increase the production of LTB4 and secondarily the synthesis of IL-1beta. Therefore treatment with licofelone, which can act on both COX and LOX pathways, may have some interesting properties in the treatment of OA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323520>Aryl-acetic and cinnamic  as lipoxygenase inhibitors with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activity.</a></h2><p>Cinnamic  have been identified as interesting compounds with cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Lipoxygenase pathway, catalyzing the first two steps of the transformation of  into leukotrienes is implicated in several processes such as cell differentiation, inflammation and carcinogenesis. Development of drugs that interfere with the formation or effects of these metabolites would be important for the treatment of various diseases like asthma, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and blood vessel disorders. Till now, asthma consists of the only pathological case in which improvement has been shown by lipoxygenase LO inhibitors. Thus, the research has been directed towards the development of drugs that interfere with the formation of leukotrienes. In order to explore the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of antioxidant acrylic/cinnamic  a series of derivatives bearing the appropriate moieties have been synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation and evaluated for their biological activities. The compounds have shown important antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity and very good inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase while some of them were tested for their anticancer activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041123>Valnoctamide, a non-teratogenic amide derivative of valproic , inhibits  activation in vitro by recombinant acyl-CoA synthetase-4.</a></h2><p>Valproic  (VPA), a mood stabilizer used for treating bipolar disorder (BD), uncompetitively inhibits acylation of  (AA) by recombinant AA-selective acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (Acsl4) at an enzyme inhibition constant (Ki ) of 25 mM. Inhibition may account for VPA's ability to reduce AA turnover in brain phospholipids of unanesthetized rats and to be therapeutic in BD. However, VPA is teratogenic. We tested whether valnoctamide (VCD), a non-teratogenic amide derivative of a VPA chiral isomer, which had antimanic potency in a phase III BD trial, also inhibits recombinant Acsl4.Rat Acsl4-flag protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. We used Michaelis-Menten kinetics to characterize and quantify the ability of VCD to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by recombinant Acsl4 in vitro.Acsl4-mediated activation of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 was inhibited uncompetitively by VCD, with a Ki of 6.38 mM.VCD's ability to uncompetitively inhibit AA activation to AA-CoA by Acsl4, at a lower Ki than VPA, suggests that, like VPA, VCD may reduce AA turnover in rat brain phospholipids. If so, VCD and other non-teratogenic Acsl4 inhibitors might be considered further for treating BD.Published 2014.

Roxb. fruits inhibits proinflammatory mediators via down regulating nuclear factor-κB in LPS stimulated Raw 264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammation has been considered as a major risk factor for various kinds of human diseases. Macrophages play substantial roles in host defense against infection. It can be activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The current study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl acetate fraction isolated from T. bellerica (EFTB) in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines. The inhibitory effects of EFTB on total cyclooxygenase (COX), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity, nitrate and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were studied. The gene level expression of COX-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were also studied in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. EFTB (100μg/mL) inhibited all inflammatory markers in dose dependent manner. Moreover, EFTB down regulated the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, COX-2 and NF-κB against LPS stimulation. Our results demonstrated that EFTB is able to attenuate inflammatory response possibly via suppression of ROS and NO species, inhibiting the production of  metabolites, proinflammatory mediators and cytokines release.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Understanding how cell death in this self-renewing tissue is regulated and how it is influenced by interaction of specific dietary components, especially fat and fibre, could lead to improved treatment and prevention strategies for cancer.The effects of two types of polyunsaturated   (PUFAs)-- (AA, 20:4, n-6) or docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6, n-3)--on the response of human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells to sodium butyrate (NaBt) were investigated.The parameters reflecting cell proliferation and cell death were studied together with oxidative response, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and changes of selected regulatory molecules associated with cell cycle (p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1/WAF1)) and apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase--PARP, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak,Mcl-1).We demonstrated that pre-treatment with either AA or DHA attenuated cell cycle arrest caused by NaBt which is associated with modulation of p27(Kip1), but not p21(Cip1/WAF1) protein expression. On the other hand, PUFAs sensitised HT-29 cells to NaBt-induced apoptosis. An increased amount of floating cells and cells in the subG(0)/G(1) population was associated with increased reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, decrease of MMP, activation of caspase-3 and -9, PARP cleavage, and decrease in the expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. The observed effects were modulated by the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and partially reversed by the antioxidant Trolox.PUFAs may have beneficial effects in the colon enhancing apoptosis induced by NaBt. Alteration of cell membrane lipid composition and potentiation of oxidative processes accompanied by changes in mitochondria followed by stimulation of apoptotic cascade components play a role in these effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23741342>  synthase is a key target in multiple essential tumor functions of prostate cancer: uptake of radiolabeled acetate as a predictor of the targeted therapy outcome.</a></h2><p>  synthase (FASN) expression is elevated in several cancers, and this over-expression is associated with poor prognosis. Inhibitors of FASN, such as orlistat, reportedly show antitumor effects against cancers that over-express FASN, making FASN a promising therapeutic target. However, large variations in FASN expression levels in individual tumors have been observed, and methods to predict FASN-targeted therapy outcome before treatment are required to avoid unnecessary treatment. In addition, how FASN inhibition affects tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we showed the method to predict FASN-targeted therapy outcome using radiolabeled acetate uptake and presented mechanisms of FASN inhibition with human prostate cancer cell lines, to provide the treatment strategy of FASN-targeted therapy. We revealed that tumor uptake of radiolabeled acetate reflected the FASN expression levels and sensitivity to FASN-targeted therapy with orlistat in vitro and in vivo. FASN-targeted therapy was noticeably effective against tumors with high FASN expression, which was indicated by high acetate uptake. To examine mechanisms, we established FASN knockdown prostate cancer cells by transduction of short-hairpin RNA against FASN and investigated the characteristics by analyses on morphology and cell behavior and microarray-based gene expression profiling. FASN inhibition not only suppressed cell proliferation but prevented pseudopodia formation and suppressed cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. FASN inhibition also suppressed genes involved in production of intracellular second messenger  and androgen hormones, both of which promote tumor progression. Collectively, our data demonstrated that uptake of radiolabeled acetate is a useful predictor of FASN-targeted therapy outcome. This suggests that [1-(11)C]acetate positron emission tomography (PET) could be a powerful tool to accomplish personalized FASN-targeted therapy by non-invasive visualization of tumor acetate uptake and selection of responsive tumors. FASN-targeted therapy could be an effective treatment to suppress multiple steps related to tumor progression in prostate cancers selected by [1-(11)C]acetate PET.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443847>The impact of dietary sn-2 palmitic triacylglycerols in combination with docosahexaenoic  or  on lipid metabolism and host faecal  composition in Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Sn-2 palmitic  triacylglycerols (sn2PA fat) and polyunsaturated fatty acids are thought to influence the metabolic status and intestinal bacterial population of the host. In this study, the impact of sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA in the diet on lipid metabolism in the liver and faecal  composition were investigated in rats fed diets containing sn2PA fat, 90% sn2PA fat + 10% DHA oil (wt%), or 90% sn2PA fat + 10% ARA oil (wt%). Tissue fatty  composition was measured using gas chromatography (GC), whereas the faecal microbial composition was assessed using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. In addition, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed using ion chromatography. The results showed that sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly reduced liver triacylglyceride (TG) content compared with the sn2PA fat only group. Moreover, the supplementation with sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly promoted the growth of Lactobacillus in the feces at the genus level. On the other hand, the growth of the opportunistic pathogen Desulfovibrio was significantly inhibited by sn2PA fat in combination with ARA compared with the sn2PA fat group.

Cumulatively increasing concentrations (1-1000 μm) of EUG did not affect the resting tonus of TM. However, EUG (1-2000 μm) reduced the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (IC(50) = 842.3 ± 52.7 μm), an effect that was unaltered by either 10 μm montelukast (IC(50) = 816.1 ± 70.1 μm) or 2 μm indomethacin (IC(50) = 693.1 ± 170.8 μm). EUG also completely relaxed the sustained contractile responses to 80 mM K(+) (IC(50)  = 597.3 ± 60.6 μm) and 1 μm carbamoylcholine (IC(50) = 571.3 ± 148.8 μm), an effect that was unaltered by indomethacin (2 μm). Under Ca(2+) -free conditions, EUG reduced the ACh-induced contractions (IC(50) = 703.4 ± 256.1 μm), the CaCl₂ -induced contractions in preparations pretreated with 60 μm ACh in the presence of nifedipine, and the Ba(2+) -induced contractions in preparations depolarized with K(+) . In tracheal preparations maintained in Ca(2+) -containing solution, EUG (300-2000 μm) relaxed the contractile response to phorbol dibutyrate (1 μm), an activator of protein kinase C. It is concluded that in TM, EUG induces a myogenic antispasmodic effect (not modulated by  derivatives) either through various mechanisms almost with the same pharmacological potency or via an action on a step common to all of them. These mechanisms seem to include blockade of voltage- and receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels, IP₃ -induced Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduction of the sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca(2+) .2010 The Authors Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology. 2010 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788856>Evidence for the association of peroxidases with the antioxidant effect of p-coumaric  in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose plus .</a></h2><p>Although many plant-derived phenolic compounds display antioxidant effects in biological systems, their mechanism of action remains controversial. In this study, the mechanism by which p-coumaric  (p-CA) performs its antioxidant action was investigated in bovine aortic endothelial cells under oxidative stress due to high levels of glucose (HG) and  (AA), a free  . p-CA prevented lipid peroxidation and cell death due to HG+AA without affecting the production of reactive oxygen species. The antioxidant effect of p-CA was not decreased by buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of cellular GSH synthesis. In contrast, pretreatment with p-CA caused the induction of peroxidases that decomposed t-butyl hydroperoxide in a p-CA-dependent manner. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of p-CA was significantly mitigated by methimazole, which was shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of 'p-CA peroxidases' in vitro. Therefore, it is suggested that the induction of these previously unidentified 'p-CA peroxidases' is responsible for the antioxidant effect of p-CA.

One of the most promising compounds belonging to this category is licofelone ([2,2 -dimethyl -6-(4-chloropheny-7-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrazoline-5-yl] acetic ). Originally discovered by Merckle GmbH and developed by EuroAllaince, licofelone (IC(50) COX=0.21 microM, IC(50) 5-LOX=0.18 microM) possesses significant analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiasthmatic effects at doses that cause no gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. The pharmacodynamic profile of licofelone has been assessed and compared with widely used NSAIDs in different animal models. The ED(50) value of licofelone is reported to be 11.22-27.07 mg/kg, po and 39.5-55-8 mg/kg, po against carrageenan-induced paw oedema and Randal Selitto hyperalgesic assay in rats, respectively. Licofelone showed analgesic effect (ED(50) = 31.33 mg/kg) against acetic -induced writhing in mice. Licofelone has long duration of action and more effective than indomethacin and zileuton with ED(50) values of 2.92 mg/kg, po and 36.77 mg/kg, po, in the mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia testing, respectively, against rat model of incisional pain. Licofelone significantly ameliorated indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration, neutrophil adhesion in mesentery, and lipid peroxides in rat gastric mucosa. Also, licofelone reversed the altered vascular permeability, morphological changes, and prevented NSAIDs-related increase in leukotriene levels in gastric mucosa. The preclinical studies have shown that licofelone not only has convincing pharmacodynamic effect but also it is well tolerated. It is currently under clinical evaluation in osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis. The present review describes pharmacological and clinical development of licofelone as a dual inhibitor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19180262>Montelukast sodium for exercise-induced asthma.</a></h2><p>Exercise is the most common trigger of bronchospasm in children with asthma. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) occurs in up to 90% of individuals with asthma who are not under antiinflammatory treatment and in about 40% of those with allergic rhinitis. EIB may be an overwhelming problem in childhood and adolescence, when physical activity is a prominent component of daily life. The importance for those with asthma to maintain regular physical activity is recognized by asthma guidelines, which include the recommendation of full participation in sporting activities in their goals for the management of asthma. Cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are derivatives of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of  metabolism, are important mediators of airway allergic inflammation and have a role in the pathogenetic mechanism of EIB. Montelukast sodium (Singulair, Merck & Co.) is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist with demonstrated activity for treating asthma and allergic rhinitis. The effect of this drug in the prevention of EIB has been evaluated in a variety of studies in adults as well as in children. Both single-dose and regular-treatment studies showed that montelukast provides effective protection against EIB. Furthermore, chronic treatment with montelukast does not induce tolerance to the bronchoprotective effect over time. This aspect is particularly relevant for children, who tend to be active at frequent and irregular intervals throughout the day, and who therefore may benefit from around-the-clock pharmacologic protection.Copyright 2008 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

The hGIIA crystal structure, both alone and inhibitor-bound, together with structures of closely related snake-venom-derived secreted phospholipase enzymes has been well described. However, differentiation of biological and nonbiological contacts and the relevance of structures determined from snake venom enzymes to human enzymes are not clear. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) and docking approaches to understand the binding of inhibitors that selectively or nonselectively block the catalysis-independent mechanism of hGIIA. Our results indicate that hGIIA behaves as a monomer in the solution environment rather than a dimer arrangement that is in the asymmetric unit of some crystal structures. The binding mode of a nonselective inhibitor, KH064, was validated by a combination of the experimental electron density and MD simulations. The binding mode of the selective pentapeptide inhibitor FLSYK to hGIIA was stipulated to be different to that of the snake venom phospholipases A of Daboia russelli pulchella (svPLA ). Our data suggest that the application of MD approaches to crystal structure data is beneficial in evaluating the robustness of conclusions drawn based on crystal structure data alone.

In the present study, modulation of TREK-1, TREK-2, and TRAAK channels by fenamates and diltiazem was examined. TREK-1, TREK-2, and TRAAK currents transiently expressed in COS-7 cells were recorded by the perforated-patch configuration. As previously reported,  (20 microM) stimulated all of these channels, and a  anesthetic, halothane (1 mM) augmented TREK-1 and TREK-2 but not TRAAK. Flufenamic  (FA, 100 microM), niflumic  (NA, 100 microM), and mefenamic  (MA, 100 microM) markedly stimulated TREK-1, TREK-2, and TRAAK. The potency sequence for the activation of TREK-1 and TREK-2 was FA > NA = MA, and the potency sequence for the activation of TRAAK was FA = NA > MA. Diltiazem (1 mM) inhibited TREK-1 and TREK-2, but not TRAAK. In conclusion, fenamates are openers of the lipid-sensitive mechano-gated 2P domain K(+) channels, and diltiazem may be a specific blocker for TREK. These novel findings could help to further understand channel functions of the mechano-gated 2P domain K(+) channels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877847>Alditols and monosaccharides from sorghum vinegar can attenuate platelet aggregation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and thromboxane-A2 synthase.</a></h2><p>Vinegar has been used as both a common seasoning and a traditional Chinese medicine. Sorghum vinegar is an excellent source of physiological substances with multiple health benefits.To evaluate the antiplatelet aggregation activity of alditols and monosaccharides extracted from sorghum vinegar and analysis its mechanism.Alditol and monosaccharide extract (AME) from sorghum vinegar was first evaluated for antiplatelet activity using the turbidimetric method. Blood was collected from healthy volunteer donors. The platelet aggregation was induced by  (AA), collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin in vitro. AME was divided into three experimental groups with the concentration were 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL. In order to determine the inhibitory activity of AME on COX1, TXS and TXA2 production experiments were conducted using the COX1, TXS and TXB2 EIA kit. Computational docking was used to find the docking pose of monosaccharides and alditols with COX1.AME showed significant induction of antiplatelet activity by  (AA), collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner (p<0.05). AME (0.50 mg/mL) reduced the AA-induced aggregation rate to 10.35%±0.46%, which was comparable to acetylsalicylic  (aspirin, ASA) (0.50 mg/mL, 6.35%±0.58%), a medical standard. Furthermore, AME strongly inhibited cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) and thromboxane-A2 synthase (TXS), and subsequently attenuated thromboxane-A2 (TXA2) production. These findings indicated that AME attenuates platelet aggregation through the AA metabolism pathway. Computational docking showed that alditols (L-erythritol, L-arabitol, xylitol and D-sorbitol), monosaccharides (D-glucopyranose, D-fructofuranonse, D-xylopyranose, D-galactopyranose and D-ribose), ethyl glucoside and 3,4-(methylenedioxy) mandelic  could dock directly into the active site of COX1.Alditols and monosaccharides from sorghum vinegar inhibit multiple steps in the platelet aggregation pathway, and may be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Either when orally administered (100 mg/kg) or inhaled for 60 min lavender essential oil significantly reduced the acetic -writhing response in a naloxone-sensitive manner. In the hot plate test, analgesic activity observed after oil inhalation was inhibited by naloxone, atropine, mecamylamine pretreatment suggesting the involvement of opioidergic as well as cholinergic pathways. Regardless of the administration route and the experimental model used both linalool and linalyl acetate did not produce significant analgesic response. Oral or inhalatory treatment with analgesic doses of essential oil did not affect mice spontaneous locomotor activity. Concerning the gastric effects, lavender oil, linalool and linalyl acetate oral administration protected against acute ethanol-induced gastric ulcers but did not prevent indomethacin-induced lesions indicating no interference with  metabolic cascade.

It is also known that lithium and carbamazepine do so without decreasing the turnover of docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3).The aim of this study was to see whether valproate also specifically targets the turnover of AA but not of DHA in brain phospholipids.Valproate was administered (200 mg kg(-1), i.p.) to rats for 30 days to produce a therapeutically relevant plasma concentration and then determine its effect compared with that of vehicle on incorporation and turnover rates of DHA in brain phospholipids. In unanesthetized rats that had received valproate or vehicle, [1-14C]DHA was infused intravenously, and arterial blood plasma was sampled until the animal was killed at 5 min; and its brain, after being microwaved, was subjected to chemical and radiotracer analysis.Using equations derived from our   model, it was found that chronic valproate compared with vehicle did not alter the rate of incorporation or turnover of DHA in brain phospholipids. Valproate-treated animals had higher concentrations of linoleic  (18:2n-6) in several brain phospholipids, supporting the hypothesis that it alters brain n-6   metabolism.The results, comparable to published findings following chronic administration of lithium and carbamazepine to rats, support the hypothesis that drugs are effective against mania in bipolar disorder act by downregulating incorporation and turnover of AA, but not of DHA, in brain phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374082>The leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast and its possible role in the cardiovascular field.</a></h2><p>Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are pro-inflammatory mediators of the 5-lipooxygenase (5-LO) pathway, that play an important role in bronchoconstriction, but can also enhance endothelial cell permeability and myocardial contractility, and are involved in many other inflammatory conditions.

We tested whether non-teratogenic VPA analogues might also inhibit Acsl4 catalyzed acylation, and thus have a potential anti-BD action.Rat Acsl4-flag protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the ability of three VPA analogues, propylisopropylacetic  (PIA), propylisopropylacetamide (PID) and N-methyl-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxamide (MTMCD), and of sodium butyrate, to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 was quantified using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA in vitro was inhibited uncompetitively by PIA, with a Ki of 11.4mM compared to a published Ki of 25mM for VPA, while PID, MTMCD and sodium butyrate had no inhibitory effect.PIA's ability to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 in vitro suggests that, like VPA, PIA may reduce AA turnover in brain phospholipids in unanesthetized rats, and if so, may be effective as a non-teratogenic mood stabilizer in BD patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997910>Peracetylation as a means of enhancing in vitro bioactivity and bioavailability of epigallocatechin-3-gallate.</a></h2><p>(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the widely studied catechin in green tea (Camellia sinensis). Previously, we have reported the low bioavailability of EGCG in rats and mice. As a means of improving the bioavailability of EGCG, we have prepared a peracetylated EGCG derivative (AcEGCG) and herein report its growth inhibitory activity and cellular uptake in vitro, as well as bioavailability in mice. AcEGCG exhibited enhanced growth inhibitory activity relative to EGCG in both KYSE150 human esophageal (IC50 = 10 versus 20 microM) and HCT116 human colon cancer cells (IC50 = 32 versus 45 microM). AcEGCG was rapidly converted to EGCG by HCT116 cells, and treatment of cells with AcEGCG resulted in a 2.8- to 30-fold greater intracellular concentration of EGCG as compared with treatment with EGCG. AcEGCG was also more potent than EGCG at inhibiting nitric oxide production (4.4-fold) and  release (2.0-fold) from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Intragastric administration of AcEGCG to CF-1 mice resulted in higher bioavailability compared with administration of equimolar doses of EGCG. The plasma area under the curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-->infinity) of total EGCG was 465.0 and 194.6 [(microg/ml) . min] from the administration of AcEGCG and EGCG, respectively. The t1/2 of EGCG was also increased following administration of AcEGCG compared with EGCG (441.0 versus 200.3 min). The AUC0-->infinity and t1/2 were also increased in small intestinal (2.8- and 4.3-fold, respectively) and colonic tissues (2.4- and 6.0-fold, respectively). These data suggest that acetylation represents a means of increasing the biological potency in vitro, increasing the bioavailability of EGCG in vivo, and may improve cancer-preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22774772>Pharmacological characterization of the peripheral FAAH inhibitor URB937 in female rodents: interaction with the Abcg2 transporter in the blood-placenta barrier.</a></h2><p>URB937 is a peripherally restricted inhibitor of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme - amide hydrolase (FAAH). Despite its limited access to the CNS, URB937 produces marked antinociceptive effects in rodents. URB937 is actively extruded from the CNS by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter, Abcg2. Tissue Abcg2 levels are markedly different between males and females, and this transporter is known to limit the access of xenobiotics to the fetoplacental unit in gestating female rodents. In the present study, we investigated the tissue distribution and antinociceptive properties of URB937 in female mice and rats.We studied the systemic disposition of URB937 in female mice and the antinociceptive effects of this compound in models of visceral (acetic -induced writhing) and inflammatory nociception (carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia) in female mice and rats. Furthermore, we evaluated the interaction of URB937 with the blood-placenta barrier in gestating mice and rats.Abcg2 restricted the access of URB937 to the CNS of female mice and rats. Nevertheless, URB937 produced a high degree of antinociception in female mice and rats in models of visceral and inflammatory pain. Moreover, the compound displayed a restricted access to placental and fetal tissues in pregnant mice and rats.Peripheral FAAH blockade with URB937 reduces nociception in female mice and rats, as previously shown for males of the same species. In female mice and rats, Abcg2 limits the access of URB937, not only to the CNS, but also to the fetoplacental unit. LINKED ARTICLES This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

BTI was also found to inhibit peritoneal capillary permeability and caused a marked reduction of lipopolysaccharide induced PGE(2) generation. In these models, the observed antioedema effect was similar to that of BW755C (a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes). BTI was found to scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, and also protected rat erythrocytes from the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide. In chronic studies, BTI inhibited granuloma formation along with the reduction of both lipid peroxidation and hydroxyproline content (in the granuloma tissue). Significant antiarthritic activity was observed with regular administration of BTI in the Freund's adjuvant induced model of arthritis. Chronic treatment with BTI (in arthritic rats) resulted in a decrease of paw diameter and tissue lipid peroxidation, along with a restoration of GSH, catalase and superoxide dismutase levels.Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468321>Efficacy of licofelone in dogs with clinical osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of licofelone, an  substrate with combined inhibitory activity against 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenases 1 and 2, a double-blind, randomised and placebo-controlled study was conducted in 33 client-owned dogs that were lame owing to hindlimb osteoarthritis. Seventeen of the dogs received a placebo and 16 were treated with 2.5 mg/kg licofelone twice a day for 28 days. The dogs' lameness was assessed on a visual analogue scale (vas), and by force plate analyses at baseline and 14 and 28 days after starting the treatment. After 14 days the mean (se) change in peak vertical force in the licofelone-treated dogs (1.7 [0.8] per cent bodyweight) was significantly greater (P<0.05) than in the placebo-treated dogs (-0.3 [0.6] per cent bodyweight), and after 28 days the difference had increased. In contrast, the dogs' lameness, as assessed by the vas values, had decreased significantly over baseline in both the treated and control groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16171988>Non-specific effects of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors on HeLa cell physiology.</a></h2><p>We examined the effects of various leukotriene synthesis inhibitors on calcium signalling in HeLa cells, before and after transfection with BLT(1). All of the inhibitors studied were found to reduce increases in intracellular calcium concentration induced by BLT(1), but also by an ionophore or activation of various G-protein coupled receptors, regardless of BLT(1) expression. In order to explore the mechanism of these apparently general effects we examined HeLa cell expression of leukotriene receptors and biosynthetic enzymes and found that the genes for key leukotriene synthesis enzymes and all of the leukotriene receptors were not expressed. Leukotrienes are involved in the pathology of a variety of cancers, and for HeLa cells leukotrienes have been reported to be important for aspects of the carcinogenic phenotype. We find that leukotriene synthesis inhibitors have non-specific effects, so careful controls are necessary to avoid interpreting non-specific effects as evidence for leukotriene involvement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17672854>Cannabidiol reduced the striatal atrophy caused 3-nitropropionic  in vivo by mechanisms independent of the activation of cannabinoid, vanilloid TRPV1 and adenosine A2A receptors.</a></h2><p>The neuroprotective potential of cannabinoids has been examined in rats with striatal lesions caused by 3-nitropropionic acic (3NP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex II. We used the CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA), the CB2 agonist HU-308, and cannabidiol (CBD), an antioxidant phytocannabinoid with negligible affinity for cannabinoid receptors. The administration of 3NP reduced GABA contents and also mRNA levels for several markers of striatal GABAergic projection neurons, including proenkephalin (PENK), substance P (SP) and neuronal-specific enolase (NSE). We also found reductions in mRNA levels for superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and -2 (SOD-2), which indicated that 3NP reduced the endogenous antioxidant defences. The administration of CBD, but not ACEA or HU-308, completely reversed 3NP-induced reductions in GABA contents and mRNA levels for SP, NSE and SOD-2, and partially attenuated those found in SOD-1 and PENK. This indicates that CBD is neuroprotective but acted preferentially on striatal neurons that project to the substantia nigra. The effects of CBD were not reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716. The same happened with the TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine, in concordance with the observation that capsaicin, a TRPV1 receptor agonist, failed to reproduce the CBD effects. The effects of CBD were also independent of adenosine signalling as they were not attenuated by the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist MSX-3. In summary, this study demonstrates that CBD provides neuroprotection against 3NP-induced striatal damage, which may be relevant for Huntington's disease, a disorder characterized by the preferential loss of striatal projection neurons. This capability seems to be based exclusively on the antioxidant properties of CBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839100>Chronic valproate treatment blocks D2-like receptor-mediated brain signaling via  in rats.</a></h2><p>Hyperdopaminergic signaling and an upregulated brain  (AA) cascade may contribute to bipolar disorder (BD). Lithium and carbamazepine, FDA-approved for the treatment of BD, attenuate brain dopaminergic D(2)-like (D(2), D(3), and D(4)) receptor signaling involving AA when given chronically to awake rats. We hypothesized that valproate (VPA), with mood-stabilizing properties, would also reduce D(2)-like-mediated signaling via AA.An acute dose of quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline was administered to unanesthetized rats that had been treated for 30 days with a therapeutically relevant dose of VPA (200 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Regional brain AA incorporation coefficients, k*, and incorporation rates, J(in), markers of AA signaling and metabolism, were measured by quantitative autoradiography after intravenous [1-(14)C]AA infusion. Whole brain concentrations of prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and thromboxane (TX)B(2) also were measured.Quinpirole compared to saline significantly increased k* in 40 of 83 brain regions, and increased brain concentrations of PGE(2) in chronic vehicle-treated rats. VPA treatment by itself reduced concentrations of plasma unesterified AA and whole brain PGE(2) and TXB(2), and blocked the quinpirole-induced increments in k* and PGE(2).These results further provide evidence that mood stabilizers downregulate brain dopaminergic D(2)-like receptor signaling involving AA.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26195235>Influence of cafeteria diet and fish oil in pregnancy and lactation on pups' body weight and   profiles in rats.</a></h2><p>The aim was to determine the effects of cafeteria diet (CD) and fish oil supplements given to pregnant and lactating rats on the birth weight and   profiles of their offspring.Female rats were given standard diet (STD) or CD for 22 days before pregnancy. After mating, some animals remained on STD or CD; for some CD rats, the diet was supplemented with 8.78 % fish oil (CD-FO). After 12 days, half the CD-FO group returned to CD (CD-FO12) and the others remained on CD-FO.At birth, body weights of pups of the three CD groups were lower than STD, maintained until 21 days in the CD-FO group only. At the end of lactation, dams of the CD groups had increased plasma triacylglycerols (TAG), non-esterified  , and glycerol concentrations, whereas most n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated   (LCPUFA) were decreased, the effect being greatest in the CD-FO group, where most n-3 LCPUFA were increased and indices of Δ(5) and Δ(6) desaturase activities decreased. The 21-day-old pups of the CD group had increased plasma TAG, not present in the CD-FO group, which had increased 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. In both 2- and 21-day-old CD pups, plasma concentrations of ARA were lower than STD, and even lower in the two CD-FO groups.The effect of CD and CD-FO decreasing pups body weight could be related to decreased concentrations of ARA, caused by the inhibition of the Δ(5) and Δ(6) desaturases in the pathway of n-6 LCPUFA biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775115>Lipid alterations in human colon epithelial cells induced to differentiation and/or apoptosis by butyrate and polyunsaturated  .</a></h2><p>The present study highlights the important association between lipid alterations and differentiation/apoptotic responses in human colon differentiating (FHC) and nondifferentiating (HCT-116) cell lines after their treatment with short-chain   sodium butyrate (NaBt), polyunsaturated   (PUFAs), and/or their combination. Our data from GC/MS and LC/MS/MS showed an effective incorporation and metabolization of the supplemented  (AA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA), resulting in an enhanced content of the respective PUFA in individual phospholipid (PL) classes and an altered composition of the whole cellular   spectrum in both FHC and HCT-116 cells. We provide novel evidence that NaBt combined with PUFAs additionally modulated AA and DHA cellular levels and caused their shift from triacylglycerol to PL fractions. NaBt increased, while AA, DHA and their combination with NaBt decreased endogenous   synthesis in FHC but not in HCT-116 cells.   treatment also altered membrane lipid structure, augmented cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. All these parameters were significantly enhanced by combined NaBt/PUFA treatment, but only in FHC cells was this accompanied by highly increased apoptosis and suppressed differentiation. Moreover, the most significant changes of ROS production, differentiation and apoptosis among the parameters studied, the highest effects of combined NaBt/PUFA treatment and a lower sensitivity of HCT-116 cells were confirmed using two-way ANOVA. Our results demonstrate an important role of  -induced lipid alterations in the different apoptotic/differentiation response of colon cells with various carcinogenic potential.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Applying a mass spectrometry-based nontargeted metabolomics approach, we report here alterations of 330 plasma metabolites representing 33 metabolic pathways during an 8-h insulin deprivation in type 1 diabetic individuals. These pathways included those known to be affected by insulin such as glucose, amino  and lipid metabolism, Krebs cycle, and immune responses and those hitherto unknown to be altered including prostaglandin, , leukotrienes, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and anti-inflammatory responses. A significant concordance of metabolome and skeletal muscle transcriptome-based pathways supports an assumption that plasma metabolites are chemical fingerprints of cellular events. Although insulin treatment normalized plasma glucose and many other metabolites, there were 71 metabolites and 24 pathways that differed between nondiabetes and insulin-treated type 1 diabetes. Confirmation of many known pathways altered by insulin using a single blood test offers confidence in the current approach. Future research needs to be focused on newly discovered pathways affected by insulin deficiency and systemic insulin treatment to determine whether they contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in T1D despite insulin treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544627>Interpretation of Euphorbia Kansui Stir-Fried with Vinegar Treating Malignant Ascites by a UPLC-Q-TOF/MS Based Rat Serum and Urine Metabolomics Strategy Coupled with Network Pharmacology.</a></h2><p> stir-fried with vinegar (V-kansui) has promising biological activities toward treating malignant ascites with reduced toxicity compared to crude kansui. But the mechanism concerning promoting the excretion of ascites has not been systematically studied. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the possible mechanism of V-kansui in treating malignant ascites, including metabolic pathways and molecular mechanism using an integrated serum and urine metabolomics coupled with network pharmacology. Serum and urine samples of rats were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). A comparison with crude kansui was also made to demonstrate the feasibility of processing. Principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were conducted to discriminate the groups, search important variables and reveal the possible pathways. A compound-target-metabolite network was finally constructed to identify the crucial targets to further understand the molecular mechanism. Sixteen significant metabolites contributing to the discrimination of model and control groups were tentatively screened out. They were mainly involved in the  metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and primary bile  to possibly reduce inflammatory and modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to achieve treating malignant ascites. A bio-network starting from the compounds and ending in the metabolites was constructed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. HSP90AA1, ANXA2, PRDX6, PCNA, SOD2 and ALB were identified as the potential key targets that were responsible for the treatment of malignant ascites by the parameter combining the average shortest path length and betweenness centrality. The correlated 17 compounds were considered as the potential active ingredients in V-kansui. In addition, the metabolomics showed that the effect of V-kansui was almost in accordance with crude kansui. These results systematically revealed the mechanism of V-kansui against malignant ascites for the first time using metabolomics coupled with network pharmacology. V-kansui could be a promising safe and therapeutic medicine for the excretion of ascites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162318>Epigenetic Regulation of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 in SH-SY5Y Human Neuroblastoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 or PLA2G4A) is a key enzyme that contributes to inflammation via the generation of  and eicosanoids. While much is known about regulation of cPLA2 by posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation, little is known about its epigenetic regulation. In this study, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, trichostatin A (TSA), valproic , tubacin and the class I HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, were found to increase cPLA2α messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Co-treatment of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor, anacardic , modulated upregulation of cPLA2α induced by TSA. Specific involvement of class I HDACs and HAT in cPLA2α regulation was further shown, and a Tip60-specific HAT inhibitor, NU9056, modulated the upregulation of cPLA2α induced by MS-275. In addition, co-treatment of with histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) suppressed TSA-induced cPLA2α upregulation. The above changes in cPLA2 mRNA expression were reflected at the protein level by Western blots and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed TSA increased binding of trimethylated H3K4 to the proximal promoter region of the cPLA2α gene. Cell injury after TSA treatment as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was modulated by anacardic , and a role of cPLA2 in mediating TSA-induced injury shown, after co-incubation with the cPLA2 selective inhibitor, arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3). Together, results indicate epigenetic regulation of cPLA2 and the potential of such regulation for treatment of chronic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23970347>Predominant role of vasoconstrictors over dilatators derived from  in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.</a></h2><p>Prostanoids derived from  (AA) have been shown to play a permissive role in the regulation of vascular tone and wall tension. Conventionally, epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EETs) and prostacyclin have been considered as dilatators, whereas thromboxane (TX) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) were considered as vasoconstrictors. However, the role of these prostanoids in the mediation of acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is not yet clearly understood. In the present study, the role of prostanoids in the acute hypoxic response in rat isolated intrapulmonary arteries (IPAs) was investigated. Exogenous AA directly caused vasoconstriction, but exerted a significant inhibition on hypoxic vasoconstriction. The vasoconstriction by AA was mediated by the endothelium. AA metabolites from lipoxygenase (LOX) had no effect on vascular tone or hypoxic vasoconstriction. Consistent results from the blockage of cytochrome P450 (CYP) or CYP epoxide hydrolase showed that HETE contributed to endothelium‑independent hypoxic vasoconstriction. EET via epoxygenase exerted no effect on 80 mM KPSS‑induced vessel contraction or hypoxic vasoconstriction. In addition, prostacyclin also failed to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, blockage of thromboxane A2/prostanoid (TP) receptors almost eliminated hypoxic vasoconstriction, suggesting the primary role of TP receptors in the regulation of the hypoxic response in rat IPAs. In conclusion, the current data indicate the predominant role of vasoconstrictors instead of dilatators in mediating HPV. These data also highlight a pivotal role for voltage‑independent Ca2+ entry in pulmonary hypoxic response and suggest that modulation of these channels by prostanoids underlies their regulatory mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19544365>Enhanced fracture repair by leukotriene antagonism is characterized by increased chondrocyte proliferation and early bone formation: a novel role of the cysteinyl LT-1 receptor.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory mediators and drugs which affect inflammation can influence the healing of injured tissues. Leukotrienes are potent inflammatory mediators, and similar to prostaglandins, are metabolites of  which can have positive or negative effects on bone and cartilage tissues. Here we tested the hypothesis that blocking the negative regulation of leukotrienes, would lead to enhanced endochondral bone formation during fracture repair. A closed femoral fracture was created in mice. Animals were divided into three groups for treatment with either montelukast sodium, a cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist (trade name Singulair), zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor (trade name Zyflo), or carrier alone. The fractures were analyzed using radiographs, quantitative gene expression, histology and histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry. Both the montelukast sodium group and the zileuton group exhibited enhanced fracture repair when compared with controls. Both treatment groups exhibited increased callous size and earlier bone formation when compared to controls as early as day 7. Gene expression analysis of treatment groups showed increased markers of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and increased early bone formation markers when compared with controls. Treatment with montelukast sodium directly targeted the cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor, leading to increased chondrocyte proliferation at early time points. These novel findings suggests a potential mechanism by which the cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor acts as a negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation, with important and previously unrecognized implications for both fracture repair, and in a broader context, systemic chondrocyte growth and differentiation.Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758921>Involvement of the long-chain   receptor GPR40 in depression-related behavior.</a></h2><p>The functional role of brain G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) remains unclear.

Primary objective was to determine the effect of S18886 on platelet aggregation ex vivo.Pharmacokinetics of S18886 was linear, with peak plasma levels being reached between 30 min and 2 h and a terminal half-life of 5.8-10 h. No significant accumulation of S18886 in plasma was observed after repeated dosing. The relationship between the S18886 concentration and platelet inhibition was examined in terms of U46619-induced platelet aggregation. Over the range of doses studied, there was a predictable relation between the plasma drug concentration and the degree of platelet inhibition at each dose. Maximal inhibition of U46619-induced platelet aggregation was achieved within 1 h with all oral doses of S18886, and this effect was maintained for at least 12 h. The PK/PD relationship was direct, and U46619-induced platelet aggregation was strongly inhibited by S18886 plasma concentrations above 10 ng mL(-1). This concentration was thus the minimal effective antiplatelet level in this population, and was maintained only by the dosages of 10 and 30 mg. The safety profile of S18886 was excellent, whatever the unit dose, with no attributable adverse events.The results of this study, which included modeling and simulation, help identify the minimal effective plasma concentration of S18886 required for potent antiplatelet efficacy in patients with stable peripheral arterial disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16200338>Successful treatment of severe atopic dermatitis with cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators derived from of  through the 5- lipoxygenase pathway. Experimental data suggest a role for cysteinyl leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and there is a rationale for the use of pharmacological agents to antagonize their effects in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We report 2 cases of severe atopic dermatitis successfully treated with montelukast as a single therapeutic agent in a daily dose of 10 mg for 8 weeks when corticosteroid treatment was contraindicated or failed to control the disease. Our observations suggest that montelukast may be used as an alternative steroid sparing medication for severe atopic dermatitis, especially in patients with associated asthma and rhinitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699405>Two-pore domain potassium channels: variation on a structural theme.</a></h2><p>The ability of cells to reliably fire action potentials is critically dependent upon the maintenance of a hyperpolarized resting potential, which allows voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels to recover from inactivation and open in response to a subsequent stimulus. Hodgkin and Huxley first recognized the functional importance a small, steady outward leak of K(+) ions to the resting potential, action potential generation and cellular excitability, and we now appreciate the contribution of inward rectifier-type K(+) channels (Kir or KCNJ channels) to this process. More recently, however, it has become evident that two-pore domain K(+) (K2P) channels also contribute to the steady outward leak of K(+) ions, and thus, maintenance of the resting potential. Molecular cloning efforts have demonstrated that K2P channel exist in yeast to humans, and represent a major branch in the K(+) channel superfamily. Humans express 15 types of K2P channels, which are grouped into six subfamilies, based on similarities in amino  sequence and functional properties. Although K2P channels are not voltage-gated, due to the absence of a canonical voltage sensor domain, their activity can be regulated by a variety of stimuli, including mechanical force, polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) (e.g., ),  anesthetics, acidity/pH, pharmacologic agents, heat and signaling events, such as phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. K2P channels thus represent important regulators of cellular excitability by virtue of their impact on the resting potential, and as such, have garnered considerable attention in recent years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015045>Targeting astrocytes in bipolar disorder.</a></h2><p>Astrocytes are homeostatic cells of the central nervous system, which are critical for development and maintenance of synaptic transmission and hence of synaptically connected neuronal ensembles. Astrocytic densities are reduced in bipolar disorder, and therefore deficient astroglial function may contribute to overall disbalance in neurotransmission and to pathological evolution. Classical anti-bipolar drugs (lithium salts, valproic  and carbamazepine) affect expression of astroglial genes and modify astroglial signalling and homeostatic cascades. Many effects of both antidepressant and anti-bipolar drugs are exerted through regulation of glutamate homeostasis and glutamatergic transmission, through K(+) buffering, through regulation of calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (that controls metabolism of ) or through Ca(2+) homeostatic and signalling pathways. Sometimes anti-depressant and anti-bipolar drugs exert opposite effects, and some effects on gene expression in drug treated animals are opposite in neurones vs. astrocytes. Changes in the intracellular pH induced by anti-bipolar drugs affect uptake of myo-inositol and thereby signalling via inositoltrisphosphate (InsP3), this being in accord with one of the main theories of mechanism of action for these drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15008823>The effects of TNF-alpha and inhibitors of  metabolism on human colon HT-29 cells depend on differentiation status.</a></h2><p>The level of differentiation could influence sensitivity of colonic epithelial cells to various stimuli. In our study, the effects of TNF-alpha, inhibitors of  (AA) metabolism (baicalein, BA; indomethacin, INDO; niflumic , NA; nordihydroguaiaretic , NDGA), and/or their combinations on undifferentiated or sodium butyrate (NaBt)-differentiated human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells were compared. NaBt-treated cells became growth arrested (blocked in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle), and showed down-regulated Bcl-xL and up-regulated Bak proteins and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). These cells were more perceptive to anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha. Both inhibitors of LOX (BA and NDGA) and COX (INDO and NA) in higher concentrations modulated cell cycle changes accompanying NaBt-induced differentiation and induced various level of cell death in undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Most important is our finding that TNF-alpha action on proliferation and cell death can be potentiated by co-treatment of cells with AA metabolism inhibitors, and that these effects were more significant in undifferentiated cells. TNF-alpha and INDO co-treatment was associated with accumulation of cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, increased reactive oxygen species production, and elevated caspase-3 activity. These results indicate the role of differentiation status in the sensitivity of HT-29 cells to the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of TNF-alpha, AA metabolism inhibitors, and their combinations, and imply promising possibility for novel anti-cancer strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554010>Antinociceptive and antiinflammatory activities of Adiantum latifolium Lam.: evidence for a role of IL-1β inhibition.</a></h2><p>Adiantum, one of the most widely distributed genera of the family Pteridaceae, is employed in folk medicine worldwide. Adiantum latifolium Lam. has been used in Latin American traditional medicine as anxiolytic, analgesic and antiinflammatory. The present study investigates the antinociceptive and antiinflammatory properties of the methanolic extract of Adiantum latifolium (MEA) in animal models of pain and inflammation to confirm its medicinal use.The antinociceptive and antiinflammatory activities of MEA were evaluated using the writhing, formalin, and tail-flick tests, carrageenan-induced paw edema and -induced ear edema. Mice motor performance was evaluated in the rota rod test and the acute toxicity evaluated over 14 days.Intraperitoneal (1-100mg/kg) or oral (100-400mg/kg) administration of MEA produced a dose-related inhibition of acetic -induced writhing in mouse. Furthermore, treatment with MEA (100mg/kg) inhibited both the early and late phases of formalin-induced hypernociception. In contrast, MEA (100mg/kg/IP) did not prevent the thermal nociception in the tail-flick test. In addition, MEA (100 and 200mg/kg/IP) inhibited important events related to the inflammatory response induced by carrageenan or , namely local edema and increase in tissue interleukin-1β levels. MEA (300mg/kg/IP)-treated mice did not show any motor performance alterations. Over the study period of 14 days, there were no deaths or toxic signs recorded in the group of mice given 1000mg/kg of MEA.The results demonstrate that Adiantum latifolium has antinociceptive and antiinflammatory activities, acting through the inhibition of IL-1β production.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The potential health hazards, including teratogenicity, from exposure to DEHP may be related to the role of DEHP or its metabolites in the trans-activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Fetal essential   (EFA) homeostasis is controlled by directional transfer across the placenta through a highly regulated process, including PPAR activation. Using HRP-1 rat trophoblastic cells, the effects of DEHP and two of its metabolites, mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (MEHP) and 2-ethylhexanoic  (EHA), on the mRNA and protein expression of the three known PPAR isoforms (alpha, beta, and gamma),   transport protein 1 (FATP1), plasma membrane   binding protein (FABPpm), and the heart cytoplasmic   binding protein (HFABP) were investigated. This study also investigated the functional effects of exposure on the uptake and transport of six long chain   (LCFAs):  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), linoleic  (LA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA), oleic  (OA), and stearic  (SA). In the presence of DEHP, MEHP, and EHA, the expression of PPARalpha, PPARgamma, FATP1, and HFABP were up-regulated in a dose- and time- dependent manner, while PPARbeta and FABPpm demonstrated variable expression. The uptake rates of EFAs (AA, DHA, LA, ALA) increased significantly upon exposure, and the transport of AA (omega-6) and DHA (omega-3) were directionally induced. These results suggest that DEHP, MEHP, and EHA can influence EFA transfer across HRP-1 cells, implying that these compounds may alter placental EFA homeostasis and potentially result in abnormal fetal development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28926758>Some aspects of the iodine metabolism of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (phaeophyceae).</a></h2><p>Despite its paramount role in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, relatively little is known about halogen metabolism in giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). This is an important shortcoming given the potential implications for marine and atmospheric chemical processes in the wide distribution range of Macrocystis. The work presented here constitutes the first in depth investigation of the uptake, efflux, and of the physiological function of iodide in this important kelp species. Iodide uptake and efflux rates were measured in adult sporophytes of Macrocystis under normal and stressed (exogenous hydrogen peroxide and an elicitor-triggered oxidative burst) conditions. Kelp tissue took up iodide according to Michaelis-Menten type kinetics when incubated in seawater enriched with various concentrations of iodide. Upon the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, simulating oxidative stress, a marked efflux of iodide occurred. In situ generation of hydrogen peroxide was elicited in Macrocystis upon the addition of oligomeric degradation products of alginate as well as  and methyl jasmonate constituting a defensive oxidative burst that could be linked to iodine accumulation. HO was detected at the single cell level using dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate, a fluorogenic probe capable of detecting intracellular HO. When assayed for vanadium haloperoxidase activity, several bromoperoxidase isoforms were detected as well as a single iodoperoxidase. Altogether, the results of this study show that Macrocystis has an elaborate iodine metabolism, which is likely significant for impacting iodine speciation in seawater around kelp beds and for  halogen emissions into the coastal atmosphere.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, no pharmacological study of this plant has been reported to confirm these activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antipyretic activities of Stahlianthus involucratus rhizome ethanol extract (SiE) in animal models.Anti-inflammatory activity of SiE was investigated in rats using ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)-induced ear edema, carrageenan- and  (AA)-induced hind paw edema, and cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation models. Acetic -induced writhing response in mice and tail-flick test in rats as well as yeast-induced hyperthermia in rats were used to investigate the antinociceptive and antipyretic activities, respectively.SiE significantly inhibited EPP-induced ear edema, carrageenan- and AA-induced hind paw edema. Its inhibitory effect in carrageenan-induced hind paw edema seemed to be in a dose-dependent manner. In cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation, SiE showed suppressive effects on granuloma formation but not on body weight gain and dry thymus weight. It could normalize serum alkaline phosphatase activity to nearly normal level. SiE also possessed a significant inhibitory effect, which seemed to be dose-dependent, on acetic -induced writhing response, whereas only at the highest dose of SiE could significantly increase test reaction time at all time-points in tail-flick test. However, no antipyretic activity was observed.These results suggest that SiE possesses anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive, but not antipyretic, activities. This study therefore rationalizes the traditional use of SiE for the treatment of inflammation and pain.Copyright © 2015.

Their effect on colon carcinogenesis using carcinoma formation as an end point is unknown. We assessed the chemopreventive properties of NO-indomethacin (NCX 530) and NO-aspirin (NCX 4016) against azoxymethane-induced colon cancer. Seven-week-old male F344 rats were fed control diet, and 1 week later, rats received two weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg body weight). Two weeks after azoxymethane treatment, rats (48 per group) were fed experimental diets containing NO-indomethacin (0, 40, or 80 ppm), or NO-aspirin (1,500 or 3,000 ppm), representing 40% and 80% of the maximum tolerated dose. All rats were killed 48 weeks after azoxymethane treatment and assessed for colon tumor efficacy and molecular changes in colonic tumors and normally appearing colonic mucosa of different dietary groups. Our results suggest that NO-indomethacin at 40 and 80 ppm and NO-aspirin at 3,000 ppm significantly suppressed both tumor incidence (P < 0.01) and multiplicity (P < 0.001). The degree of inhibition was more pronounced with NO-indomethacin at both dose levels (72% and 76% inhibition) than with NO-aspirin (43% and 67%). NO-indomethacin at 40 and 80 ppm and NO-aspirin at 3,000 ppm significantly inhibited the colon tumors' (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001) total cyclooxygenase (COX), including COX-2 activity (52-75% inhibition) and formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGF2alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1alpha, and TxB2 from  (53-77% inhibition). Nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) activity and beta-catenin expression were suppressed in animals given NO-NSAID. In colonic crypts and tumors of animals fed these two NO-NSAIDs, there was a significant decrease in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling when compared with animals fed the control diet. The results of this study provide strong evidence that NO-NSAIDs possess strong inhibitory effect against colon carcinogenesis; their effect is associated with suppression of COX and NOS-2 activities and beta-catenin levels in colon tumors. These results pave the way for the rational design of human clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110484>Upregulated expression of brain enzymatic markers of  and docosahexaenoic  metabolism in a rat model of the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>In animal models, the metabolic syndrome elicits a cerebral response characterized by altered phospholipid and unesterified   concentrations and increases in pro-apoptotic inflammatory mediators that may cause synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that these changes are associated with phospholipase (PLA2) enzymes that regulate  (AA, 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-6)  metabolism, major polyunsaturated   in brain. Male Wistar rats were fed a control or high-sucrose diet for 8 weeks. Brains were assayed for markers of AA metabolism (calcium-dependent cytosolic cPLA2 IVA and cyclooxygenases), DHA metabolism (calcium-independent iPLA2 VIA and lipoxygenases), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and synaptic integrity (drebrin and synaptophysin). Lipid concentrations were measured in brains subjected to high-energy microwave fixation.The high-sucrose compared with control diet induced insulin resistance, and increased phosphorylated-cPLA2 protein, cPLA2 and iPLA2 activity and 12-lipoxygenase mRNA, but decreased BDNF mRNA and protein, and drebrin mRNA. The concentration of several n-6   in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids and lysophosphatidylcholine was increased, as was unesterified AA concentration. Eicosanoid concentrations (prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and leukotriene B4) did not change.These findings show upregulated brain AA and DHA metabolism and reduced BDNF and drebrin, but no changes in eicosanoids, in an animal model of the metabolic syndrome. These changes might contribute to altered synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in rats and humans with the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502109>Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia: effects of drug treatment on   composition of plasma lipids and membranes.</a></h2><p>The effect of atorvastatin, simvastatin and gemfibrozil on   composition of plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), triglycerides (TG) and red cell membrane ghosts (G) has been determined in appropriate sample populations of individuals with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) or hypercholesterolemia (HCHL). Treatments were appropriate for the condition, gemfibrozil for HTG and a statin for HCHL. Modifications depend on the drug and lipid fraction examined. Both classes of drugs modify   composition but gemfibrozil modifications are more numerous and dramatic than are the modifications by statins. Gemfibrozil produces major modifications in   composition, which are both   and lipid class specific but generally decreases SFA and increases PUFA (mainly n6) and increases the proportion of   with chain length of 18C or more. Statins tend to increase chain length but have less effect on saturation. Notably, all three drugs increased  (AA) in PL and CE.

Leukotrienes are biologically active 5-lipoxygenase products of  metabolism that are involved in the mediation of various inflammatory disorders including SCI. In this study, we investigated the possible protective effects of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor blocker, on SCI-induced oxidative damage. Wistar albino rats (n=24) were divided randomly as control, vehicle- or montelukast (10mg/kg, ip)-treated SCI groups. To induce SCI, a standard weight-drop method that induced a moderately severe injury at T10 was used. Vehicle or montelukast were administered to the injured animals 15 min after injury. At seven days post-injury, neurological examination was performed and rats were decapitated. Blood samples were taken to evaluate leukotriene B4 levels, and pro-inflmamatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) while in spinal cord and urinary bladder samples malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), luminol chemiluminescence (CL) levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and caspase-3 activities were determined. Tissues were also evaluated histologically. SCI caused significant decreases in tissue GSH, which were accompanied with significant increases in luminol CL and MDA levels and MPO and caspase-3 activities, while pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma were elevated. On the other hand, montelukast treatment reversed these parameters and improved histological findings. In conclusion, SCI caused oxidative tissue injury through the activation of pro-inflammatory mediators and by neutrophil infiltration into tissues, and the neuroprotective and antiapoptotic effects of montelukast are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, neutrophil accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Moreover, montelukast does not only exert antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects on the spinal cord, but it has a significant impact on the bladder tissue damage secondary to SCI.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

During lactation, litters were adjusted to eight pups per dam. Fetuses of 20 days and pups of 0, 1, 10, 20 and 30 days of age were studied.Body weight and length were lower in pups of the FD group from birth. The diet, milk, pups' plasma and liver of FD group had higher proportions of n-3 LCPUFA, but the content of  (ARA) was lower. Plasma glucose was higher, but unesterified fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAG), 3-hydroxybutyrate and liver TAG in 1-day-old pups were lower in the FD group, and differences in some of these variables were also found in pups up to 30 days old. Liver lipoprotein lipase activity and mRNA expression, and the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, acyl-CoA oxidase and 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl-CoA synthase increased more at birth in pups of the FD group, but the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and Δ6-desaturase mRNA was lower in the FD group.Maternal intake of high n-3 LCPUFA retards postnatal development, which could be the result of impaired ARA synthesis, and affects hepatic metabolic adaptations to extrauterine life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17921331>Effects of cyclooxygenase inhibition on canine coronary artery blood flow and thrombosis.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to determine the effect of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, and the nonselective COX inhibitor naproxen on coronary vasoactivity and thrombogenicity under baseline and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. We hypothesize that endothelial COX-1 is the primary COX isoform in the canine normal coronary artery, which mediates  (AA)-induced vasodilatation. However, COX-2 can be induced and overexpressed by inflammatory mediators and becomes the major local COX isoform responsible for the production of antithrombotic prostaglandins during systemic inflammation. The interventions included the selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 (0.3 mg/kg iv), the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide (5 mg/kg iv), or the nonselective COX inhibitor naproxen (3 mg/kg iv). The selective prostacyclin (IP) receptor antagonist RO-3244794 (RO) was used as an investigational tool to delineate the role of prostacyclin (PGI(2)) in modulating vascular reactivity. AA-induced vasodilatation of the left circumflex coronary artery was suppressed to a similar extent by each of the COX inhibitors and RO. The data suggest that AA-induced vasodilatation in the normal coronary artery is mediated by a single COX isoform, the constitutive endothelial COX-1, which is reported to be susceptible to COX-2 inhibitors. The effect of the COX inhibitors on thrombus formation was evaluated in a model of carotid artery thrombosis secondary to electrolytic-induced vessel wall injury. Pretreatment with LPS (0.5 mg/kg iv) induced a systemic inflammatory response and prolonged the time-to-occlusive thrombus formation, which was reduced in the LPS-treated animals by the administration of nimesulide. In contrast, neither SC-560 nor naproxen influenced the time to thrombosis in the animals pretreated with LPS. The data are of significance in view of reported adverse cardiovascular events observed in clinical trials involving the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors, thereby suggesting that the endothelial constitutive COX-1 and the inducible vascular COX-2 serve important functions in maintaining vascular homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16448396>Anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone against various inflammatory challenges.</a></h2><p>We investigated the pharmacological profile of licofelone [6-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-phenyl-1H-pyrrolizine-5-acetic ] against different inflammogens. The anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic effect of licofelone (2, 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) against all the challenges was statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared with control and indomethacin (10 mg/kg, p.o.). The ED(50) value of 19.1 mg/kg (onset by 2 h, duration: short), 13.0 mg/kg and 16.8 mg/kg (onset by 1 h, duration: long) was observed for licofelone against carrageenan-, - and bradykinin-induced paw oedema, respectively. Similarly, licofelone showed ED(50) value of 47.6 mg/kg (onset by 1 h, duration: long), 92.2 mg/kg (onset by 1 h, duration: medium), and 78.6 mg/kg (onset by 2 h, duration: medium) against carrageenan-, - and bradykinin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, respectively. The rank order of potency based on percent inhibition and percent reversal against inflammation and mechanical hyperalgesia, respectively, was found to be licofelone > indomethacin. Moreover, licofelone (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly (P < 0.05) and dose-dependently prevented the Freund's adjuvant-induced increased vascularity in mice (vascularity index; 10 mg/kg: 0.059 +/- 0.015; 20 mg/kg: 0.048 +/- 0.004; 30 mg/kg: 0.039 +/- 0.012; 100 mg/kg: 0.025 +/- 0.015 vs. control: 0.0285 +/- 0.003).

Endocannabinoids play an important role in the physiologic control of sleep, pain processing, and emesis. The authors therefore investigated the effects of general anesthesia on the endocannabinoid system in humans.The authors measured whole blood levels of anandamide in 12 patients after induction of general anesthesia with etomidate (an agent shown to have no effect on anandamide levels) and maintenance of anesthesia with the  agent sevoflurane as well as in 12 patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia with propofol, a known inhibitor of   amide hydrolase in the mouse brain. Anandamide levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at four time points (before and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min after induction of anesthesia).Patients of the sevoflurane group showed a significant decline in anandamide levels from induction of anesthesia to 40 min after induction, whereas anandamide levels in patients of the propofol group remained unchanged (type III sum of squares = 1725.66, F = 162.60, P < 0.001, repeated-measures analysis of variance).General anesthesia influences the endocannabinoid system in a drug-dependent way, which may explain side effects of general anesthetics such as psychomimetic and antiemetic properties of propofol and the high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after  anesthetics. These findings suggest new targets for anesthetic drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27356604>PPARα induced NOS1 phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt in guinea pig antral mucous cells: NO-enhancement in Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis.</a></h2><p>A PPARα (peroxisome proliferation activation receptor α) agonist (GW7647) activates nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) to produce NO leading to cGMP accumulation in antral mucous cells. In this study, we examined how PPARα activates NOS1. The NO production stimulated by GW7647 was suppressed by inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin) and Akt (AKT 1/2 Kinase Inhibitor, AKT-inh), although it was also suppressed by the inhibitors of PPARα (GW6471) and NOS1 (N-PLA). GW7647 enhanced the ACh (acetylcholine)-stimulated exocytosis (Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis) mediated via NO, which was abolished by GW6471, N-PLA, wortmannin, and AKT-inh. The Western blotting revealed that GW7647 phosphorylates NOS1 via phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt in antral mucous cells. The immunofluorescence examinations demonstrated that PPARα existing with NOS1 co-localizes with PI3K and Akt in the cytoplasm of antral mucous cells. ACh alone and AACOCF3, an analogue of  (AA), induced the NOS1 phosphorylation via PI3K/Akt to produce NO, which was inhibited by GW6471. Since AA is a natural ligand for PPARα, ACh stimulates PPARα probably via AA. In conclusion, PPARα activates NOS1 via PI3K/Akt phosphorylation to produce NO in antral mucous cells during ACh stimulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20723034>Thromboxane Antagonism with terutroban in Peripheral Arterial Disease: the TAIPAD study.</a></h2><p>Terutroban is a selective prostaglandin endoperoxide (TP) receptor antagonist with antithrombotic, antivasoconstrictive and antiatherosclerotic properties and is currently in development for long-term cardiovascular secondary prevention.TAIPAD is an international, double-blind, randomized controlled study comparing the effects of five dosages of oral terutroban vs. aspirin and placebo on platelet aggregation in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients.After 10 day's placebo run-in, included patients (n = 435; ankle-brachial pressure index, 0.7 ± 0.1) were randomly allocated to aspirin 75 mg day(-1), terutroban 1, 2.5, 5, 10 or 30 mg day(-1) or placebo.

The cDNAs of two novel cystatins were isolated, coding for an approx. 11-kDa protein, SlCYS10; and for a 23.6-kDa protein, SlCYS9, bearing an N-terminal signal peptide and a long, 11.5-kDa extension at the C terminus. Both genes were induced by arachidonate but not by methyl jasmonate, an inducer of the 88-kDa eight-unit cystatin, multicystatin, accumulated in the cytosol of leaf cells upon herbivory. A truncated form of SlCYS9, tSlCYS9, was produced by deletion of the C-terminal extension to assess the influence of this structural element on the cystatin moiety. As shown by kinetic and stability assays with recombinant variants expressed in Escherichia coli, deleting the extension influenced both the overall stability and inhibitory potency of SlCYS9 against cysteine proteases of herbivorous organisms.

Maximum withaferin A content of 0.0875 mg/g dry cell weight and transformation efficiency of 80% were obtained. Confirmation of transformation was done on the basis of the presence of the ags gene by using polymerase chain reaction. Various abiotic elicitors (, methyl jasmonate, calcium chloride, and copper sulfate) and biotic elicitors (cell extracts and culture filtrates of Alternia alternata, Fusarium solani, and Verticilium dahaliae) were tested at different concentrations to enhance withaferin A production in suspension culture of transformed cells. Maximum enhancements of 5.4 times and 9.7 times, respectively, were obtained when copper sulfate (100 microM) and the cell extract of V. dahaliae (5% v/v) were added separately to suspension cultures. The dual elicitation strategy by the combined addition of these two elicitors resulted in 13.8-fold enhancement of withaferin A content in comparison to control cultures (2.65 mg/L). The present study indicates the potential of this biotechnology-based methodology for the large-scale production of withaferin A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175350>Relative abundance of short chain and polyunsaturated   in propionic -induced autistic features in rat pups as potential markers in autism.</a></h2><p>  are essential dietary nutrients, and one of their important roles is providing polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) for the growth and function of nervous tissue. Short chain   (SCFAs) are a group of compounds derived from the host microbiome that were recently linked to effects on the gut, the brain, and behavior. They are therefore linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Reduced levels of PUFAs are associated with impairments in cognitive and behavioral performance, which are particularly important during brain development. Recent studies suggest that omega -3   such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are involved in neurogenesis, neurotransmission, and protection from oxidative stress. Omega-3 PUFAs mediate some of these effects by antagonizing Omega-6 PUFA (, AA)-induced proinflammatory prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) formation.In this work, the absolute and relative concentrations of propionic (PPA), butyric and acetic , as well as PUFAs and their precursors (α-Linolenic and linoleic), were measured in the brain tissue of PPA-neurointoxicated rat pups (receiving 250 mg PPA/Kg body weight for 3 consecutive days) as a rodent model with persistent autistic features compared with healthy controls.The data revealed remarkably lower levels of omega6/omega3, α-Linolenic/Linoleic, α-Linolenic/EPA, α-Linolenic/DHA, EPA/DHA, and AA/Linoleic  ratios in PPA-intoxicated rats. The role of these impaired ratios is discussed in relation to the activity of desaturases and elongases, which are the two enzymatic groups involved in the synthesis of PUFAs from their precursors. The relationship between the abnormal relative concentrations of the studied   and oxidative stress, neurotransmission, and neuroinflammation is also discussed in detail.This study demonstrates that   ratios are useful for understanding the mechanism of PPA neurotoxicity in a rodent model of autism. Therefore, it is possible to use these ratios for predictions in patients with this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18461450>Chronic administration of valproic  reduces brain NMDA signaling via  in unanesthetized rats.</a></h2><p>Evidence that brain glutamatergic activity is pathologically elevated in bipolar disorder suggests that mood stabilizers are therapeutic in the disease in part by downregulating glutamatergic activity. Such activity can involve the second messenger,  (AA, 20:4n - 6). We tested this hypothesis with regard to valproic  (VPA), when stimulating glutamatergic N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptors in rat brain and measuring AA and related responses. An acute subconvulsant dose of NMDA (25 mg/kg i.p.) or saline was administered to unanesthetized rats that had been treated i.p. daily with VPA (200 mg/kg) or vehicle for 30 days. Quantitative autoradiography following intravenous [1-(14)C]AA infusion was used to image regional brain AA incorporation coefficients k*, markers of AA signaling. In chronic vehicle-pretreated rats, NMDA compared with saline significantly increased k* in 41 of 82 examined brain regions, many of which have high NMDA receptor densities, and also increased brain concentrations of the AA metabolites, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)). VPA pretreatment reduced baseline concentrations of PGE(2) and TXB(2), and blocked the NMDA induced increases in k* and in eicosanoid concentrations. These results, taken with evidence that carbamazepine and lithium also block k* responses to NMDA in rat brain, suggest that mood stabilizers act in bipolar disorder in part by downregulating glutamatergic signaling involving AA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21433159>Fast ultrasound-assisted extraction of polar (phenols) and nonpolar (lipids) fractions in Heterotheca inuloides Cass.</a></h2><p>Heterotheca inuloides Cass., also known as "arnica", is used in traditional medicine in Mexico.Development of fast methods for the extraction of lipidic and phenolic fractions from arnica plants and their subsequent characterization.Ultrasound was applied to accelerate extraction of the target compounds from this plant and reduce the use of organic solvents as compared with conventional methods. Gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography with diode-array detection were used for the characterization of the lipidic and phenolic fractions, respectively.Under optimal extraction conditions, 9 and 55 min were necessary to complete extraction of the lipidic and phenolic fractions, respectively. The   present at the highest concentrations in H. inuloides were eicosatetraenoic n3 (24.6 μg/g), cis-9-hexadecenoic n7 (23.1 μg/g), exacosanoic (22.7 μg/g) and cis-9-octadecenoic  (21.3 μg/g), while the rest were in the range 7.6-1.3 μg/g. The most concentrated phenols were guaiacol (41.5 μg/g), catechin (38.7 μg/g), ellagic  (35.9 μg/g), carbolic  (24.2 μg/g) and p-coumaric  (19.5 μg/g), while the rest were in the range 5.1-0.4 μg/g.Ultrasound reduces the time necessary to complete the extraction 160 and 26 times, the extraction volume 2.5 and 4 times, and increases the extraction efficiency 5 and 3 times for lipidic and phenolic fractions, respectively, in comparison with conventional extraction methods. In addition, the characterization of the lipidic and phenolic fractions constitutes a first approach to the H. inuloides metabolome.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859881>Is post exposure prevention of teratogenic damage possible: Studies on diabetes, valproic , alcohol and anti folates in pregnancy: Animal studies with reflection to human.</a></h2><p>We discuss the possibilities to prevent the post-exposure teratogenic effects of several teratogens: valproic  (VPA), diabetes and alcohol.

The drug has been shown to suppress scratching and improve the skin inflammation in the NC/Nga (NC) mouse, a model of atopic dermatitis. Corticosteroids are commonly used as effective agents for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We examined the anti-pruritic efficacy of TS-022 in NC mice cohabited with skin-lesioned NC mice, which showed spontaneous scratching without skin lesions in the early phase and chronic itching with severe dermatitis in the late phase, in comparison with that of dexamethasone. We have previously reported that prostaglandin D(2) might have a physiological role in the inhibition of pruritus. While after 2 weeks of cohabitation with skin-lesioned NC mice (early phase of dermatitis, characterized by the appearance of spontaneous scratching), topically applied TS-022 exhibited a weak anti-pruritic effect in the NC mice, after 6 weeks of cohabitation (late phase, characterized by both chronic scratching and dermatitis), the drug exerted potent anti-pruritic activity. In contrast, dexamethasone exerted potent anti-pruritic effect in both the early and late phases. Indomethacin aggravated the scratching in the early phase, but had no effect in the late phase. The skin prostaglandin D(2) level was significantly increased in the early phase, to subsequently declined and return to the basal level in the late phase. The cutaneous ability for prostaglandin D(2) production following topical application of  or mechanical scratching was decreased in the late phase. Moreover, the expression level of the prostanoid DP(1) receptor in the skin was increased in the late phase. These findings suggest that the potent anti-pruritic activity of TS-022 in the late phase might be attributable to the decrease of endogenous prostaglandin D(2) production and increase of prostanoid DP(1) receptor expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28613869>Effect of Different Elicitors and Preharvest Day Application on the Content of Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity of Butterhead Lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. capitata) Produced under Hydroponic Conditions.</a></h2><p>The effect of four elicitors on phytochemical content in two varieties of lettuce was evaluated. The best preharvest day for application of each elicitor was chosen. Solutions of  (AA), salicylic  (SA), methyl jasmonate (MJ), and Harpin protein (HP) were applied by foliar aspersion on lettuce leaves while cultivating under hydroponic conditions. Application of elicitors was done at 15, 7, 5, 3, or 1 day before harvest. Green lettuce showed the highest increase in phytochemical content when elicitors (AA, SA, and HP) were applied on day 7 before harvest. Similarly, antioxidant activity rose in all treatments on day 7. In red lettuce, the highest content of bioactive molecules occurred in samples treated on day 15. AA, SA, and HP were the elicitors with the highest effect on phytochemical content for both varieties, mainly on polyphenol content. Antioxidant activity also increased in response to elicitation. HPLC-MS showed an increase in the content of phenolic  in green and red lettuce, especially after elicitation with SA, suggesting activation of the caffeic  pathway due to elicitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15744068>Neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of the ethyl acetate fraction prepared from Tussilago farfara L.</a></h2><p>The flower buds of Tussilago farfara L. (Compositae) have been traditionally used in Oriental medicine for the treatment of bronchitis and asthma. The extract of T. farfara was reported to exhibit antiinflammatory actions by inhibiting  metabolism and nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction on various types of neuronal cell damage induced in primary cultured rat cortical cells. Its antioxidant activities were also evaluated by cell-free bioassays. We found that the EA fraction potently inhibited the neuronal damage induced by . We also found that it significantly attenuated the neuronal damage induced by spermine NONOate, a stable NO generator. In addition, it inhibited the A(beta(25-35))-induced neurotoxicity and glutamate- or N-methyl-D-aspartic -induced excitotoxicity. It was found that the oxidative neuronal damage induced by H2O2, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, or Fe(2+)/ascorbic  was also inhibited by the EA fraction. Furthermore, it was shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation initiated by Fe(2+)/ascorbic  in rat brain homogenates, and scavenge DPPH radicals. This is the first demonstration of neuroprotective and antioxidant effects of T. farfara. Although complex mechanisms may be involved in the neuroprotective actions, T. farfara may be useful for the management of neurodegenerative disorders associated with inflammation, A(beta), excitotoxicity, and/or oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746679>Abnormal fatty acids in Canadian children with autism.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are critical for pediatric neurodevelopment and are abnormal in autism, although prior studies have demonstrated conflicting results and methodological differences. To our knowledge, there are no published data on fatty  in Canadian children with autism. The aim of this study was to investigate red blood cell and serum fatty  status to identify whether abnormalities exist in Canadian children with autism, and to enhance future cross-study comparison.Eleven Canadian children with autism (3 girls, 8 boys; age 3.05 ± 0.79 y) and 15 controls (9 girls, 6 boys; age 3.87 ± 1.06 y) met inclusion criteria, which included prior Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, no recent medication or supplements, no specialty diets, and no recent illness.The children with autism demonstrated lower red blood cell docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.0003), eicosapentaenoic  (P < 0.03),  (P < 0.002), and ω-3/ω-6 ratios (P < 0.001). They also demonstrated lower serum docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.02),  (P < 0.05), and linoleic  (P < 0.02) levels.Fatty acids in both serum and red blood cells were abnormal in this small group of Canadian children with autism than in controls, underlining a need for larger age- and sex-matched investigations in this community. A potential role for fatty  abnormalities within the complex epigenetic etiology of autism is proposed in relation to emerging understanding of relationships between cobalamin metabolism, gut , and propionic  production.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We examined in this study the effect of aqueous extracts of the compounds from autoxidized  (AA) ethyl ester or hexanal which is the predominant component generated from oxidized AA by the anosmic mouse licking performance to a tastant. The addition of the water extract from oxidized AA or hexanal to a quinine hydrochloride (QHCl) solution decreased the anosmic mice licking frequency at several concentrations of QHCl. Hexanal also reduced the licking frequency of anosmic mice conditioned to avoid MSG at several concentrations of monosodium glutamate (MSG). These results suggest that hexanal would affect mouse taste perception to QHCl and MSG via the gustatory sensation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21846199>Hypolipidemic effects of different angiocarp parts of Alpinia zerumbet.</a></h2><p>In utilization of Alpinia zerumbet (Pers.) Burtt and Smith (Zingiberaceae) (AZ), usually the angiocarps are discarded without further use.We speculate whether the angiocarps could show hypolipidemic effect.Several diets were prepared: Alpinia seed powder (ASP); Alpinia seed powder/husk (ASH): 40/60; and Alpinia seed essential oil (ASO): 0.01-0.10%. Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 11 groups were fed these diets for 8 weeks and tested for the hypolipidemic bioactivity.The fecal neutral cholesterol excretion was increased, and the serum total triglyceride (TG) was significantly reduced from 153.7 mg/dL in the high-fat group (H) to 114.3-119.8 mg/dL by ASO; to 116.3-147.9 mg/dL by ASP; and to 116.2-145.3 mg/dL by ASH. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were almost unaffected. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were mostly raised by ASO to 180.3-200.8 mg/dL. The lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) levels were mostly reduced to 66.8-82.6 mg/dL by ASH. The level of  was mostly raised to 0.50-0.60% by ASO, compared with 0.37% of group H. More importantly, the significant reduction in hepatic TG and total cholesterol (TC) implicated a crucial liver protective effect.ASP and ASH consisted of high crude-fiber content, while ASO consisted of seed essential oil. Both the seed essential oil and the whole powder of AZ previously had been reported to possess potent hypolipidemic bioactivity. Conclusively, the hypolipidemic effect can be attributed to the combined effect of the essential oil and the crude fiber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718439>Valproyl-CoA and esterified valproic  are not found in brains of rats treated with valproic , but the brain concentrations of CoA and acetyl-CoA are altered.</a></h2><p>Sodium valproate and lithium are used to treat bipolar disorder. In rats, both reduce the turnover of  in several brain phospholipids, suggesting that arachidonate turnover is a common target of action of these mood stabilizers. However, the mechanisms by which these drugs reduce arachidonate turnover in brain are not the same. Lithium decreases turnover by reducing the activity and expression of the 85-kDa type IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2); valproate does not affect cPLA2 activity or expression. To test whether valproate alters neural membrane order by direct esterification into phospholipid or by interrupting intermediary CoA metabolism, we measured valproyl-CoA, esterified valproate, and short chain acyl-CoAs in brains from control rats and rats treated chronically with sodium valproate. Valproyl-CoA and esterified forms of valproate were not found in brain with detection limits of 25 and 37.5 pmol/g brain(-1), respectively. Valproate treatment did result in a 1.4-fold decrease and 1.5-fold increase in the brain concentrations of free CoA and acetyl-CoA when compared to control. Therefore the reduction of brain  turnover by chronic valproate in rats is not related to the formation of valproyl-CoA or esterified valproate, but may involve changes in the intermediary metabolism of CoA and short chain acyl-CoA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16310765>The cysteinyl-leukotriene-1 receptor antagonist zafirlukast is a potent secretagogue in rat and human airways.</a></h2><p>Cysteinyl-leukotriene-1 receptor antagonists are important tools in the therapy of asthma. Although many studies have been performed concerning their effects on airway smooth muscle tone, there are no basic data on their effects on airway secretions. Therefore, we assessed the effects of zafirlukast and montelukast on rat tracheal secretion by quantification of secreted 35S04 labelled mucus macromolecules, and determined the influence of the  pathway using the modified Ussing chamber technique. Zafirlukast (432+/-89.99%) and montelukast (167+/-16.74%) stimulated rat tracheal secretion. This was abolished by application of eicosatetraenoic , an inhibitor of the  metabolism. Whereas inhibition of cyclooxygenase did not show any significant effect on zafirlukast induced secretion, blockade of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway markedly reduced the secretagogue effects. Furthermore, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase completely inhibited the effects elicited by zafirlukast. Additional experiments revealed secretagogue effects of zafirlukast also in human bronchial tissue. In conclusion, zafirlukast is a potent inducer of tracheal secretion. Obviously, these effects are induced by involvement of a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase dependent pathway mediated by products of the  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26225920>ACEA (a highly selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis in mice treated with antiepileptic drugs.</a></h2><p>Hippocampal neurogenesis plays a very important role in learning and memory functions. In a search for best neurological drugs that protect neuronal cells and stimulate neurogenesis with no side effects, cannabinoids proved to be a strong group of substances having many beneficial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ACEA (arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide--a highly selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) combined with a classical antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (VPA) on neural precursor cells' proliferation and differentiation in the mouse brain. All experiments were performed on adolescent CB57/BL male mice injected i.p. with VPA (10mg/kg), ACEA (10mg/kg) and PMSF (30 mg/kg) (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride--a substance protecting ACEA against degradation by the - amidohydrolase) for 10 days. Next an acute response of proliferating neural precursor cells to ACEA and VPA administration was evaluated with Ki-67 staining (Time point 1). Next, in order to determine whether acute changes translated into long-term alterations in neurogenesis, proliferating cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by confocal microscopy used to determine the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells that showed mature cell phenotypes (Time point 2). Results indicate that ACEA with PMSF significantly increase the total number of Ki-67-positive cells when compared to the control group. Moreover, ACEA in combination with VPA increased the number of Ki-67-positive cells, whereas VPA administered alone had no impact on proliferating cells' population. Accordingly, neurogenesis study results indicate that the combination of ACEA+PMSF administered alone and in combination with VPA considerably increases the total number of BrdU-positive cells in comparison to the control group while ACEA+PMSF alone and in combination with VPA increased total numbers of BrdU-positive cells, newly born neurons and astrocytes as compared to VPA group but not to the control group. VPA administered alone decreased the number of newly born neurons with no significant impact on neurogenesis. These data provide substantial evidence that VPA administered chronically slightly decreases the proliferation and differentiation of newly born cells while combination of VPA+ACEA significantly increases the level of newborn neurons in the dentate subgranular zone.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The respective times to occlusion after S18886 were as follows: 56.8 +/- 9.3, 83.5 +/- 14.9, and 92.4 +/- 15.7 minutes compared to 43.3 +/- 8.2 minutes after vehicle. S18886 caused a minimal increase in tongue bleeding time and a significant decrease in ex vivo platelet aggregation to  or U46619.

Clopidogrel produced a 50% reduction in adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and a slight increase in the time to occlusion. However, clopidogrel + S18886 1.0 mg/kg prevented occlusive thrombus formation in most of the coronary vessels over 6 hours. S18886 did not alter myocardial infarct size in the ischemia-reperfusion model.

To further explore the actions of sPLA2-IIA in tumorigenesis, sPLA2-IIA was overexpressed in two cell lines where it is normally absent, the murine colon tumor cell line AJ02nm0, and human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116. Two allelic variants of sPLA2-IIA were tested in this study; sPLA2-IIA(AKR) and sPLA2-IIA(SWR), which are derived from AKR/J and SWR/J mice, respectively, and differ by a single amino  at position 63 in the calcium- and receptor-binding domain. There was no change in cell-doubling time for either allele when compared to vector controls. Furthermore, sodium butyrate and  (AA)-induced cell death were unchanged in control and transfected cells. Addition of the sPLA2 substrate, palmitoyl-arachidonoyl-phosphatidic  (PAPA), to AJ02nm0 cells resulted in a modest (12%-24%), but significant (P < 0.01), inhibition of growth that was dependent on sPLA2-IIA expression. However, when AJ02nm0 and HCT-116 cells were injected subcutaneously (sc) into nude mice, Pla2g2a expression resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in tumor size. In addition, sPLA2-IIA expressing HCT-116 tumors were found to be more infiltrative than controls. We conclude that the ability of sPLA2-IIA to slow tumor cell growth is dependent upon the availability of substrate, and that in some instances sPLA2-IIA may actually enhance tumor growth. Mechanisms that may account for differences between the tumor explant model versus the Apc(Min) model of intestinal cancer are discussed.2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17704828>The molecular mechanism of the inhibition by licofelone of the biosynthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products.</a></h2><p>Licofelone is a dual inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway, and has been developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition by licofelone of the formation of 5-LO products.The efficacy of licofelone to inhibit the formation of 5-LO products was analysed in human isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) or transfected HeLa cells, as well as in cell-free assays using respective cell homogenates or purified recombinant 5-LO. Moreover, the effects of licofelone on the subcellular redistribution of 5-LO were studied.Licofelone potently blocked synthesis of 5-LO products in Ca(2+)-ionophore-activated PMNL (IC(50)=1.7 microM) but was a weak inhibitor of 5-LO activity in cell-free assays (IC(50)>>10 microM). The structures of licofelone and MK-886, an inhibitor of the 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), were superimposable. The potencies of both licofelone and MK-886 in ionophore-activated PMNL were impaired upon increasing the concentration of , or under conditions where 5-LO product formation was evoked by genotoxic, oxidative or hyperosmotic stress. Furthermore, licofelone prevented nuclear redistribution of 5-LO in ionophore-activated PMNL, as had been observed for FLAP inhibitors. Finally, licofelone as well as MK-886 caused only moderate inhibition of the synthesis of 5-LO products in HeLa cells, unless FLAP was co-transfected.Our data suggest that the potent inhibition of the biosynthesis of 5-LO products by licofelone requires an intact cellular environment and appears to be due to interference with FLAP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642186>Transcriptome changes in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. roots induced by methyl jasmonate.</a></h2><p>Transcriptome profiling has been widely used to analyze transcriptomic variation in plants subjected to abiotic or biotic stresses. Although gene expression changes induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) have been profiled in several plant species, no information is available on the MeJA-triggered transcriptome response of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., a species with highly valuable medicinal properties. In this study, we used transcriptome profiling to investigate transcriptome changes in roots of P. multiflorum seedlings subjected to a 0.25 mmol/L-MeJA root-irrigation treatment.

Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) 1 receptor antagonist used in asthma treatment, decreases eosinophil infiltration into the asthmatic airways, suggesting that CysLTs modulate eosinophil protease activity.We sought to determine whether CysLTs and montelukast regulate eosinophil protease activity.Purified blood eosinophils were treated with or without montelukast; MK-0591, a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor; or leukotriene (LT) D(4). Migration assays through Matrigel were performed in the presence of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic  (5-oxo-ETE), a potent eosinophil chemotactic factor, or LTD(4). Expression of molecules implicated in plasmin generation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 release were also evaluated.Montelukast and MK-0591 decreased eosinophil migration promoted by 5-oxo-ETE, whereas LTD(4) failed to induce eosinophil migration. However, LTD(4) significantly boosted the migration rate obtained with a suboptimal concentration of 5-oxo-ETE and partially reversed the inhibition obtained with MK-0591. Montelukast significantly reduced the maximal rate of activation of plasminogen into plasmin by eosinophils obtained with 5-oxo-ETE. 5-Oxo-ETE increased the number of eosinophils expressing urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and stimulated secretion of MMP-9. Montelukast, but neither MK-0591 nor LTD(4), reduced the expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and the secretion of MMP-9 and increased total cellular activity of urokinase plasminogen activator and the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 mRNA.Montelukast inhibits eosinophil protease activity in vitro through a mechanism that might be independent of its antagonist effect on CysLT 1 receptor.This could partially explain montelukast's anti-inflammatory effect in asthma and eventually amplify to improve its therapeutic efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375653>Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists inhibit tumor metastasis by inhibiting capillary permeability.</a></h2><p>We explored the possibility of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists, pranlukast and montelukast, preventing tumor cell migration through both cerebral and peripheral capillaries.

In addition, a Lewis lung carcinoma metastasis model in mice was used to study the inhibitory effect of pranlu kast and montelukast against cancer cell extravasation through general capillaries. When mice were given food containing either pranlukast or montelukast, immediately after paw amputation, tumor metastasis was prevented by both drugs, and their survival was prolonged. These results show that pranlukast can inhibit tumor cell migration through both the brain and peripheral capillaries, whereas montelukast inhibits tumor cell migration only in the peripheral capillaries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015447>High-performance liquid chromatography assay with fluorescence detection for the evaluation of inhibitors against human recombinant monoacylglycerol lipase.</a></h2><p>A fluorescent assay for the evaluation of inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is described. 1,3-Dihydroxypropan-2-yl 4-pyren-1-ylbutanoate was designed and synthesized as novel fluorogenic substrate. Activity of human recombinant MAGL was determined in the presence of the surfactant Triton X-100 without further sample cleanup by measuring the amount of 4-pyren-1-ylbutanoic  released by the enzyme with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection. The known covalent binding MAGL inhibitors methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), 4-nitrophenyl 4-[bis(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)hydroxymethyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate (JZL184), and [4-(5-methoxy-2-oxo-1,3,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-methylphenyl]carbamic  benzyl ester (CAY10499) were used to validate the test system. Applying an incubation time of 15 min, the IC(50) values obtained for these compounds were 0.16, 3.7, and 1.1 microM, respectively. A prolongation of the incubation to 45 min results in a two- to threefold decrease of the IC(50) values.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Plasma (10μL) was diluted with acetate buffer (80μL, 1M, pH 4.9) and d- and d-ibuprofen were extracted with ethyl acetate (2×500μL). After solvent evaporation d- and d-ibuprofen were derivatized in anhydrous acetonitrile by using pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide and N,N-diisopropylethylamine as the base catalyst. Under electron-capture negative-ion chemical ionization (ECNICI), the PFB esters of d- and d-ibuprofen readily ionize to form their carboxylate anions [M-PFB] at m/z 205 and m/z 208, respectively. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of m/z 205 and m/z 208 resulted in the formation of the anions at m/z 161 and m/z 164, respectively, due to neutral loss of CO (44 Da). A collision energy-dependent H/D isotope effect was observed, which involves abstraction/elimination of H from d-ibuprofen and D from d-ibuprofen and is minimum at a CE value of 5eV. Quantitative GC-MS determination was performed by selected-ion monitoring of m/z 205 and m/z 208. Quantitative GC-MS/MS determination was performed by selected-reaction monitoring of the mass transitions m/z 205 to m/z 161 for d-ibuprofen and m/z 208 to m/z 164 for d-ibuprofen. In a therapeutically relevant concentration range (0-1000μM) d-ibuprofen added to human plasma was determined with accuracy (recovery, %) and imprecision (relative standard deviation, %) ranging between 93.7 and 110%, and between 0.8 and 4.9%, respectively. GC-MS (y) and GC-MS/MS (x) yielded almost identical results (y=4.00+0.988x, r=0.9991). In incubation mixtures of  (10μM), d-ibuprofen (10μM) or d-ibuprofen (10μM) with ovine cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms 1 and 2, the concentration of d-ibuprofen and d-ibuprofen did not change upon incubation at 37°C up to 60min. The trough pharmacokinetics of an inhaled arginine-containing ibuprofen preparation in mice was studied after once-daily treatment (0.0, 0.07, 0.4 and 2.5mg/kg body weight) for three days. A linear relationship between ibuprofen concentration in serum (10μL) and administered dose 24h after the last drug administration was observed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study sought to determine whether CP-900691 ((S)-3-[3-(1-carboxy-1-methyl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-piperidine-1-carboxylic  4-trifluoromethyl-benzyl ester; CP), a member of this novel class of agents, by decreasing plasma triglycerides, could prevent diabetic nephropathy in the Black and Tan, BRachyuric (BTBR) ob/ob mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Four-week old female BTBR WT and BTBR ob/ob mice received either regular chow or one containing CP (3 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks. CP elevated plasma high-density lipoprotein, albuminuria, and urinary excretion of 8-epi PGF(2α), a product of the nonenzymatic metabolism of  and whose production is elevated in oxidative stress, in BTBR WT mice. In BTBR ob/ob mice, CP reduced plasma triglycerides and non-esterified  , fasting blood glucose, body weight, and plasma interleukin-6, while concomitantly improving insulin resistance. Despite these beneficial metabolic effects, CP had no effect on elevated plasma insulin, 8-epi PGF(2α) excretion, and albuminuria, and surprisingly, did not ameliorate the development of diabetic nephropathy, having no effect on the accumulation of renal macrophages, glomerular hypertrophy, and increased mesangial matrix expansion. In addition, CP did not increase plasma high-density lipoprotein in BTBR ob/ob mice, while paradoxically increasing total cholesterol levels. These findings indicate that 8-epi PGF(2α), possibly along with hyperinsulinemia and inflammatory and dysfunctional lipoproteins, is integral to the development of diabetic nephropathy and should be considered as a potential target of therapy in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18656901>Effect of montelukast and MK-886 on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.</a></h2><p>Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) may occur in transplantation, trauma, and elective hepatic resections. Leukotrienes have been shown to play a major role in hepatic I/R injury. Five-lipoxygenase enzyme is an important enzyme in the production of leukotrienes from . MK-886 is an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, and montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MK-886 and montelukast are effective in preventing hepatic I/R injury.Rats were divided into five groups consisting of seven rats in each: (1) Control I/R, (2) Control-montelukast, (3) Control-MK-886, (4) I/R+montelukast, and (5) I/R+MK-886. Thirty min of total hepatic vascular occlusion and then 60 min reperfusion were performed to animals in groups 1, 4, and 5. In groups 2 and 4, montelukast, and in groups 3 and 5, MK-886 was applied intraperitoneally before and during the surgical procedures.Apoptosis in the liver and intestine decreased significantly in the I/R+montelukast and I/R+MK-886 groups compared with the I/R group. Tissue malondialdehyde levels and glutathione consumptions also decreased significantly in the I/R+montelukast and I/R+MK-886 groups compared with the I/R group. The difference in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels between the groups did not reach significance.Montelukast and MK-886 were found to be effective in prevention of liver and intestine injury by reducing apoptosis and oxidative stress in a hepatic I/R model. Anti-inflammatory properties and inhibition of lipid peroxidation by montelukast and MK-886 could be protective for these organs in I/R injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21184843>Valproate uncompetitively inhibits  acylation by rat acyl-CoA synthetase 4: relevance to valproate's efficacy against bipolar disorder.</a></h2><p>The ability of chronic valproate (VPA) to reduce  (AA) turnover in brain phospholipids of unanesthetized rats has been ascribed to its inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl)-mediated activation of AA to AA-CoA. Our aim was to identify a rat Acsl isoenzyme that could be inhibited by VPA in vitro.Rat Acsl3-, Acsl6v1- and Acsl6v2-, and Acsl4-flag proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the ability of VPA to inhibit their activation of long-chain   to acyl-CoA was estimated using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.VPA uncompetitively inhibited Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA and of docosahexaenoic (DHA) but not of palmitic  to acyl-CoA, but did not affect AA conversion by Acsl3, Acsl6v1 or Acsl6v2. Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA showed substrate inhibition and had a 10-times higher catalytic efficiency than did conversion of DHA to DHA-CoA. Butyrate, octanoate, or lithium did not inhibit AA activation by Acsl4.VPA's ability to inhibit Acsl4 activation of AA and of DHA to their respective acyl-CoAs, when related to the higher catalytic efficiency of AA than DHA conversion, may account for VPA's selective reduction of AA turnover in rat brain phospholipids, and contribute to VPA's efficacy against bipolar disorder.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The leukotrienes have a role in inflammatory diseases such as allergic rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma. Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, is claimed to be effective in asthma. The present study aimed to assess the role of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist on peripheral inflammation and whether montelukast treatment enhances the anti-inflammatory effect of indomethacin. Anti-inflammatory response was measured using a plethysmometer. Histopathologic examination for leukocyte accumulation was done. Montelukast (0.5-2mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant anti-inflammatory effect in dose dependent manner against formalin-induced rat paw oedema at 1h but not in 3 and 5 h. When indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p) was co-administered with montelukast (1 mg/kg, i.p), the anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin were significantly increased as compared to the per se effect at 3 and 5 hour after formalin challenge. In histopathology it has been found that combination therapy significantly decreased migration of leucocytes into the site of inflammation. These results show that montelukast has anti-inflammatory properties in peripheral tissue and markedly potentiates the anti-inflammatory activity of indomethacin at 3 and 5 h. It is expected that combination of montelukast with cyclooxygenase inhibitor would prove to be a novel approach to manage complex inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18059327>Effects of zileuton and montelukast in mouse experimental spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p>5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis from  (AA). Here, we examined the role of the 5-LO-product, cysteinyl-LT (Cys-LT), with a 5-LO inhibitor (zileuton) and a Cys-LT, receptor antagonist (montelukast), in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury (SCI).SCI was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a two-level T6 to T7 laminectomy for 1 min. Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators (ELISA) and apoptosis by annexin V, TUNEL, Fas ligand staining and Bax and Bcl-2 expression (immunohistochemistry and western blots). Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale, for 10 days after cord injury.SCI in mice resulted in tissue damage, oedema, neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in injured tissue. Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, TNF-alpha, COX-2 and pERK1/2 expression, PGE(2) and LTB(4) production, and apoptosis. In separate experiments, zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days.Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI.

Our previous screening of medicinal plants showed that methanol (MeOH) extract of Forsythiae Fructus had significant anti-inflammatory activity, but the active ingredients remain unclear. For isolation of active ingredient of MeOH extract of Forsythiae Fructus, it was partitioned with n-hexane and ethylacetate (EtOAc), and arctigenin was isolated from EtOAc fraction by column chromatography with anti-inflammatory activity-guided separation. Its activity was evaluated in the animal models of inflammation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activities in the edematous tissues homogenate, and silica-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the RAW 264.7 cell line. It was shown that arctigenin (100 mg/kg) had significantly decreased not only carrageenan-induced paw edema 3 and 4h after injection of carrageenan,  (AA)-induced ear edema at a painting dose of 0.1-1.0mg/ear, and acetic -induced writhing response and acetic -induced capillary permeability accentuation at an oral dose of 25-100, and 100 mg/kg, respectively, but also MPO and EPO activities at a painting dose of 0.1-1.0mg/ear in the AA-induced edematous tissues homogenate as indicators of neutrophils and eosinophils recruitment into the inflamed tissue. Further, arctigenin (0.1-10 microM) also significantly inhibited the intracellular ROS production by silica. These results indicate that arctigenin is a bioactive agent of Forsythiae Fructus having significant anti-inflammatory action by inhibition of the exudation, and leukocytes recruitment into the inflamed tissues. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of arctigenin may be due to the inhibition of release/production of inflammatory mediators such as AA metabolites and free radicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191591>Maternal long-chain PUFA supplementation during protein deficiency improves brain   accretion in rat pups by altering the milk   composition of the dam.</a></h2><p>Long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) are important for fetal and neonatal brain development. However, their accretion in the brain is compromised during maternal protein restriction. Hence, we investigated the effect of maternal supplementation with n-3 DHA plus n-6  (ARA) at a low protein level (9 %) on offspring brain   accretion using Wistar rats (nine rats per group) randomly fed a control (C), a low-protein (LP) or a low-protein DHA + ARA-supplemented (LPS) diet during gestation and lactation. At birth, pups from the LPS group had the highest brain DHA and n-3   levels (P = 0·001), whereas pups from the LP group had the highest MUFA (P = 0·05) but the lowest DHA and total n-3 PUFA levels (P = 0·000). During lactation, pups from the LPS group accrued significantly more α-linolenic  (P = 0·003), EPA (P = 0·02) and DHA (P = 0·000) in brain lipids than pups from the LP group, whereas brain lipids of pups from the LP group had markedly increased levels of the n-3 deficiency marker docosapentaenoic  and n-6:n-3 ratio (P = 0·000). Owing to supplementation, milk from LPS dams had the highest DHA and ARA, but lower  and medium-chain   as compared with milk from C and LP dams during early lactation, but normalised by mid-lactation. To conclude, adverse effects of restricted maternal protein intake on LC-PUFA accretion in the brain of offspring were ameliorated by alterations in maternal milk   profile due to supplementation. Results underscore the importance of LC-PUFA for protein-deficient mothers during gestation as well as lactation to achieve the optimum brain LC-PUFA status of progeny.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17089191>Activatory properties of lysophosphatidic  on human THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive leukocyte proliferation and proinflammatory mediators release represent common phenomena in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Multiple evidences identify lysophosphatidic  (LPA), a small lipid endowed with pleiotropic activities, as an important modulator of both proliferation and activation of different cell types involved in several inflammation-associated pathologies. However, its possible role on monocyte proinflammatory activation is not fully understood yet. Aim of the present study was to investigate LPA effects on THP-1 cells in terms of proliferation, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production and release of -derived inflammatory mediators. Actually, LPA significantly increased both DNA synthesis and ROI production as well as prostaglandin E(2) release and the upregulation of LPA(3) receptor expression.

The sPLA(2)-X(-/-) mice had a significant reduction in myocardial infarct size and a decrease in myocardial myeloperoxidase activity compared with sPLA(2)-X(+/+) mice. Myocardial infarct size was also significantly reduced in lethally irradiated sPLA(2)-X(+/+) mice reconstituted with sPLA(2)-X(-/-) bone marrow compared with sPLA(2)-X(+/+) bone marrow. The extent of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was comparable between sPLA(2)-X(-/-) and sPLA(2)-X(+/+) mice in Langendorff experiments using isolated hearts and blood-free perfusion buffer, supporting a potential role of sPLA(2)-X in blood in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. In the infarcted myocardium of sPLA(2)-X(+/+) mice, sPLA(2)-X was released from neutrophils but not myocardial tissues and platelets and was undetectable in the peripheral serum.

The attenuated functions of sPLA(2)-X(-/-) neutrophils were reversible by the exogenous addition of sPLA(2)-X protein. Furthermore, administration of a sPLA(2) inhibitor reduced myocardial infarct size and suppressed the cytotoxic activity of sPLA(2)-X(+/+) neutrophils.Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was attenuated in sPLA(2)-X(-/-) mice partly through the suppression of neutrophil cytotoxic activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248405>Targeting cysteinyl-leukotrienes in abdominal aortic aneurysm.</a></h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an asymptomatic dilatation of the vessel wall exceeding the normal vessel diameter by 50%, accompanied by intramural thrombus formation. Since the aneurysm can rupture, AAA is a life-threatening vascular disease, which may be amenable to surgical repair. At present, no pharmacological therapy for AAA is available. The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway of  metabolism leads to biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), potent lipid mediators with pro-inflammatory biological actions. Among the LTs, cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LT) are well-recognized signaling molecules in human asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, the effects of these molecules in cardiovascular diseases have only recently been explored. Drugs antagonizing the CysLT1 receptor, termed lukasts and typified by montelukast, are established therapeutics for clinical management of asthma. Lukasts are safe, well-tolerated drugs that can be administered during long time periods. Here we describe recent data indicating that montelukast may be used for prevention and treatment of AAA, thus representing a promising pharmacological tool for a deadly vascular disease with significant socio-economic impact.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Chemical characterization was carried out by HPLC-UV/DAD analysis. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using Croton oil-,  (AA)-, phenol-, ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)-, and capsaicin-induced ear edema models in mice. Histopathological evaluation and measurements of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) enzymes were also performed. Rutin, luteolin, and apigenin were identified in EAEVP. Topically applied HEVP and EAEVP significantly ( < 0.05,  < 0.01 or  < 0.001) reduced edema induced by five different irritants at the doses tested (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ear). Histopathological analysis revealed a reduction of edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vasodilation. In addition, the enzymes activity (MPO and NAG) in the ear tissues was reduced by the topical treatment of HEVP and EAEVP ( < 0.05,  < 0.01 or  < 0.001).

In the present study, the analgesic activity of myricetin, a major compound in Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc. leaves was evaluated in vivo. The analgesic effect of myricetin was tested by a serial of models, such as acetic -induced writhing response, formalin-induced paw licking and hot plate test. The sedative activity was evaluated by pentobarbital-induced sleep time. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen and  was also performed in vitro. Myricetin showed a significant inhibition on chemical nociceptive models such as the acetic -induced writhing response and the licking time on the late phase in the formalin test in a dose-dependent manner, but did not manifest a signicant effect in hot plate test. Myricetin was also not able to increase the sleeping time induced by pentobarbital, which further indicated that the analgesic effect of myricetin was unrelated to sedation. In addition, myricetin inhibited the content of PGE2 in the peritoneal fluid and platelet aggregation induced by collagen and  in vitro.

To probe potential markers and the underlying mechanism of DN, an animal model of DN, the db/db mice, was used and serum and urine metabolites were profiled using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Metabolic patterns were evaluated based on serum and urine data. Principal component analysis of the data revealed an obvious metabonomic difference between db/db mice and controls, and db/db mice showed distinctly different metabolic patterns during the progression from diabetes to early, medium, and later DN. The identified metabolites discriminating between db/db mice and controls suggested that db/db mice have perturbations in the tricarboxylic  cycle (TCA, citrate, malate, succinate, and aconitate), lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and amino  turnover. The db/db mice were characterized by acidic urine, high TCA intermediates in serum at week 6 and a sharp decline thereafter, and gradual elevation of free   in the serum. The sharp drop of serum TCA intermediates from week 6 to 8 indicated the downregulated glycolysis and insulin resistance. However, urinary TCA intermediates did not decrease in parallel with those in the serum from week 6 to 10, and an increased portion of TCA intermediates in the serum was excreted into the urine at 8, 10, and 12 wk than at 6 wk, indicating kidney dysfunction occurred.

In higher plants it is well established that these short-chain aldehydes are formed from C18   via actions of lipoxygenase and   hydroperoxide lyase, however, the biosynthetic pathway in marine algae has not been fully established yet. A brown alga, Laminaria angustata, forms relatively higher amounts of C6- and C9-aldehydes. When linoleic  was added to a homogenate prepared from the fronds of this algae, formation of n-hexanal was observed. When glutathione peroxidase was added to the reaction mixture concomitant with glutathione, the formation of n-hexanal from linoleic  was inhibited, and oxygenated   accumulated. By chemical analyses one of the major oxygenated   was shown to be (S)-13-hydroxy-(Z, E)-9, 11-octadecadienoic . Therefore, it is assumed that n-hexanal is formed from linoleic  via a sequential action of lipoxygenase and   hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), by an almost similar pathway as the counterpart found in higher plants HPL partially purified from the fronds has a rather strict substrate specificity, and only 13-hydroperoxide of linoleic , and 15-hydroperoxide of  are the essentially suitable substrates for the enzyme. By surveying various species of marine algae including Phaeophyta, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta it was shown that almost all the marine algae have HPL activity. Thus, a wide distribution of the enzyme is expected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24346824>Montelukast: a novel therapeutic option in eosinophilic peritonitis.</a></h2><p>Eosinophilic peritonitis is a recognised complication of peritoneal dialysis and has an incompletely understood pathophysiology. Current treatment options, including change of dialysate, change of peritoneal dialysis modality, steroids or antihistamines, are supported only by case reports with a lack of controlled trials or evidence-based guidelines. Leukotrienes are proinflammatory  metabolites produced by leucocytes and are involved in eosinophil chemotaxis. Montelukast is an orally administered leukotriene receptor antagonist commonly used in managing childhood atopic illnesses and theoretically safe for use in patients with renal failure.We describe the first reported case of recurrent, symptomatic, eosinophilic peritonitis in a 15-year-old girl successfully treated with leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast after changes in dialysate and treatment with antihistamines failed to adequately control eosinophilic peritoneal infiltrates or symptoms.Current scientific understanding of leukotrienes and eosinophil migration suggest that montelukast may be a well-tolerated, safe and efficacious treatment for eosinophilic peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis. Further cases and comparative studies are required to develop an evidence base for treatment of this condition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12800462>COX-LOX inhibition: current evidence for an emerging new therapy.</a></h2><p>Safe and effective drug treatment is an important objective of all doctors. In the treatment of arthritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs offer effective treatment but safety is significantly limited, largely due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Attention has recently focused on exploiting increased knowledge of metabolism of  to allow the development of safer anti-inflammatory drugs. Dual inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase are planned. These drugs may inhibit formation of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This review outlines the salient features of cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolism of . The role of the eicosanoids in mediating inflammation and gastrointestinal integrity is delineated. Evidence is presented regarding action of licofelone, one COX/LOX inhibitor that is currently in advanced stages of clinical trials.

In a rat ex vivo whole-blood calcium ionophore-induced LTB(4) assay, AM103 (administered orally at 1 mg/kg) displayed >50% inhibition for up to 6 h with a calculated EC(50) of approximately 60 nM. When rat lung was challenged in vivo with calcium ionophore, AM103 inhibited LTB(4) and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) production with ED(50) values of 0.8 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. In this model, the EC(50) derived from plasma AM103 was approximately 330 nM for inhibition of both LTB(4) and CysLT. In an acute inflammation setting, AM103 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of LTB(4), CysLT, and plasma protein extravasation induced by peritoneal zymosan injection. In a model of chronic lung inflammation using ovalbumin-primed and challenged BALB/c mice, AM103 reduced the concentrations of eosinophil peroxidase, CysLTs, and interleukin-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Finally, AM103 increased survival time in mice exposed to a lethal intravenous injection of platelet-activating factor. In summary, AM103 is a novel, potent and selective FLAP inhibitor that has excellent pharmacodynamic properties in vivo and is effective in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation and in a model of lethal shock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371369>Release of free F2-isoprostanes from esterified phospholipids is catalyzed by intracellular and plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases.</a></h2><p>F2-isoprostanes are produced in vivo by nonenzymatic peroxidation of  esterified in phospholipids. Increased urinary and plasma F2-isoprostane levels are associated with a number of human diseases. These metabolites are regarded as excellent markers of oxidant stress in vivo. Isoprostanes are initially generated in situ, i.e. when the arachidonate precursor is esterified in phospholipids, and they are subsequently released in free form. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the release of free isoprostanes after in situ generation in membrane phospholipids is, for the most part, unknown, this process is likely mediated by phospholipase A2 activity(ies). Here we reported that human plasma contains an enzymatic activity that catalyzes this reaction. The activity associates with high density and low density lipoprotein and comigrates with platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase on KBr density gradients. Plasma samples from subjects deficient in PAF acetylhydrolase do not release F2-isoprostanes from esterified precursors. The intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase II, which shares homology to the plasma enzyme, also catalyzes this reaction. We found that both the intracellular and plasma PAF acetylhydrolases have high affinity for esterified F2-isoprostanes. However, the rate of esterified F2-isoprostane hydrolysis is much slower compared with the rate of hydrolysis of other substrates utilized by these enzymes. Studies using PAF acetylhydrolase transgenic mice indicated that these animals have a higher capacity to release F2-isoprostanes compared with nontransgenic littermates. Our results suggested that PAF acetylhydrolases play key roles in the hydrolysis of F2-isoprostanes esterified on phospholipids in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317327> -related phylogeny of myxobacteria as an approach to discover polyunsaturated omega-3/6  .</a></h2><p>In an analysis of 47 aerobic myxobacterial strains, representing 19 genera in suborders Cystobacterineae, Nannocystineae, Sorangiineae, and a novel isolate, "Aetherobacter" SBSr008, an enormously diverse array of   (FAs) was found. The distribution of straight-chain   (SCFAs) and branched-chain   (BCFAs) supports the reported clustering of strains in the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA genes. This finding additionally allows the prediction and assignment of the novel isolate SBSr008 into its corresponding taxon. Sorangiineae predominantly contains larger amounts of  (57 to 84%) than BCFA. On the other hand, Cystobacterineae exhibit significant BCFA content (53 to 90%), with the exception of the genus Stigmatella. In Nannocystineae, the ratio of BCFA and  seems dependent on the taxonomic clade. Myxobacteria could also be identified and classified by using their specific and predominant FAs as biomarkers. Nannocystineae is remarkably unique among the suborders for its absence of hydroxy FAs. After the identification of  (AA) FA in Phaselicystidaceae, eight additional polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) belonging to the omega-6 and omega-3 families were discovered. Here we present a comprehensive report of FAs found in aerobic myxobacteria. Gliding bacteria belonging to Flexibacter and Herpetosiphon were chosen for comparative analysis to determine their FA profiles in relation to the myxobacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22003123>Conserved valproic--induced lipid droplet formation in Dictyostelium and human hepatocytes identifies structurally active compounds.</a></h2><p>Lipid droplet formation and subsequent steatosis (the abnormal retention of lipids within a cell) has been reported to contribute to hepatotoxicity and is an adverse effect of many pharmacological agents including the antiepileptic drug valproic  (VPA). In this study, we have developed a simple model system (Dictyostelium discoideum) to investigate the effects of VPA and related compounds in lipid droplet formation. In mammalian hepatocytes, VPA increases lipid droplet accumulation over a 24-hour period, giving rise to liver cell damage, and we show a similar effect in Dictyostelium following 30 minutes of VPA treatment. Using (3)H-labelled polyunsaturated () or saturated (palmitic)  , we shown that VPA treatment of Dictyostelium gives rise to an increased accumulation of both types of   in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and non-polar lipids in this time period, with a similar trend observed in human hepatocytes (Huh7 cells) labelled with [(3)H]. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of β-oxidation in Dictyostelium phenocopies   accumulation, in agreement with data reported in mammalian systems. Using Dictyostelium, we then screened a range of VPA-related compounds to identify those with high and low lipid-accumulation potential, and validated these activities for effects on lipid droplet formation by using human hepatocytes. Structure-activity relationships for these VPA-related compounds suggest that lipid accumulation is independent of VPA-catalysed teratogenicity and inositol depletion. These results suggest that Dictyostelium could provide both a novel model system for the analysis of lipid droplet formation in human hepatocytes and a rapid method for identifying VPA-related compounds that show liver toxicology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28441341>A Long-Term Treatment with Arachidonyl-2'-Chloroethylamide Combined with Valproate Increases Neurogenesis in a Mouse Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Rational polytherapy in the treatment of refractory epilepsy has been the main therapeutic modality for several years. In treatment with two or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is of particular importance that AEDs be selected based on their high anticonvulsant properties, minimal side effects, and impact on the formation of new neurons. The aim of the study was to conduct an in vivo evaluation of the relationship between treatments with synthetic cannabinoid arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) alone or in combination with valproic  (VPA) and hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy. All studies were performed on adolescent male CB57/BL mice with using the following drugs: VPA (10 mg/kg), ACEA (10 mg/kg), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF-a substance protecting ACEA against degradation by fatty  hydrolase, 30 mg/kg), pilocarpine (PILO, a single dose of 290 mg/kg) and methylscopolamine (30 min before PILO to stop peripheral cholinergic effects of pilocarpine, 1 mg/kg). We evaluated the process of neurogenesis after a 10-day treatment with ACEA and VPA, alone and in combination. We observed a decrease of neurogenesis in the PILO control group as compared to the healthy control mice. Furthermore, ACEA + PMSF alone and in combination with VPA significantly increased neurogenesis compared to the PILO control group. In contrast, VPA 10-day treatment had no impact on the level of neurons in comparison to the PILO control group. The combination of ACEA, PMSF and VPA considerably stimulated the process of creating new cells, particularly neurons, while chronic administration of VPA itself had no influence on neurogenesis in the mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy. The obtained results enabled an in vivo evaluation of neurogenesis after treatment with antiepileptic drugs in an experimental model of epilepsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17594136>Activatory properties of lysophosphatidic  on human THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Excessive leukocyte proliferation and proinflammatory mediators release represent common phenomena in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Multiple evidences identify lysophosphatidic  (LPA), a small lipid endowed with pleiotropic activities, as an important modulator of both proliferation and activation of different cell types involved in several inflammation-associated pathologies. However, its possible role on monocyte proinflammatory activation is not fully understood yet. Aim of the present study was to investigate LPA effects on THP-1 cells in terms of proliferation, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production and release of -derived inflammatory mediators. Actually, LPA significantly increased both DNA synthesis and ROI production as well as prostaglandin E(2) release and the upregulation of LPA(3) receptor expression. These findings identified LPA as both a growth factor and a triggering mediator of proinflammatory response in THP-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30059558>LASSBio-1586, an N-acylhydrazone derivative, attenuates nociceptive behavior and the inflammatory response in mice.</a></h2><p>Pain and inflammation are complex clinical conditions that are present in a wide variety of disorders. Most drugs used to treat pain and inflammation have potential side effects, which makes it necessary to search for new sources of bioactive molecules. In this paper, we describe the ability of LASSBio-1586, an N-acylhydrazone derivative, to attenuate nociceptive behavior and the inflammatory response in mice. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated through acetic -induced writhing and formalin-induced nociception tests. In these experimental models, LASSBio-1586 significantly (p<0.05) reduced nociceptive behavior. Several methods of acute and chronic inflammation induced by different chemical (carrageenan, histamine, croton oil, ) and physical (cotton pellet) agents were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of LASSBio-1586. LASSBio-1586 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity in all tests (p<0.05). Study of the mechanism of action demonstrated the possible involvement of the nitrergic, serotonergic and histamine signaling pathways. In addition, a molecular docking study was performed, indicating that LASSBio-1586 is able to block the COX-2 enzyme, reducing  metabolism and consequently decreasing the production of prostaglandins, which are important inflammatory mediators. In summary, LASSBio-1586 exhibited relevant antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential and acted on several targets, making it a candidate for a new multi-target oral anti-inflammatory drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24915501>Prevalence and mechanism of polyunsaturated aldehydes production in the green tide forming macroalgal genus Ulva (Ulvales, Chlorophyta).</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase mediated transformations convert polyunsaturated   into various oxylipins. First, lipoxygenases catalyze   oxidation to   hydroperoxides. Subsequently, breakdown reactions result in a wide array of metabolites with multiple physiological and ecological functions. These   transformations are highly diverse in marine algae and play a crucial rule in e.g., signaling, chemical defense, and stress response often mediated through polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs). In this study, green tide-forming macroalgae of the genius Ulva (Chlorophyta) were collected at various sampling sites in the lagoon of the Ria Formosa (Portugal) and were surveyed for PUAs. We demonstrated that sea-lettuce like but not tube-like morphotypes produce elevated amounts of  C10-polyunsaturated aldehydes (2,4,7-decatrienal and 2,4-decadienal) upon tissue damage. Moreover, morphogenetic and phylogenetic analyses of the collected Ulva species revealed chemotaxonomic significance of the perspective biosynthetic pathways. The aldehydes are derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) with 20 or 18 carbon atoms including eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3),  (C20:4 n-6), stearidonic  (C18:4 n-3), and γ-linolenic  (C18:3 n-6).

Leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an important cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT), is a powerful pro-inflammatory mediator formed from . However, little information regarding the effects of LTD4 on the pathogenesis of osteoporosis has been reported before. In the present study, we defined the physiological roles of LTD4 in cellular senescence in osteoblasts. Our results indicate that LTD4 treatment decreased the expression of SIRT1 in a dose-dependent manner in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Additionally, LTD4 significantly increased the expression of p53, p21 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). LTD4 was also found to elevate the activity of β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) but to prevent BrdU incorporation. Our results indicate that cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (cysLT1R) could be detected in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. However, cysLT2R was not expressed in these cells. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of cysLT1R or use of the selective cysLT1R antagonist montelukast abolished the LTD4-induced reduction in SIRT1 and increase in p53, p21, and PAI-1. Notably, knockdown of cysLT1R by transfection with cysLT1R siRNA or treatment with montelukast attenuated the LTD4-induced increase in SA-β-Gal activity. Our study shows for the first time that LTD4 has a significant impact on cellular senescence in osteoblasts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Some 20 odor-active peaks were detected, and 17 odorants were identified or tentatively identified. Among the perceived odorants, most of them were newly identified from the Wagyu beef. The main constituents of the potent odorants were aldehydes and ketones, which are known as the degradation products of polyunsaturated   that were significantly included in the lipids of the Wagyu.

Poly(dimethylsiloxane)/divinylbenzene fiber was used in the HS-SPME. Changes in the  compounds of oxidized porcine liver and unsaturated   induced by iron were examined. Results showed that 1-octen-3-one (metallic), hexanol (weak metallic), 1-octen-3-ol (mushroomlike), (E)-2-nonenal (cardboardlike), and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (, oily) were the main contributors to the overall off-flavor of porcine liver. The results of the sensory evaluation revealed that oxidized  has a major impact on metallic and liverlike off-flavor and that when liverlike off-flavor is perceived, metallic is also included. Oxidized linolenic  was the most important contributor to the objectionable fishy off-flavor. Oxidized porcine liver exhibited distinct metallic, liverlike, and weak fishy background notes. Liverlike flavor had a high correlation coefficient with odor characteristics such as metallic (0.839) and fishy (0.777).

We investigated the effects of licofelone on cardiovascular derangements and production of thromboxane (Tx)A(2) induced by the inflammatory agonist n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) in the rabbit, in comparison with those of aspirin or rofecoxib, inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. In control rabbits, injection of fMLP (30 nmol/kg) in the jugular vein evokes ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in the first 1-5 min, i.e. a profound depression of the ST segment and inversion of the T wave. Simultaneously, fMLP induces bradycardia and hypotension and increases TxB(2) blood levels. All changes are transient. Licofelone (60 mg/kg/5 days, p.os) prevented fMLP-induced ECG ischemic changes in all treated animals, reverted bradycardia and hypotension, and significantly reduced TxB(2). Aspirin (10 mg/kg/5 days, p.os) prevented ischemic ECG alterations in 2 out of 5 treated animals and did not modify either bradycardia or hypotension. One rabbit died two min after fMLP. In 2 rabbits, aspirin reduced TxB(2) levels by more than 80% respect to mean control values; the remaining two rabbits produced an amount of TxB(2) similar to controls. These two rabbits also showed ischemic ECG changes. Rofecoxib (10 mg/kg/5 days, p.os) did not prevent fMLP-induced ischemic ECG alteration, bradycardia and hypotension, and did not significantly modify the increase of TxB(2). These results indicate that the capacity of licofelone to efficiently suppress TxA(2) production, is responsible for the protection from the cardiovascular derangement triggered by an inflammatory stimulus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16948471>Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of aryl-acetic and hydroxamic  as novel lipoxygenase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of the leukotrienes.

Simple stable molecules containing the hydroxamic  functionality have been shown to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase. In fact, several hydroxamates are orally active inhibitors of the enzyme as determined by their ability to block the biosynthesis of leukotriene in vivo. In order to establish the inhibitory utility of simple hydroxamates several omega-phenylalkyl and omega-naphthylalkyl hydroxamic  were synthesized. In an attempt to expand and delineate these results we tried to synthesize some more for a further pharmacochemical study. Since lipophilicity is a significant physicochemical property determining distribution, bioavailability, metabolic activity and elimination, we tried to determine experimentally their lipophilicity from RPTLC method. The compounds are tested in vitro on: a) soybean lipoxygenase inhibition, b) interaction with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) stable free radical, c) the HO* radical mediated oxidation of DMSO, d) inhibition of lipid peroxidation, e) scavenging of superoxide anion radicals f) interaction with glutathione and g) in vivo for the inhibition of carrageenin induced rat paw edema.

This study examined the implication of 5-lipoxygenase pathway and angiogenic factors in hepatic fibrosis progression and whether, the inhibition of  cascade product (cysteinyl leukotrienes) can represent a potential target for therapy. Cholestasis and subsequent fibrosis was induced by common bile duct ligation and resection (BDL) for 5 weeks in rats. After surgery, Cysteinyl leukotrienes antagonist (montelukast) was orally and daily administrated (10 mg/kg) for 34 days. Sham operated and drug control groups received either saline or montelukast immediately after operation. BDL significantly increased liver hydroxyproline (Hp), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-(k )ss), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ss), tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase (TIMP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and reduced the level of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). On the other hand, montelukast treatment reversed all these biochemical parameters and ameliorated histopathological changes which previously induced by BDL. Findings of the present study suggest that montelukast treatment may favor collagenolytic activity through modulating hepatic expression of TGFss-, NF-(k)ss, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio.

The present study was aimed to investigate the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties of B. crispa.Male rats (220-270 gm,) and mice (25-30 gm) were randomly divided into different groups (n = 6). Various doses of plant extract of B. crispa, its fractions and pure compounds isolated from the plant were administered intraperitoneally (i.p). The analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet activities were assessed using acetic  and formalin-induced nociception in mice, carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and -induced platelets aggregation tests.The intraperitoneal administration of the methanolic extract (50 and 100 mg/kg), hexane fraction (10 and 25 mg/kg i.p) exhibited significant inhibition (P < 0.01) of the acetic -induced writhing in mice and attenuated formalin-induced reaction time of animals in second phase of the test. Pure compounds BdI-2, BdI-H3 and BH-3 isolated from B. crispa produced significant (P < 0.01) analgesic activity in acetic -induced and formalin tests. The crude extract of B. crispa (50-200 mg/kg i.p.) and its hexane fraction inhibited carrageenan-induced rat paw edema with maximum inhibition of 65 and 71% respectively (P < 0.01).

Certain chemical functionality such as the carboxylic  is a general liability for BBB permeability preventing significant CNS distribution of a drug from a systemic dose. Here, we report a strategy for CNS-selective distribution of the carboxylic  containing thyromimetic sobetirome using prodrugs targeted to - amide hydrolase (FAAH), which is expressed in the brain. Two amide prodrugs of sobetirome were shown to be efficient substrates of FAAH with V/K values comparable to the natural endocannabinoid FAAH substrate anandamide. In mice, a systemic dose of sobetirome prodrug leads to a substantial ∼60-fold increase in brain distribution (K) of sobetirome compared to an equimolar systemic dose of the parent drug. The increased delivery of sobetirome to the brain from the prodrug was diminished by both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in vivo. The increased brain exposure of sobetirome arising from the prodrug corresponds to ∼30-fold increased potency in brain target engagement compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that FAAH-targeted prodrugs can considerably increase drug exposure to the CNS with a concomitant decrease in systemic drug levels generating a desirable distribution profile for CNS acting drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16250016>Expression of the mechanosensitive 2PK+ channel TREK-1 in human osteoblasts.</a></h2><p>TREK-1 is a mechanosensitive member of the two-pore domain potassium channel family (2PK+) that is also sensitive to lipids, free   (including ), temperature, intracellular pH, and a range of clinically relevant compounds including  anaesthetics. TREK-1 is known to be expressed at high levels in excitable tissues, such as the nervous system, the heart and smooth muscle, where it is believed to play a prominent role in controlling resting cell membrane potential and electrical excitability. In this report, we use RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to confirm that human derived osteoblasts and MG63 cells express TREK-1 mRNA and protein. In addition, we show gene expression of TREK2c and TRAAK channels. Furthermore, whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology demonstrates that these cells express a spontaneously active, outwardly rectifying potassium "background leak" current that shares many similarities to TREK-1. The outward current is largely insensitive to TEA and Ba2+, and is sensitive to application of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). In addition, blocking TREK-1 channel activity is shown to upregulate bone cell proliferation. It is concluded that human osteoblasts functionally express TREK-1 and that these channels contribute, at least in part, to the resting membrane potential of human osteoblast cells. We hypothesise a possible role for TREK-1 in mechanotransduction, leading to bone remodelling.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17549353>Overexpression of cysteinyl LT1 receptor in prostate cancer and CysLT1R antagonist inhibits prostate cancer cell growth through apoptosis.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of  by either cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase is believed to play an important role in carcinogenesis. Leukotriene (LT) D4 is a proinflammmatory mediator derived from  through various enzymatic steps, and 5-lipoxygenase is an important factor in generating LTD4. We investigated LTD4 receptor (cysteinyl LT1 receptor: CysLT1R) expression in prostate cancer (PC), as well as the effects of CysLT1R antagonist on cell proliferation in PC cell lines. CysLT1R expression in PC patients, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and normal prostate (NP) tissues were examined. CysLT1R expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Effects of CysLT1R antagonist on PC cell growth were examined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to determine whether or not the CysLT1R antagonist induces apoptosis. Initially, only slight CysLT1R expression was detected in BPH and NP tissues and marked CysLT1R expression was detected in PIN and PC tissues. CysLT1R expression was higher in high-grade cancer than in low-grade cancer. Furthermore, CysLT1R antagonist caused marked inhibition of PC cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner through early apoptosis. In conclusion, CysLT1R is induced in PC, and the results suggest that CysLT1R antagonist may mediate potent anti-proliferative effects of PC cells. Thus, the target of CysLT1R may become a new therapy in the treatment of PC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090924>Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (CysLT) antagonists decrease pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures and blood-brain barrier dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Current evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. In line with this view, selected pro-inflammatory  derivatives have been reported to facilitate seizures. Kainate-induced seizures are accompanied by leukotriene formation, and are reduced by inhibitors of LOX/COX pathway. Moreover, LTD4 receptor blockade and LTD4 synthesis inhibition suppress pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling and pilocarpine-induced recurrent seizures. Although there is convincing evidence supporting that blood-brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction facilitates seizures, no study has investigated whether the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast is associated with its ability to maintain BBB integrity. In this study we investigated whether montelukast and other CysLT receptor antagonists decrease PTZ-induced seizures, as well as whether these antagonists preserve BBB during PTZ-induced seizures. Adult male albino Swiss mice were stereotaxically implanted with a cannula into the right lateral ventricle, and two electrodes were placed over the parietal cortex along with a ground lead positioned over the nasal sinus for electroencephalography (EEG) recording. The effects of montelukast (0.03 or 0.3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), pranlukast (1 or 3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), Bay u-9773 (0.3, 3 or 30 nmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), in the presence or absence of the agonist LTD4 (0.2, 2, 6 or 20 pmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), on PTZ (1.8 μmol/2 μL)-induced seizures and BBB permeability disruption were determined. The animals were injected with the antagonists, agonist or vehicle 30 min before PTZ, and monitored for additional 30 min for the appearance of seizures by electrographic and behavioral methods. BBB permeability was assessed by sodium fluorescein method and by confocal microscopy for CD45 and IgG immunoreactivity. Bay-u9973 (3 and 30 nmol), montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) and pranlukast (1 and 3 μmol), increased the latency to generalized seizures and decreased the mean amplitude of EEG recordings during seizures. LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) reverted the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast (0.3 μmol). Montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) prevented PTZ-induced BBB disruption, an effect that was reversed by LTD4 at the dose of 6 pmol, but not at the doses 0.2 and 2 pmol. Moreover, the doses of LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) that reverted the effect of montelukast on seizures did not alter montelukast-induced protection of BBB, dissociating BBB protection and anticonvulsant activity. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that 1. PTZ increased the number of CD45+ and double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cerebral cortex, indicating BBB leakage with leukocyte infiltration; 2. while LTD4 (6 pmol) potentiated, montelukast decreased the effect of PTZ on leukocyte migration and BBB, assessed by double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cannulated hemisphere. Our data do not allow us ruling out that mechanisms unrelated and related to BBB protection may co-exist, resulting in decreased seizure susceptibility by montelukast. Notwithstanding, they suggest that CysLT1 receptors may be a suitable target for anticonvulsant development.Copyright © 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the early events taking place in immune cells after L-carnitine inoculation in vitro are defined in this report. Using  as a   source, we determined the utilization rate of L-carnitine by murine T-, B-lymphocytes and macrophages within two hours of cell culture, its effect on prostaglandin E1 and E2 production and the levels of beta-hydroxy-butyrate. The results show that although all immune cells consume a small portion of L-carnitine, beta-hydroxy-butyrate decreases upon addition of  and/or L-carnitine indicating that active biosynthetic pathways are induced. L-carnitine is shown to increase the -induced production of prostaglandins E1 and E2 in macrophages, while their secretion from T- and B-lymphocytes is decreased. These findings indicate the L-carnitine may very rapidly alter the activation state of immune cells and lead to the development of various reactions, beneficial or not to the organism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15044038>Licofelone, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, specifically inhibits cyclooxygenase-1-dependent platelet activation.</a></h2><p>5-Lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitors, possessing anti-inflammatory action and gastric safety due to cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase inhibition and antiplatelet activity due to cyclooxygenase-1 blockade, would be beneficial in the treatment of ischemic disease because they may reduce, at the same time, inflammation, underlying the atherosclerotic process, and platelet activation, responsible for acute thrombotic events. In this study, we characterized the antiplatelet effects of the new 5-lipoxygenase/cyclooxygenase inhibitor licofelone ([2,2-dimethyl-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-phenyl-2,3,dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-5-yl]-acetic . Licofelone completely prevented platelet aggregation induced in platelet-rich plasma by threshold aggregating concentrations of  (0.87+/-0.14 mM) at threshold inhibitory concentrations of 0.75+/-0.35 microM (n=5). Platelet-rich plasma aggregation induced by threshold aggregating concentrations of collagen/adrenalin (0.3+/-0.05 microg/ml and 0.4+/-0.1 microM, respectively) was reduced to 3.2+/-2% of control at licofelone 100 microM, (P<0.05, n=6). Washed platelet aggregation induced by threshold aggregating concentrations of thrombin (0.07+/-0.01 U/ml) was only partially affected by licofelone at concentrations one or two order of magnitude higher than those fully preventing -induced aggregation (44+/-11% of control at 100 microM, P<0.05, n=7). Failure to prevent aggregation triggered by high concentrations of collagen/adrenalin in aspirin-treated platelets supports cyclooxygenase-1 as a specific target of licofelone. In fact, licofelone inhibited thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) production by all the agonists tested at concentrations between 0.5 and 50 microM. At this concentration, TxB(2) production was reduced at values similar to those of unstimulated platelets. These results indicate that, at clinically relevant concentrations, licofelone exerts a potent antiplatelet effect mediated by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29634113>CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF THE RED SEA SOFT CORAL SARCOPHYTON TROCHELIOPHORUM.</a></h2><p>The present study describes the in vitro cytotoxic effects of soft coral (Sarcophyton tiocheliophorum).

Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic  (VPA) is an environmental risk factor of ASD. Male rats prenatally exposed to VPA show socio-emotional autistic-like dysfunctions that have been related to changes in the activity of the endocannabinoid anandamide. Here, we have investigated if prenatal VPA induced sex-specific autistic endophenotypes involving anandamide signalling.We studied sex-specific differences in the ASD-like socio-emotional, cognitive and repetitive symptoms displayed during development of Wistar rats of both sexes, prenatally exposed to VPA. The involvement of anandamide was followed by Western blotting of cannabinoid CB receptors and by inhibiting its metabolism.Female rats were less vulnerable to the deleterious effects of prenatal VPA exposure on social communication, emotional reactivity and cognitive performance than male rats. Conversely, as observed in male rats, prenatal VPA exposure induced selective deficits in social play behaviour and stereotypies in the female rat offspring. At the neurochemical level, prenatal VPA exposure altered phosphorylation of CB receptors in a sex-specific, age-specific and tissue-specific manner. Enhancing anandamide signalling through inhibition of its degradation reversed the behavioural deficits displayed by VPA-exposed animals of both sexes.These findings highlight sexually dimorphic consequences of prenatal VPA exposure that may be related to sex-specific effects of VPA on endocannabinoid neurotransmission in the course of development and introduce a new therapeutic target for reversing autistic-like symptoms in both sexes.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349441>Association between sn-2 fatty  profiles of breast milk and development of the infant intestinal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that host diet and gut microbes are related. Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%), oleic  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C,  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period. The above results provided important information for designing the configuration of FAs in next-generation formulas for Chinese infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373735>Enhancing the pharmacodynamic profile of a class of selective COX-2 inhibiting nitric oxide donors.</a></h2><p>We report herein the development, synthesis, physicochemical and pharmacological characterization of a novel class of pharmacodynamic hybrids that selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoform and present suitable nitric oxide releasing properties.

Despite recent advances in medical therapeutics, treatment of patients with COPD remains largely symptomatic. Although inhaled corticosteroids are currently the drug of choice for anti-inflammatory therapy, the inflammatory process in COPD is essentially steroid resistant. By now, COPD has been increasingly recognized as an inflammatory disease characterized by sputum neutrophilia and, in some cases, eosinophilia. Moreover other cell types thought to play the predominant role in COPD, are cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ T) cells and macrophages. Leukotriene B4, (LTB 4), a neutrophil and T cell chemoattractant which is produced by macrophages, neurophils and epithelial cells, is a potent inflammatory mediator. Also cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) are known to induce mucus secretion, inflammatory cell infiltration, increase vascular permeability and tissue edema, damage ciliary clirens, and cause severe bronchoconstriction. These are derivatives of , metabolized via 5-lypoxygenase (5-LO) pathway. There are several sites along this pathway that antileukotriene agents exert their action and at the end-organ receptors. They are classified into two major categories: receptor antagonists and synthesis inhibitors. Beneficial effects on therapy of patients with COPD have already derived from studies, while they seem well tolerated.

High lung cys-leukotriene levels may be a contributing factor towards the increase in oxygen toxicity. We investigated the effect of cysteinyl-leukotriene inhibition using the receptor antagonist, montelukast (MK, Singulair), on hyperoxia-induced changes in lung parenchymal structure in neonatal rat pups. Rat pups were exposed to 21% O(2) (air) or 50% O(2) (moderate hyperoxia) from days 1-14 after birth, and were administered the cys-leukotriene receptor antagonist MK (1 mg/kg/day) or normal saline from days 4-14. Somatic growth and morphometric measurements were done on day 15. There was a significant increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cysteinyl-leukotriene levels (+61.9%) when animals were exposed to hyperoxia. O(2) exposure significantly decreased the specific internal surface area by 13%. There was a nonsignificant 5.8% and 19.6% increase in mean chord length and mean alveolar diameter, respectively, as well as an 8.6% decrease in lung volume to body weight ratio.

PLA(2) are present in the atherosclerotic plaques and their direct involvement in the proatherogenic inflammatory response is well documented. Epidemiological and genetic studies have demonstrated the correlation of the PLA(2) mass and enzymatic activity with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. The potential pro-atherogenic role of PLA(2) led to the development of two small molecules, varespladib, a reversible sPLA(2) inhibitor, and darapladib, a selective Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor. Both molecules have demonstrated antiatherosclerotic properties in animal models, and positive effects on atherosclerotic plaque composition evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials. On these grounds, the results of three phase 3 studies have recently been published: the VISTA-16 study with varespladib in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and the STABILITY and SOLID-TIMI 52 studies with darapladib in patients with stable coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome, respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro effects of licofelone on platelet function. Effects observed were compared with those produced by the classic COX-1 inhibitor aspirin (ASA).Platelet aggregation was assessed by a turbidimetric method. Platelet haemostatic performance was studied with the platelet function analyser (PFA-100), using collagen epinephrine and collagen ADP cartridges. Interaction of platelets with thrombogenic surfaces was analysed by perfusion experiments performed under flow conditions using both parallel and annular chambers.Licofelone prolonged the lag time of platelet aggregation induced by  and reduced maximal platelet aggregation induced by ADP or collagen. Studies using PFA-100 demonstrated that licofelone (0.1, 1 and 10 muM) significantly prolonged closure times (P < 0.05) with both types of cartridges. In studies with the parallel chamber exposing purified collagen, both licofelone and ASA significantly reduced (P < 0.05) overall platelet interaction with the thrombogenic surface. In studies performed in annular chamber exposing a highly thrombogenic vessel surface, licofelone reduced height and area of the platelet masses deposited (7.0 +/- 0.5 mum; P < 0.005 and 80.2 +/- 17.3 mum; P < 0.05 vs. control 10.6 +/- 0.9 mum and 194.8 +/- 44.7 mum, respectively).

The experiments were designed according to the standard procedure to investigate the activity of ASA. HT-AC and HT inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen or  in both whole blood and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). ASA and HT-AC had a greater effect in whole blood than in PRP when ADP or collagen was used as inducer. ASA and HT-AC had a greater effect in PRP+leucocytes than in PRP alone. All three compounds inhibited platelet thromboxane B2 and leucocyte 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha (6-keto-PF1 alpha) production. The thromboxane/6-keto-PGF1alpha inhibition ratio (as an indirect index of the prostanoid equilibrium) was 10.8 (SE 1) for HT-AC, 1.0 (SE 0.1) for HT and 3.3 (SE 0.2) for ASA. All three compounds stimulated nitric oxide production, although HT was a weaker effect. In our experiments only concentrations higher than 500 microm (HT) or 1 mm (HT-AC and ASA) inhibited 3-nitrotyrosine production. All three compounds inhibited the production of TNFalpha by leucocytes, with no significant differences between them.

Increased dietary intake of ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated   (LCPUFA) reduces retinal neovascularization and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), but ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of a major metabolizing pathway, cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP) 2C, promote ocular pathological angiogenesis. We hypothesized that inhibition of CYP2C activity will add to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on neovascular eye diseases.The mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy and laser-induced CNV were used to investigate pathological angiogenesis in the retina and choroid, respectively. The plasma levels of ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of CYP2C were determined by mass spectroscopy. Aortic ring and choroidal explant sprouting assays were used to investigate the effects of CYP2C inhibition and ω-3 LCPUFA-derived CYP2C metabolic products on angiogenesis ex vivo. We found that inhibition of CYP2C activity by montelukast added to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on retinal neovascularization and CNV by 30% and 20%, respectively. In CYP2C8-overexpressing mice fed a ω-3 LCPUFA diet, montelukast suppressed retinal neovascularization and CNV by 36% and 39% and reduced the plasma levels of CYP2C8 products. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition, which blocks breakdown and inactivation of CYP2C ω-3 LCPUFA-derived active metabolites, increased oxygen-induced retinopathy and CNV in vivo. Exposure to selected ω-3 LCPUFA metabolites of CYP2C significantly reversed the suppression of both angiogenesis ex vivo and endothelial cell functions in vitro by the CYP2C inhibitor montelukast.Inhibition of CYP2C activity adds to the protective effects of ω-3 LCPUFA on pathological retinal neovascularization and CNV.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857162>The influence of n-3 polyunsaturated   and very low calorie diet during a short-term weight reducing regimen on weight loss and serum   composition in severely obese women.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated   of n-3 series (n-3 PUFA) were shown to increase basal fat oxidation in humans.

The arylidene derivatives (IIa-d) were reduced by hydrogen at room temperature using palladium (10 %/carbon) as catalyst to produce 6-aryl-4-oxohexanoic  (IIIa-d) as target compounds. In certain instances, the lactone derivative (IVd) was obtained as a low-melting by-product. These compounds were tested in two models used for evaluating the activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The first test is the effect of the synthesized compounds on  metabolism in vitro using human whole blood assay. The second is the in vivo carrageenan induced rat paw edema test.

LY333013 is a potent inhibitor of sPLA2. This study examined the impact of two doses of LY333013 vs. placebo on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction following inhaled allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics. Fifty subjects were randomly assigned to treatment, and 40 subjects completed the study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, random order, crossover study design was used. LY333013 had no impact on the primary outcome variables of the areas under the FEV1 response curve early (0-3 hours) (AUC(early)) and late (3-8 hours) (AUC(Iate)) following inhaled allergen challenge. No significant drug-related adverse effects were observed. The response to inhaled allergen challenge was reproducible and confirms the utility of this technique as a model in which to screen compounds for further testing in asthmatic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226605>Measurement of F2-isoprostanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic products, and oxysterols from a single plasma sample.</a></h2><p>Oxidized lipids such as F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  products (HETEs), and cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) are widely believed to be involved in multiple diseases. Usually, each product is measured individually in separate blood samples. In this study we describe a method allowing us to measure F2-IsoPs, HETEs, COPs, and arachidonate using a single sample. Plasma (1 ml) samples from healthy volunteers were diluted with heavy isotopic standards, hydrolyzed in alkali with organic solvent, and then subjected to anionic-exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE). After the SPE column was washed, hexane and hexane/ethyl acetate portions were collected and combined for COPs measurement. Thereafter the column was loaded with hexane/ethanol/acetic  and fractions were collected for total F2-IsoPs, total HETEs, and arachidonate measurement. All compounds in the eluates were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The efficiency of SPE and reproducibility for all compounds measured were high. Levels of total F2-IsoPs (0.45+/-0.26 ng/ml (n=157)), total HETEs (34.06+/-16.35 ng/ml (n=21)), total arachidonate (68.36+/-24.45 microg/ml (n=33)), and COPs (7-ketocholesterol, 12.25+/-6.56 ng/ml; 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, 6.32+/-3.46 ng/ml; 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 15.06+/-7.06 ng/ml; 24-hydroxycholesterol, 41.39+/-18.22 ng/ml; and 27-hydroxycholesterol, 29.08+/-16.79 ng/ml (n=26)) were recorded in healthy subjects (age range 20 to 66 years; average male to female ratio 1:1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604175>Synthesis and pharmacochemical evaluation of novel aryl-acetic  inhibitors of lipoxygenase, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory agents.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase catalyzes the first two steps of the transformation of  into leukotrienes which are implicated in host defense reactions. It is well known that many  possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. Taking into account that compounds bearing a thienyl, naphthyl, pyrollyl, and 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol moieties possess anti-inflammatory activity which is related to their capacity to transfer electrons and to scavenge reactive oxygen species, we synthesized some new aryl-acetic  and we explored their ability to inhibit soybean lipoxygenase, to present antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and to interact with glutathione. The compounds have shown important antioxidant activity, medium anti-inflammatory activity, and very good inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase. Compound 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-phenyl-acrylic  (1i) showed significant in vitro LO inhibition (IC(50) 65 microM).

It has been shown that they can be modulated by an extraordinarily diverse range of endogenous and exogenous factors. One particular member of the family, TREK-1 (also known as KCNK2), is activated by increasing temperature, membrane stretch and internal acidosis, but is also sensitive to the presence of certain polyunsaturated   (such as ), neuroprotectants (such as riluzole) and  and gaseous general anaesthetics (such as halothane and nitrous oxide). It has recently been reported that TREK-1 channels are also affected by oxygen concentrations, and that at the levels of hypoxia that occur in the normal human brain, the channels greatly change their properties and, for example, lose their ability to be modulated by  and internal acidosis. These reports seriously challenge the idea that TREK-1 is a target for general anaesthetics and neuroprotectants. However, in this report we show that TREK-1 is not oxygen sensitive, and its ability to be activated by anaesthetics,  and internal acidosis remains unaltered under conditions of hypoxia.

The anti-inflammatory agents of GE, however, remain unclear. In this experiment, MeOH extracts of GE were fractionated with organic solvents for the anti-inflammatory activity-guided separation of GE. Eight phenolic compounds from the ether (EtOEt) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fractions were isolated by column chromatography: 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (I), 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (II), benzyl alcohol (III), bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) methane (IV), 4(4'-hydroxybenzyloxy)benzyl methylether (V), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol (VI), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (VII), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic  (VIII). To investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity of these compounds, their effects on carrageenan-induced paw edema,  (AA)-induced ear edema and analgesic activity in acetic  (HAc)-induced writhing response were carried out in vivo; cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL 2H3) cells and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydroazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity were determined in vitro. These phenolic compounds not only had anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in vivo, but also inhibited COX activity and silica-induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner. Among these phenolic compounds, compound VII was the most potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Compound VII significantly inhibited silica-induced ROS generation and compound VI significantly increased DPPH radical scavenging activity. Compounds I, II and III significantly inhibited the activity of COX-I and II. These results indicate that phenolic compounds of GE are anti-inflammatory, which may be related to inhibition of COX activity and to anti-oxidant activity. Consideration of the structure-activity relationship of the phenolic derivatives from GE on the anti-inflammatory action revealed that both C-4 hydroxy and C-3 methoxy radicals of benzyl aldehyde play an important role in anti-inflammatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515928>Prevention of Escherichia coli K1 penetration of the blood-brain barrier by counteracting the host cell receptor and signaling molecule involved in E. coli invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli meningitis is an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and a key contributing factor is our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of E. coli meningitis. We have shown that E. coli penetration into the brain requires E. coli invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), which constitute the blood-brain barrier. E. coli invasion of HBMEC involves its interaction with HBMEC receptors, such as E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) interaction with its receptor, the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), and host signaling molecules including cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha). In the present study, we showed that treatment with etoposide resulted in decreased expression of 67LR on HBMEC and inhibited E. coli invasion of HBMEC. Pharmacological inhibition of cysteinyl leukotrienes, lipoxygenated products of  released by cPLA(2)alpha, using montelukast (an antagonist of the type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor) also inhibited E. coli invasion of HBMEC. E. coli penetration into the brain was significantly decreased by etoposide as well as by montelukast, and a combination of etoposide and montelukast was significantly more effective in inhibiting E. coli K1 invasion of HBMEC than single agents alone. These findings demonstrate for the first time that counteracting the HBMEC receptor and signaling molecule involved in E. coli invasion of HBMEC provides a novel approach for prevention of E. coli penetration into the brain, the essential step required for development of E. coli meningitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347600>Mode of action of mood stabilizers: is the  cascade a common target?</a></h2><p>Bipolar disorder is a major medical, social and economic burden worldwide. However, the mechanisms of action of effective antibipolar disorder drugs remain elusive. In this paper, we review studies using a neuropharmacological approach in unanesthetized rats, combined with kinetic, biochemical and molecular biology techniques, showing that chronic administration of three Food and Drug Administration-approved mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate and carbamazepine) at therapeutically relevant doses, selectively target the brain  (AA) cascade. Whereas chronic lithium and carbamazepine decrease the binding activity of activator protein-2 and in turn the transcription, translation and activity of its AA-selective calcium-dependent phospholipase A(2) gene product, valproate appears to be a non-competitive inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. The net overlapping effects of the three drugs are decreased turnover of AA but not of docosahexaenoic  in rat brain phospholipids, and decreased brain cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E(2). Although these observations support the hypothesis proposed by Rapoport and colleagues that the AA cascade is a common target of mood stabilizers, this hypothesis is not necessarily exclusive of other targets. Targeting the AA cascade with drugs or diet may be a useful therapeutic approach in bipolar disorder, and examining the AA cascade in patients might help in better understanding the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17680922>Chronic treatment of rats with sodium valproate downregulates frontal cortex NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and COX-2 mRNA.</a></h2><p>Valproic  (VPA) is used to treat bipolar disorder, but its mechanism of action is not clear. VPA shares many cellular and molecular targets with lithium, including reducing  turnover in rat brain phospholipids and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein level and activity in rat brain.We examined the effect of chronic VPA administration (200 mg/kg body weight for 30 days) to produce therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations, on transcription factors (NF-kappaB, AP-1, AP-2, C/EBP, CREB, and ETS) that are known to regulate the COX-2 gene.Chronic VPA significantly increased AP-1 DNA binding activity and decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, p50 subunit protein and mRNA expression of COX-2 in frontal cortex compared with untreated control rats. It did not alter AP-2, C/EBP, ETS or CREB DNA binding activity.VPA downregulates NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, likely by decreasing the p50 protein levels. This effect may explain its downregulation of COX-2 mRNA. The decrease in NF-kappaB activity by chronic VPA may affect other NF-kappaB-regulated genes and may be related to VPA's action in bipolar disorder. Chronic VPA may decrease the reported increased brain NF-kappaB components in bipolar patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27057092>Anti-Inflammatory and Antinociceptive Activities of Anthraquinone-2-Carboxylic .</a></h2><p>Anthraquinone compounds are one of the abundant polyphenols found in fruits, vegetables, and herbs. However, the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity and molecular mechanisms of anthraquinones have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the activity of anthraquinones using acute inflammatory and nociceptive experimental conditions. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic  (9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracenecarboxylic , AQCA), one of the major anthraquinones identified from Brazilian taheebo, ameliorated various inflammatory and algesic symptoms in EtOH/HCl- and acetylsalicylic - (ASA-) induced gastritis, -induced edema, and acetic -induced abdominal writhing without displaying toxic profiles in body and organ weight, gastric irritation, or serum parameters. In addition, AQCA suppressed the expression of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 in stomach tissues and lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) treated RAW264.7 cells. According to reporter gene assay and immunoblotting analyses, AQCA inhibited activation of the nuclear factor- (NF-) κB and activator protein- (AP-) 1 pathways by suppression of upstream signaling involving interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK1), p38, Src, and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Our data strongly suggest that anthraquinones such as AQCA act as potent anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive components in vivo, thus contributing to the immune regulatory role of fruits and herbs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249480>Effect of retinoic  on gene expression in human conjunctival epithelium: secretory phospholipase A2 mediates retinoic  induction of MUC16.</a></h2><p>How vitamin A contributes to the maintenance of the wet-surfaced phenotype at the ocular surface is not well understood. This study sought to identify vitamin A-responsive genes in ocular surface epithelia using gene microarray analysis of cultures of a human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cell line grown with all-trans-retinoic  (RA). The analysis showed that secretory phospholipase A(2) group IIA (sPLA(2)-IIA) was the gene most upregulated by RA, followed by the membrane-associated mucin MUC16 at a later time point. Since eicosanoids, the product of  generated by the PLA(2) family, have been shown to increase mucin production, this study sought to determine whether sPLA(2) mediates the RA induction of MUC16.HCjE cells were cultured with or without RA for 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours. Complementary RNA prepared from RNA of the HCjE cells was hybridized to human gene chips and analyzed using commercial software. Microarray data on mucin expression were validated by real-time PCR. To investigate whether sPLA(2) is associated with RA-induced MUC16 upregulation, HCjE cells were incubated with RA and the broad-spectrum PLA(2) inhibitor aristolochic  (ArA) or the specific sPLA(2)-IIA inhibitor LY315920, followed by analysis of MUC16 mRNA and protein by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.After RA addition, 28 transcripts were upregulated and 6 downregulated by more than twofold (P < 0.01) at both 3 and 6 hours (early phase). Eighty gene transcripts were upregulated and 45 downregulated at both 24 and 48 hours (late phase). Group IIA sPLA(2), significantly upregulated by 24 hours, and MUC16 were the most upregulated RNAs by RA at 48 hours. sPLA(2) upregulation by RA was confirmed by Western blot analysis. When HCjE cells were incubated with RA plus ArA or specific inhibitor of sPLA(2)-IIA, LY315920, the RA-induced MUC16 mRNA was significantly reduced (P < 0.01).The RA-associated upregulation of membrane-associated mucin MUC16 at late phase appears to be through sPLA(2)-IIA. Upregulation of this hydrophilic membrane-associated mucin may be one of the important mechanisms by which vitamin A facilitates maintenance of the wet-surfaced phenotype on the ocular surface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18775807>Impact of the anti-inflammatory agent bindarit on the chemokinome: selective inhibition of the monocyte chemotactic proteins.</a></h2><p>Bindarit is an indazolic derivative that is devoid of any immunosuppressive effects and has no effect on  metabolism. However, it has been proved to have anti-inflammatory activity in a number of experimental diseases, including pancreatitis, arthritis, and lupus nephritis. This therapeutic effect has been associated with its ability to interfere selectively with monocyte recruitment, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we comprehensively examine the effect of bindarit on the chemokine system, and report that in activated monocytes and endothelial cells, it selectively inhibits the production of the monocyte chemotactic protein subfamily of CC inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-2/CCL8). The capacity of bindarit to inhibit the production of a defined set of related CC chemokines by monocytes and endothelial cells likely underlies the anti-inflammatory activity of this agent in disease. The exploitation of the chemokine system as drug target in inflammatory disease has relied mainly on the development of receptor antagonists and blocking antibodies. Here we report on the use of inhibition of synthesis as a potentially viable and selective approach to modify the chemokine system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120445>Anti-inflammatory activity of methanolic extracts from Ventilago harmandiana Pierre.</a></h2><p>Methanolic extracts from the heart wood, stem bark, and stem wood of Ventilago harmandiana Pierre (Family Rhamnaceae) were assessed for anti-inflammatory effects using both acute and chronic inflammatory models. Analgesic and antipyretic activities of the extracts were also evaluated. It was found that all extracts possessed strong inhibitory effects on the acute phase of inflammation as seen in ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)- and  (AA)-induced ear edema as well as in carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats. The extracts elicited only weak inhibitory activity on cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation, a subchronic inflammatory model. In the analgesic test, all extracts exerted pronounced inhibitory activity in acetic -induced writhing response but showed only weak effects in the tail-flick test. The extracts also showed excellent antipyretic activity on yeast-induced hyperthermia in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16006105>UCM707, an inhibitor of the anandamide uptake, behaves as a symptom control agent in models of Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis, but fails to delay/arrest the progression of different motor-related disorders.</a></h2><p>To date, UCM707, (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-N-(3-furylmethyl)eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenamide, has the highest potency and selectivity in vitro and in vivo as inhibitor of the endocannabinoid uptake. This may enable this compound to potentiate endocannabinoid transmission, with minimal side effects, in the treatment of several neurological disorders. In the present study, we examined whether the treatment with UCM707 produced beneficial effects, as other cannabinoid-related compounds have already shown, to alleviate motor deterioration or to delay/arrest neurodegeneration, in several models of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). UCM707 exhibited a notable anti-hyperkinetic activity in a rat model of HD generated by bilateral intrastriatal application of 3-nitropropionic . This effect was possibly associated with an amelioration of GABA and glutamate deficits induced by the toxin in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra, respectively. However, UCM707 did not protect against the death of GABAergic neurons that occurs in rats with striatal atrophy generated by unilateral application of malonate, another animal model of HD, which is more useful to test neuroprotective strategies. In addition, UCM707 did not provide neuroprotection in rats with unilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, a rat model of PD. This was possibly due to the fact that UCM707 is devoid of anti-oxidant properties since another uptake inhibitor, AM404, that has these properties acted as a protective agent. Lastly, UCM707 was also unable to inhibit the development of the neurological impairment of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an acute model of MS. However, UCM707, like other endocannabinoid uptake inhibitors reported previously, significantly reduced spasticity of the hindlimbs in a chronic relapsing EAE mice, a chronic model of MS. In summary, UCM707 might be a promising compound in HD to alleviate motor symptoms, which represents an important goal considering the current lack of efficient pharmacological treatments in this basal ganglia disorder. However, the compound was unable to delay neurodegeneration in this disorder and also in PD. In addition, UCM707 did not produce any neurological recovery from inflammatory attack in an EAE rat model of MS, although it retained the classic anti-spastic action shown by other uptake inhibitors in the EAE mouse model of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342048>PPARα autocrine regulation of Ca²⁺-regulated exocytosis in guinea pig antral mucous cells: NO and cGMP accumulation.</a></h2><p>In antral mucous cells, acetylcholine (ACh, 1 μM) activates Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis, consisting of a peak in exocytotic events that declines rapidly (initial phase) followed by a second slower decline (late phase) lasting during ACh stimulation. GW7647 [a peroxisome proliferation activation receptor α (PPARα) agonist] enhanced the ACh-stimulated initial phase, and GW6471 (a PPARα antagonist) abolished the GW7647-induced enhancement. However, GW6471 produced the delayed, but transient, increase in the ACh-stimulated late phase, and it also decreased the initial phase and produced the delayed increase in the late phase during stimulation with ACh alone. A similar delayed increase in the ACh-stimulated late phase is induced by an inhibitor of the PKG, Rp8BrPETcGMPS, suggesting that GW6471 inhibits cGMP accumulation. An inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), N(5)-[imino(propylamino)methyl]-L-ornithine hydrochloride (N-PLA), also abolished the GW7647-induced-enhancement of ACh-stimulated initial phase but produced the delayed increase in the late phase. However, in the presence of N-PLA, an NO donor or 8BrcGMP enhanced the ACh-stimulated initial phase and abolished the delayed increase in the late phase. Moreover, GW7647 and ACh stimulated NO production and cGMP accumulation in antral mucosae, which was inhibited by GW6471 or N-PLA. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that NOS1 and PPARα colocalize in antral mucous cells. In conclusion, during ACh stimulation, a PPARα autocrine mechanism, which accumulates NO via NOS1 leading to cGMP accumulation, modulates the Ca(2+)-regulated exocytosis in antral mucous cells.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17313706>p-Coumaric , a common dietary phenol, inhibits platelet activity in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>p-Coumaric  (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic ; 4CA), is a ubiquitous plant metabolite with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The antiplatelet activity of this compound was analysed both ex vivo and in vitro. 4-CA, administered to rabbits for 2 weeks at the dose of 5 mg/kg, mixed with food, inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting blood coagulation. This effect was associated with a marked increase in plasma antioxidant activity, measured as ferric reducing ability of plasma, and with the reduction of thromboxane B2 production. The antiplatelet effect was confirmed by in vitro experiments on human blood: 4CA (500 microM and 1 mM) reduced ADP-induced platelet aggregation (55 x 2 (se 4 x 01) % and 35 x 6 (se 2 x 35) % relative to basal level, respectively). 4CA was able to modify platelet function, measured with PFA-100, a shear-inducing device that simulates primary haemostasis. 4CA interfered also with  cascade, reducing thromboxane B2 production and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 generation (ic50 371 and 126 microM, respectively). The data show that 4CA is an antioxidant compound with good antiplatelet activity at doses that can be obtained with dietary intervention, suggesting possible applications for primary prevention of vascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18044077>Activity and potential role of licofelone in the management of osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It is a progressive joint disease associated with aging. It may be found in the knees, hips, or other joints. It is estimated that costs associated with osteoarthritis exceed 2% of the gross national product in developed countries. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory disease and are among the most widely used drugs worldwide. The main limitation in using NSAIDs consists in their side-effects, including gastrointestinal ulcerogenic activity and bronchospasm. The mechanism of action of these drugs is attributed to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), and, consequently, the conversion of  into prostaglandins. It is hypothesized that the undesirable side-effects of NSAIDs are due to the inhibition of COX-1 (constitutive isoform), whereas the beneficial effects are related to the inhibition of COX-2 (inducible isoform).  can also be converted to leukotrienes (LTs) by the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Licofelone, a LOX/COX competitive inhibitor, decreases the production ofproinflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins (which are involved in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and in gastrointestinal (GI) damage induced by NSAIDs) and has the potential to combine good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects with excellent GI tolerability. Preliminary data with this drug seem promising, but further well-designed clinical trials of this agent in the elderly will be necessary before a final evaluation is possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26189969>Acetic  in aged vinegar affects molecular targets for thrombus disease management.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the mechanism underlying the action of dietary vinegar on antithrombotic activity, acetic , the main acidic component of dietary vinegar, was used to determine antiplatelet and fibrinolytic activity. The results revealed that acetic  significantly inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-, collagen-, thrombin-, and  (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. Acetic  (2.00 mM) reduced AA-induced platelet aggregation to approximately 36.82 ± 1.31%, and vinegar (0.12 mL L(-1)) reduced the platelet aggregation induced by AA to 30.25 ± 1.34%. Further studies revealed that acetic  exerts its effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and the formation of thromboxane-A2. Organic  including acetic , formic , lactic , citric , and malic  also showed fibrinolytic activity; specifically, the fibrinolytic activity of acetic  amounted to 1.866 IU urokinase per mL. Acetic  exerted its fibrinolytic activity by activating plasminogen during fibrin crossing, thus leading to crosslinked fibrin degradation by the activated plasmin. These results suggest that organic  in dietary vinegar play important roles in the prevention and cure of cardiovascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16344985>Valproic  selectively inhibits conversion of  to arachidonoyl-CoA by brain microsomal long-chain  acyl-CoA synthetases: relevance to bipolar disorder.</a></h2><p>Several drugs used to treat bipolar disorder (lithium and carbamazepine), when administered chronically to rats, reduce the turnover of , but not docosahexaenoic , in brain phospholipids by decreasing the activity of an -selective phospholipase A(2). Although chronic valproic  produces similar effects on brain  and docosahexaenoic  turnover, it does not alter phospholipase A(2) activity, suggesting that it targets a different enzyme in the turnover pathway.By isolating rat brain microsomal long-chain  acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl), we show in vitro that valproic  is a non-competitive inhibitor of Acsl, as it reduces the maximal velocity of the reaction without changing the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. While valproic  inhibited the synthesis of arachidonoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and docosahexaenoyl-CoA, the K (i )for inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA synthesis (14.1 mM) was approximately one fifth the K (i) for inhibiting palmitoyl-CoA (85.4 mM) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (78.2 mM) synthesis. As chronic administration of valproic  in bipolar disorder achieves whole-brain levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mM, inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA formation can occur at brain concentrations that are therapeutically relevant to this disease. Furthermore, brain microsomal Acsl did not produce valproyl-CoA.This study shows that valproic  acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of brain microsomal Acsl, and that inhibition is substrate-selective. The study supports the hypothesis that valproic  acts in bipolar disorder by reducing the brain  cascade, by inhibiting arachidonoyl-CoA formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20447827>Characterization of 4-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-6-yl acetate as an effective antiplatelet agent.</a></h2><p>We have studied earlier a membrane bound novel enzyme Acetoxy Drug: protein transacetylase identified as Calreticulin Transacetylase (CRTAase) that catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from polyphenolic acetates (PAs) to the receptor proteins and thus modulating their biological activities. In this communication, we have reported for the first time that acetoxy quinolones are endowed with antiplatelet action by virtue of causing CRTAase catalyzed activation of platelet Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) by way of acetylation leading to the inhibition of ADP/ (AA)-dependent platelet aggregation. The correlation of specificity of platelet CRTAase to various analogues of acetoxy quinolones with intracellular NO and consequent effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation was considered crucial. Among acetoxy quinolones screened, 6-AQ (4-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-6-yl acetate/6-acetoxyquinolin-2-one, 22) was found to be the superior substrate to platelet CRTAase and emerged as the most active entity to produce antiplatelet action both in vitro and in vivo. 6-AQ caused the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1) resulting in the down regulation of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Structural modification of acetoxy quinolones positively correlated with enhancement of intracellular NO and antiplatelet action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17434479>Synergistic antinociception by the cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide and the PPAR-alpha receptor agonist GW7647.</a></h2><p>The analgesic properties of cannabinoid receptor agonists are well characterized. However, numerous side effects limit the therapeutic potential of these agents. Here we report a synergistic antinociceptive interaction between the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide and the synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonist 2-(4-(2-(1-Cyclohexanebutyl)-3-cyclohexylureido)ethyl)phenylthio)-2-methylpropionic  (GW7647) in a model of acute chemical-induced pain. Moreover, we show that anandamide synergistically interacts with the large-conductance potassium channel (KCa1.1, BK) activator isopimaric . These findings reveal a synergistic interaction between the endocannabinoid and PPAR-alpha systems that might be exploited clinically and identify a new pharmacological effect of the BK channel activator isopimaric .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14981656>Colorado potato beetles show differential digestive compensatory responses to host plants expressing distinct sets of defense proteins.</a></h2><p>Herbivorous insects fed plants expressing proteinase inhibitors (PIs) compensate for the loss of digestive proteolytic functions by producing novel proteinases. We assessed here whether such compensatory responses represent a general, non-specific adaptation to defense-related proteins in host plant tissues, or if distinct responses occur depending on the stress exerted on the plant. As a model, growth, development, and digestive proteases of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) were monitored after feeding larvae with plants pre-treated with either methyl jasmonate or , two compounds inducing different sets of defense genes in potato. In brief, larvae fed plants treated with jasmonate or arachidonate were negatively affected compared to larvae fed non-treated plants, suggesting the potency of both molecules to induce partial resistance to potato beetles in potato. On the other hand, larvae fed treated plants partially compensated for the presence of defense-related proteins by adapting their digestive proteolytic system, both quantitatively and qualitatively. These compensatory processes varied depending on the treatment, the larvae fed arachidonate-treated plants showing the most dramatic response. Compensation to jasmonate and arachidonate was also influenced by a cysteine PI from rice expressed in the plant, pointing out the possible indirect effects of recombinant defense proteins on naturally-occurring plant-insect interactions. These observations, while showing the potential of jasmonate and arachidonate as inducers of partial resistance to the potato beetle in potato, also suggest that digestive compensation in herbivorous insects is determined, at least in part, by defense-related compounds found in the plant in response to different stress stimuli or as a result of ectopic expression in transgenic plants.Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15643555>Improved production of galanthamine and related alkaloids by methyl jasmonate in Narcissus confusus shoot-clumps.</a></h2><p>Liquid-shake cultured shoot-clumps of Narcisus confussus were treated with the commonly used biotic elicitors methyl jasmonate, , chitosan and salicylic . The effects of these compounds on the growth of the explants, as well as on the amount of the alkaloids released to the liquid culture medium and accumulated in the tissues at the end of the experiment were studied. The obtained results showed that, in general, high doses of these compounds had a negative effect on the growth of the explants, particularly the salicylic . On the contrary, the addition of methyl jasmonate, mainly at 25 microM, promoted the release of galanthamine and other related alkaloids to the liquid medium in proportions of up to 300% in relation to the control explants, and also their accumulation in tissues.

This study determined the effect of blocking TPr with S18886 or inhibiting cyclooxygenase with aspirin on oxidative stress and the early stages of nephropathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice. Diabetic mice were treated with S18886 (5 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1)) or aspirin (30 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1)) for 6 weeks. Neither S18886 nor aspirin affected hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia. There was intense immunohistochemical staining for nitrotyrosine in diabetic mouse kidney. In addition, a decrease in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity was associated with an increase in MnSOD tyrosine-34 nitration. Tyrosine nitration was significantly reduced by S18886 but not by aspirin. Staining for the NADPH oxidase subunit p47(phox), inducible nitric oxide synthase, and 12-lipoxygenase was increased in diabetic mouse kidney, as were urine levels of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha). S18886 attenuated all of these markers of oxidant stress and inflammation. Furthermore, S18886 significantly attenuated microalbuminuria in diabetic mice and ameliorated histological evidence of diabetic nephropathy, including transforming growth factor-beta and extracellular matrix expression. Thus, in contrast to inhibiting cyclooxygenase, blockade of TPr may have therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy, in part by attenuating oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285599>Vascular metabolism of anandamide to  affects myogenic constriction in response to intraluminal pressure elevation.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that  produced by anandamide breakdown contributes to the vascular effects of anandamide.Isolated, pressurized rat skeletal muscle arteries, which possess spontaneous myogenic tone, were treated with anandamide, , capsaicin (vanilloid receptor agonist), WIN 55-212-2 (cannabinoid receptor agonist), URB-597 (FAAH inhibitor), baicalein (lipoxygenase inhibitor), PPOH (cytochrome P450 inhibitor), and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Changes in the arteriolar diameter in response to the various treatments were measured. To assess the effect of anandamide metabolism, anandamide was applied for 20 min followed by washout for 40 min. This protocol was used to eliminate other, more direct effects of anandamide in order to reveal how anandamide metabolism may influence vasodilation.Anandamide at a low dose (1μM) evoked a loss of myogenic tone, while a high dose (30 μM) not only attenuated the myogenic response but also evoked acute dilation. Both of these effects were inhibited by the FAAH inhibitor URB-597 and were mimicked by . The CB1 and CB2 agonist R-WIN 55-212-2 and the vanilloid receptor agonist capsaicin were without effect on the myogenic response. The inhibition of the myogenic response by anandamide was blocked by indomethacin and PPOH, but not by baicalein or removal of the endothelium. FAAH expression in the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.Anandamide activates the  pathway in the microvasculature, affecting vascular autoregulation (myogenic response) and local perfusion.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, new anti-inflammatory formulation containing S. deltoides extract as a major ingredient was prepared and in vivo activity was evaluated. The plausible action mechanism was also investigated. The new formulation (SAG) contains 1 part of S. deltoides extract, 0.9 part of Angelica gigas extract and 0.9 part of glucosamine sulfate (w/w). SAG inhibited dose-dependently edematic response of  (AA)- and 12-O-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate (TPA)-induced ear edema in mice, which is an animal model of acute inflammation. SAG showed 44.1% inhibition of AA-induced ear edema at an oral dose of 50 mg/kg. In an animal model of chronic inflammation, SAG clearly reduced the edematic response of 7-day model of multiple treatment of TPA (38.1% inhibition at 200 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, SAG (50-800 mg/kg/day) as well as S. deltoides extract (285 mg/kg/day) significantly inhibited prostaglandin E2 production from the skin lesion of the animals of 7-day model. These results were well correlated with in vitro finding that SAG as well as S. deltoides extract reduced cyclooxygenase (COX)-1- and COX-2-induced prostanoid production, measured in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Therefore, these results suggest that SAG possesses anti-inflammatory activity in vivo against acute as well as chronic inflammatory animal models at least in part by inhibition of prostaglandin production through COX-1/COX-2 inhibition. And COX inhibition of SAG is possibly contributed by S. deltoides extract among the ingredients. Although the anti-inflammatory potencies of SAG were less than those of currently used anti-inflammatory drugs, this formulation may have beneficial effect on inflammatory disorders as a neutraceutical.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230635>Valproic  modulates platelet and coagulation function ex vivo.</a></h2><p>: Trauma-induced coagulopathy is associated with adverse patient outcome. Animal models demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic  (VPA), improve survival following injury. While in-vivo data suggest that improved survival may in part be because of an attenuation of coagulopathy, it remains unknown whether this is a direct effect of the drug, or the establishment of an overall prosurvival phenotype. We thus conducted an ex-vivo experiment to determine if VPA has an effect on coagulation and platelet function. Ten swine were subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS). Blood samples were drawn prior to TBI+HS insult (Healthy group) and 2 h following TBI+HS (Shock group). Samples were incubated with VPA or vehicle controls for 1 h. Platelet aggregation was analyzed via impedance aggregometry and coagulation was measured using thromboelastography. Addition of VPA to the healthy blood did not affect platelet aggregation or coagulation parameters. In shock blood, incubation with VPA significantly reduced collagen-(P = 0.050), -(P = 0.005), and adenosine diphosphate-(P = 0.023) induced platelet aggregation. VPA also significantly increased the clot strength (P = 0.002) and clot formation rate (P = 0.011). This is the first study to investigate the effect of VPA on platelet function ex vivo. Our results suggest that VPA has no effect on normal blood, but it decreases platelet activation and improves clot dynamics (strength and rate of formation) in blood from shocked animals. This suggests that VPA is capable of exerting a selective platelet sparing effect while enhancing the clot integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574784>Mechanism of the attenuation of proteolysis-inducing factor stimulated protein degradation in muscle by beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate.</a></h2><p>The leucine metabolite beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) prevents muscle protein degradation in cancer-induced weight loss through attenuation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, the action of HMB on protein breakdown and intracellular signaling leading to increased proteasome expression by the tumor factor proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) has been studied in vitro using murine myotubes as a surrogate model of skeletal muscle. A comparison has been made of the effects of HMB and those of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), a known inhibitor of PIF signaling. At a concentration of 50 mumol/L, EPA and HMB completely attenuated PIF-induced protein degradation and induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, as determined by the "chymotrypsin-like" enzyme activity, as well as protein expression of 20S proteasome alpha- and beta-subunits and subunit p42 of the 19S regulator. The primary event in PIF-induced protein degradation is thought to be release of  from membrane phospholipids, and this process was attenuated by EPA, but not HMB, suggesting that HMB might act at another step in the PIF signaling pathway. EPA and HMB at a concentration of 50 mumol/L attenuated PIF-induced activation of protein kinase C and the subsequent degradation of inhibitor kappaBalpha and nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor kappaB. EPA and HMB also attenuated phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase by PIF, thought to be important in PIF-induced proteasome expression. These results suggest that HMB attenuates PIF-induced activation and increased gene expression of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, reducing protein degradation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19439586>A transient receptor potential-like channel mediates synaptic transmission in rod bipolar cells.</a></h2><p>On bipolar cells are connected to photoreceptors via a sign-inverting synapse. At this synapse, glutamate binds to a metabotropic receptor which couples to the closure of a cation-selective transduction channel. The molecular identity of both the receptor and the G protein are known, but the identity of the transduction channel has remained elusive. Here, we show that the transduction channel in mouse rod bipolar cells, a subtype of On bipolar cell, is likely to be a member of the TRP family of channels. To evoke a transduction current, the metabotropic receptor antagonist LY341495 was applied to the dendrites of cells that were bathed in a solution containing the mGluR6 agonists L-AP4 or glutamate. The transduction current was suppressed by ruthenium red and the TRPV1 antagonists capsazepine and SB-366791. Furthermore, focal application of the TRPV1 agonists capsaicin and anandamide evoked a transduction-like current. The capsaicin-evoked and endogenous transduction current displayed prominent outward rectification, a property of the TRPV1 channel. To test the possibility that the transduction channel is TRPV1, we measured rod bipolar cell function in the TRPV1(-/-) mouse. The ERG b-wave, a measure of On bipolar cell function, as well as the transduction current and the response to TRPV1 agonists were normal, arguing against a role for TRPV1. However, ERG measurements from mice lacking TRPM1 receptors, another TRP channel implicated in retinal function, revealed the absence of a b-wave. Our results suggest that a TRP-like channel, possibly TRPM1, is essential for synaptic function in On bipolar cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29232862>Effect of Oxylipins, Terpenoid Precursors and Wounding on Soft Corals' Secondary Metabolism as Analyzed via UPLC/MS and Chemometrics.</a></h2><p>The effect of three oxylipin analogues, a terpenoid intermediate and wounding on the secondary metabolism of the soft corals  and  was assessed. Examined oxylipins included prostaglandin (PG-E1), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and  (AA) in addition to the diterpene precursor geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGP). Post-elicitation, metabolites were extracted from coral heads and analyzed via UPLC-MS followed by multivariate data analyses. Both supervised and unsupervised data analyses were used for sample classification. Multivariate data analysis revealed clear segregation of PG-E1 and MeJA elicited  at 24 and 48 h post elicitation from other elicitor samples and unelicited control group. PG-E1 was found more effective in upregulating  terpene/sterol levels compared to MeJA. Metabolites showing upregulation in  include campestene-triol and a cembranoid, detected at ca. 30- and 2-fold higher levels compared to unelicited corals. Such an elicitation effect was less notable in the other coral species  suggesting a differential oxylipin response in soft corals. Compared to MeJA and PG, no elicitation effect was observed for GGP, AA or wounding on the metabolism of either coral species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082030>Antinociceptive and antiinflammatory activities of Artemisia copa extracts.</a></h2><p>The aqueous extract from aerial parts of Artemisia copa Phil.

A dose-related antinociceptive response was obtained in the writhing test at doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg p.o. (percentage of inhibition 23.3 and 52.70, respectively). The extract also inhibited the second phase of formalin test (38.81%) and this effect was not antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone 5mg/kg i.p.

Dichloromethane and ethanolic extracts, were analyzed for antiinflammatory activity with the carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and the ear edema induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) and  (AA) in mice. Both extracts showed antiinflammatory activity in the TPA (88 and 54%), and the ethanolic extract showed a 37% inhibition in AA test. No effects were seen at doses of 300 mg/kg p.o. and 100 mg/kg i.p. in the carrageenan test.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA; N-(2-chloroethyl)-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenamide, a highly selective cannabinoid CB(1) receptor agonist) on the threshold for electroconvulsions and the anticonvulsant activity of valproate in the maximal electroshock-induced seizures in mice. To inhibit the rapid metabolic degradation of ACEA by the - amide hydrolase, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was used at a constant ineffective dose of 30 mg/kg (i.p.). Moreover, the effects of ACEA and PMSF on the acute adverse-effect profile of valproate were determined in the chimney test. Additionally, the adverse-effect potentials of combination of ACEA, PMSF with valproate were examined in the step-through passive avoidance task (long-term memory) and grip-strength test (neuromuscular strength). To ascertain any pharmacokinetic contribution of ACEA and PMSF to the observed interaction between tested drugs, both free (non-protein bound) plasma and total brain concentrations of valproate were estimated. Results indicated that ACEA (5 and 7.5 mg/kg; i.p.) combined with PMSF increased significantly (P<0.001) the electroconvulsive threshold in mice. ACEA at low doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p., with PMSF had no impact on threshold for electroconvulsions. Similarly, neither PMSF (30 mg/kg) nor ACEA (15 mg/kg) administered alone affected the electroconvulsive threshold in mice. Moreover, ACEA (at a subthreshold dose of 2.5 mg/kg; i.p.) co-administered with PMSF potentiated significantly the antielectroshock activity of valproate by reducing its ED(50) from 258.3 to 195.1 mg/kg (P<0.01). Isobolographic transformation of data revealed that the interactions between valproate and ACEA (at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) combined with PMSF were additive. In the chimney test, the combination of ACEA (2.5 mg/kg) and PMSF (30 mg/kg) had no effect on acute adverse effect of valproate and its TD(50) (356.4 mg/kg) did not differ significantly from that for valproate administered alone (TD(50)=404.4 mg/kg). Moreover, none of the examined drugs administered either alone or in combinations produced long-term memory deficits in the step-through passive avoidance task and impaired neuromuscular strength in the grip-strength test in mice. In contrast, ACEA (2.5 mg/kg; i.p.) combined with PMSF (30 mg/kg; i.p.) considerably increased both, the free plasma (by 42%; P<0.01) and total brain (by 49%; P<0.001) concentrations of valproate (administered at 195 mg/kg; i.p.) in mice. Hence, the observed interaction between valproate and ACEA with PMSF in the maximal electroshock test was pharmacokinetic in nature. Finally, based on this preclinical study, one can conclude that ACEA--a cannabinoid CB(1) receptor agonist co-administered with PMSF pharmacokinetically interacted with valproate and thus, providing the enhancement of the antielectroshock activity of valproate in mice, although, the isobolographically determined interaction between drugs was additive. To elucidate the protective role of cannabinoids in the brain during seizures, more advanced neurochemical studies are required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23306154>Evaluation of anti-inflammatory drug-conjugated silicon quantum dots: their cytotoxicity and biological effect.</a></h2><p>Silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) have great potential for biomedical applications, including their use as biological fluorescent markers and carriers for drug delivery systems. Biologically inert Si-QDs are less toxic than conventional cadmium-based QDs, and can modify the surface of the Si-QD with covalent bond. We synthesized water-soluble alminoprofen-conjugated Si-QDs (Ap-Si). Alminoprofen is a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used as an analgesic for rheumatism. Our results showed that the "silicon drug" is less toxic than the control Si-QD and the original drug. These phenomena indicate that the condensed surface integration of ligand/receptor-type drugs might reduce the adverse interaction between the cells and drug molecules. In addition, the medicinal effect of the Si-QDs (i.e., the inhibition of COX-2 enzyme) was maintained compared to that of the original drug. The same drug effect is related to the integration ratio of original drugs, which might control the binding interaction between COX-2 and the silicon drug. We conclude that drug conjugation with biocompatible Si-QDs is a potential method for functional pharmaceutical drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22366210>Cysteinyl leukotrienes mediate the response of submucosal ganglia from rat colon to bradykinin.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to find out the mechanism by which the inflammatory mediator, bradykinin, induces an increase of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in enteric neurons. For this purpose, ganglia in the isolated submucosa from rat colon were loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye, fura-2, and were exposed to bradykinin (2·10(-8)mol/l). Under control conditions, the kinin evoked a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Preincubation with quinacrine or arachidonyltrifluoromethylketone (AACOCF(3)), i.e. blockers of cytosolic phospholipase A(2), prevented the raise of [Ca(2+)](i). This inhibition was mimicked by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetrayonic  (ETYA), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenases as well as lipoxygenases, and by BWA4C, a selective inhibitor of lipoxygenases, whereas indomethacin was ineffective, suggesting the mediation of the kinin response by a lipoxygenase metabolite. Indeed, a leukotriene, leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)), mimicked the effect of bradykinin. The LTD(4) receptor blocker, MK-571, inhibited the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) evoked by LTD(4) and by bradykinin. Consequently, bradykinin receptors in submucosal ganglia from rat colon are coupled to a stimulation of phospholipase A(2), the release of  and the production of LTD(4), which seems to be finally responsible for the change in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report, for the first time, that the dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor licofelone triggers apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCA-7 colon cancer cells. Induction of apoptosis was related to the recruitment of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as shown by loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and 3 activation and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 cleavage. Moreover, licofelone induced the cleavage of the full-length p21(Bax) into p18(Bax), a more potent inducer of the apoptotic process than the uncleaved form. Pre-treatment of HCA-7 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly blocked licofelone-induced apoptosis, confirming that this process occurred primarily in a caspase-dependent pathway. We also present evidences that licofelone was able to affect the  (AA) cascade, as it blocked the activity of 5-LOX and COX enzymes, and it induced, through the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), the release of unesterified AA from HCA-7 membrane phospholipids. However, apoptosis induction was not related to the ability of licofelone to affect the AA cascade, since neither exogenous prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4) addition, nor pharmacological inhibition of cPLA(2), was able to rescue HCA-7 cells from apoptosis. Even if further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of licofelone-induced apoptosis, this study suggests that this drug, as well as similar dual COX/5-LOX inhibitors, may represent a novel and promising approach in colon cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30119268>Potential role of leukotriene receptor antagonists in reducing cardiovascular and cerbrovascular risk: A systematic review of human clinical trials and in vivo animal studies.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are important lipid mediators of inflammation arising from  cascade.

Although statins are widely used for treatment of hyperlipidemia, side effects associated with their use have prompted the search for a safer alternative for treating hyperlipidemia. The present study investigated the effect of water-soluble compounds in Abana (WSCA), a polyherbal drug formulation traditionally used in India for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, on lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. WSCA reduced cholesterol and triglyceride content in the cells and their supernatant. WSCA inhibited the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into cellular cholesterol and  , suggesting the inhibition of lipid synthesis. In addition, WSCA inhibited HMG-CoA reductase, a key metabolic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. WSCA also increased cholesterol and   secretion into the cell supernatant, suggesting the enhanced removal of cholesterol and  . Furthermore, WSCA showed decreased linoleic  (18:2) and  (20:4) content in HepG2 cells.

However, investigations of its role in biological systems have been limited by its chemical instability. We developed a stable agonist of 5,6-EET, 5-(pentadeca-3(Z),6(Z),9(Z)-trienyloxy)pentanoic  (PTPA), in which the 5,6-epoxide was replaced with a 5-ether. PTPA obviates chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. In bovine coronary artery rings precontracted with U46619, PTPA (1 nmol/L to 10 micromol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxations, with maximal relaxation of 86+/-5% and EC50 of 1 micromol/L. The relaxations were inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 micromol/L; max relaxation 43+/-9%); the ATP-sensitive K+ channel inhibitor glybenclamide (10 micromol/L; max relaxation 49+/-6%); and the large conductance calcium-activated K+ channel inhibitor iberiotoxin (100 nmol/L; max relaxation 38+/-6%) and abolished by the combination of iberiotoxin with indomethacin or glybenclamide or increasing extracellular K+ to 20 mmol/L. Whole-cell outward K+ current was increased nearly 6-fold by PTPA (10 micromol/L), which was also blocked by iberiotoxin. Additionally, we synthesized 5-(pentadeca-6(Z),9(Z)-dienyloxy)pentanoic  and 5-(pentadeca-3(Z),9(Z)-dienyloxy)pentanoic  (PDPA), PTPA analogs that lack the 8,9 or 11,12 double bonds of  and therefore are not substrates for cyclooxygenase. The PDPAs caused concentration-dependent relaxations (max relaxations 46+/-13% and 52+/-7%, respectively; EC50 1micromol/L), which were not altered by glybenclamide but blocked by iberiotoxin. These studies suggested that PTPA induces relaxation through 2 mechanisms: (1) cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolism to 5-ether-containing prostaglandins that activate ATP-sensitive K+ channels and (2) activation of smooth muscle large conductance calcium-activated K+ channels. PDPAs only activate large conductance calcium-activated K+ channels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15214789>Inhibition of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 by novel 2-oxoamides in vitro, in cells, and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The Group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (GIVA PLA(2)) is a particularly attractive target for drug development because it is the rate-limiting provider of proinflammatory mediators. We previously reported the discovery of novel 2-oxoamides that inhibit GIVA PLA(2) [Kokotos, G.; et al. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 2891-2893]. In the present work, we have further explored this class of inhibitors and found that the 2-oxoamide functionality is more potent when it contains a long 2-oxoacyl residue and a free carboxy group. Long-chain 2-oxoamides based on gamma-aminobutyric  and gamma-norleucine are potent inhibitors of GIVA PLA(2). Such inhibitors act through a fast and reversible mode of inhibition in vitro, are able to block the production of  and prostaglandin E(2) in cells, and demonstrate potent in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17250639>Amino  and   composition of an aqueous extract of Channa striatus (Haruan) that exhibits antinociceptive activity.</a></h2><p>1. The present study was performed in order to determine the amino  and   composition of an aqueous extract of the freshwater fish Channa striatus, obtained by soaking (1:2, w/v) fresh fillets overnight in a chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) solvent, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for its antinociceptive activity and to clarify the relationship between the presence of the amino and   and the expected activity. 2. The aqueous extract was found to contain all amino  with the major amino  glycine, alanine, lysine, aspartic  and proline making up 35.77 +/- 0.58, 10.19 +/- 1.27, 9.44 +/- 0.56, 8.53 +/- 1.15 and 6.86 +/- 0.78% of the total protein, respectively. 3. In addition, the aqueous extract was found to have a high palmitic  (C16:0) content, which contributed approximately 35.93 +/- 0.63% to total  . The other major   in the aqueous extract were oleic  (C18:1), stearic  (C18:0), linoleic  (C18:2) and  (C20:4), contributing 22.96 +/- 0.40, 15.31 +/- 0.33, 11.45 +/- 0.31 and 7.44 +/- 0.83% of total  , respectively. 4. Furthermore, the aqueous extract was demonstrated to possess concentration-dependent antinociceptive activity, as expected, when assessed using the abdominal constriction test in mice. 5. It is concluded that the aqueous extract of C. striatus contains all the important amino , but only some of the important  , which are suggested to play a key role in the observed antinociceptive activity of the extract, as well as in the traditionally claimed wound healing properties of the extract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27592249>Pharmacological inhibition of   amide hydrolase attenuates social behavioural deficits in male rats prenatally exposed to valproic .</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by impaired social interaction, deficits in communication and repetitive stereotyped behaviours. The endocannabinoid system plays an important role in modulating emotionality and social responding, however there have been a paucity of studies investigating this system in autistic animal models. This study investigated the effect of inhibiting   amide hydrolyase (FAAH), the anandamide catabolic enzyme, on behavioural responding in the valproic  (VPA) rat model of autism. Male rats prenatally exposed to VPA exhibit an autistic-like behavioural phenotype exemplified as thermal hypoalgesia, reduced social and exploratory behaviour, and enhanced repetitive behaviour. Systemic administration of the FAAH inhibitor PF3845 (10mg/kg) attenuated the deficit in social behaviour observed in VPA exposed male animals without altering nociceptive, repetitive or exploratory behaviour. In comparison, female VPA exposed rats displayed enhanced repetitive and reduced exploratory behaviour, but no change in social behaviour or thermal nociceptive responding. PF3845 did not alter social, repetitive or thermal nociceptive responding, but reduced exploratory behaviour in a social context in VPA-, but not saline-, exposed females. These data indicate that FAAH inhibition elicits sexual dimorphic effects on behavioural responding in VPA exposed rodents, and support an important role for FAAH in the regulation of social behavioural deficits in autistic males.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The monohaloacetic  (monoHAAs) are generated as byproducts during the disinfection of drinking water and are cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. Iodoacetic  toxicity was mitigated by antioxidants, suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress. Other monoHAAs may share a similar mode of action. Each monoHAA generated a significant concentration-response increase in the expression of a β-lactamase reporter under the control of the antioxidant response element (ARE). The monoHAAs generated oxidative stress with a rank order of iodoacetic  (IAA) > bromoacetic  (BAA) ≫ chloroacetic  (CAA); this rank order was observed with other toxicological end points. Toxicogenomic analysis was conducted with a nontransformed human intestinal epithelial cell line (FHs 74 Int). Exposure to the monoHAAs altered the transcription levels of multiple oxidative stress responsive genes, indicating that each exposure generated oxidative stress. The transcriptome profiles showed an increase in thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) and sulfiredoxin (SRXN1), suggesting peroxiredoxin proteins had been oxidized during monoHAA exposures. Three possible sources of reactive oxygen species were identified, the hypohalous  generating peroxidase enzymes lactoperoxidase (LPO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent oxidase 5 (NOX5), and PTGS2 (COX-2) mediated  metabolism. Each monoHAA exposure caused an increase in COX-2 mRNA levels. These data provide a functional association between monoHAA exposure and adverse health outcomes such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21826570>Aqueous-methanolic extract of sweet flag (Acorus calamus) possesses cardiac depressant and endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated coronary vasodilator effects.</a></h2><p>This investigation was aimed to probe the pharmacological base of medicinal use of Acorus calamus in ischemic heart diseases. Effect on heart parameters was studied in isolated rabbit heart while coronary vasodilator effect was studied in isolated bovine coronary arterial rings, suspended in tissue baths filled with Krebs solution, maintained at 37°C, aerated with carbogen and responses were measured on PowerLab data acquisition system. In Langendorrf's perfused rabbit heart, the crude extract of Acorus calamus (Ac.Cr) at 0.01-10 mg/mL partially suppressed force of ventricular contractions (FVC), heart rate (HR) and coronary flow (CF). The ethylacetate fraction completely suppressed FVC, partially suppressed HR and CF, while the nHexane fraction exhibited similar effect on FVC and HR but increased CF, similar to methacholine and . In bovine coronary arterial preparations, Ac.Cr caused inhibition of U46619 (20 nM)-precontractions, which was blocked in presence of increasing concentration of K(+) (4.8-20 mM), tetraethylammonium (1 μM) and SKF525A (10 μM), similar to  and methacholine, indicating K(+) channels activation and possible involvement of endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Activity-directed fractionation revealed that EDHF-mediated activity is concentrated in the nHexane fraction. When tested against high K(+), the ethylacetate fraction was found more potent than parent crude extract and nHexane fraction. These data indicate that Ac.Cr mediates coronary vasodilator effect primarily through EDHF, responsible for the increase in CF, while the cardiac depressant effects may be due to the presence of additional cardiac depressant constituent(s), thus provides possible mechanistic basis to its medicinal use in ischemic heart diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28859122>Effects of arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) on the protective action of various antiepileptic drugs in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model in mice.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that cannabinoid CB1 receptor ligands play a pivotal role in seizures, not only in preclinical studies on animals, but also in clinical settings. This study was aimed at characterizing the influence of arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA-a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) co-administered with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on the anticonvulsant potency of various antiepileptic drugs (clobazam, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, tiagabine and valproate) in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. Psychomotor seizures in male albino Swiss mice were evoked by a current (32 mA, 6 Hz, 3 s stimulus duration) delivered via corneal electrodes. Potential adverse effects produced by the antiepileptic drugs in combination with ACEA+PMSF were assessed using the chimney test (motor performance), passive avoidance task (remembering and acquisition of learning), and grip-strength test (muscular strength). Brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were measured by HPLC to exclude any pharmacokinetic contribution to the observed effect. ACEA (5 mg/kg, i.p.) + PMSF (30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly potentiated the anticonvulsant potency of levetiracetam (P<0.05), but not that of clobazam, lacosamide, phenobarbital, tiagabine or valproate in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. Moreover, ACEA+PMSF did not significantly affect total brain concentrations of levetiracetam in mice. No behavioral side effects were observed in animals receiving combinations of the studied antiepileptic drugs with ACEA+PMSF. In conclusion, the combined administration of ACEA+PMSF with levetiracetam is associated with beneficial anticonvulsant pharmacodynamic interaction in the 6-Hz corneal stimulation model. The selective activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the brain may enhance levetiracetam-related suppression of seizures in epilepsy patients, contributing to the efficacious treatment of epilepsy in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342691>Requirement of PPARalpha in maintaining phospholipid and triacylglycerol homeostasis during energy deprivation.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) has been implicated as a key control of   catabolism during the cellular fasting. However, little is known regarding changes of individual   in hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) and phospholipid (PL) as a result of starvation. In the present work, the effects of 72 h fasting on hepatic TG and PL   profiles in PPARalpha-null (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts were investigated. Our results indicated that mice deficient in PPARalpha displayed hepatomegaly and hypoketonemia following 72 h starvation. Histochemical analyses revealed that severe  infiltration was observed in the livers of KO mice under fasted conditions. Furthermore, 72 h fasting resulted in a 2.8-fold higher accumulation of hepatic TG in KO mice than in WT mice fasted for the same length of time. Surprisingly, the total hepatic PL contents in fasted KO mice decreased by 45%, but no significant change in hepatic PL content was observed in WT mice following starvation. Gas chromatographic analysis indicated that KO mice were deprived of  (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3)  during fasting. Taken together, these results show that PPARalpha plays an important role in regulation of   metabolism as well as phospholipid homeostasis during energy deprivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19213737>Free   and Methyl Jasmonate Trigger Defense Reactions in Laminaria digitata.</a></h2><p>, linolenic  and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were found to be strong triggers of an oxidative burst in the kelp Laminaria digitata. These findings constitute the first report of an oxidative burst in an algal system induced by free  . The source of reactive oxygen species can be at least partially inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI). Treatment with  increases the levels of a number of free   [including myristic (C14:0), linoleic (C18:2), linolenic (C18:3) and eicosapentaeneoic (C20:5) ] and hydroxylated derivatives [such as 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), 13-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic  (13-HOTE) and 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  (15-HEPE)]. Similar to a previous report of the function of an alginate oligosaccharide-triggered oxidative burst in the establishment of resistance in L. digitata against infection by its brown algal endophyte Laminariocolax tomentosoides, C20:4- and MeJA-induced oxidative bursts seem to be involved in establishing the same protection in L. digitata. Altogether, this study supports the notion that lipid oxidation signaling plays a key role in defense induction in marine brown algae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110924>AKAP150, a switch to convert mechano-, pH- and -sensitive TREK K(+) channels into open leak channels.</a></h2><p>TREK channels are unique among two-pore-domain K(+) channels. They are activated by polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) including  (AA), phospholipids, mechanical stretch and intracellular acidification. They are inhibited by neurotransmitters and hormones. TREK-1 knockout mice have impaired PUFA-mediated neuroprotection to ischemia, reduced sensitivity to  anesthetics and altered perception of pain. Here, we show that the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP150 is a constituent of native TREK-1 channels. Its binding to a key regulatory domain of TREK-1 transforms low-activity outwardly rectifying currents into robust leak conductances insensitive to AA, stretch and acidification. Inhibition of the TREK-1/AKAP150 complex by Gs-coupled receptors such as serotonin 5HT4sR and noradrenaline beta2AR is as extensive as for TREK-1 alone, but is faster. Inhibition of TREK-1/AKAP150 by Gq-coupled receptors such as serotonin 5HT2bR and glutamate mGluR5 is much reduced when compared to TREK-1 alone. The association of AKAP150 with TREK channels integrates them into a postsynaptic scaffold where both G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (as demonstrated here for beta2AR) and TREK-1 dock simultaneously.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267810>Effects of food resources on the fatty  composition, growth and survival of freshwater mussels.</a></h2><p>Increased nutrient and sediment loading in rivers have caused observable changes in algal community composition, and thereby, altered the quality and quantity of food resources available to native freshwater mussels. Our objective was to characterize the relationship between nutrient conditions and mussel food quality and examine the effects on fatty  composition, growth and survival of juvenile mussels. Juvenile Lampsilis cardium and L. siliquoidea were deployed in cages for 28 d at four riverine and four lacustrine sites in the lower St. Croix River, Minnesota/Wisconsin, USA. Mussel foot tissue and food resources (four seston fractions and surficial sediment) were analyzed for quantitative fatty  (FA) composition. Green algae were abundant in riverine sites, whereas cyanobacteria were most abundant in the lacustrine sites. Mussel survival was high (95%) for both species. Lampsilis cardium exhibited lower growth relative to L. siliquoidea (p <0.0001), but growth of L. cardium was not significantly different across sites (p = 0.13). In contrast, growth of L. siliquoidea was significantly greater at the most upstream riverine site compared to the lower three lacustrine sites (p = 0.002). In situ growth of Lampsilis siliquoidea was positively related to volatile solids (10 - 32 μm fraction), total phosphorus (<10 and 10 - 32 μm fractions), and select FA in the seston (docosapentaeonic , DPA, 22:5n3; 4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic, 22:5n6; , ARA, 20:4n6; and 24:0 in the <10 and 10 - 32 μm fractions). Our laboratory feeding experiment also indicated high accumulation ratios for 22:5n3, 22:5n6, and 20:4n6 in mussel tissue relative to supplied algal diet. In contrast, growth of L. siliquiodea was negatively related to nearly all FAs in the largest size fraction (i.e., >63 μm) of seston, including the bacterial FAs, and several of the FAs associated with sediments. Reduced mussel growth was observed in L. siliquoidea when the abundance of cyanobacteria exceeded 9% of the total phytoplankton biovolume. Areas dominated by cyanobacteria may not provide sufficient food quality to promote or sustain mussel growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26928048>Pretreatment of cultured preadipocytes with  during the differentiation phase without a cAMP-elevating agent enhances fat storage after the maturation phase.</a></h2><p> (AA) and the related prostanoids exert complex effects on the adipocyte differentiation depending on the culture conditions and life stages. Here, we investigated the effect of the pretreatment of cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with exogenous AA during the differentiation phase without 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a cAMP-elevating agent, on the storage of fats after the maturation phase. This pretreatment with AA stimulated appreciably adipogenesis after the maturation phase as evident with the up-regulated gene expression of adipogenic markers. The stimulatory effect of the pretreatment with AA was attenuated by the co-incubation with each of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. Among exogenous prostanoids and related compounds, the pretreatment with MRE-269, a selective agonist of the IP receptor for prostaglandin (PG) I2, strikingly stimulated the storage of fats in adipocytes. The gene expression analysis of arachidonate COX pathway revealed that the transcript levels of inducible COX-2, membrane-bound PGE synthase-1, and PGF synthase declined more greatly in cultured preadipocytes treated with AA. By contrast, the expression levels of COX-1, cytosolic PGE synthase, and PGI synthase remained constitutive. The treatment of cultured preadipocytes with AA resulted in the decreased synthesis of PGE2 and PGF2α serving as anti-adipogenic PGs although the biosynthesis of pro-adipogenic PGI2 was up-regulated during the differentiation phase. Moreover, the gene expression levels of EP4 and FP, the respective prostanoid receptors for PGE2 and PGF2α, were gradually suppressed by the supplementation with AA, whereas that of IP for PGI2 remained relatively constant. Collectively, these results suggest the predominant role of endogenous PGI2 in the stimulatory effect of the pretreatment of cultured preadipoccytes with AA during the differentiation phase without IBMX on adipogenesis after the maturation phase.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These products contribute to joint damage, pain and inflammation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 are responsible for the production of PGs. Inhibition of these enzymes by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the levels of PGs, resulting in a reduction in pain and inflammation. However, this inhibition can cause alternative processing of  via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway, resulting in increased production of proinflammatory and gastrotoxic LTs. Licofelone is a competitive inhibitor of 5-LOX, COX-1 and COX-2 that is currently being developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Licofelone decreases the production of both LTs and PGs, and thereby reduces inflammation and pain with low gastrotoxicity. Unlike selective COX-2 inhibitors, coadministration of licofelone and aspirin does not appear to be associated with an increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, at least under experimental conditions. Furthermore, there is evidence from animal models to suggest that licofelone may stop disease progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24287576>Histone acetylation and  cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to assess the role of ethanol-derived acetate and acetate-mediated histone acetylation in -induced stress in HepG2 cells and cells overexpressing CYP2E1. Cells were grown for 7 days with 1 mM sodium acetate or 100 mM ethanol; their acetylated histone proteins and histone deacetylase 2 expression was quantified using Western blot. Ethanol- or acetate-pretreated cells were also treated for 24 h with 60 μM  to induce oxidative stress. Cytotoxicity was estimated by lactate dehydrogenase release, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2] 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test, and by DNA damage, while oxidative stress was quantified using dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Cells grown with ethanol or acetate had increased acetylated histone H3 levels in both cell types and elevated acetylated histone H4 levels in cells overexpressing CYP2E1 but not in naïve cells. In cells overexpressing CYP2E1 grown with ethanol, expression of histone deacetylase 2 was reduced by about 40 %.  altered cell proliferation and was cytotoxic mostly to cells engineered to overexpress CYP2E1 but both effects were significantly lower in cells pretreated with ethanol or acetate. Cytotoxicity was also significantly decreased by 4-methylpyrazole--a CYP2E1 inhibitor and by trichostatin--an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. In cells pretreated with acetate or ethanol, the oxidative stress induced by  was also significantly lower. Our data indicate that histone hyperacetylation may in some extent protect the cells against oxidative stress. It is possible that acetate may act as an antioxidant at histone level.

In the in vivo anti-inflammatory assays, the extract (50, 100 and 200mg/kg) showed a significant (P<0.05) dose-dependent inhibition in the carrageenan,  and xylene-induced tests. Cyathula prostrata produced a significant (P<0.05, 0.001) dose-dependent inhibition in the acetic  and hot plate analgesic tests respectively.

The experimental animals were randomly divided into model control, 5-aminosalicylic  therapy group and three dose of SF therapy groups. The 5 groups were treated intracolonically with normal saline, 5-aminosalicylic  (100 mg x kg(-1)), and SF at the doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg x kg(-1) respectively and daily (8:00 am) for 7 days 24 h following the induction of colitis. A normal control group of rats clystered with normal saline instead of acetic  was also included in the study. Pathological changes of the colonic mucosa were evaluated by the colon mucosa damage index (CMDI) and the histopathological score (HS). The insulted colonic mucosa was sampled for a variety of determinations at the end of experiment when the animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Colonic activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were assayed with ultraviolet spectrophotometry.

However, inflammatory risk (:eicosapentaenoic  ratios in plasma phospholipids) and perceptions of vigor were more adversely affected by the KLC than by the NLC diet.KLC and NLC diets were equally effective in reducing body weight and insulin resistance, but the KLC diet was associated with several adverse metabolic and emotional effects. The use of ketogenic diets for weight loss is not warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19754461>Is the brain  cascade a common target of drugs used to manage bipolar disorder?</a></h2><p>Although lithium has been used therapeutically to treat patients with bipolar disorder for over 50 years, its mechanism of action, as well as that of other drugs used to treat bipolar disorder, is not agreed upon. In the present paper, I review studies in unanaesthetized rats using a neuropharmacological approach, combined with kinetic, biochemical and molecular biology techniques, demonstrating that chronic administration of three commonly used mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic  and carbamazepine), at therapeutically relevant doses, selectively target the brain  cascade. Upon chronic administration, lithium and carbamazepine decrease the binding activity of activator protein-2 and, in turn, the transcription, translation and activity of its -selective calcium-dependent phospholipase A(2) gene product, whereas chronic valproic  non-competitively inhibits long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. The net overlapping effects of the three mood stabilizers are decreased turnover of , but not of docosahexaenoic , in rat brain phospholipids, as well as decreased brain cyclo-oxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E(2). As an extension of this theory, drugs that are thought to induce switching to mania, especially when administered during bipolar depression (fluoxetine and imipramine), up-regulate enzymes of the  cascade and turnover of  in rat brain phospholipids. Future basic and clinical studies on the  hypothesis of bipolar disorder are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17619556>Montelukast in allergic diseases beyond asthma.</a></h2><p>Allergic diseases include a variety of different illnesses (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, urticaria, and dermatitis) in which the physiological and pathological basis is the release of chemical mediators such as histamine; platelet-activating factor; metabolites of ; and chemotactic factors from mastocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. The numerous drugs used for allergy treatment now include the new pharmacologic category of cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) antagonists. LTs are released from eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages, interacting functionally in allergic reactions against a background of an imbalance between T-cell clones and resulting in preferential cytokine production following the T-helper 2 profile. Anti-LTs also have been used successfully by some authors to control rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria. although additional controlled testing will be required, these applications broaden the possible range of treatments for allergic disease in all its many aspects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19686718>Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of a novel inhibitor of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 expression.</a></h2><p>In a previous study, we reported a new gamma-hydroxybutenolide derivative, 4-benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl-3-bromo-5-hydroxy-5H-furan-2-one (BTH), as inhibitor of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression in lypopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 and TPH-1 cells, without affecting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In this study, we evaluated the in vivo effect of BTH on some acute and chronic inflammatory animal models in relation to its inhibitory profile on mPGES-1 expression. In the zymosan-induced mouse air pouch model, BTH produced a dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production and mPGES-1 protein expression in pouch exudates without any effect on COX-2 protein expression. This behavior was confirmed in the chronic model of collagen-induced arthritis, where administration of BTH (5 mg/kg) clearly reduced PGE(2) and mPGES-1 expression in joint tissues, whereas COX-2 was unaffected. These effects were accompanied by the suppression of clinical and histopathological manifestations of disease such as the loss of proteoglycan, and the destruction of surface cartilage. Other enzymes participating in the metabolism of , such as prostaglandin I(2) synthase, tromboxane A(2) synthase or 5-lipoxygenase were unaffected by this compound. The acetic -induced hyperalgesia model in LPS-sensitized mice showed a dose-dependent analgesic effect of BTH, exerting an ED(50) value of 6.2 mg/kg. Our data suggest that inhibition of mPGES-1 protein expression in acute and chronic inflammatory models by BTH, could provide a potential therapeutic target and a pharmacological tool to discern the role of the inducible enzymes COX-2 and mPGES-1 in inflammatory pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17942572>Altered TP receptor function in isolated, perfused kidneys of nondiabetic and diabetic ApoE-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Early manifestations of kidney disease occur in atherosclerosis and activation of TP (thromboxane A(2)) receptors is implicated in atherosclerotic, diabetes, and renal diseases. The purpose of the present study was to analyze, in isolated, perfused mouse kidneys, the participation of TP receptors in renal vasoconstrictions and vasodilatations. In kidneys, taken from wild-type C57BL6, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-KO) and diabetic ApoE-KO mice, changes in perfusion pressure were recorded. Constrictions to TP receptor ligands U 46619, , PGH(2), and 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), but not those to angiotensin II, endothelin, or norepinephrine, were inhibited by the selective TP receptor antagonist Triplion (S 18886; 10 nM). Acetylcholine and prostacyclin evoked biphasic responses during methoxamine constrictions; the constrictor part was blocked by Triplion. In ApoE-KO mouse kidneys, compared with C57BL6, a specific decrease in norepinephrine response and no modification in dilator responses were observed. In diabetic ApoE-KO mouse kidneys, constrictions to U 46619 and those to 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) were significantly and selectively augmented, without modification in the expression of the TP receptor, and again without any significant change in vasodilator activity. Thus TP receptors are functional, and their activation is not involved in norepinephrine, endothelin, and angiotensin II vasoconstrictions but is implicated in the unusual vasoconstrictions to acetylcholine and prostacyclin. Increased responsiveness of TP receptors occurs in diabetic ApoE-KO mouse kidneys. Thus early changes in TP receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor activity may participate in the development of kidney disease in atherosclerosis and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16462894>Effect of geraniol on - and mevalonate metabolism in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2.</a></h2><p>Monoterpenes have multiple pharmacological effects on the metabolism of mevalonate. Geraniol, a dietary monoterpene, has in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity against several cell lines. We have studied the effects of geraniol on growth, - metabolism, and mevalonate metabolism in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line Hep G2. Up to 100 micromol geraniol/L inhibited the growth rate and 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) reductase activity of these cells. At the same concentrations, it increased the incorporation of cholesterol from the medium in a dose-dependent manner. Geraniol-treated cells incorporated less 14C-acetate into nonsaponifiable lipids, inhibiting its incorporation into cholesterol but not into squalene and lanosterol. This is indicative of an inhibition in cholesterol synthesis at a step between lanosterol and cholesterol, a fact confirmed when cells were incubated with 3H-mevalonate. The incorporation of 3H-mevalonate into protein was also inhibited, whereas its incorporation into   increased. An inhibition of delta5 desaturase activity was demonstrated by the inhibition of the conversion of 14C-dihomo-gamma-linolenic  into . Geraniol has multiple effects on mevalonate and lipid metabolism in Hep G2 cells, affecting cell proliferation. Although mevalonate depletion is not responsible for cellular growth, it affects cholesterogenesis, protein prenylation, and - metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120441>Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of Peperomia pellucida (L.)

HBK (Piperaceae) was tested for anti-inflammatory (paw edema induced by carrageenin and ) and analgesic activity (abdominal writhes and hot plate) in rats and mice, respectively. Oral administration of 200 and 400 mg/kg of the aqueous extract exhibited an anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenin test, which was based on interference with prostaglandin synthesis, as confirmed by the  test. In the abdominal writhing test induced by acetic , 400 mg/kg of the plant extract had the highest analgesic activity, whereas in the hot-plate test the best dose was 100 mg/kg.

Montelukast is an effective and well-tolerated preventative treatment for asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults and children. The upper and lower airway show similar inflammatory responses to allergen challenge. Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that are known as the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis produced by a number of cell types including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, macrophages and monocytes. Synthesis of these mediators results from the cleavage of  in cell membranes and they exert their biological effects by binding and activating specific receptors. This occurs in a series of events that lead to contraction of the human airway smooth muscle, chemotaxis and increased vascular permeability. These effects have led to their important role in the diseases of asthma and allergic rhinitis. As these agents lead to the production of symptoms in patients that are asthmatic or allergic, the use of LTRAs, particularly montelukast, may seem appropriate. Clinical trials have shown that montelukast is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis or both diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647959>The roles of pH in regulation of uterine contraction in the laying hens.</a></h2><p>In the laying hens, the uterus (shell gland) plays essential roles in calcium transfer for calcification of the eggshell and expulsion of the egg through the vagina for oviposition. Much is known about the effects of pH changes on eggshell production of the uterus. However, very little is understood about the effects of pH changes on uterine contractility. We investigated the effects of pH changes on uterine contraction in the laying hens. The laying hens were humanely killed, and strips of uterine smooth muscles were isolated. Isometric force was measured and the effects of intracellular and extracellular pH changes studied. The results show that alterations of pH clearly have marked effects on force in the hen uterus. Both intracellular and extracellular acidifications significantly decreased uterine activity, whether it arises spontaneously or in the presence of agonists such as prostaglandin F(2alpha) and . Alkalinization produced the opposite effects. Thus, changes in pH can regulate uterine contraction. This insight into pH regulation of the uterine activity provides a focus for egg production management directed at physiological and pathological oviposition in the laying hens.Copyright  2009 Elsevier B.V.

Whether cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 ) and lipid mediators produced from cPLA2 activation are involved in the anti-inflammatory role of DHA in macrophages has not been reported. We report here that DHA and the GPR120 agonist, GW9508, activate cPLA2 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and cause prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release in a murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. DHA and GW9508 activate cPLA2 via GPR120 receptor, G protein Gαq and scaffold protein β-arrestin 2. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation is involved in DHA- and GW9508-induced cPLA2 activation, but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The anti-inflammatory role of DHA and GW9508 is in part via activation of cPLA2 , COX-2 and production of PGE2 as a cPLA2 inhibitor or a COX-2 inhibitor partially reverses the DHA- and GW9508-induced inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 secretion. The cPLA2 product  and PGE2 also play an anti-inflammatory role. This effect of PGE2 is partially through inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB signalling pathway and through the EP4 receptor of PGE2 because an EP4 inhibitor or knock-down of EP4 partially reverses DHA inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 secretion. Hence, DHA has an anti-inflammatory effect partially through induction of PGE2.Published 2014.

LOX enzymes are expressed in immune, epithelial, and tumor cells that display a variety of physiological functions, including inflammation, skin disorder, and tumorigenesis. In the humans and mice, six LOX isoforms have been known. 15-LOX, a prototypical enzyme originally found in reticulocytes shares the similarity of amino  sequence as well as the biochemical property to plant LOX enzymes. 15-LOX-2, which is expressed in epithelial cells and leukocytes, has different substrate specificity in the humans and mice, therefore, the role of them in mammals has not been established. 12-LOX is an isoform expressed in epithelial cells and myeloid cells including platelets. Many mutations in this isoform are found in epithelial cancers, suggesting a potential link between 12-LOX and tumorigenesis. 12R-LOX can be found in the epithelial cells of the skin. Defects in this gene result in ichthyosis, a cutaneous disorder characterized by pathophysiologically dried skin due to abnormal loss of water from its epithelial cell layer. Similarly, eLOX-3, which is also expressed in the skin epithelial cells acting downstream 12R-LOX, is another causative factor for ichthyosis. 5-LOX is a distinct isoform playing an important role in asthma and inflammation. This isoform causes the constriction of bronchioles in response to cysteinyl leukotrienes such as LTC4, thus leading to asthma. It also induces neutrophilic inflammation by its recruitment in response to LTB4. Importantly, 5-LOX activity is strictly regulated by 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) though the distribution of 5-LOX in the nucleus. Currently, pharmacological drugs targeting FLAP are actively developing. This review summarized these functions of LOX enzymes under pathophysiological conditions in mammals.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the use of traditional non-steroidal aspirin-like drugs has been associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal bleedings. The development of a new class of drugs, the selective cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, has generated much expectation on the possibility to have safer compounds. After the initial enthusiasm of the scientific community, a re-evaluation of some large, randomized double-blind clinical studies performed with two of these compounds, has disclosed that the late serious gastrointestinal complications are not significantly reduced in comparison with non-selective inhibitors and that cardiovascular concerns might arise particularly if theses drugs are utilized in patients with underlying heart diseases. A new promising class of drugs to control inflammatory diseases is in advanced clinical development. The balanced inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and of cyclooxygenase (both types 1 and 2) block the formation of all the enzymatically -derived metabolites, both prostaglandins (like COX inhibitors) and leukotrienes (LT); these drugs have been shown to possess a very good anti-inflammatory efficacy without serious side effects. Licofelone, previously known as ML3000, is the molecule in the most advanced phase of clinical development (phase III) among this class of compounds; it is a potent, competitive, and well balanced inhibitor of 5-LOX and COX pathways. The drug has been shown to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic antibronchocostrictory and antiplatelet properties at doses which are safe for the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the newly performed preclinical studies, here briefly reviewed, appear to indicate that the compound seems particularly suitable to protect the articular cartilage and the synovial space in degenerative joint disease and to exert a relevant antithrombotic activity. Preliminary results of clinical studies of licofelone in osteoarthritis indicate that the drug has a comparable or slightly better efficacy than that of naproxen but possesses a much better gastrointestinal safety. This latter important aspect has been also evaluated by an endoscopic study in normal volunteers randomly assigned to a 4-week treatment with licofelone, placebo or naproxen. The results indicate that no ulcers occurred in either licofelone group or the placebo group, while ulcers with unequivocal depth were present in 20% of the naproxen-treated subjects.</p></html>
