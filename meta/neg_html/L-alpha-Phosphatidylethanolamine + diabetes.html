<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12371386>[Sodium-proton exchanges and platelet procoagulant activity in type 1 diabetic patients].</a></h2><p>Platelet sodium-proton exchange rate and phospholipid dependent procoagulant activity were measured in 31 type 1 diabetics (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years) and 35 healthy subjects (mean age 35.4 +/- 9.4 years). The activity of platelet Na+/H+ exchanger was measured in platelet rich plasma, using an optical swelling assay, according to Rosskopf et al. Platelet procoagulant activity was measured in platelet rich plasma, platelet poor plasma and platelet/microparticles filtrated plasma, using Russell's viper venom (according to Jy and Horstman) and calibrated with ship . We found that Na+/H+ exchange rate was significantly higher in diabetic patients in comparison to the controls (p = 0.0009). There was also a positive correlation between the activity of Na+/H+ exchanger and phospholipid dependent procoagulant activity in all plasma fractions. We did not find a significant association between Na+/H+ exchanger activity and metabolic parameters studied, however in patients with HbA1c level > 7.5% higher Na+/H+ exchange rates were noted. Total procoagulant activity did not rise significantly in diabetic patients, but was markedly higher in platelet poor and platelet filtrated plasma. It was supposed that it originated from platelet derived microparticles, enriched in phospholipids. Our results suggest that an increased platelet Na+/H+ exchange rate and raised procoagulant activity connected with platelet microparticles may enhance the risk of vascular damage in type 1 diabetic patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11795690>Beta 2-glycoprotein I is a good indicator of certain adverse pregnancy conditions.</a></h2><p>To compare levels of beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies with six different antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera from patients with certain adverse pregnancy conditions.aPL levels were examined in pregnant women with anti-phospholipid syndrome (26), pre-eclampsia (32), autoimmune disease (12), or  (23) and in a group with physiological pregnancy (38). A commercial ELISA was used to determine the serum levels of anti-beta2-GPI (Immunotech) in isotypes IgG and IgA, and anti-cardiolipin levels (Milenia) in IgG and IgM. aPL screening also included L-alpha-phosphatidic acid, , L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol, L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol, and L-alpha-phosphatidyl-serine (Sigma, U.S.A.) in IgG and IgM. Statistical analysis of all aPL levels was made by cut-off levels for Ig isotypes by using 3 SD or 95th percentile calculated using STATGRAPHICS.Positive levels of antibodies against beta2-GPI in IgA are more frequently associated with a diagnosis of anti-phospholipid syndrome, pre-eclampsia, and autoimmune disease in pregnant women than with  in pregnancy. Very high interindividual differences in aPLs (against inositol, L-serine, cardiolipin, and beta2-glycoprotein in IgG and IgA) were found in serum from women with pregnancy complicated by anti-phospholipid syndrome, pre-eclampsia, and autoimmune disease. Pregnant patients with  had higher serum levels in aPLs to DL-glycerol, inositol, L-serine, and beta2-glycoprotein. Positive aPL levels predominate in isotype IgG. Very low levels of aPLs to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine were detected in all groups studied.Serum levels of anti-beta2-GPI could serve as a better prognostic marker in complicated pregnancy than the panel of seven different anti-phospholipid antibodies. Detection of anti-beta2-GPI is proposed as a first step of the screening for aPLs.</p></html>
