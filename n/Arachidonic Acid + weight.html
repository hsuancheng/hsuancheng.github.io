<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813326>The Antagonist Effect of  on  Gene Expression by Nuclear Receptor Type II Regulation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30325046>Metabonomics analysis of kidneys in rats administered with chronic low-dose cadmium by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the nephrotoxicity in rats administered with chronic low-dose cadmium (Cd) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups, namely: control; low-dose (0.13 mg/kg· [bw]); middle-dose (0.80 mg/kg·bw); and high-dose (4.89 mg/kg·bw). The rats received CdCl daily via drinking water for 24 weeks. Rat kidneys were collected for metabonomics analysis. Principal components analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis were used to investigate the metabonomics profile changes in the kidney samples and to screen the potential biomarkers. Ten metabolites were identified in the positive and negative ion modes. Compared with the control group, the intensities of tetranor 12-HETE, uric , hypoxanthine, phenylacetylglycine, guanidinosuccinic  and xanthosine significantly increased (P < 0.01), and those of imidazolelactic , lactose 6-phosphate, l-urobilinogen and  significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in the high-dose group. Results showed that exposure to Cd in rats induced oxidative stress to the kidneys and disrupted amino  metabolism, fatty  metabolism and energy metabolism.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552618>Expression, purification, and characterization of a novel acidic Lipoxygenase from Myxococcus xanthus.</a></h2><p>The gene encoding a novel acidic lipoxygenase from Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 (accession: WP_011551853.1) was cloned into vector pET-28a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).

However, the therapeutic mechanism of this effect has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, a MTT dye reduction assay and DAPI staining were first used to evaluate the cell viability and apoptosis of A549 cells with and without QYSLD-treatment, respectively. The /volume of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) sarcoma was used to assess the therapeutic effect of QYSLD on LLC mice. Second, an UPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics method was employed to identify and relatively quantify functional metabolites that were responsible for the intervention effect of QYSLD on LLC. As a result, the MTT dye reduction assay and DAPI staining demonstrated that QYSLD could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of A549 cells. The /volume test of LLC sarcoma showed that QYSLD could restrain the development of LLC. Next, 21 potential biomarkers that could contribute to the curative mechanism of QYSLD on LLC were screened by the untargeted metabolomics method. The down-regulated metabolites induced by QYSLD included PC(16:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PC(20:2(11Z,14Z)/16:0), PC(22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/14:0), PC(22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/14:0), , gamma-glutamylisoleucine, cholesterol sulfate, CL (8:0/10:0/11:0/a-13:0) and CDP-DG (16:0/18:1(11Z)). The up-regulated metabolites were LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(18:0), LysoPE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0), LysoPE(22:0/0:0), LysoPE(22:1(13Z)/0:0), LysoPE(22:2(13Z,16Z)/0:0), triglylcarnitine, 1‑arachidonoylglycerophosphoinositol, 1‑palmitoylglycerophosphoinositol, 2‑stearoylglycerophosphoinositol, sphingosine 1‑phosphate(d19:1-P) and SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)). The metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the potential biomarkers were primarily involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, fatty  degradation and  metabolism. This study demonstrated that QYSLD has a good antitumor effect and that a UPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics method is a promising means of elucidating the intervention mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine formulas.Copyright © 2018.

Thirty-six Kunming (KM) mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal group, model group and MXF group. Influenza virus H1N1 was used by nasal drip to establish influenza mice model. The mice in MXF group were orally administrated with MXF for 6 consecutive days after inoculation, and the other two groups were given with equal volume of saline solution in the same way. , rectal temperature, morbidity and mortality were recorded daily. Serum samples were collected 24 hours after the last administration for HPLC-TOF-MS analysis. The results showed that as compared with the normal group, the  and rectal temperature were decreased in model group, and their lung index and mortality rate were significantly increased (P<0.05); MXF had good therapeutic effects on the abnormity of , rectal temperature, lung index and high mortality rate of mice infected with H1N1 virus. The original data collected from the serum samples were analyzed with R language, MPP, SIMCA-P and other software, and significant changes were found in 14 kinds of endogenous substances from mice serum (P<0.05). As compared with model group, the potential metabolic markers in MXF group recovered to normal levels to a certain degree after being intervened by MXF. Further analysis with MetPA data platform showed that, the pathways involved in 14 metabolites included glucose metabolism,  metabolism, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids metabolism etc. The metabolomics study and pharmacological experiment showed that MXF might play a role of efficacy by improving glucose metabolism, regulating  metabolism, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolic pathways.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437282>Inhibition of Mid-chain HETEs Protects Against Angiotensin II-induced Cardiac Hypertrophy.</a></h2><p>Recent data demonstrated the role of CYP1B1 in cardiovascular disease. It was, therefore, necessary to examine whether the inhibition of CYP1B1 and hence inhibiting the formation of its metabolites, using 2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), would have a cardioprotective effect against angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. For this purpose, male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with Ang II with or without TMS (300 μg/kg every third day i.p.). Thereafter, cardiac hypertrophy and the formation of mid-chain HETEs and  were assessed. In vitro, RL-14 cells were treated with Ang II (10 μM) in the presence and absence of TMS (0.5 μM). Then, reactive oxygen species, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation levels, and nuclear factor-kappa B-binding activity were determined. Our results demonstrated that TMS protects against Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by the improvement in cardiac functions shown by the echocardiography as well as by reversing the increase in heart  to tibial length ratio caused by Ang II. In addition, the cardioprotective effect of TMS was associated with a significant decrease in cardiac mid-chain HETEs levels. Mechanistically, TMS inhibited reactive oxygen species formation, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the binding of p65 NF-κB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028283>Implementation of buffy-coat-derived pooled platelet concentrates for internal quality control of light transmission aggregometry: a proof of concept study.</a></h2><p>Essentials In platelet function testing, standardized internal controls (IQC) are not commercially provided. Platelet function testing was performed daily on aliquoted pooled platelet concentrates. Pooled platelet concentrates showed stability for control purposes from Monday to Friday. Pooled platelet concentrates provide the necessary steadiness to serve as IQC material.Background Standardized commercially available control material for internal quality control (IQC) of light transmission aggregometry (LTA) is still lacking. Moreover, the availability of normal blood donors to provide fresh platelets is difficult in small laboratories, where 'volunteers' may be in short supply. Objectives To evaluate the implementation of buffy-coat-derived pooled platelet concentrates (PCs) for IQC material for LTA. Methods We used buffy-coat-derived pooled PCs from the blood bank as IQC material for LTA. On each weekend one PC was prepared (> 200 mL) and aliquoted from the original storage bag on a daily basis in four baby bags (40-50 mL), which were delivered from Monday to Friday to our laboratory. The IQC measurements of at least 85 work-weeks (from Monday to Friday) were evaluated with this new IQC material. LTA was performed on a four-channel Chronolog 700 Aggregometer (Chronolog Corporation, Havertown, PA, USA) (agonists: collagen, adenosine diphosphate [ADP],  [AA] and thrombin receptor activator peptide-6 [TRAP-6]). Results The medians of platelet aggregation from IQC measurements with collagen, ADP and AA from Monday to Friday were 68.0-59.5, 3.0-2.0 and 51.0-50.0%, respectively, and the mean of platelet aggregation with TRAP-6 was 71.2-66.4%. Conclusions Buffy-coat-derived pooled PCs serve as a reliable and robust IQC material for LTA measurements and would be beneficial for the whole laboratory procedure and employees' safety.© 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665872>Maternal intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during mid-pregnancy is inversely associated with linear growth.</a></h2><p>This study investigates relations of maternal N-3 and N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake during pregnancy with offspring  mass index (BMI), height z-score and metabolic risk (fasting glucose, C-peptide, leptin, lipid profile) during peripuberty (8-14 years) among 236 mother-child pairs in Mexico. We used food frequency questionnaire data to quantify trimester-specific intake of N-3 alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA); N-6 linoleic  and  (AA); and N-6:N-3 (AA:EPA+DHA), which accounts for the fact that the two PUFA families have opposing effects on physiology. Next, we used multivariable linear regression models that accounted for maternal education and parity, and child's age, sex and pubertal status, to examine associations of PUFA intake with the offspring outcomes. In models where BMI z-score was the outcome, we also adjusted for height z-score. We found that higher second trimester intake of EPA, DHA and AA were associated with lower offspring BMI and height z-score. For example, each 1-s.d. increment in second trimester EPA intake corresponded with 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) z-scores lower BMI and 0.20 (0.05, 0.36) z-scores lower height. Accounting for height z-score in models where BMI z-score was the outcome attenuated estimates [e.g., EPA: -0.16 (-0.37, 0.05)], suggesting that this relationship was driven by slower linear growth rather than excess adiposity. Maternal PUFA intake was not associated with the offspring metabolic biomarkers. Our findings suggest that higher PUFA intake during mid-pregnancy is associated with lower attained height in offspring during peripuberty. Additional research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and to confirm findings in other populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864291>Functional recovery upon human dental pulp stem cell transplantation in a diabetic neuropathy rat model.</a></h2><p>Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is among the most debilitating complications of diabetes. Here, we investigated the effects of human dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) transplantation in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neuropathic rats. Six weeks after STZ injection, DPSCs were transplanted through two routes, intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM), in single or two repeat doses. Two weeks after transplantation, a significant improvement in hyperalgesia, grip-strength, motor coordination and nerve conduction velocity was observed in comparison with controls. A rapid improvement in neuropathic symptoms was observed for a single dose of DPSC IV; however, repeat dose of DPSC IV did not bring about added improvement. A single dose of DPSC IM showed steady improvement, and further recovery continued upon repeat IM administration. DPSC single dose IV showed greater improvement than DPSC single dose IM, but IM transplantation brought about better improvement in . A marked reduction in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was observed in the blood plasma for all treated groups, as compared with controls. With respect to inflammatory cytokines, repeat dose of DPSC IM showed further improvement, suggesting that a repeat dose is required to maintain the improved inflammatory state. Gene expression of inflammatory markers in liver confirmed amelioration in inflammation.  level was unaffected by IV DPSC transplantation but showed noticeable increase through IM administration of a repeat dose. These results suggest that DPSC transplantation through both routes and dosage was beneficial for the retrieval of neuropathic parameters of DN; transplantation via the IM route with repeat dose was the most effective.Copyright © 2017 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

In a completely randomized design, commercial Rambouillet ewes (age = 3 to 5 yr; initial BW = 65.2 ± 1.6 kg) on a base diet of long-stem sorghum × Sudangrass hay were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary supplements in which ground juniper replaced 0% (CNTL), 33% (18JUN), 66% (36JUN), or 100% (54JUN) of the ground sorghum × Sudangrass hay in a pelleted supplement with ground juniper from d 38 ± 4 of gestation to 2 d postpartum. Treatment DM diet intake overall (g/kg BW) in ewes receiving no juniper was similar ( ≥ 0.38) to that of those receiving increasing concentrations of juniper. Changes in ewe BW and BCS were similar ( ≥ 0.24) in ewes throughout gestation. All serum metabolites and hormones were within normal clinical ranges; however, serum IGF-1 decreased linearly ( = 0.003), alanine increased (linear; = 0.003), and serum Na decreased (linear; = 0.049) as the percentage of juniper increased in the diet. Ewe milk fatty  composition was similar ( > 0.05) for the majority of fatty acids across treatment groups, with the exception of  (C20:4n6) being greater ( < 0.02) in 54JUN vs. CNTL ewe milk. Lamb birth  were similar ( = 0.13), whereas lamb ADG tended to differ (quadratic; = 0.06) from d 0 to 14, with 18JUN being the least. At weaning, BW tended ( = 0.09) to linearly decrease in lambs born to ewes consuming greater concentrations of juniper but were not different ( = 0.26) between CNTL and 18JUN, 36JUN, and 54JUN. Results indicated that feeding increasing levels of ground juniper in supplements did not negatively alter ewe performance or serum metabolites and hormones measured pre- and postpartum. Lamb birth  and preweaning performance appeared unaffected by maternal consumption of ground juniper containing supplements.

(AA) is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), vasoactive and natriuretic metabolites that contribute to blood pressure (BP) regulation. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may compete with AA for CYP450-dependent bioactive lipid mediator formation. We aimed at investigating the role of AA, EPA and DHA and their CYP450-dependent metabolites in BP control and vascular function in 66 overweight/obese children. Fatty  profile moderately correlated with the corresponding CYP450-derived metabolites but their levels did not differ between children with normal BP (NBP) and high BP (HBP), except for higher EPA-derived epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) and their diols in HBP group, in which also the estimated CYP450-epoxygenase activity was higher. In the HBP group, EPA inversely correlated with BP, EEQs inversely correlated both with systolic BP and carotid Intima-Media Thickness (cIMT). The DHA-derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) were inversely correlated with diastolic BP. Omega-3 derived epoxymetabolites appeared beneficially associated with BP and vascular structure/function only in obese children with HBP. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of omega-3/omega-6 epoxymetabolites in children's hemodynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229635>Oral administration of fumonisin B and T-2 individually and in combination affects hepatic total and mitochondrial membrane lipid profile of rabbits.</a></h2><p>Weaned rabbits were fed diets contaminated with 2 mg/kg diet T-2 toxin alone, or 10 mg/kg diet fumonisin B (FB) alone, and both toxins in combination (2 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to a toxin-free control diet. Samplings were performed after 4 weeks (blood and liver). Bodyweight of T-2-fed group was lower after 4 weeks; the liver  was increased dramatically (threefold of control). Liver total phospholipids (PLs) provided slight alterations in the fatty  (FA) composition; all three toxin-treated groups showed a decrease in palmitoleic  (C16:1 n7) proportion. In the liver mitochondrial PL FA composition, margaric  (C17:0) proportion decreased in the separated toxin treatments compared to the combined setting. Oleic  (C18:1 n9) proportion was increased and  (C20:4 n6) was decreased in the FB-treated group, while docosapentaenoic  (C22:5 n3) was decreased in the separated treatments. The total monounsaturation was significantly higher in the FB group's mitochondrial PL FA profile. After 4 weeks, all toxin treatments decreased the blood plasma reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity, and FB increased the plasma sphinganine/sphingosine ratio. Both mycotoxins seem to cross the hepatocellular and the hepatic mitochondrial membrane, without drastic membrane disruption, as assessed from the PL FA composition, but inducing detectable lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589254>Juniperonic  Incorporation into the Phospholipids of Murine Macrophage Cells Modulates Pro-Inflammatory Mediator Production.</a></h2><p>Juniperonic  (JPA; Δ5,11,14,17-20:4), originally identified in certain gymnosperm seeds, is a rare n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) with lipid-modulating effects on rats and anti-proliferative effects on fibroblast cell proliferation. However, little is known how JPA exerted its immunosuppressive effect. The objective of this study was to investigate whether JPA inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators through the modulation of cellular phospholipid fatty  compositions. Using standard lipid chemistry techniques in conjunction with argentated column chromatography, high-purity JPA (> 98%) was extracted, isolated, and purified from Biota kernels. When murine RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with increasing concentrations of JPA, amounts of cellular phospholipid total PUFA, JPA, and Δ7-docosatetraenoic  (Δ7-DTA; elongation product of JPA) increased in a dose-dependent manner; however, the proportions of total monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and  (AA) decreased. JPA suppressed the production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) up to 21, 75, 30, and 44%, respectively. The induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) over-expression by JPA could account for the doubling of the PGE level. Furthermore, JPA suppressed the expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In a separate study using the mouse ear edema model, we demonstrated that JPA also significantly suppressed inflammation, as measured by ear thickness and biopsy . The anti-inflammatory properties of JPA could be due, in part, to the incorporation of JPA into cellular phospholipids with subsequent modulation of membrane-mediated MAPK signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599053>The Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio: A critical appraisal and possible successor.</a></h2><p>The well-known health effects of the long-chain, marine omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FAs) has led to a growing interest in the prognostic value that blood levels of these FAs might have vis-à-vis cardiovascular and neurocognitive diseases. The measurement and expression of n-3 FA levels is not straight-forward, however, and a wide variety of means of expression of n-3 FA status have been used in research and clinical medicine. This has led to considerable confusion as to what "optimal" n-3 FA status is. The n-6:n-3 ratio has enjoyed relatively widespread use, but this apparently simple metric has both theoretical and practical difficulties that have contributed to misunderstandings in this field. Just as the once-popular polyunsaturated:saturated FA ratio has largely disappeared from the nutritional and medical literature, it may be time to replace the n-6:n-3 ratio with a newer metric that focuses on the primary deficiency in Western diets - the lack of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA). The Omega-3 Index (red blood cell EPA+DHA) has much to recommend it in this regard.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of a larger randomized controlled study, we investigated FA metabolism in a subset of 47 clinically stable preterm infants (birth  ≤1500 g or gestational age ≤32 weeks). Infants were randomized to receive HM supplemented with either a new HM fortifier (nHMF;  = 26) containing 12.5 g medium-chain FA (MCFA), 958 mg linoleic  (LA), 417 mg α-linolenic  (ALA), and 157 mg docosahexaenoic  (DHA) per 100 g of powder (in compliance with the latest guidelines) or a fat-free HMF (cHMF;  = 21). Plasma phospholipid (PL) and triacylglycerol (TAG), and red blood cell phosphatidylcholine (RBC-PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (RBC-PE) FA profiles were assessed before and after 21 days of feeding. In the nHMF group, significantly increased levels of -9 monounsaturated fatty acids were observed, formed most likely by elongation and desaturation of dietary saturated fatty acids present in HM. ALA fortification increased ALA assimilation into plasma TAG. Similarly, DHA fortification enriched the DHA content in RBC-PE, which, in this compartment, was not associated with lower  levels as observed in plasma TAG and phospholipids.

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs); omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are known to have anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory properties respectively. The present study examines the effect of vitamin D deficiency on fatty  composition and metabolism in a rat model. Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 8/group) as follows; control and vitamin D deficient (VDD). Diets (control: 1000 IU D3/kg diet; VDD: 0 IU D3/kg diet) were given from weaning and continued throughout pregnancy. Pregnant female rats were dissected on gestational day 20 to collect blood, liver and placenta. The VDD diet reduced maternal serum 25-hydroxyviatmin D3 levels (p < 0.001) as compared to control. Maternal vitamin D deficiency resulted in lower total  gain and placental  (p < 0.05 for both) during pregnancy. Animals from VDD group demonstrated higher  (AA) levels in both the liver and plasma (p < 0.05 for both) as compared to control. Liver, plasma and placental monounsaturated fatty  levels (MUFA) were lower (p < 0.01 for all) while plasma total saturated fatty acids (SFA) (p = 0.05) were higher in the VDD group. Animals from the VDD group demonstrated lower ∆9-desaturase activity index (p < 0.01 for all) in the liver, plasma and placenta. The plasma ∆5-desaturase activity index (p < 0.05) was higher although no change was observed in the ∆6-desaturase activity index. However, the mRNA levels of liver ∆6-desaturase was lower (p < 0.05) in the VDD group. Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin D deficiency influences fatty  desaturase activity and expression and therefore alters maternal fatty  metabolism.Copyright © 2018.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , oleic , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and oleic  and lower levels of adrenic , , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to  outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders.

Exploratory analyses tested whether child sex, birth , and caregiver depressive symptomatology were moderators of the treatment effect.Omega Tots was a single-site 180-day randomized (1:1), double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Children (n = 377) were age 10 to 16 months at enrollment, born at less than 35 weeks' gestation, assigned to 180 days of daily 200 mg DHA + 200 mg AA supplementation or placebo (400 mg corn oil), and followed after the trial ended to age 26 to 32 months. Caregivers completed a sociodemographic profile and questionnaires about their depressive symptomatology (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and the child's sleep (Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire). Analyses compared changes in sleep between the DHA+AA and placebo groups, controlling for baseline scores. Exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted.Eighty-one percent (n = 156; n = 150) of children had 180-day trial outcome data; 68% (n = 134; n = 122) had postintervention outcome data. Differences in change between the DHA+AA and placebo groups after 180 days of supplementation were not statistically significant for the entire cohort. Male children (difference in nocturnal sleep change = 0.44, effect size = 0.26, P = .04; sleep problems odds ratio = 0.36, 95% confidence interval = 0.15, 0.82) and children of depressed caregivers (difference in nocturnal sleep change = 1.07, effect size = 0.65, P = .006; difference in total sleep change = 1.10, effect size = 0.50, P = .04) assigned to the treatment group showed improvements in sleep, compared to placebo.Although there is no evidence of an overall effect of DHA+AA supplementation on child sleep, exploratory post hoc analyses identified important subgroups of children born preterm who may benefit.

The model utilized serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, ω-3): (AA, ω-6) ratios as biomarkers of colonic mucosal PGE concentration. Normal human volunteers were given low and high ω-3 fatty  test doses for 2 weeks. This established a slope and intercept of the line for dose versus serum EPA:AA ratio in each individual. The slope and intercept was utilized to calculate a personalized target dose that was given for 12 weeks. This target dose was calculated on the basis of a model, initially derived from lean rodents, showing a log-linear relationship between serum EPA:AA ratios and colonic mucosal PGE reduction. Bayesian methods allowed addition of human data to the rodent model as the trial progressed. The dosing model aimed to achieve a serum EPA:AA ratio that is associated with a 50% reduction in colonic PGE Mean colonic mucosal PGE concentrations were 6.55 ng/mg protein (SD, 5.78) before any supplementation and 3.59 ng/mg protein (SD, 3.29) after 12 weeks of target dosing. In secondary analyses, the decreases in PGE were significantly attenuated in overweight and obese participants. This occurred despite a higher target dose for the obese versus normal  participants, as generated by the pharmacodynamic predictive model. Large decreases also were observed in 12-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids, and PGE increased substantially. Future biomarker-driven dosing models for cancer prevention therefore should consider energy balance as well as overall eicosanoid homeostasis in normal tissue. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711599> sex-dependently affects obesity through linking gut microbiota-driven inflammation to hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis.</a></h2><p>Unraveling the role of dietary lipids is beneficial to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6 fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating microbiota-driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators, browning process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut microbiota composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory microbiota and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin resistance via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces insulin resistance. Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing microbiota, up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte browning and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Our findings formulate recommendations of n-6 fatty acids like AA from dietary intake for obese subjects preferably in a sexually dimorphic way.Copyright © 2017.

We divided the participants into two groups depending on the achievenemt in reduction of bodyweight 3% or more during hospitalization and examined the relationship between serum levels of EPA and AA, as well as ratio of EPA/AA on admission and effectiveness of  loss under strict dietary therapy during hospitalization, using Cox proportional hazard models.After adjustment was made for several confounders, the hazard ratio of effective  loss for logarithmical serum EPA was 1.59 (95% CI 1.02-2.49, P = 0.04) and for logarithmical EPA/AA ratio 1.64 (1.03-2.61, P = 0.04), whereas the hazard ratio for effective  loss for logarithmical serum AA was 1.11 (0.45-2.78, P = 0.82). In addition, after dividing EPA/AA ratio and serum EPA into quartiles based on participant number, the hazard ratio for the highest quartile of EPA/AA ratio was 2.33 (1.14-4.77, P = 0.02), and for the highest quartile of serum EPA 1.60 (0.80-3.19, P = 0.18) compared with the lowest quartile.These results suggest the possibility that EPA is involved in bodyweight change under a caloric-restriction regimen.

Although it alters fatty  (FA) metabolism, data concerning the profile of FA in CF patients with liver cirrhosis is lacking. This study aimed to assess the FA composition of serum phospholipids in CF patients with and without liver cirrhosis.The study comprised 25 CF patients with liver cirrhosis and 25 without it. We assessed Z-scores for  height and , lung function, exocrine pancreatic sufficiency and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FAs' profile of serum glycerophospholipids was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.In CF patients with liver cirrhosis, the levels of C16:0 were higher and the amounts of C20:2n-6, C20:3n-6, C20:4n-6, and all the n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) (C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, C22:6n-3) were lower than those in CF subjects without liver cirrhosis. The n-6/n-3, C20:4n-6/C18:2n-6, total n-6/C18:2n-6, C20:5n-3/C18:3n-3 and total n-3/C18:3n-3 ratios did not differ between the 2 groups.Liver cirrhosis may associate with profound abnormalities in the composition of serum glycerophospholipids FAs in CF patients.

However, impairment in systolic function, often reported as declining ejection fraction, may not consistently occur in a given time frame which could be contributable to a variety of factors within the experimental design. One major factor may be the amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) that are present in the diet. To determine whether the FA content and composition were critical determinants in the development of cardiac dysfunction in response to high-fat feeding, we fed adult, male mice Western diet (45% fat, 60% saturated), Surwit diet (60% fat, 90% saturated), milk-fat-based diet (60% fat, 60% saturated) or high-fat Western diet (HFWD, 60% fat, 32% saturated) for 12 weeks. We report that neither the amount of total fat nor the ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAs in the diets differentially affects  and adiposity in mice. In addition, no evidence of systolic dysfunction is present after 12 weeks. Interestingly, the HFWD, with equal parts saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs, induces mild cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction after 12 weeks, which coincides with elevated serum levels of . Our results suggest that the dietary FA content and composition may be a primary determinant of diastolic, but not systolic, dysfunction in animal models of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, there is a need to find selection criteria for IMF independent from lean growth. In pigs, the proportion of linoleic (C18:2) and  (C20:4) acids decline with fat deposition and therefore they can be considered as indicators of fatness. The aim of this research was to estimate the genetic variation for C18:2 and C20:4 in IMF and their genetic correlations with IMF and lean growth traits, with the objective to assess their potential as specific biomarkers of IMF. The analysis was conducted using a full-pedigreed Duroc resource line with 91,448 records of  and backfat thickness (BT) at 180 days of age and 1371 records of fatty  composition in the muscle .The heritability estimates for C18:2 and C20:4 in IMF, whether expressed in absolute (mg/g of muscle) or in relative (mg/g of fatty ) terms, as well as for their ratio (C20:4/C18:2), were high (> 0.40), revealing that the C18:2 to C20:4 pathway is subjected to substantial genetic influence. Litter effects were not negligible, with values ranging from 8% to 15% of the phenotypic variance. The genetic correlations of C18:2 and C20:4 with IMF and BT were negative (- 0.75 to - 0.66, for IMF, and - 0.64 to - 0.36, for BT), if expressed in relative values, but almost null (- 0.04 to 0.07), if expressed in absolute values, except for C18:2 with IMF, which was highly positive (0.88). The ratio of C20:4 to C18:2 also displayed a stronger genetic correlation with IMF (- 0.59) than with BT (- 0.10).The amount of C18:2 in muscle can be used as an IMF-specific biomarker. Selection for the absolute amount of C18:2 is expected to deliver a similar response outcome as selection for IMF at restrained BT. Further genetic analysis of the C18:2 metabolic pathway may provide new insights into differential fat deposition among adipose tissues and on candidate genes for molecular markers targeting specifically for one of them.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070994>Parental high dietary  levels modulated the hepatic transcriptome of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) progeny.</a></h2><p>Disproportionate high intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet is considered as a major human health concern. The present study examines changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern of adult male zebrafish progeny associated with high levels of the n-6 PUFA  (ARA) in the parental diet. The parental generation (F0) was fed a diet which was either low (control) or high in ARA (high ARA). Progenies of both groups (F1) were given the control diet. No differences in  were found between the diet groups within adult stages of either F0 or F1 generation. Few differentially expressed genes were observed between the two dietary groups in the F0 in contrast to the F1 generation. Several links were found between the previous metabolic analysis of the parental fish and the gene expression analysis in their adult progeny. Main gene expression differences in the progeny were observed related to lipid and retinoid metabolism by PPARα/RXRα playing a central role in mediating changes to lipid and long-chain fatty  metabolism. The enrichment of genes involved in β-oxidation observed in the progeny, corresponded to the increase in peroxisomal β-oxidative degradation of long-chain fatty acids in the parental fish metabolomics data. Similar links between the F0 and F1 generation were identified for the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway in the high ARA group. In addition, estrogen signalling was found to be affected by parental high dietary ARA levels, where gene expression was opposite directed in F1 compared to F0. This study shows that the dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio can alter gene expression patterns in the adult progeny. Whether the effect is mediated by permanent epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in developing gametes needs to be further investigated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28960147>Platelet function investigation by flow cytometry: Sample volume, needle size, and reference intervals.</a></h2><p>Flow cytometry is an increasingly used method for platelet function analysis because it has some important advantages compared with other platelet function tests. Flow cytometric platelet function analyses only require a small sample volume (3.5 mL); however, to expand the field of applications, e.g., for platelet function analysis in children, even smaller volumes are needed. Platelets are easily activated, and the size of the needle for blood sampling might be of importance for the pre-activation of the platelets. Moreover, to use flow cytometry for investigation of platelet function in clinical practice, a reference interval is warranted. The aims of this work were 1) to determine if small volumes of whole blood can be used without influencing the results, 2) to examine the pre-activation of platelets with respect to needle size, and 3) to establish reference intervals for flow cytometric platelet function assays. To examine the influence of sample volume, blood was collected from 20 healthy individuals in 1.0 mL, 1.8 mL, and 3.5 mL tubes. To examine the influence of the needle size on pre-activation, blood was drawn from another 13 healthy individuals with both a 19- and 21-gauge needle. For the reference interval study, 78 healthy adults were included. The flow cytometric analyses were performed on a NAVIOS flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, Florida) investigating the following activation-dependent markers on the platelet surface; bound-fibrinogen, CD63, and P-selectin (CD62p) after activation with , ristocetin, adenosine diphosphate, thrombin-receptor-activating-peptide, and collagen. The study showed that a blood volume as low as 1.0 mL can be used for platelet function analysis by flow cytometry and that both a 19- and 21-gauge needle can be used for blood sampling. In addition, reference intervals for platelet function analyses by flow cytometry were established.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29282029>Docosahexaenoic  reduces sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and fatty  synthase expression and inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting pAkt signaling in a human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.</a></h2><p>Fatty  synthase (FASN), the major enzyme in de novo fatty  synthesis, is highly expressed in breast cancer and its expression is reduced by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in liver. We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA  (AA) and tumor . We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or oleic  (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation.DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin.We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049141>Supplementing Genistein for Breeder Hens Alters the Fatty  Metabolism and Growth Performance of Offsprings by Epigenetic Modification.</a></h2><p>The experiment was designed to clarify the effect and molecular mechanism of maternal genistein (GEN) on the lipid metabolism and developmental growth of offspring chicks. Laying broiler breeder (LBB) hens were supplemented with 40 mg/kg genistein (GEN), while the control group was fed with the low-soybean meal diet. The offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation with 8 replicates each. Hepatic transcriptome data revealed 3915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs,  adjusted < 0.05, fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.67) between chicks in the two groups. Maternal GEN activated the GH-IGF1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promoted the developmental processes and cellular amino  metabolic processes, as well as inhibited the apoptotic process. GEN treatment significantly increased the  gain, breast muscle percentage, and liver index in chicks. PANTHER clustering analysis suggested that maternal GEN enhanced the antioxidant activity of chicks by the upregulation of gene (SOD3, MT1, and MT4) expression. Accordingly, the activities of T-AOC and T-SOD in the liver were increased after GEN treatment. The overrepresentation tests revealed that maternal GEN influenced the glycolysis, unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A metabolism, lipid transport, and cholesterol metabolism in the chick livers. Hepatic cholesterol and long-chain fatty  were significantly decreased after GEN treatment. However, the level of  was higher in the livers of the GEN-treated group compared with the CON group. Moreover, GEN treatment enhanced fatty  -oxidation and upregulated PPAR expression in the chick liver. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that maternal GEN might induce histone H3-K36 trimethylation in the promoter region of PPAR gene (PPARD) through Iws1, methyltransferases. It also induced histone H4-K12 acetylation at the PPARD promoter through MYST2, which activated the PPAR signaling pathways in the chick livers. In summary, supplementing LBB hens with GEN can alter lipid metabolism in the offspring chicks through epigenetic modification and improve the antioxidative capability as well as growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518038>Effects of  and Docosohexahenoic  Supplementation during Gestation in Rats. Implication of Placental Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p> and docosahexaenoic acids (ARA and DHA) are important during pregnancy. However, the effects of dietary supplementation on fetal growth and oxidative stress are inconclusive. We aimed to assess the effect of high ARA and DHA diet during rat gestation on: (1) ARA and DHA availability in plasma and placenta, (2) fetal growth, and (3) placental oxidative stress, analyzing the influence of sex. Experimental diet (ED) was prepared by substituting soybean oil in the control diet (CD) by a fungi/algae-based oil containing ARA and DHA (2:1). Rats were fed with CD or ED during gestation; plasma, placenta, and fetuses were obtained at gestational day 20. DHA, ARA, and their precursors were analyzed in maternal plasma and placenta by gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry. Fetuses and placentas were weighed, the proportion of fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) determined, and placental lipid and protein oxidation analyzed. ED fetuses exhibited lower  compared to CD, being >40% IUGR; fetal  negatively correlated with maternal plasma ARA, but not DHA. Only ED female placenta exhibited higher lipid and protein oxidation compared to its CD counterparts; lipid peroxidation is negatively associated with fetal . In conclusion, high ARA during gestation associates with IUGR, through placental oxidative stress, with females being more susceptible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211867>Effects of corn dried distillers' grains with solubles on performance, egg quality, yolk fatty  composition and oxidative status in laying ducks.</a></h2><p>The study investigated the effects of increasing content of corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in the diets of laying ducks on oxidative status, laying performance, egg quality, and egg yolk fatty  composition. Longyan females (1080) with similar BW at 17 wk of age were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups, each consisting of 6 replicates of 30 birds. The basal diet (I) was a typical corn-soybean ration while the experimental diets (II to VI) substituted corn DDGS for soybean meal and wheat bran and a small reduction of corn. The level of substitution in diets (II to VI) was 6%, 12%, 18%, 24% and 30%. The experiment lasted for 18 wk. Average egg  decreased linearly as the level of corn DDGS inclusion increased (P < 0.001). Haugh unit, albumen , and proportion declined as linear responses to corn DDGS substitution (P < 0.05), but yolk color linearly increased (P < 0.001); the proportions of oleic (C18:1) and total monounsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk linearly decreased with increasing corn DDGS and many of the key polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like linoleic (C18:2n-6),  (C20:4n-6) and α-linolenic (C18:3n-3) acids linearly increased (P < 0.001), but not those of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docoshexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The PUFAs n-6/n-3 ratio linearly increased with increasing corn DDGS level (P < 0.001). Increasing corn DDGS linearly increased hepatic expression of GPX1, HO-1, and Nrf2 and hepatic activity of GSH-Px and the liver content of MDA (P < 0.001). There were no treatment effects on egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, eggshell thickness, strength, and yolk cholesterol content (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the use of corn DDGS is possible as a replacement, primarily for soybean meal at levels up to 18% in the diets of laying ducks without affecting laying performance, egg quality, and antioxidant status. Increasing amounts of corn DDGS linearly increased egg yolk concentrations of key fatty acids like like C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 and the antioxidant enzyme activity of GSH-Px through the Nrf2 pathway to avoid oxidative stress.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823619>Feed Restriction Reveals Distinct Serum Metabolome Profiles in Chickens Divergent in Feed Efficiency Traits.</a></h2><p>Restrictive feeding influences systemic metabolism of nutrients; however, this impact has not been evaluated in chickens of diverging feed efficiency. This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric  and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino acids were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:5, and 40:5) positively correlated with feed intake and  gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and  metabolism. Alterations in the hepatic synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and the need for precursors for gluconeogenesis due to varying energy demand may explain the marked differences in serum metabolite profiles in ad libitum and restrictively fed birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832728>Monoraphidium sp.

ALA is an essential fatty  which cannot be produced within the human  and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of ω-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3).Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty  composition of HDMA-20 lipid.A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of ω-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total lipid), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total lipid, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and lipid content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3 mg L day, and the lipid contents was 22.6% of dry .HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of ω-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and lipid accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective ω-3 PUFAs production in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606584>Impact of a modified anti-thrombotic guideline on stroke in children supported with a pediatric ventricular assist device.</a></h2><p>Stroke is the most feared complication associated with the Berlin Heart EXCOR pediatric ventricular assist device (VAD), the most commonly used VAD in children, and affects 1 in 3 children. We sought to determine whether a modified anti-thrombotic guideline, involving more intense platelet inhibition and less reliance on platelet function testing, is associated with a lower incidence of stroke.All children supported with the EXCOR at Stanford from 2009 to 2014 were divided into 2 cohorts based on the primary anti-thrombotic guideline used to prevent pump thrombosis: (1) the Edmonton Anti-thrombotic Guideline (EG) cohort, which included children implanted before September 2012 when dual anti-platelet therapy was used with doses titrated to Thromboelastrography/PlateletMapping (TEG/PM); and (2) the Stanford Modified Anti-thrombotic Guideline (SG) cohort, which included children implanted on or after September 2012 when triple anti-platelet therapy was used routinely and where doses were uptitrated to high, -based dosing targets, with low-dose steroids administered as needed for inflammation.At baseline, the EG (N = 16) and SG (N = 11) cohorts were similar. The incidence rate of stroke in the SG cohort was 84% lower than in the EG cohort (0.8 vs 4.9 events per 1,000 days of support, p = 0.031), and 86% lower than in the previous Investigational Device Exemption trial (p = 0.006).

Target doses of aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole were higher (all p < 0.003), with less dosing variability in the SG cohort than in the EG cohort. There was no difference in adenosine diphosphate inhibition by TEG/PM, but  inhibition was higher in the SG cohort (median 75% vs 39%, p = 0.008).Stroke was significantly less common in pediatric patients supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD using a triple anti-platelet regimen uptitrated to high, -based dosing targets as compared with the dual anti-platelet regimen titrated to PM, and without a higher risk of bleeding.

IGF-1 had positive associations with linoleic  (LA) at 2 days and 4 months and mead  (MA) showed positive associations in cord blood. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for maternal factors ( mass index,  gain, smoking, education), sex, birth  and feeding modality confirmed a negative association for the ratio AA/LA to IGF-1. MA in cord blood correlated to birth size. Changes in the ratios of n-6/n-3 and AA/docosahexaenoic  from day 2 to 4 months together with infants'  and feeding modality determined 55% of the variability of delta-IGF-1. Breast-fed infants at 4 months had lower IGF-1 correlating with lower LA and higher AA concentrations, which in girls correlated with lower  gain from birth to 4 months of age.Our data showed interaction of n-6 fatty acids with IGF-1 during the first 4 months of life, and an association between MA and birth size when adjusted for confounding factors. Further follow-up may indicate whether these correlations are associated with later  composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405034>High and Low Molecular  Hyaluronic  Differentially Influences Oxylipins Synthesis in Course of Neuroinflammation.</a></h2><p>Hyaluronic  (HA), a major glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix, has cell signaling functions that are dependent on its molecular . Anti-inflammatory effects for high-molecular- (HMW) HA and pro-inflammatory effects for low-molecular- (LMW) HA effects were found for various myeloid cells, including microglia. Astrocytes are cells of ectodermal origin that play a pivotal role in brain inflammation, but the link between HA with different molecular  and an inflammatory response in these cells is not clear. We tested the effects of LMW and HMW HA in rat primary astrocytes, stimulated with Poly:IC (PIC, TLR3 agonist) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4 agonist). Oxylipin profiles were measured by the UPLC-MS/MS analysis and metabolites HDoHEs (from docosahexaenoic ), -HETEs, prostaglandins (from ), DiHOMEs and HODEs (from linoleic ) were detected. Both, HMW and LMW HA downregulated the cyclooxygenase-mediated polyunsaturated fatty acids metabolism, LMW also reduced lipoxygenase-mediated fatty  metabolism. Taken together, the data show that both LMW and HMW (i) influence themselves on cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, IL-10), enzymes iNOS, COX-2, and oxylipin levels in extracellular medium of cultured astrocytes, (ii) induced cellular adaptations in long-term applications, (iii) modulate TLR4- and TLR3-signaling pathways. The effects of HMW and LMW HA are predominantly revealed in TLR4- and TLR3- mediated responses, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498567>The Red Alga Gracilariopsis chorda and Its Active Constituent  Promote Spine Dynamics via Dendritic Filopodia and Potentiate Functional Synaptic Plasticity in Hippocampal Neurons.</a></h2><p>Exogenous neurotrophins can induce neuronal differentiation, outgrowth, survival, and synaptic function in the central nervous system. In primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, an ethanol extract of the red alga Gracilariopsis chorda (GCE) and its active compound  (AA) significantly increased the densities of dendritic filopodia and spines, promoted the expression of presynaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), induced robust synaptogenesis, and increased the expression of cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) and actin-related protein 2 (ARP2), which are important for actin organization in dendritic protrusions, and facilitated presynaptic plasticity by increasing the size of the synaptic vesicle pool at presynaptic nerve terminals. In addition, oral administration of GCE and AA for 10 days, at concentrations of 1 mg/g and 2.2 μg/g , respectively, significantly protected against scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice by increasing the latency time in the passive avoidance test.

Here, we performed the following analysis in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model using LC-MS/MS. Oral administration of 2% DSS in mice for 4 days resulted in severe intestinal inflammation by day 7, which gradually subsided by day 18. Based on the disease scoring index (assigned on the basis of fecal condition and  loss), we defined the phases of colitis as induction (days 0-4), acute inflammation (days 4-7), recovery (days 7-9), and late recovery (days 9-18). Across all phases, 58 lipid mediators were detected in the inflamed colon tissue. In the induction phase, the production of n-6 fatty -derived prostaglandin E and thromboxane B increased by ∼2-fold. In the acute inflammation phase, the production of n-6 fatty -derived leukotrienes increased by >10-fold, while that of n-3 fatty -derived hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids decreased. In the recovery phase, a precursor of protectin D1 (17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic ) increased over 3-fold. These observations suggested dynamic changes in the production of lipid mediators across different phases of the disease and their potential regulation in healing colitis.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661024>Secondhand smoke alters  metabolism and inflammation in infants and children with cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Mechanisms that facilitate early infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) are unclear. We previously demonstrated that children with CF and parental-reported secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) have increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. SHSe hinders  (AA) metabolites that mediate immune function in patients without CF, and may influence CF immune dysfunction. We aimed to define SHSe's impact on inflammation mediators and infection in children with CF.Seventy-seven children with CF <10 years of age 35 infants <1 year; 42 children 1-10 years) were enrolled and hair nicotine concentrations measured as an objective surrogate of SHSe. AA signalling by serum and macrophage lipidomics, inflammation using blood transcriptional profiles and in vitro macrophage responses to bacterial infection after SHSe were assessed.Hair nicotine concentrations were elevated in 63% of patients. Of the AA metabolites measured by plasma lipidomics, prostaglandin D (PGD) concentrations were decreased in children with CF exposed to SHSe, and associated with more frequent hospitalisations (p=0.007) and worsened  z scores (p=0.008). Children with CF exposed to SHSe demonstrated decreased expression of the prostaglandin genes PTGES3 and PTGR2 and overexpression of inflammatory pathways. These findings were confirmed using an in vitro model, where SHSe was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in PGD and increased methicillin-resistant  survival in human CF macrophages.Infants and young children with CF and SHSe have altered AA metabolism and dysregulated inflammatory gene expression resulting in impaired bacterial clearance. Our findings identified potential therapeutic targets to halt early disease progression associated with SHSe in the young population with CF.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

An experimental pre-post test, single group design was used. Fifteen post-menopausal women with obesity were enrolled in a 12-week pilot intervention focusing on lowering added sugars and increasing fiber and fish rich in n-3 PUFAs. Measurements included fasting blood samples, anthropometric, lifestyle and dietary data collected at baseline, end of intervention (Week 12) and follow-up (Week 24). Primary outcomes were change in erythrocyte PUFAs and associations between erythrocyte PUFAs, QOL (Short Form 12), and inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α-receptor 2, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP)). Fourteen women completed all intervention visits.

Quality of dietary fat, beyond the quantity, can influence CV risk profile and, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids (FA) have been proposed as beneficial in this setting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations of individual CV risk factors, characterizing the MetS, with erythrocyte membrane FA, markers of average intake, in a group of 70 overweight/obese children.We conducted an observational study. Erythrocyte membrane FA were measured by gas chromatography. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to evaluate associations between FA and features of the MetS.Mean content of Omega-3 FA was low (Omega-3 Index = 4.7 ± 0.8%). Not omega-3 FA but some omega-6 FA, especially  (AA), were inversely associated with several features of the MetS: AA resulted inversely correlated with waist circumference (r = - 0.352), triglycerides (r = - 0.379), fasting insulin (r = - 0.337) and 24-h SBP (r = - 0.313).

However, the hot carcass yield was higher for females and castrated males than for entire males. Luminosity values were influenced ( < 0.05) by sex, with entire males presenting higher values than castrated males and females. Females showed higher ( < 0.05) concentrations of linoleic  and  in the meat of the  muscle. The meat of animals submitted to AL intake and 30% FR showed similar ( > 0.05) concentrations, and the concentrations of palmitic , palmitoleic , stearic , oleic  and conjugated linoleic  were higher ( < 0.05) than those of animals with 60% FR. The meat of females had a higher ω6/ω3 ratio and lower h/H ratio, and females had greater levels of feeding. The meat of animals on the 60% FR diet had a greater ω6/ω3 ratio, lower h/H ratio and lower concentration of desirable fatty acids in addition to a greater atherogenicity index (AI) and thrombogenicity index (TI).Lambs of different sexes had carcasses with different quantitative traits without total influence on the chemical and physical meat characteristics.

We previously demonstrated that a high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic dysregulation, cardiac fibrosis and accumulation of more PAT in minipigs. This study used our obese minipig model to investigate the characteristics of PAT and omental visceral fat (VAT) induced by a HFD, and the potential link between PAT and HFD-related myocardial fibrosis.Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a HFD for 6 months.The HFD induced dyslipidemia, cardiac fibrosis and more fat accumulation in the visceral and pericardial depots. The HFD changes the fatty  composition in the adipose tissue by decreasing the portion of linoleic  in the VAT and PAT. No  was detected in the VAT and PAT of control pigs, whereas it existed in the same tissues of obese pigs fed the HFD. Compared with the control pigs, elevated levels of malondialdehyde and TNFα were exhibited in the plasma and PAT of obese pigs. HFD induced greater size of adipocytes in VAT and PAT. Higher levels of GH, leptin, OPG, PDGF, resistin, SAA and TGFβ were observed in obese pig PAT compared to VAT.This study demonstrated the similarities and dissimilarities between PAT and VAT under HFD stimulus. In addition, this study suggested that alteration in PAT contributed to the myocardial damage.© 2018 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28529008>Role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human brain structure and function across the lifespan: An update on neuroimaging findings.</a></h2><p>There is a substantial  of evidence from animal studies implicating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in neuroinflammatory, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective processes in brain. However, direct evidence for a role of PUFA in human brain structure and function has been lacking. Over the last decade there has been a notable increase in neuroimaging studies that have investigated the impact of PUFA intake and/or blood levels (i.e., biostatus) on brain structure, function, and pathology in human subjects. The majority of these studies specifically evaluated associations between omega-3 PUFA intake and/or biostatus and neuroimaging outcomes using a variety of experimental designs and imaging techniques. This review provides an updated overview of these studies in an effort to identify patterns to guide and inform future research. While the  of evidence provides general support for a beneficial effect of a habitual diet consisting of higher omega-3 PUFA intake on cortical structure and function in healthy human subjects, additional research is needed to replicate and extend these findings as well as identify response mediators and clarify mechanistic pathways. Controlled intervention trials are also needed to determine whether increasing n-3 PUFA biostatus can prevent or attenuate neuropathological brain changes observed in patients with or at risk for psychiatric disorders and dementia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The variables measured were fasting blood glucose and insulin levels; glucose tolerance; diacylglycerols as intracellular mediators of insulin resistance in adipose tissue (AT), liver, and muscle; inflammation markers (plasma IL-6 and leptin, and liver and AT histology markers); eicosanoids from  as lipid mediators of inflammation; and the populations of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Enterobacteriales, and Bifidobacteriales in feces. It was found that d-fagomine reduces fat-induced impaired glucose tolerance, inflammation markers, and mediators (hepatic microgranulomas and lobular inflammation, plasma IL-6, prostaglandin E , and leukotriene B ) while attenuating the changes in the populations of Enterobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales.d-Fagomine delays the development of a fat-induced prediabetic state in rats by reducing low-grade inflammation. We suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of d-fagomine may be linked to a reduction in fat-induced overpopulation of minor gut bacteria.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Children born at less than 35 weeks' gestation who were 10 to 16 months corrected age underwent 6 months of intervention. Of 2363 children assessed, 982 were eligible, 605 declined, and 377 enrolled and were randomized. Analyses were according to intent to treat.One-to-one allocation to receive daily microencapsulated DHA, 200 mg, and  (AA), 200 mg (DHA+AA), or microencapsulated corn oil (placebo).The primary outcome specified a priori was Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley-III), cognitive composite score at 16 to 22 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes were Bayley-III language and motor composite scores and Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised and Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire effortful control and activity level scores. Subgroup analyses defined a priori were by income, sex, and birth .Among 377 children randomized and included in the analysis (182 girls and 195 boys; median corrected age, 15.7 months), 338 children (89.7%) had complete data on the primary outcome. Bayley-III cognitive scores did not differ between the DHA+AA and placebo groups (difference in change, 0.5 [95% CI, -1.8 to 2.8]; effect size, 0.05; P = .66). Assignment to the DHA+AA group had a small to medium negative effect on Bayley-III language scores among children with lower birth  (eg, a child with a birth  of 1000 g assigned to receive DHA+AA experienced a 4.1-point relative decrease, while a child assigned to placebo did not; P = .03 for interaction).

Here we evaluated the impact of the colonic fatty  milieu on the formation of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. Distal tumors in rats were chemically induced to model inflammatory colonic carcinogenesis. After 21 weeks of feeding with either a fish oil diet containing an eicosapentaenoic /ω-6 fatty  ratio of 0.4 or a Western fat diet, the relationships between colon fatty acids and prostaglandin E (PGE) concentrations were evaluated. PGE is a key proinflammatory mediator in the colon tightly linked with the initiation and progression of colon cancer. The fish oil vs. the Western fat diet resulted in reduced total fatty  concentrations in serum but not in colon. In the colon, the effects of the fish oil on fatty acids differed in normal and tumor tissue. There were distinct lipodomic patterns consistent with a lipogenic phenotype in tumors. In tumor tissue, the eicosapentaenoic / ratio, cyclooxygenase-2 expression and the mole percent of saturated fatty acids were significant predictors of inter-animal variability in colon PGE after accounting for diet. In normal tissues from either control rats or carcinogen-treated rats, only diet was a significant predictor of colon PGE. These results show that the fatty  milieu can modulate the efficacy of dietary fish oils for colon cancer prevention, and this could extend to other preventive agents that function by reducing inflammatory stress.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

After 6 wk, 18 ducks from each group were killed. Abdominal fat ratio and pH (at 45 min and 24 h postmortem), color parameters (lightness, redness, and yellowness), water-holding capacity, cooking loss, shear force, and intramuscular fat and fatty  contents were measured. Six more ducks were killed to isolate RNA from their abdominal fat tissue for measurements of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), obese (leptin), and adiponectin (ADP) expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that  gain was higher in the FG group than in the control and NFG groups, whereas feed conversion ratio was lower (P < 0.05). The abdominal fat contents were lower in the NFG and FG groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). The NFG and FG groups had lower levels of saturated fatty acids (mainly palmitic ) and higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mainly linoleic  and ) than the control group. The mRNA expressions of PPARγ, leptin, and ADP in abdominal fat tissue were significantly increased in the NFG and FG groups, and the mRNA expression of PPARγ was higher in the FG group than in the NFG group (P < 0.05). These results suggest that fermenting G. biloba reduces the deposition of abdominal fat and improves the fatty  profile of Peking duck meat.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031388>Postnatal RBC  and docosahexaenoic acids deficiencies are associated with higher risk of neonatal morbidities and mortality in preterm infants.</a></h2><p> (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids are essential for the health and development of the neonate.

In order to assess their power to modulate the fatty  and oxylipin pattern, we thoroughly compared fat-1 and wild-type C57BL/6 mice on a sunflower oil diet with wild-type mice on the same diet enriched with 1% EPA and 1% DHA for 0, 7, 14, 30 and 45 days. Feeding led after 14-30 days to a high steady state of n3-PUFA in all tissues at the expense of n6-PUFAs. Levels of n3-PUFA achieved by feeding were higher compared to fat-1 mice, particularly for EPA (max. 1.7% in whole blood of fat-1 vs. 7.8% following feeding). Changes in PUFAs were reflected in most oxylipins in plasma, brain and colon: Compared to wild-type mice on a standard diet,  metabolites were overall decreased while EPA and DHA oxylipins increased with feeding more than in fat-1 mice. In plasma of n3-PUFA fed animals, EPA and DHA metabolites from the lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 pathways dominated over ARA derived counterparts.Fat-1 mice show n3-PUFA level which can be reached by dietary interventions, supporting the applicability of this model in n3-PUFA research.

The fatty  composition of today's 'modern diet' tends towards higher n-6 PUFA levels in relation to n-3 PUFA. Low dietary n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio is a health concern, as n-6 PUFA give rise to eicosanoids and PG, which are traditionally considered pro-inflammatory, especially when derived from ARA. Juvenile zebrafish fed a high-ARA diet for 17 d had a lower whole- n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio compared with zebrafish fed a low-ARA (control) diet (0·6 in the control group v. 0·2 in the high-ARA group). Metabolic profiling revealed altered levels of eicosanoids, PUFA, dicarboxylic acids and complex lipids such as glycerophospholipids and lysophospholipids as the most significant differences compared with the control group. ARA-derived hydroxylated eicosanoids, such as hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids, were elevated in response to high-ARA feed. In addition, increased levels of oxidised lipids and amino acids indicated an oxidised environment due to n-6 PUFA excess in the fish. To conclude, our results indicate that an ARA-enriched diet induces changes in complex lipids and immune-related eicosanoids and increases levels of oxidised lipids and amino acids, suggesting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399727>Implications of Lipids in Neonatal  and Fat Mass in Gestational Diabetic Mothers and Non-Diabetic Controls.</a></h2><p>Maternal lipid metabolism greatly changes during pregnancy and we review in this article how they influence fetal adiposity and growth under non-diabetic and gestational diabetic conditions.In pregnant women without diabetes (control), maternal glycemia correlates with neonatal glycemia, neonatal  and fat mass. In pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), maternal glucose correlates with neither neonatal glycemia, neonatal birth  nor fat mass, but maternal triacylglycerols (TAG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol do correlate with birth  and neonatal adiposity. The proportions of maternal plasma  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids decrease from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy, and at term these long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are higher in cord blood plasma than in mothers, indicating efficient placental transfer. In control or pregnant women with GDM at term, the maternal concentration of individual fatty acids does not correlate with neonatal  or fat mass, but cord blood fatty  levels correlate with birth  and neonatal adiposity-positively in controls, but negatively in GDM. The proportion of AA and DHA in umbilical artery plasma in GDM is lower than in controls but not in umbilical vein plasma. Therefore, an increased utilization of those two fatty acids by fetal tissues, rather than impaired placental transfer, is responsible for their smaller proportion in plasma of GDM newborns. In control pregnant women, maternal glycemia controls neonatal  and fat mass, whereas in mothers with GDM-even with good glycemic control-maternal lipids and their greater utilization by the fetus play a critical role in neonatal  and fat mass. We propose that altered lipid metabolism rather than hyperglycemia constitutes a risk for macrosomia in GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690640>Early Mechanistic Events Induced by Low Molecular  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Mouse Lung Epithelial Cells: A Role for Eicosanoid Signaling.</a></h2><p>Low molecular  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (LMW PAHs; < 206.3 g/mol) are under regulated environmental contaminants (eg, secondhand smoke) that lead to gap junction dysregulation, p38 MAPK activation, and increased mRNA production of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and cyclooxygenase (COX2), in lung epithelial cells. However, the early mechanisms involving lipid signaling through the  pathway and subsequent eicosanoid production leading to these downstream events are not known. Common human exposures are to mixtures of LMW PAHs, thus C10 cells (a mouse lung epithelial cell line) were exposed to a representative binary PAH mixture, 1-methylanthracene (1-MeA) and fluoranthene (Flthn), for 30 min-24 h with and without p38 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitors. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibition reversed PAH-induced phospho-p38 MAPK activation and gap junction dysregulation at 30 min. A significant biphasic increase in cPLA2 protein was observed at 30 min, 2, and 4 h, as well as COX2 protein at 2 and 8 h. Untargeted metabolomics demonstrated a similar trend with significantly changing metabolites at 30 min and 4 h of exposure relative to 1 h; a "cPLA2-like" subset of metabolites within the biphasic response were predominately phospholipids. Targeted metabolomics showed several eicosanoids (eg, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), PGE2α) were significantly increased at 4, 8, and 12 h following exposure to the binary PAH mixture and this effect was p38-dependent. Finally, PAH metabolism was not observed until after 8 h. These results indicate an early lipid signaling mechanism of LMW PAH toxicity in lung epithelial cells due to parent PAH compounds.© The Author(s) 2019.

The results showed that the grade III crabs had the largest gonadsomatic index (GSI), which was significantly higher than the grade I and grade II crabs, no significant difference was found with the grade IV crab. Significant differences in moisture and total lipid contents were observed among various edible parts from different grades of male . In particular, grade II crabs had the highest total lipid and dry matter content for hepatopancreas. A balanced amino acids composition and a high essential amino acids score (EAAS) were found in the muscle and gonads of grade III crabs. The levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in the hepatopancreas, as well as the contents of PUFA, highly-unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), n-3 PUFA,  (ARA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) in the gonads were significantly increased in the grade II crabs. Taken together, it can generally be concluded that adult male  of 150-200 g (Grade II-III)  have the highest nutritional quality even though they are not the largest crabs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589625>Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and extensively hydrolyzed casein-induced browning in a Ucp-1 reporter mouse model of obesity.</a></h2><p>Browning in adipose tissues, which can be affected by diet, may mitigate the detrimental effects of adiposity and improve longer-term metabolic health. Here, browning-inducing effects of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g.,  (ARA)/docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and extensively hydrolyzed casein (eHC) were investigated in uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp-1) reporter mice. To address the overall functionality, their potential role in supporting a healthy metabolic profile under obesogenic dietary challenges later in life was evaluated. At weaning Ucp1+/LUC reporter mice were fed a control low fat diet (LFD) with or without ARA + DHA, eHC or eHC + ARA + DHA for 8 weeks until week 12 after which interventions continued for another 12 weeks under a high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Serology (metabolic responses and inflammation) and in vivo and ex vivo luciferase activity were determined; in the meantime browning-related proteins UCP-1 and the genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and Ucp-1 were examined. ARA + DHA, eHC or their combination reduced  gain and adipose tissue  compared to the HFD mice. The interventions induced Ucp-1 expression in adipose tissues prior to and during the HFD exposure. Ucp-1 induction was accompanied by higher PGC1a and PRDM16 expression. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were improved coinciding with lower serum cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, leptin, resistin, fibroblast growth factor 21, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and higher adiponectin than the HFD group. HFD-associated increased systemic (IL-1β and TNF-α) and adipose tissue inflammation (F4/80, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) was reduced. Studies in a Ucp-1 reporter mouse model revealed that early intervention with ARA/DHA and eHC improves metabolic flexibility and attenuates obesity during HFD challenge later in life. Increased browning is suggested as, at least, part of the underlying mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102583>Effects of Diet and Social Housing on Reproductive Success in Adult Zebrafish, Danio rerio.</a></h2><p>Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have proven their efficiency as an animal model for genetics and development, but their nutrition and housing requirements continue to elude researchers. Diet and housing density were predicted to affect  change and reproductive success in 120 days postfertilization (dpf) zebrafish, and growth performance of their progeny. Fish were fed one of four diets, each utilizing a different primary protein source (fish meal [Zeigler™], algae, or insect), while being housed 3.3 or 6.6 fish/L for 3 weeks. Clutch size, viability, and larval development of their progeny were monitored out to 10 dpf. All diets were sent out for proximate nutrient analysis and fatty  profiles to understand how diet compositions affect reproduction. We found that diet and housing proximity affected adult fish  and larvae growth; diets composed of higher levels of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids (specifically  [AA] and eicosapentanoic ) allowed fish to gain  and produce healthy larvae. Fish housed at higher densities produced smaller embryos, but larger larvae than those housed at lower densities. These findings imply that significant effects of a modified stimulus are exhibited after relatively short periods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28494548>[The role of cytochrome P450 in nonalcoholic fatty liver induced by high-fat diet: a gene expression profile analysis].</a></h2><p> To clarify the role of cytochrome P450 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by RNA-Seq and bioinformatics analysis.  A total of 20 male C57BL/6 mice were used. Ten mice were fed with high-fat diet (D12492, 60% kcal fat) for 16 weeks to establish a mouse model of NAFLD, and the other 10 mice were fed with low-fat diet (D12450B, 10% kcal fat) as control group. At the end of the experiment, the , liver , and hepatic triglyceride (TG) content were measured. Meanwhile, HE staining and RNA-Seq analysis were performed for the liver tissues. The differentially expressed genes were screened out and subjected to bioinformatics analysis, including KEGG and GO BP enrichment analyses and interaction network analysis. Comparison of means between the two groups was made using t-test.  Compared with the control group, the mice in the model group were obviously obese, with significantly increased  (41.41 ± 6.01 g vs 28.78 ± 1.79 g,  = 6.04,  < 0.01) and liver  (1.38 ± 0.30 g vs 1.08 ± 0.10 g,  = 2.89,  < 0.01). The mice in the model group showed obvious steatosis, accompanied by a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration, but with no obvious fibrosis, according to the results of HE staining. In addition, the hepatic TG content in the model group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (0.64 ± 0.01 mg/mg vs 0.29 ± 0.06 mg/mg,  = 10.11,  = 0.04). Compared with the control group, a total of 367 differentially expressed genes, including 211 down-regulated and 156 up-regulated ones, were identified in the model group according to the RNA-seq results. Meanwhile, 19 CYP450 subtypes, accounting for 5% of the differentially expressed genes, were identified, and CYP2E1, CYP2C70, CYP3A11, CYP3A25, CYP2D26, CYP4A10, CYP17A1, CYP2B10, and CYP2C38 were involved in oxidative stress, steroid hormone metabolism, fatty  metabolism,  metabolism, and the PPAR signaling pathway. An interaction network was constructed with 30 nodes, and CYP2E1 and CYP2C70 were identified as key nodes. RT-PCR validation results showed that the expression changes of CYP450 subtypes and lipid metabolism-related genes were consistent with the findings of sequencing.  The CYP450 family plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of fatty liver by regulating lipid metabolism-related pathways, including oxidative stress,  metabolism, steroid hormone metabolism , and fatty  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678821>A casein hydrolysate based formulation attenuates obesity and associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis in LDLr-/-.Leiden mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity frequently associates with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) seems to be an important driver of these manifestations.This study investigated a combination of an extensively hydrolyzed casein (eHC), docosahexaenoic  (DHA),  (ARA), and Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG (LGG) (together referred to as nutritional ingredients, NI) on the development of obesity, metabolic risk factors, WAT inflammation, NAFLD and atherosclerosis in high-fat diet-fed LDLr-/-.Leiden mice, a model that mimics disease development in humans.LDLr-/-.Leiden male mice (n = 15/group) received a high-fat diet (HFD, 45 Kcal%) for 21 weeks with or without the NI (23.7% eHC, 0.083% DHA, 0.166% ARA; all w/w and 1x109 CFU LGG gavage 3 times/week). HFD and HFD+NI diets were isocaloric. A low fat diet (LFD, 10 Kcal%) was used for reference. , food intake and metabolic risk factors were assessed over time. At week 21, tissues were analyzed for WAT inflammation (crown-like structures), NAFLD and atherosclerosis. Effects of the individual NI components were explored in a follow-up experiment (n = 7/group).When compared to HFD control, treatment with the NI strongly reduced  to levels of the LFD group, and significantly lowered (P<0.01) plasma insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin and serum amyloid A (P<0.01). NI also reduced WAT mass and inflammation. Strikingly, NI treatment significantly reduced macrovesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation and liver collagen (P<0.05), and attenuated atherosclerosis development (P<0.01). Of the individual components, the effects of eHC were most pronounced but could not explain the entire effects of the NI formulation.A combination of eHC, ARA, DHA and LGG attenuates obesity and associated cardiometabolic diseases (NAFLD, atherosclerosis) in LDLr-/-.Leiden mice. The observed reduction of inflammation in adipose tissue and in the liver provides a rationale for these comprehensive health effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642348>FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF KNOCK-IN MICE EXPRESSING A 12/15-LIPOXYGENATING ALOX5 MUTANT INSTEAD OF THE 5-LIPOXYGENATING WILDTYPE ENZYME.</a></h2><p>Most mammalian genomes involve several genes encoding for functionally distinct ALOX-isoforms. Pro-inflammatory leukotrienes are formed via the ALOX5 pathway but 12/15-lipoxygenating ALOX-isoforms have been implicated in the biosynthesis of pro-resolving mediators. In vitro mutagenesis of the triad determinants abolished the leukotriene synthesizing activity of ALOX5 but the biological consequences of these alterations have not been studied. To fill this gap we created Alox5 knock-in mice, which express the 12/15-lipoxygenating Phe359Trp+Ala424Ile+Asn425Met Alox5 triple mutant and characterized its phenotypic alterations.The mouse Alox5 triple mutant functions as  15-lipoxygenating enzyme, which also forms 12S-hydroxy and 8S-hydroxy . In contrast to the wildtype enzyme the triple mutant effectively oxygenates linoleic  to the activating PPARγ ligand 13S-hydroxy linoleic . Knock-in mice expressing the mutant enzyme are viable, fertile and develop normally. The mice cannot synthesize pro-inflammatory leukotrienes but show significantly attenuated plasma levels of lipolytic endocannabinoids. When aging the animals gained significantly more , which may be related to the 5-fold higher levels of 13-hydroxy linoleic  in the adipose tissue.These data indicate for the first time that in vivo mutagenesis of the triad determinants of mouse Alox5 abolished the biosynthetic capacity of the enzyme for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and altered the catalytic properties of the protein favoring the formation of 13-hydroxy linoleic .In vivo triple mutation of the mouse Alox5 gene impacts the  homeostasis of aging mice via augmented formation of the activating PPARγ ligand 13-hydroxy linoleic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346523>A moderate diet restriction during pregnancy alters the levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-related lipids in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and olfactory bulb of rat offspring in a sex-specific manner.</a></h2><p>Undernutrition during pregnancy has been associated to increased vulnerability to develop metabolic and behavior alterations later in life. The endocannabinoid system might play an important role in these processes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a moderate maternal calorie-restricted diet on the levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG),  (AA) and the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) anandamide (AEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in the brain of newborn rat offspring. We focused on brain structures involved in metabolism, feeding behavior, as well as emotional and cognitive responses. Female Wistar rats were assigned during the entire pregnancy to either control diet (C) or restriction diet (R), consisting of a 20% calorie-restricted diet.  gain and caloric intake of rat dams were monitored and birth outcomes were assessed. 2-AG, AA and NAE levels were measured in hypothalamus, hippocampus and olfactory bulb of the offspring. R dams displayed lower gain  from the middle pregnancy and consumed less calories during the entire pregnancy. Offspring from R dams were underweight at birth, but litter size was unaffected. In hypothalamus, R male offspring displayed decreased levels of AA and OEA, with no change in the levels of the endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA. R female exhibited decreased 2-AG and PEA levels. The opposite was found in the hippocampus, where R male displayed increased 2-AG and AA levels, and R female exhibited elevated levels of AEA, AA and PEA. In the olfactory bulb, only R female presented decreased levels of AEA, AA and PEA. Therefore, a moderate diet restriction during the entire pregnancy alters differentially the endocannabinoids and/or endocannabinoid-related lipids in hypothalamus and hippocampus of the underweight offspring, similarly in both sexes, whereas sex-specific alterations occur in the olfactory bulb. Consequently, endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid-related lipid signaling alterations might be involved in the long-term and sexual dimorphism effects commonly observed after undernutrition and low birth .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728086>Seafood intake and the development of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>We provide an overview of studies on seafood intake in relation to obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Overweight and obesity development is for most individuals the result of years of positive energy balance. Evidence from intervention trials and animal studies suggests that frequent intake of lean seafood, as compared with intake of terrestrial meats, reduces energy intake by 4-9 %, sufficient to prevent a positive energy balance and obesity. At equal energy intake, lean seafood reduces fasting and postprandial risk markers of insulin resistance, and improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adults. Energy restriction combined with intake of lean and fatty seafood seems to increase  loss. Marine n-3 PUFA are probably of importance through n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids and oxylipins, but other constituents of seafood such as the fish protein per se, trace elements or vitamins also seem to play a largely neglected role. A high intake of fatty seafood increases circulating levels of the insulin-sensitising hormone adiponectin. As compared with a high meat intake, high intake of seafood has been reported to reduce plasma levels of the hepatic acute-phase protein C-reactive protein level in some, but not all studies. More studies are needed to confirm the dietary effects on energy intake, obesity and insulin resistance. Future studies should be designed to elucidate the potential contribution of trace elements, vitamins and undesirables present in seafood, and we argue that stratification into responders and non-responders in randomised controlled trials may improve the understanding of health effects from intake of seafood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28528506>Exposure of marine mussels to diclofenac: modulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Human pharmaceuticals, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are an emerging threat to marine organisms. NSAIDs act through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) conversion of  into prostaglandins. One experiment was carried out whereby marine mussels were exposed for 72 h to 1 and 100 μg/L diclofenac (DCF). A specific and sensitive method using liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry was developed to quantify DCF in mussel tissues. The developed method could also clearly identify and quantify COX products, i.e., prostaglandin levels, and be used to assess their modulation following DCF exposure. Prostaglandin-D (PGD) was always found below the detection limit (20 μg/kg dry  (dw)). Basal prostaglandin-E (PGE) concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 202 μg/kg dw. Exposure of 100 μg/L resulted in a significant reduction in PGE levels, whereas a downward trend was observed at 1 μg/L exposure.

The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C20:4), FFA especially palmitic  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys.Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735766>Fructus Gardeniae-induced gastrointestinal injury was associated with the inflammatory response mediated by the disturbance of vitamin B6, phenylalanine, , taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.</a></h2><p>Fructus Gardenia (FG) is a widely used bitter and cold herb for clearing heat and detoxicating. Currently, toxicity of FG and its relative formula has been reported in many clinical and animal studies. However, no systematic research has been carried out on FG-related gastrointestinal (GI) injury which has been emphasized in China since the Ming Dynasty.The purpose of this article is to investigate whether FG could damage GI and explore the mechanisms involved.FG was given to male mice by 7-day intragastric administration at average doses of 0.90 g (L group), 1.50 g (M group), and 3.00 g (H group) crude drug/kg FG. Comprehensive understanding of changes in , diarrhea degree, stool routine, histomorphology and inflammatory factors of stomach, small intestine, and colon for evaluating the effect of different doses of FG on GI injury. Moreover, metabolomics-based mechanisms exploration of FG on GI injury was carried out via HPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis on mice urine.High dose FG caused GI injury with serious diarrhea, decreased , abnormal stool routine, sever alteration in histomorphology of small intestine and colon (mild change in stomach), and significant change in inflammatory factors. The results of metabolomics suggested that 55 endogenous metabolites dispersed in 21 significantly altered metabolic pathways in 3.00 g/kg crude FG treated mice. The hub metabolites of GI injury were mainly related with vitamin B6 metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism,  metabolism, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism via correlated network analysis.FG affected the normal functions of GI via the regulating a variety of metabolic pathways to an abnormal state, and our results provided a research paradigm for the GI-injury of the relative bitter and cold traditional Chinese medicines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, their metabolic phenotype after digestion has not been studied. In this study, the effects of honey-extracted polyphenols (HEPs) on serum antioxidant capacity and metabolic phenotype were revealed for the first time. Herein, sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: one group was administered HEPs (200 mg per kilogram  dose) and the other group was fed distilled water three times. Then, 1 h after the last gavage, the metabolic profiling of serum was analyzed by UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS and multivariate statistical analysis, and the following results were obtained. At first, twenty-five metabolites, including polyphenols, unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids, were selected as potential biomarkers. Then, metabolic pathway analysis showed that several amino  metabolism pathways, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis,  metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and inositol phosphate metabolism were affected. Association analysis demonstrated that the alteration of metabolites may be responsible for the increased serum antioxidant capacity. This new insight into the effects on the metabolic phenotype after HEP intake prompted the study on the biological functions and emerging health benefits of HEPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30298207>Choline and choline-related nutrients in regular and preterm infant growth.</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient, with increased requirements during development. It forms the headgroup of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in all membranes and many secretions. Phosphatidylcholine is linked to cell signaling as a phosphocholine donor to synthesize sphingomyelin from ceramide, a trigger of apoptosis, and is the major carrier of  and docosahexaenoic  in plasma. Acetylcholine is important for neurodevelopment and the placental storage form for fetal choline supply. Betaine, a choline metabolite, functions as osmolyte and methyl donor. Their concentrations are all tightly regulated in tissues.During the fetal growth spurt at 24-34-week postmenstrual age, plasma choline is higher than beyond 34 weeks, and threefold higher than in pregnant women [45 (36-60) µmol/L vs. 14 (10-17) µmol/L]. The rapid decrease in plasma choline after premature birth suggests an untimely reduction in choline supply, as cellular uptake is proportional to plasma concentration. Supply via breast milk, with phosphocholine and α-glycerophosphocholine as its major choline components, does not prevent such postnatal decrease. Moreover, high amounts of liver PC are secreted via bile, causing rapid hepatic choline turnover via the enterohepatic cycle, and deficiency in case of pancreatic phospholipase A2 deficiency or intestinal resection. Choline deficiency causes hepatic damage and choline accretion at the expense of the lungs and other tissues.Choline deficiency may contribute to the impaired lean  mass growth and pulmonary and neurocognitive development of preterm infants despite adequate macronutrient supply and  gain. In this context, a reconsideration of current recommendations for choline supply to preterm infants is required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031402>Associations between maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  concentrations and child cognition at 7 years of age: The MEFAB birth cohort.</a></h2><p>Concentrations of the fish fatty acids EPA and DHA are low among Dutch women of reproductive age. As the human brain incorporates high concentrations of these fatty acids in utero, particularly during third trimester of gestation, these low EPA and DHA concentrations may have adverse consequences for fetal brain development and functioning.Analyses were conducted using longitudinal observational data of 292 mother-child pairs participating in the MEFAB cohort. Maternal AA, DHA, and EPA were determined in plasma phospholipids - obtained in three trimesters - by gas-liquid chromatography. Cognitive function was assessed at 7 years of age, using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, resulting in three main outcome parameters: sequential processing (short-term memory), simultaneous processing (problem-solving skills), and the mental processing composite score. Spline regression and linear regression analyses were used to analyse the data, while adjusting for potential relevant covariates.Only 2% of the children performed more than one SD below the mental processing composite norm score. Children with lower test scores (<25%) were more likely to have a younger mother with a higher pre-gestational BMI, less likely to be breastfed, and more likely to be born with a lower birth , compared to children with higher test scores (≥25%). Fully-adjusted linear regression models did not show associations of maternal AA, DHA, or EPA status during any of the pregnancy trimesters with childhood sequential and simultaneous processing.Maternal fatty  status during pregnancy was not associated with cognitive performance in Dutch children at age 7.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to normal individuals, obese individuals have noted pathophysiological alterations which may alter the toxicokinetics of xenobiotics and therefore alter their toxicities. However, the effects of obesity on the toxicity of many widely utilized pesticides has not been established. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if the obese phenotype altered the toxicity of the most widely used organophosphate (OP) insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPS). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed normal or high-fat diet for 4weeks and administered a single dose of vehicle or CPS (2.0mg/kg; oral gavage) to assess cholinergic (acetylcholinesterase activities) and non-cholinergic (carboxylesterase and endocannabinoid hydrolysis) endpoints. Exposure to CPS significantly decreased red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, but not brain AChE activity, in both diet groups. Further, CPS exposure decreased hepatic carboxylesterase activity and hepatic hydrolysis of a major endocannabinoid, anandamide, in a diet-dependent manner with high-fat diet fed animals being more sensitive to CPS-mediated inhibition. These in vivo studies were corroborated by in vitro studies using rat primary hepatocytes, which demonstrated that fatty  amide hydrolase and CES activities were more sensitive to CPS-mediated inhibition than 2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolase activity. These data demonstrate hepatic CES and FAAH activities in high-fat diet fed mice were more potently inhibited than those in normal diet fed mice following CPS exposure, which suggests that the obese phenotype may exacerbate some of the non-cholinergic effects of CPS exposure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Docosahexaenoic  (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), is also beneficial for cognition, but is susceptible to oxidation. The present study characterized the membrane distribution of lutein in brain regions important for different domains of cognitive function and determined whether membrane lutein was associated with brain PUFA oxidation.Adult rhesus monkeys were fed a stock diet (~2 mg/day lutein or ~0.5 μmol/kg /day) (n = 9) or the stock diet plus a daily supplement of lutein (~4.5 mg/day or~1 μmol/kg /day) and zeaxanthin (~0.5 mg/day or 0.1 μmol/kg /day) for 6-12 months (n = 4). Nuclear, myelin, mitochondrial, and neuronal plasma membranes were isolated using a Ficoll density gradient from prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CER), striatum (ST), and hippocampus (HC). Carotenoids, PUFAs, and PUFA oxidation products were measured using HPLC, GC, and LC-GC/MS, respectively.All-trans-lutein (ng/mg protein) was detected in all regions and membranes and was highly variable among monkeys. Lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation significantly increased total concentrations of lutein in serum, PFC and CER, as well as lutein in mitochondrial membranes and total DHA concentrations in PFC only (P<0.05). In PFC and ST, mitochondrial lutein was inversely related to DHA oxidation products, but not those from  (P <0.05).This study provides novel data on subcellular lutein accumulation and its relationship to DHA oxidation in primate brain. These findings support the hypothesis that lutein may be associated with antioxidant functions in the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30287737>A Novel Antithrombotic Protease from Marine Worm .</a></h2><p>, an old marine species, has great potential for use as functional seafood due to its various bioactivities. Its potential antithrombotic activity pushed us to isolate the bio-active components bio-guided by tracking fibrinolytic activity. As a result, a novel protease named as SK (the kinase obtained from ) was obtained, which possessed a molecular  of 28,003.67 Da and 15 N-terminal amino  sequences of PFPVPDPFVWDTSFQ. SK exerted inhibitory effects on thrombus formation through improving the coagulation system with dose-effect relationship within a certain range. Furthermore, in most cases SK got obviously better effect than that of urokinase. With the help of untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling, , sphingolipid, and nicotinate and nicotinamide mechanism pathways were found to be important pathways. They revealed that the effect mechanism of SK on common carotid arterial thrombosis induced by FeCl₃ was achieved by inhibiting vessel contraction, platelet aggregation, adhesion, and release, correcting endothelial cell dysfunction and retarding process of thrombus formation. This study demonstrated SK was a promising thrombolytic agent on the basis of its comprehensive activities on thrombosis, and it should get further exploitation and utilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015951>Sevoflurane attenuates ventilator‑induced lung injury by regulating c‑PLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of club cell secretory protein (CCSP), an endogenous modulator, in reducing pulmonary inflammation induced by sevoflurane following one‑lung ventilation (OLV). Healthy Japanese white rabbits were randomly assigned to six groups: Sham‑operated group (group S); respiratory management of OLV group (group O); OLV + sevoflurane treated group (group OF), club cells exfoliated + sham‑operated group (group NA), club cells exfoliated + OLV group (group NAO); and club cells exfoliated + OLV + sevoflurane treated group (group NAOF). At the end of the experimental observation, all animals in the different groups were sacrificed and lung injury was evaluated according to the lung wet/dry  ratio and histological scoring system. Lung homogenates were harvested to detect the mRNA and protein expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (c‑PLA2) and CCSP. The content of  was measured using an ELISA. Following OLV treatment, c‑PLA2 expression was increased, CCSP expression was decreased and lung injury scores were significantly increased. Sevoflurane inhalation in the OLV‑treated group induced an upregulation of CCSP and a downregulation of c‑PLA2 expression. In the group NAO, in which the club cells were simultaneously exfoliated, OLV caused more severe lung damage and induced higher expression of c‑PLA2 compared with that in group O. However, sevoflurane inhalation reduced the extent of lung injury and the expression of c‑PLA2, even when the endogenous modulator of lung inflammation, CCSP, was exfoliated (group NAOF). These results indicated that OLV promoted lung inflammation through the CCSP and c‑PLA2 pathway. However, the results from the club cells exfoliated group indicated that the CCSP may not be involved in the protective effect exerted by sevoflurane inhalation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651694>Maternal plasma phosphatidylcholine polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy and offspring growth and adiposity.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are essential for offspring development, but it is less clear whether pregnancy PUFA status affects growth and adiposity.In 985 mother-offspring pairs from the ongoing Singaporean GUSTO cohort, we analyzed the associations between offspring growth and adiposity outcomes until age 5 years and five PUFAs of interest, measured in maternal plasma at 26-28 weeks' gestation: linoleic  (LA), , α-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). We measured fetal growth by ultrasound (n=924), neonatal  composition (air displacement plethysmography (n=252 at birth, and n=317 at age 10 days), and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (n=317)), postnatal growth (n=979) and skinfold thicknesses (n=981). Results were presented as regression coefficients for a 5% increase in PUFA levels.LA levels were positively associated with birthweight (β (95% CI): 0.04 (0.01, 0.08) kg),  mass index (0.13 (0.02, 0.25) kg/m), head circumference (0.11 (0.03, 0.19) cm), and neonatal abdominal adipose tissue volume (4.6 (1.3, 7.8) mL for superficial subcutanous tissue, and 1.2 (0.1, 2.4) mL for internal tissue), but not with later outcomes. DHA levels, although not associated with birth outcomes, were related to higher postnatal length/height: 0.63 (0.09, 1.16) cm at 12 months and 1.29 (0.34, 2.24) cm at 5 years.LA was positively associated with neonatal  size, and DHA with child height.

Information regarding safety, growth performance, and efficacy of feeding camelina cake to pigs is limited. We therefore evaluated the effects of camelina cake inclusion in pig nursery diets. In total, 192 pigs (9.4 kg BW) were randomly allocated by sex to 48 pens, 2 heavy and 2 light pigs per pen. Pigs were fed 1 of 4 wheat-based diets including camelina cake (0%, 6%, 12%, or 18%; variety Celine) replacing soybean meal for 4 wk. Individual pigs, pen feed added, and orts were weighed weekly. Feces were collected on d 26 and 27. A blood sample was taken on d 29 from 24 pigs with the lowest BW/pen, which were then euthanized and necropsied. Gross pathological examination was conducted, and organ  were measured. Samples of liver, back fat, belly fat, and jowl fat were collected for fatty  analysis. Increasing dietary camelina cake inclusion linearly decreased ( 0.001) apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, GE and ash but did not affect ATTD of CP and P. For the entire trial (d 0 to 28), increasing camelina cake inclusion by 6% linearly decreased ( 0.001) ADFI by 74 g/d, ADG by 51 g/d, and BW by 0.8 kg but did not affect feed efficiency (G:F). Increasing camelina cake inclusion linearly increased ( 0.001) liver  relative to BW, linearly decreased ( 0.050) kidney , but did not affect spleen, heart, and thyroid . Increasing camelina cake inclusion did not result in serological (large-animal standard panel, T3, and T4) or gross clinical (morphology) findings that might suggest toxicity. In liver, back fat, belly fat, and jowl fat, increasing dietary camelina cake inclusion linearly increased ( 0.050) total n-3 fatty acids and shorter-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids but did not increase docosahexaenoic  (n-3) or  (n-6). In conclusion, feeding camelina cake to weaned pigs at up to 18% did not elicit clinical signs of toxicity and increased n-3 fatty acids in carcass fat depots. The decrease in ADFI as camelina cake inclusion increased resulted in pigs fed 18% weighing 5 kg less than controls at the end of the nursery period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403679>Characterization of the endocannabinoid system in subcutaneous adipose tissue in periparturient dairy cows and its association to metabolic profiles.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) plays a major role in metabolic adaptations in postpartum (PP) dairy cows. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of metabolism and energy homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high  (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low  loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of  were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT inflammation in PP dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413441>Feasibility Evaluation of Myocardial Cannabinoid Type 1 Receptor Imaging in Obesity: A Translational Approach.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of targeted imaging of myocardial cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1-R) and its potential up-regulation in obese mice with translation to humans using [C]-OMAR and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).Activation of myocardial CB1-R by endocannabinoids has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice. Obesity may lead to an up-regulation of myocardial CB1-R, potentially providing a mechanistic link between obesity and the initiation and/or progression of cardiomyopathy.Binding specificity of [C]-OMAR to CB1-R was investigated by blocking studies with rimonabant in mice. The heart was harvested from each mouse, and its radioactivity was determined by γ-counter. Furthermore, [C]-OMAR dynamic micro-PET/CT was carried out in obese and normal- mice. Ex vivo validation was performed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (absolute quantification) and RNAscope Technology (an in situ ribonucleic  analysis platform). Subsequently, myocardial CB1-R expression was probed noninvasively with intravenous injection of CB1-R ligand [C]-OMAR and PET/CT in humans with advanced obesity and normal- human control subjects, respectively.Rimonabant significantly blocked OMAR uptake in the heart muscle compared with vehicle, signifying specific binding of OMAR to the CB1-R in the myocardium. The myocardial OMAR retention quantified by micro-PET/CT in mice was significantly higher in obese compared with normal- mice. Absolute quantification of CB1-R gene expression with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization confirmed CB1-R up-regulation in all major myocardial cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes, endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts) of obese mice. Obese mice also had elevated myocardial levels of endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol compared with lean mice. Translation to humans revealed higher myocardial OMAR retention in advanced obesity compared with normal- subjects.Noninvasive imaging of cardiac CB1-R expression in obesity is feasible applying [C]-OMAR and PET/CT. These results may provide a rationale for further clinical testing of CB1-R-targeted molecular imaging in cardiometabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

We have previously described the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and anticoagulant activity of orally administered camel milk in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In the present study in the same animal model, we extended these observations by comparing camel milk and the more available and widely consumed bovine milk with respect to their antidiabetic and antithrombotic actions. Rats were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), and then camel milk or bovine milk was administered orally for 8 wk. We evaluated the changes in , fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, blood coagulation profile, and platelet function. Diabetic rats developed  loss, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, inhibition of platelet aggregation responses to  and adenosine diphosphate, a marked decrease (>50%) in plasma fibrinogen levels, and short activated partial thromboplastin time. Treatment with camel milk or bovine milk reversed these abnormalities, resulting in  gain, decreased blood glucose levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Despite the more remarkable antidiabetic action of camel milk, treatment with bovine milk was more effective in correcting plasma fibrinogen levels and restoring inhibited platelet aggregation responses. Long-term administration of camel milk or bovine milk counteracted streptozotocin-induced metabolic manifestations in rats, maintained platelet function, and abolished coagulopathy-associated fibrinogen consumption. Notably, the antidiabetic effect of camel milk was more pronounced than that of bovine milk, but bovine milk exhibited more potent anticoagulant activity than camel milk. These findings should encourage further clinical trials to assess the efficiency of camel milk and bovine milk or their derived peptides as food supplements or potential nonpharmacological therapies for dysglycemia and the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

This study investigates the effect of vitC deficiency in guinea pigs on plasma biopterin status and the vasomotor responses in coronary arteries exposed to vasoconstrictor/-dilator agents. Dunkin Hartley female guinea pigs ( = 32) were randomized to high (1500 mg/kg diet) or low (0 to 50 mg/kg diet) vitC for 10-12 weeks. At euthanasia, coronary artery segments were dissected and mounted in a wire-myograph. Vasomotor responses to potassium, carbachol, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), U46619, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were recorded. Plasma vitC and tetrahydrobiopterin were measured by HPLC. Plasma vitC status reflected the diets with deficient animals displaying reduced tetrahydrobiopterin. Vasoconstrictor responses to carbachol were significantly decreased in vitC deficient coronary arteries independent of their general vasoconstrictor/vasodilator capacity ( < 0.001). Moreover, in vitC deficient animals, carbachol-induced vasodilator responses correlated with coronary artery diameter ( < 0.001). Inhibition of cyclooxygenases with indomethacin increased carbachol-induced vasoconstriction, suggesting an augmented carbachol-induced release of vasodilator prostanoids. Atropine abolished carbachol-induced vasomotion, supporting a specific muscarinic receptor effect. Arterial responses to SNP, potassium, S6c, U46619 and ET-1 were unaffected by vitC status. The study shows that vitC deficiency decreases tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations and muscarinic receptor mediated contraction in coronary arteries. This attenuated vasoconstrictor response may be linked to altered production of vasoactive  metabolites and reduced muscarinic receptor expression/signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29306361>Steroid hormone concentrations and  mass are differently affected by polyunsaturated fatty acids during the oestrous cycle in guinea pigs.</a></h2><p>Reproductive functions in female mammals can be significantly affected by the actions of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on steroid hormone secretion rates. Nevertheless, the effects of plasma free PUFAs on the oestrous cycle have seldom been considered. Therefore, in the present study, the diet of domestic guinea pigs was supplemented with high concentrations of different PUFAs and the effects of altered plasma PUFA patterns on steroid hormone concentrations, measured non-invasively, and  mass during oestrus and dioestrus were analysed. The oestrous cycle was characterised by increased oestrogen and cortisol concentrations in oestrus, corroborated by lowest bodyweight, whereas progesterone concentrations were highest in dioestrus. Plasma concentrations of the long-chain PUFAs docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6 ω3) and  (AA; 20:5 ω6) affected steroid hormone concentrations differently in oestrus and dioestrus. DHA positively affected oestrogen and progesterone concentrations and diminished cortisol concentrations only in oestrus. In contrast, AA negatively affected oestrogen and stimulated cortisol concentrations in oestrus and reduced progesterone concentrations in general. These findings imply selective and opposite contributions of DHA and AA to ovarian functions during different stages of the oestrous cycle, indicating a high biological relevance of plasma free PUFAs in female reproductive function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29905079>Untargeted Profiling of Concordant/Discordant Phenotypes of High Insulin Resistance and Obesity To Predict the Risk of Developing Diabetes.</a></h2><p>This study explores the metabolic profiles of concordant/discordant phenotypes of high insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. Through untargeted metabolomics (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), we analyzed the fasting serum of subjects with high IR and/or obesity ( n = 64). An partial least-squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction followed by univariate statistics and enrichment analysis allowed exploration of these metabolic profiles. A multivariate regression method (LASSO) was used for variable selection and a predictive biomarker model to identify subjects with high IR regardless of obesity was built. Adrenic  and a dyglyceride (DG) were shared by high IR and obesity.

DGs and adrenic  differed in concordant/discordant phenotypes, thereby revealing protective mechanisms against high IR also in obesity. A biomarker model formed by DGs, uric and adrenic acids presented a high predictive power to identify subjects with high IR [AUC 80.1% (68.9-91.4)]. These findings could become relevant for diabetes risk detection and unveil new potential targets in therapeutic treatments of IR, diabetes, and obesity.

Some health benefits of n-3 PUFA are mediated through the impact of their oxygenated metabolites, i.e. oxylipins. The TFA, trans-10, cis-12-conjugated linoleic  (CLA; 18:2n-6) is associated with adipose tissue (AT) inflammation, oxidative stress, and wasting. We examined the impact of a 4-week feeding of 0, 0.5, and 1.5% docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 22:6n-3) in the presence and absence of 0.5% CLA on AT oxylipin profiles in female C57BL/6N mice. Esterified oxylipins in AT derived from linoleic  (LNA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA),  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), DHA, and putative from CLA were quantified. CLA containing diets reduced AT mass by ~62%. Compared with the control diet, the DHA diet elevated concentrations of EPA-and DHA-derived alcohols and epoxides and LNA-derived alcohols, reduced ARA-derived alcohols, ketones, epoxides, and 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F (P < 0.05), and had mixed effects on ALA-derived alcohols. Dietary CLA lowered EPA-, DHA-, and ALA-derived epoxides, ARA-derived ketones and epoxides, and ALA-derived alcohols. While dietary CLA induced variable effects in EPA-, DHA-, and LNA-derived alcohols and LNA-derived ketones, it elevated ARA-derived alcohols and PGF, PGF, and F2-isoprostanes. DHA counteracted CLA-induced effects in 67, 57, 43, and 29% of total DHA-, ARA-, EPA-, and ALA-derived oxylipins, respectively. Thus, CLA elevated proinflammatory oxylipins while DHA increased anti-inflammatory oxylipins and diminished concentration of CLA-induced pro-inflammatory oxylipins in AT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279258>The Role of Chemoprophylactic Agents in Modulating Platelet Aggregability After Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h2><p>The pathophysiology behind the subacute but persistent hypercoagulable state after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is poorly understood but contributes to morbidity induced by venous thromboembolism. Because platelets and their microvesicles have been hypothesized to play a role in post-traumatic hypercoagulability, administration of commonly used agents may ameliorate this coagulability. We hypothesized that utilization of aspirin, ketorolac, amitriptyline, unfractionated heparin, or enoxaparin would modulate the platelet aggregation response after TBI.Concussive TBI was induced by  drop. Mice were then randomized to receive aspirin, ketorolac, amitriptyline, heparin, enoxaparin, or saline control at 2 and 8 h after TBI. Mice were sacrificed at 6 or 24 h after injury to determine coagulability by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), platelet function testing with impedance aggregometry, and microvesicle enumeration. Platelet sphingolipid metabolites were analyzed by mass spectrometry.ROTEM demonstrated increased platelet contribution to maximum clot firmness at 6 h after TBI in mice that received aspirin or amitriptyline, but this did not persist at 24 h. By contrast, adenosine diphosphate- and -induced platelet aggregation at 6 h was significantly lower in mice receiving ketorolac, aspirin, and amitriptyline compared with mice receiving saline at 6 h after injury and only -initiated platelet aggregation was decreased by aspirin at 24 h. There were no differences in microvesicle production at either time point. Platelet sphingosine-1-phosphate levels were decreased at 6 h in the group receiving amitriptyline and increased at 24 h along with platelet ceramide levels at 24 h in the amitriptyline group.After TBI, amitriptyline decreased platelet aggregability and increased contribution to clot in a manner similar to aspirin. The amitriptyline effects on platelet function and sphingolipid metabolites may represent a possible role of the  sphingomyelinase in the hypercoagulability observed after injury. In addition, inhibition of platelet reactivity may be an underappreciated benefit of low molecular  heparins, such as enoxaparin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Group 1 continued eating control food for 56 days. Group 2 was fed test food for 56 days, which was control food plus fish oil and high-AA oil. Test food contained 0.17% AA, 0.09% EPA and 0.18% DHA. After 56 days, cats were fed the opposite food for another 56 days. At baseline and after each feeding period, serum was analyzed for fatty  concentrations, and urine for specific gravity, calcium concentration, relative-super-saturation for struvite crystals, and a calcium-oxalate-titrimetric test was performed. After consuming test food, cats had increased (all P<0.001) serum concentrations of EPA (173%), DHA (61%), and AA (35%); decreased urine specific gravity (P = 0.02); decreased urine calcium concentration (P = 0.06); decreased relative-super-saturation for struvite crystals (P = 0.03); and increased resistance to oxalate crystal formation (P = 0.06) compared with cats consuming control food. Oxalate crystal formation was correlated with serum calcium concentration (r = 0.41; P<0.01). These data show benefits for reducing urine stone formation in cats by increasing dietary PUFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29885491>Identification of a novel tetrameric structure for human apolipoprotein-D.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein-D is a 25 kDa glycosylated member of the lipocalin family that folds into an eight-stranded β-barrel with a single adjacent α-helix. Apolipoprotein-D specifically binds a range of small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and  and has an antioxidant function that is in part due to the reduction of peroxidised lipids by methionine-93. Therefore, apolipoprotein-D plays multiple roles throughout the  and is protective in Alzheimer's disease, where apolipoprotein-D overexpression reduces the amyloid-β burden in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Oligomerisation is a common feature of lipocalins that can influence ligand binding. The native structure of apolipoprotein-D, however, has not been conclusively defined. Apolipoprotein-D is generally described as a monomeric protein, although it dimerises when reducing peroxidised lipids. Here, we investigated the native structure of apolipoprotein-D derived from plasma, breast cyst fluid (BCF) and cerebrospinal fluid. In plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein-D was present in high-molecular  complexes, potentially in association with lipoproteins. In contrast, apolipoprotein-D in BCF formed distinct oligomeric species. We assessed apolipoprotein-D oligomerisation using native apolipoprotein-D purified from BCF and a suite of complementary methods, including multi-angle laser light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering. Our analyses showed that apolipoprotein-D predominantly forms a ∼95 to ∼100 kDa tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed these findings and provided a structural model for apolipoprotein-D tetramer. These data indicate apolipoprotein-D rarely exists as a free monomer under physiological conditions and provide insights into novel native structures of apolipoprotein-D and into oligomerisation behaviour in the lipocalin family.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Several hormonal signals, such as glucocorticoids and ghrelin, regulate feeding and metabolism by engaging the endocannabinoid system. Similarly, studies have suggested that leptin interacts with the endocannabinoid system, yet the mechanism and functional relevance of this interaction remain elusive. Therefore, we explored the interaction between leptin and endocannabinoid signaling with a focus on fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), the primary degradative enzyme for the endocannabinoid -arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA). Mice deficient in leptin exhibited elevated hypothalamic AEA levels and reductions in FAAH activity while leptin administration to WT mice reduced AEA content and increased FAAH activity. Following high fat diet exposure, mice developed resistance to the effects of leptin administration on hypothalamic AEA content and FAAH activity. At a functional level, pharmacological inhibition of FAAH was sufficient to prevent leptin-mediated effects on  and food intake. Using a novel knock-in mouse model recapitulating a common human polymorphism (FAAH C385A; rs324420), which reduces FAAH activity, we investigated whether human genetic variance in  affects leptin sensitivity. While WT (CC) mice were sensitive to leptin-induced reductions in food intake and  gain, low-expressing FAAH (AA) mice were unresponsive. These data demonstrate that FAAH activity is required for leptin's hypophagic effects and, at a translational level, suggest that a genetic variant in the FAAH gene contributes to differences in leptin sensitivity in human populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702246>Placental lipid droplet composition: Effect of a lifestyle intervention (UPBEAT) in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal obesity is associated with adverse outcomes. Placental lipid droplets (LD) have been implicated in maternal-fetal lipid transfer but it is not known whether placental LD fat composition is modifiable. We evaluated the effects of a diet and physical activity intervention in obese pregnant women compared to routine antenatal care (UPBEAT study) on placental LD composition. LD were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Total FAs and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, PCs; sphingomyelins, SMs and lyso-phosphatidylcholines, Lyso-PCs) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ-linolenic  in LD were positively associated with gestational  gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention. In the whole sample, PCs carrying DHA and  were inversely associated with placental . Placenta MFSD2a expression was associated with DHA cord blood metabolites and relationships were observed between LD lipids, especially DHA carrying species, and cord blood metabolites. We describe placenta LD composition for the first time and demonstrate modest, potentially beneficial effects of a lifestyle intervention on LD FAs in obese pregnant women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The CRF was induced by gavage of 250 mg·kg·d adenine for 21 d. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique was used in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to analyze the urine metabolic profiles in three groups. The endogenous substances with the variable importance projection (VIP)>1 and <0.05 were screened as the potential biomarkers for CRF, and enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways was carried out.Compared with the normal control group, the model group had lower , higher kidney coefficient, higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels (all <0.01), while the above indexes in the Niaoduqing group were ameliorated compared with the model group (all <0.01). Fifteen potential biomarkers were found in the urine of the model group, which were involved in 9 metabolic pathways including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis,  metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, tricarboxylic  cycle, glycerophosphatide metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and tyrosine metabolism.Niaoduqing granules has therapeutic effect on rats with CRF, which may be related to the regulation of amino  metabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28687367>The relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty  levels and cardiac autonomic function in obese children.</a></h2><p>Childhood obesity is a worldwide health concern. Studies have shown autonomic dysfunction in obese children. The exact mechanism of this dysfunction is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty  (EMFA) levels and cardiac autonomic function in obese children using heart rate variability (HRV).A total of 48 obese and 32 healthy children were included in this case-control study. Anthropometric and biochemical data, HRV indices, and EMFA levels in both groups were compared statistically.HRV parameters including standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (NN), root mean square of successive differences, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by >50 ms (NN50), the proportion of NN50 divided by the total number of NNs, high-frequency power, and low-frequency power were lower in obese children compared to controls, implying parasympathetic impairment. Eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  levels were lower in the obese group (p<0.001 and p=0.012, respectively). In correlation analysis, in the obese group,  mass index standard deviation and linoleic , , triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein levels showed a linear correlation with one or more HRV parameter, and age, eicosapentaenoic , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated with mean heart rate. In linear regression analysis, age, dihomo-gamma-linolenic , linoleic , ,  mass index standard deviation, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein were related to HRV parameters, implying an effect on cardiac autonomic function.There is impairment of cardiac autonomic function in obese children. It appears that levels of EMFAs such as linoleic ,  and dihomo-gamma-linolenic  play a role in the regulation of cardiac autonomic function in obese children.Copyright © 2017 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

The purpose of this study was to examine the toxicity of a largely used drug, ibuprofen (Ibu), in Dresseina polymorpha mussels and its impact on air survival time. The mussels were exposed to increasing concentration of Ibu (0, 1, 10 and 100μg/L) for 96 at 15°C and a sub-group of mussels was maintain in air for another 96h. Post-exposure mussels (Ibu and Ibu+Air) were analyzed for  loss, total triglycerides, neutral lipids, lipid peroxidation (LPO), arachidonate-dependent cyclooxygenase (COX) and glutathione S-transferase activity. Lipid extracts of mussel tissues were also analyzed by H-nuclear resonance spectroscopy. The data revealed that mussels exposed to Ibu had increased signs of lipid oxidation, neutral lipids and decreased triglycerides, LPO and GST activity. COX activity was significantly reduced by Ibu in keeping with mode of action of the drug. Following exposure to air, increased  loss, neutral lipids (lipid degradation), were observed in mussels exposed to Ibu but no changes in COX activity were observed. Air stress limited the decrease in triglycerides and the increase in GST in mussels exposed to 100μg/L Ibu indicating decreased anti-oxidant response/phase II biotransformation and limited lipid metabolism. In conclusion, exposure to Ibu has some anti-inflammatory effects to mussels based on COX activity but resulted in increased oxidative damage and lipid catabolism. Exposure to air stress could enhance some of these responses and contribute to decreased resistance to air exposures.Crown Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this investigation was to use direct infusion-mass spectrometry (DI-MS) lipidomics to determine the effects of fish oil supplementation on lipid profiles of human adipose tissue. Adipose tissue samples from an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation study (n = 66) were analyzed to compare the pattern following supplementation equivalent to zero or four portions of oily fish per week. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were incorporated into highly unsaturated (≥5 double bonds) triglycerides (TGs), phosphocholines, and phosphoethanolamines as well as being detected directly as the nonesterified fatty  forms. Multivariate statistics demonstrated that phospholipids were the most accurate and sensitive lipids for the assessing EPA and DHA incorporation into adipose tissue. Potential confounding factors (adiposity, age, and sex of the subject) were also considered in the analysis, and adiposity was also associated with an increase in highly unsaturated TGs as a result of incorporation of the n-6 PUFA . DI-MS provides a high-throughput analysis of fatty  status that can monitor oily fish consumption, suitable for use in cohort studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660800>Physicochemical Quality, Fatty  Composition, and Sensory Analysis of Nellore Steers Meat Fed with Inclusion of Condensed Tannin in the Diet.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to test the effect of dietary tannin on the fatty  profile and sensory attributes of meat from Nellore steers. Thirty-two Nellore bull male were distributed in a completely randomized design and fed diets with condensed tannin extract as follows: 0, 10, 30, and 50 g/kg total DM basis. The physicochemical composition of the meat, lipid oxidation, fatty  profile, flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptance were evaluated. There was a linear decrease (P ≤ 0.05) on lipid content, tenderness, cooking  loss, myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids in meat as tannin increased in the diets. The total saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the atherogenicity index decreased. However, a linear increase (P ≤ 0.05) was observed for linoleic, linolenic, , eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids. The physicochemical characteristic of the meat, such as moisture, ash, and protein contents, water retention capacity, final pH, Warner-Bratzler shear force, collagen, and color indexes (lightness, redness, yellowness, and chrome) did not change with dietary tannin. Also, CLA, n-6:n-3 ratio, Δ -desaturase, and elongase activity were not different among diets. In conclusion, condensed tannin linearly increases unsaturated fatty acids and decreases the atherogenicity index of meat; thus, it can be recommended at the highest level (50 g/kg DM) in the diet of Nellore steers.Agriculture byproducts plays an important part in the diet of ruminant animals and consequently on food chain and has implications for the composition and quality of the livestock products (milk, meat, and eggs) that people consume. Feeding tannin to steers increases the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and meat tenderness, with a concomitant reduction on saturated fatty acids and the atherogenicity index in meat. Thus, we recommend adding tannin to steer diets to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in red meat for human consumption.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310962>-rich ARASCO oil has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic actions against streptozotocin + high fat diet induced diabetes mellitus in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of  (AA)-rich ARASCO oil on high-fat diet (HFD) + streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus in male Wistar rats and its possible mechanisms of action.Male Wistar rats with HFD + STZ-induced diabetes were employed in the present study. ARASCO oil was administered orally for the first 7 d consecutively, followed by once weekly throughout the study (14 wk). At various time points, blood glucose and  and oral glucose tolerance tests were measured. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed to collect plasma and various organs and stored at -80°C. Plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and lipoxin A4 were measured. Expression of the following genes was determined: nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in pancreas and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) in adipose tissue. Various antioxidants were measured in the plasma and other tissues. Area under the curve and insulin sensitivity index were assessed by computing homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance, quantitative insulin check index, Matsuda, and Belfiore indices.ARASCO oil treatment decreased hyperglycemia, restored insulin sensitivity, suppressed inflammation, enhanced plasma lipoxin A4 levels, and reversed altered antioxidant status to near normal in animals with HFD + STZ-induced diabetes.These results suggest that ARASCO, a rich source of AA, can prevent HFD + STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats owing to its anti-inflammatory action.

Diacylglycerol lipase β (DAGLβ) is an enzyme that synthesizes 2-AG and its inhibition reduces eicosanoid levels and produces antinociceptive effects in models of inflammatory pain. Here we test whether inhibition of DAGLβ produces antinociceptive effects in a model of postoperative pain.Rats were administered the selective DAGLβ inhibitor KT109 or vehicle and underwent plantar incision. Postsurgical pain/disability was examined using evoked (mechanical hyperalgesia), functional (incapacitance/ bearing), and functional/spontaneous (locomotion) modalities.Activity-based protein profiling confirmed that KT109 inhibited DAGLβ in the lumbar spinal cord (LSC) and brain, confirming that it is a systemically active DAGLβ inhibitor. Treatment with KT109 reduced basal 2-AG, AA, and PGE levels in the liver but not the brain, indicating that DAGLβ activity does not significantly contribute to basal PGE production within the central nervous system. Plantar incision elevated the levels of 2-AG and PGE in the LSC. Although KT109 did not alter postsurgical 2-AG levels in the LSC, it slightly reduced PGE levels. In contrast, the clinically efficacious cyclooxygenase inhibitor ketoprofen completely suppressed PGE levels in the LSC. Similarly, KT109 had no significant effect upon postsurgical 2-AG, AA, or PGE levels at the incision site, while ketoprofen abolished PGE production at this location. KT109 and ketoprofen reversed the  bearing imbalance induced by plantar incision, yet neither KT109 nor ketoprofen had any significant effect on mechanical hyperalgesia. Treatment with ketoprofen partially but significantly rescued the locomotor deficit induced by incision while KT109 was without effect.DAGLβ is not the principal enzyme that controls 2-AG derived AA and PGE production after surgery, and inhibitors targeting this enzyme are unlikely to be efficacious analgesics superior to those already approved to treat acute postoperative pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262891>Inhibition of Pancreatic Carcinoma Growth Through Enhancing ω-3 Epoxy Polyunsaturated Fatty  Profile by Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase is a major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to produce biologically active ω-3 epoxy fatty acids (ω-3 epoxides). In general, all epoxy PUFAs including ω-3 epoxides are quickly metabolized/inactivated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to form diol products. The aims of this study were to determine the effect and mechanism of fat-1 transgene, and ω-3 PUFA combined with sEH gene knockout or inhibitor on inhibiting pancreatic cancer and the related mechanisms involved.PK03-mutant Kras murine pancreatic carcinoma cells were inoculated into mouse models including fat-1, sEH and C57BL/6J mice. The mice were fed with AIN-76A diet with or without ω-3 PUFA supplementation or treated with sEH inhibitor. In addition to tumor growth (tumor size and ), cell proliferation, mutant Kras-mediated signaling, inflammatory reaction and angiogenesis were analyzed immunohisto-chemically and by western blot assay. ω-3 PUFA metabolism, particularly focusing on ω-3 epoxy fatty acids (ω-3 epoxides), was measured using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach.Significant decreases of  and size of the PK03 pancreatic carcinoma were observed in the fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor compared to those of C57BL/6J control mice fed with AIN-76A diet (: 0.28±0.04 g vs. 0.58±0.06 g; size: 187.0±17.5 mm vs. 519.3±60.6 mm). In a separate experiment, sEH mice fed ω-3 PUFA supplement and C57BL/6J mice treated with sEH inhibitor and fed ω-3 PUFA supplement exhibited a significant reduction in the  and size of the pancreatic carcinoma compared to C57BL/6J control mice (: 0.26±.26 g and 0.39±.39 g vs. 0.69±0.11 g, respectively; size: 274.2±36.2 mm and 296.4±99.8 mm vs. 612.6±117.8 mm, respectively). Moreover, compared to the pancreatic tumors in C57BL/6J control mice, the tumors in fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor showed a significant less inflammatory cell infiltrate (62.6±9.2/HPF (high power field) vs. 8.0±1.2/HPF), tumor cell proliferation (48.5±1.7% vs. 16.5±1.6%), and angiogenesis (micro-vessel density (MVD): 35.0±1.0 vs. 11.1±0.5) immunohistochemically, as well as significantly increased caspase-3 labeled apoptosis (0.44±0.06% vs. 0.69±0.06%, respectively). Using western blot approach, significant inhibition of mutant Kras-activated signals including phosphorylated Serine/threonine kinases (cRAF), Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were identified in pancreatic carcinoma of fat-1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor. Eicosanoic  metabolic profiling of the serum specimens detected a significant increase of the ratios of epoxides to dihydroxy fatty  (DiHDPE) for docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and epoxides/dihydroxy octadecenoic  (DiHOME) for  (ARA) and linoleic  (LA), as well as a significant increase of epoxy metabolites of DHA, EPA, ARA and LA in fat-1 transgenic mice treated with a sEH inhibitor.ω-3 epoxy products from ω-3 PUFA metabolism play a crucial role in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth, and use of ω-3 PUFAs combined with sEH inhibition is a strategy with high potential for pancreatic cancer treatment and prevention.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) and plasma fatty acids were measured at baseline and after 3 years.After 3 years, the overweight group showed greater increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-Insulin resistance index and ba-PWV values (P = .009) than the normal- group. In addition, greater reductions in eicosapentaenoic  (C20:3, n-3, EPA; P = .009) and the EPA/ (C20:4, n-6, AA) ratio (P = .001) were found in the overweight group. Multivariate analyses revealed that changes in (Δ) ba-PWV were significantly and positively associated with baseline BMI values and ΔAA/linoleic  ratios (C18:2, n-6, LA) and negatively associated with ΔEPA/AA ratios. In a subanalysis using baseline BMI values, Δba-PWV correlated strongly and negatively with ΔEPA/AA ratios (r = -0.595, P < .001) and positively with ΔAA/LA ratios (r = 0.455, P < .001) in the overweight group.This study suggests that the persistence of overweight over 3 years in subjects ≥50 years old is associated with faster arterial stiffening than is observed in normal- subjects and that this stiffening is independently associated with increases in AA/LA and decreases in EPA/AA ratios.Copyright © 2016 National Lipid Association.

Moreover, LOX-mediated 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) and 15-HETE from  in the testes were significantly elevated and a linear increasing trend of 15-HETE concentrations was detected with doses of PFOS. The perturbations of lipid mediators suggested that PFOS has potential negative impacts on testicular functions.

LA is known to induce obesity and insulin resistance. In this study, two concentrations of LA with or without added glucose (G) were fed to mice to investigate their effects on endocannabinoid (EC) biology.Four groups of C57BL/6 mice were provided with diets containing 1% or 8% LA with or without added G (LAG) for 8 weeks.  , food intake, circulating glucose and insulin levels were measured throughout the study. Following euthanasia, plasma, bowel and hepatic ECs, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels (enzymes responsible for EC degradation) and transcriptional activity of PPARα in liver were quantified. Liver was probed for evidence of insulin receptor activity perturbation.Increasing dietary LA from 1% to 8% significantly increased circulating, small bowel and hepatic ECs. 1%LAG fed mice had lowest feed efficiency, and only liver levels of both ECs were reduced by addition of G. Addition of G to 1% LA diets resulted in elevated monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels ( < 0.001 and  < 0.001, respectively) in liver due to increased transcriptional activity of PPARα ( < 0.05). The reduced EC levels with addition of G also correlated with a measure of enhanced insulin action.In conclusion,  of mice is influenced by the source of calorie intake. Furthermore, tissue EC/g are dependent on tissue-specific synthesis and degradation that are modulated by dietary LA and G which also influence food efficiency, and down-stream insulin signalling pathways.

However, the drugs have divergent effects on the formation of cAMP, an inhibitory second messenger. Thus, by inhibiting the synthesis of prostacyclin, acetylsalicylic  reduces cAMP formation, whereas clopidogrel potentiates it. Therefore, with higher doses of acetylsalicylic , the potentiation of cAMP production by clopidogrel may be attenuated, which could limit the antithrombotic potential of the drug combination. The purpose of this study was to examine this possibility in vivo. Approach and Results- Mice were given oral acetylsalicylic  at varying doses, oral clopidogrel (5 mg/kg ), or both. At doses of 0.15 and 0.6 mg/kg, acetylsalicylic  inhibited -induced platelet aggregation, but only 0.6 mg/kg acetylsalicylic , or higher, decreased the plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin-F, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin. When given with clopidogrel, laser injury-induced arterial thrombi were significantly larger with the 0.6 mg/kg dose of acetylsalicylic  than with the 0.15 mg/kg dose. Thrombi in mice treated with clopidogrel and the 0.15 mg/kg dose of acetylsalicylic  were smaller than in mice treated with clopidogrel alone, suggesting that acetylsalicylic  can add to the antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel but that higher doses of acetylsalicylic  blunt the antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel. Conclusions- These findings support the use of lower, prostacyclin-preserving, doses of acetylsalicylic  in conjunction with clopidogrel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut Barrier Function, Attenuating Inflammation and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h2><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg ) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189323>Feeding distillers dried grains in replacement of forage in limit-fed dairy heifer rations: Effects on metabolic profile and onset of puberty.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of increasing the inclusion rate of distillers dried grains (DDGS) in replacement of forage in limit-fed diets on the metabolic profile and onset of puberty in dairy heifers. A 16-wk randomized complete block design study was conducted using 48 Holstein heifers (199 ± 2 d of age) with 3 treatments. Treatments were (1) 30% DDGS (30DG), (2) 40% DDGS (40DG), and (3) 50% DDGS (50DG), with the remainder of the diet consisting of grass hay and 1.5% mineral mix. Heifers were housed in groups of 6 and individually limit-fed using Calan gates at 2.65, 2.50, and 2.35% of  (BW) on a dry matter (DM) basis for 30DG, 40DG, and 50DG, respectively. Jugular blood samples were collected during wk 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 for metabolite and metabolic hormone analysis. Additional samples were taken during wk 16 for plasma fatty  analysis. When heifers weighed 200 kg, coccygeal vein blood samples were taken twice per week for progesterone analysis to estimate onset of puberty. Blood samples continued until cycling was confirmed via ultrasound for the presence of a corpus luteum. A quadratic response and a linear tendency in the proportion of total fatty acids as linoleic  were observed. Linear and quadratic responses for plasma concentrations of linoleic  and  occurred. Overall results for fatty  analysis demonstrated that total fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty acids concentration in the blood were linearly increased, with a quadratic response for polyunsaturated fatty acids with 30DG and 50DG having the greatest concentrations. No interactions of treatment by week were observed for any of the metabolites and metabolic hormones measured. Glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, and triglycerides were similar across treatments. A linear response of plasma urea nitrogen and a quadratic response tendency for cholesterol concentration were observed. Age and BW at puberty were similar across treatments. Limit-feeding heifers with greater inclusion rates of DDGS maintained energy status without the accumulation of excess adipose tissue as indicated by leptin. Treatments had no detrimental effects on age or BW at puberty.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The objective of our study was to compare the effect of supplementation of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (FA) on FA concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Holstein calves. Twenty-seven Holstein heifer calves (107 ± 2.6 d of age; 142.6 ± 6.5 kg of ) from the university research and teaching herd were randomly assigned to a common TMR supplemented with 1 of 3 treatments: Ca salts of flaxseed FA (Virtus Nutrition, Corcoran, CA) containing 35% 18:3 n-3 (N3), Ca salts of soybean FA (Virtus Nutrition) containing 50% 18:2 n-6 (N6), or a 50:50 mix of N3 and N6. Treatments were supplemented with FA at 4% of dietary dry matter and fed for 30 d. Feed intake was recorded daily, and , wither height, and  condition score were measured weekly throughout the study. On d 28 heifers were vaccinated with a Pasteurella vaccine and the temperature response to the vaccine was recorded. Blood was collected on d 0 and 28 for PBMC isolation. After total lipid extraction and FA methyl ester preparation, FA composition of PBMC was measured. We observed no effect of treatment on  gain,  condition score change, or wither height change. Heifers receiving the N3 diet had a lower temperature response to Pasteurella challenge compared with both the mix and N6 diets. Heifers consuming the N3 diet had a greater content of total n-3 FA, α-linolenic , and eicosapentaenoic  in PBMC compared with heifers fed the N6 and mix diets. Heifers receiving the N3 diet also had a lower content of total n-6 FA, linoleic , and  in PBMC than heifers fed the N6 and mix diets. In conclusion, our study determined that feeding weaned female Holstein heifers a diet high in n-3 FA increased concentrations of n-3 FA in PBMC.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

The fatty  desaturase-2 (FADS2) gene encodes for the delta-6-desaturase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of C20:4 from linoleic  (C18:2). The purpose of this study was to characterise mutations in the promoter of the porcine FADS2, evaluating in particular the effect of one haplotype tagging polymorphism (rs321384923A > G) on the biosynthesis pathway of C20:4. A total of 1,192 Duroc barrows with records on fatty  composition in muscle and subcutaneous fat were genotyped. Pigs carrying the A allele showed, irrespective of fat content, both enhanced FADS2 expression and higher C20:4 in muscle and exhibited increased ratios of C20:4 to C18:2 and of C20:4 to eicosadienoic  (C20:2) in both muscle and adipose tissue. Despite the inverse relationship observed between C20:4 and fat content, the rs321384923 polymorphism had no impact on lean . It is concluded that the haplotype encompassing the rs321384923 polymorphism at the porcine FADS2 affects the n-6 fatty  profile by specifically modifying the desaturation efficiency of C18:2 to C20:4 rather than by concomitant variations in C18:2 following changes in fat content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366666>Effects of monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor URB602 on lung ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.</a></h2><p>Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) is a common and severe postoperative pathologic complication that often occurs when the oxygen supply disrupted to the lung tissue fallowed by reperfusion period, in most cases after lung transplantation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have very important role as regulators of inflammation. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the main 2-AG-degrading enzyme, and the downstream metabolites of 2-AG play a role in the inflammation. Ischemia reperfusion (IR) was induced by clamping the left pulmonary hilum for 60 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion in male C57BL/6 mice. Effects of URB602, a MAGL inhibitor, were evaluated in a preventive or therapeutic regimen (5 min before ischemia or reperfusion, respectively). Oxygenation index, wet-to-dry  ratio and lung injury score were analyzed. Endocannabinoids including 2-AG, anandamide (AEA) and  (AA) levels, metabolites such as Prostaglandin I (PGI), Thromboxane B (TXB) and Leukotrienes B (LTB) and inflammatory markers (Interleukin 6 (IL-6) andTumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) in lung tissues were measured by using mass spectrometry or ELISA analyses. We found that IR increased the wet-to-dry  ratio of lung and lung injury score and decreased oxygenation index as compared to the sham group. Moreover, treatment with URB602 in preventive or therapeutic regimen reduced the wet-to-dry  ratio and lung injury score while increased oxygenation index when compared with the IR group, with a more improvement in the preventive regimen group. In addition, treatment with URB602 before ischemia increased 2-AG level but decreased metabolites (AA, PGI, TXB, LTB) and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α). Thus, our study demonstrated that a pretreatment with URB602 significantly reduced IR-induced lung injury and inflammation. URB602 inhibited LIRI and inflammation by increasing 2-AG level and reducing downstream metabolites from AA to PGI, TXB and LTB in lung tissues.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we report the characterization of a disintegrin isolated from Cerastes cerastes venom, exhibiting antiparasitic activity on Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Indeed, isolated disintegrin, referred to Disintegrin_Cc, induced 84.75% of parasiticidal activity and deep morphological alterations on the parasites. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that this disintegrin was homogenous. This dimeric disintegrin of 14,193.97 Da contains an RGD domain and four intramolecular disulfide bridges. It presents a high percentage of identity with other related snake disintegrins. Predicted 3D structure indicated that this peptide shares partial homology with well-known active antimicrobial peptides. Disintegrin_Cc inhibited 80% of -induced platelet aggregation. The obtained results suggest that the isolated molecule plays a dual role as a disintegrin and as an anti-leishmanial compound.

Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) has been hypothesized to modulate the metabolic fates of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), including  (AA), but the in vivo actions of ACSL4 are unknown. The purpose of our studies was to determine the in vivo role of adipocyte ACSL4 in regulating obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.We developed a novel mouse model with adipocyte-specific ablation of ACSL4 (Ad-KO) using loxP Cre recombinase technology. Metabolic phenotyping of Ad-KO mice relative to their floxed littermates (ACSL4) was performed, including  and  composition over time; insulin and glucose tolerance tests; and energy expenditure, activity, and food intake in metabolic cages. Adipocytes were isolated for ex vivo adipocyte oxygen consumption by Clark electrode and lipidomics analysis. In vitro adipocyte analysis including oxygen consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte oxygen consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free fatty  pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and liver fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole  energy expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The primary objective was for subjects to reduce dietary omega-6 fatty  consumption to less than 4 g/d and increase omega-3 intake to more than 3 g/d. The primary outcome was change in urinary leukotriene E, with changes in other eicosanoids, platelet activation, lung function, and patient-reported questionnaires also assessed.Of the 10 subjects who screened for the study, all 10 completed the dietary intervention. Urinary leukotriene E decreased by 0.17 ng/mg (95% CI, -0.29 to -0.04; P = .02) and tetranor prostaglandin D-M decreased by 0.66 ng/mg creatinine (95% CI, -1.21 to -0.11; P = .02).

In this study, a simple, fast and environmentally friendly supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous measurement of five (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, 6KetoPGF1α and LTB4) AA-metabolites in biological samples. These analytes were extracted by protein precipitation followed by separation and quantification. The analysis was completed within 3 minutes. The matrix matched linear calibration ranged from 0.5-100 ng mL-1 (r2 ≥ 0.995), whilst, the limit of quantification of PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and LTB4 was 0.5 ng mL-1 and was 2.5 ng mL-1 for 6KetoPGF1α. The interday and intraday precisions of the method were less than 15% while the accuracy of most of the analytes varied between 83 and 109%.

Cancer patients are prone to sarcopenia as a result of the decrease in muscle mass and muscle weakness which occurs in cancer cachexia. Attention has been given on the effects of fatty  administration on cancer patients.We conducted a retrospective chart-review study of consecutive patients with unresectable advanced GI cancer (stage IV) (n=46) receiving chemotherapy treatment in an outpatient or in-hospital setting between December 2012 and September 2015 at our Institution. The collected data were characteristics, psoas muscle area as measured by computed tomography (CT), and biochemical blood test and serum fatty  profiles. Three methods of analysis were evaluated: (i) Comparison of biomarkers between two groups: psoas muscle index change rate (ΔPMI) decrease group vs. ΔPMI increase group. (ii) Correlation between ΔPMI and biomarkers. (iii) Multiple regression of ΔPMI and biomarkers Results: In the ΔPMI decrease group, n-6/n-3 ratio and AA/EPA ratio in the decrease group were significantly higher than those in the increase group. Among all parameters, serum EPA was positively and significantly related to ΔPMI (CC=0.443, p=0.039). In contrast, serum CRP, AA/EPA ratio and n-6/n-3 ratio were negatively related to ΔPMI (CC=-0.566, CC=-0.501, CC=-0.476, p=0.006, p=0.018, p=0.025, respectively). On multiple regression analysis, serum CRP value was strongly related to ΔPMI (r=0.421, β=-0.670, p=0.001).Higher n-6/n-3 and AA/EPA ratios were associated with a decrease in psoas muscle area, that lead to diagnosis of sarcopenia. Higher CRP was also associated with a decrease in psoas muscle area, suggesting that this might be an indicator of cachexic skeletal muscle depletion in cachexic patients with advanced gastro-intestinal cancers.Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Four trials were undertaken with gilthead seabream of different ages, fed on diets with fishmeal and fish oil as the main dietary protein and lipid sources and 21-25% lipid contents. Larvae of 4 days after hatching (dah) to 9 dah were fed rotifers with different fatty  profiles: control (2.8% eicosapentaenoic , EPA; 1.6% docosahexaenoic , DHA; 5.4% n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-3 LC-PUFAs; and 0.2% , ARA), low EPA (1.38% EPA, 1.6% DHA, 3.9% n-3 LC-PUFA and 0.4% ARA) or low LC-PUFA (0.7% EPA, 1.0% DHA, 1.8% n-3 LC-PUFA and 0.0% ARA) (% dry ). Larvae fed the low-LC-PUFA diet showed a significantly lower growth at 10 dah. BAL activities were significantly higher in larvae fed the control diet than in those fed low-EPA and low-LC-PUFA diets at 9 dah. BAL activity increased with age across life cycle (49 μg to 300 g). PLA activity could not be detected in larvae but increased with age in juvenile and adult gilthead seabream (86 g to 295 g), similar to BAL. Results suggested a correspondence between the stimulation of lipid digestion capacity and growth performance in gilthead seabream by dietary essential fatty acids, particularly by EPA when DHA requirements are met in the diet especially in the very early stages of life cycle, when the progression of BAL and PLA activities could be used as indicators of the nutritional status of cultured gilthead seabream larvae. Finally, regarded that PLA activity was not detected in 4-dah to 44-dah gilthead seabream larvae, future works are suggested to assess the dietary effect on PLA activity and the PLA activity pattern along the larval stage of this species using a more sensitive detection method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281303>Long chain polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation in infants born at term.</a></h2><p>The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (AA) are considered essential for maturation of the developing brain, retina and other organs in newborn infants. Standard infant milk formulae are not supplemented with LCPUFA; they contain only alpha-linolenic  and linoleic , from which formula-fed infants must synthesise their own DHA and AA, respectively. Over the past few years, some manufacturers have added LCPUFA to formula milk and have marketed these products as providing an advantage for the overall development of full-term infants.To assess whether supplementation of formula milk with LCPUFA is both safe and beneficial for full-term infants, while focusing on effects on visual function, neurodevelopment and physical growth.Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; December 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to December 2016), Embase (Ovid, 1980 to December 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1980 to December 2016) and abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies (2000 to 2016). We applied no language restrictions.We reviewed all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating effects of LCPUFA supplemented versus non-supplemented formula milk on visual function, neurodevelopment and physical growth. We did not include trials reporting only biochemical outcomes.Two review authors extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the guidelines of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. When appropriate, we conducted meta-analysis to determine a pooled estimate of effect.We identified 31 RCTs and included 15 of these in the review (N = 1889).Nine studies assessed visual acuity, six of which used visual evoked potentials (VEP), two Teller cards and one both. Four studies reported beneficial effects, and the remaining five did not. Meta-analysis of three RCTs showed significant benefit for sweep VEP acuity at 12 months (log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)) (mean difference (MD) -0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to -0.13; I = 0; three trials; N = 244), but meta-analysis of three other RCTs showed no benefit for visual acuity measured with Teller cards at 12 months (cycles/degree) (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.11; I = 0; three trials; N = 256). GRADE analysis for the outcome of visual acuity indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.Eleven studies measured neurodevelopmental outcomes at or before two years. Nine studies used Bayley Scales of Infant Development, version II (BSID-II), and only two of these studies reported beneficial effects. Meta-analysis revealed no significant differences between LCPUFA and placebo groups in BSID Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.06, 95% CI -2.01 to 2.14; I = 75%; four trials; N = 661) and no significant differences in BSID Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) scores at 18 months (MD 0.69, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.16; I = 61%; four trials; N = 661). Results showed no significant differences between the two groups in BSID-II scores at one year and two years of age. One study reported better novelty preference measured by the Fagan Infant Test at nine months. Another study reported better problem solving at 10 months. One study used the Brunet and Lezine test to assess the developmental quotient and found no beneficial effects. Follow-up of some infants in different studies at three, six and nine years of age revealed no beneficial effects of supplementation. GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.Thirteen studies measured physical growth; none found beneficial or harmful effects of supplementation. Meta-analysis of five RCTs showed that the supplemented group had lower  (z scores) at one year of age (MD -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.06; I = 83%; N = 521) and that the two groups showed no significant differences with respect to length and head circumference (z scores). Meta-analysis at 18 months and at two years revealed no significant differences between the two groups with respect to  (kg), length (cm) and head circumference (cm). GRADE analysis of these outcomes indicated that the overall quality of evidence was low.Most of the included RCTs reported no beneficial effects or harms of LCPUFA supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes of formula-fed full-term infants and no consistent beneficial effects on visual acuity.

From day 15 of gestation to day 3 pp, Sprague-Dawley dams were fed a commercial chow. On day 3 pp litters were culled and pups (4 males and 2 females) randomly cross-fostered to dams who were randomized to one of the 5 experimental diets resulting in 20 male and 10 female pups/diet group. Dams fed ARA or ARA: DHA had 28-36% more 20:4n-6 in milk and feeding DHA or ARA: DHA doubled 22:6n-3 in milk lipids (P<0.05). Feeding 1:1 or 2:1 ARA: DHA resulted in greater pup  at weaning (P<0.05). Compared to the control pups, ARA + DHA fed pups had a lower proportion of splenic CD45RA+ lymphocytes. In summary, postpartum supplementation with a combination of ARA + DHA, compared to ARA or DHA alone, resulted in a higher content of ARA and DHA in dam's milk and tissues and had positive effects on growth, accompanied by evidence of progression toward a mature immune phenotype, and suggests a need for ARA when DHA is supplemented in the early diet. Additional investigations are needed of ARA immunomodulation to better understand and estimate nutritional requirements for LCPUFAs during early development.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The dietary intake of plant-based precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influences circulating levels of LCPUFA. We hypothesized that low LCPUFA diets during pregnancy would compensate by higher expression of FADS genes to enhance the conversion of precursors to LCPUFA to spare the overall LCPUFA levels. Seventy-five pregnant women were enrolled during the last trimester of pregnancy based on the eligibility and exclusion criteria. Maternal LCPUFA in plasma, expression of FADS1 and FADS2 genes, FADS2 Indel genotype status and neonate birth  were studied.In the vegetarian group (n = 25), plasma α-linolenic  (ALA) but not linoleic  (LA) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than the non-vegetarian group (n = 50).

As blood pressure (BP) is associated with (long-chain) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA), genetic variation in desaturase enzymes being involved in the synthesis of LC PUFA may be associated with BP. This study aimed to investigate the direct effects (independent of mediating variables) and indirect effects (mediated through intermediate variables) of a common variant in the FADS1 gene, rs174546, known to affect delta-5 desaturase (D5D) activity on PUFA level,  mass index (BMI) and BP.A subsample of the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) baseline survey including 520 children aged 2 to <10 years from six European countries was included. The association between rs174546 (T<C) and BP z-score as well as the mediating effects of selected key PUFA levels (dihomo-gamma-linolenic , DGLA; , ARA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or estimated D5D activity (D5D index) and BMI z-score were investigated through path model analyses, adjusting for sex, age, educational level of parents, family history of hypertension, lifestyle factors and blood levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whole blood fatty acids were measured by a validated gas chromatographic method and recorded as percentage of  of all fatty acids detected.Minor allele carriers of the SNP rs174546 had significantly higher DGLA and lower ARA and EPA levels as well as a lower D5D index. Via ARA and BMI z-score, the polymorphism had an indirect lowering effect on systolic BP z-score for each additional T allele (standardized effect estimate -0.057, p = 0.007). For DGLA, EPA and D5D index, the indirect effects of rs174546 on systolic BP were also negative but did not reach significance. DGLA and EPA had an increasing indirect effect on systolic BP via BMI. Results for diastolic BP were in general similar but effect estimates were lower compared to systolic BP.Genetic variation in FADS1 influences BP via ARA and BMI indicating a favorable effect of the minor allele in SNP rs174546. Thus, polymorphisms with an impact on the D5D activity may play a role for the BP level mediated through PUFA and BMI. Therefore, health effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA may vary depending on genetic FADS1 variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30018887> Exerts an Inhibitory Effect on Platelet Aggregation through AKT Dependent Way.</a></h2><p>The  (common bean), a worldwide vegetable of high consumption, can act as a nutritional supplement in the diet of oversized individuals to reduce . Studies have demonstrated the existence of molecules capable of inhibiting the breakdown of carbohydrates via inhibition of both α-amylases and glycosidases. Here, we describe a novel property of the : inhibition of thrombotic cardiovascular events. Using assays to test platelet aggregation and secretion, and flow cytometry against the surface expression of P-Selectin. We show that bean extracts significantly reduced adenosine 5'-diphosphate and  induced-platelet aggregation. The mechanism underlying such effect appears to be mediated by AKT, since AKT hypo-phosphorylation decreases the "inside out" activation of platelets. In sum, our results support the hypothesis that common beans are nutritional ingredients that help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with platelet hyper-reactivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362766>Effects of calorie restriction plus fish oil supplementation on abnormal metabolic characteristics and the iron status of middle-aged obese women.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles has led to a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) worldwide as well as in Taiwan. Middle-aged women are at a greater risk of MetS, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than men because they have more subcutaneous fat and larger waist circumferences compared with men with equal visceral fat levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of calorie restriction (CR) and fish oil supplementation (CRF) on middle-aged Taiwanese women with MetS. An open-label, parallel-arm, controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. A total of 75 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the CR or CRF group. Both the dietary intervention groups were further divided into two age groups: ≤45 and >45 years. Changes in MetS severity, inflammatory status, iron status, and red blood cell fatty  profile were evaluated. A total of 71 participants completed the trial. Both dietary interventions significantly ameliorated MetS and improved the participants' inflammatory status. CR significantly increased the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) whereas CRF increased hepcidin levels in women aged >45 years. Furthermore, CRF significantly increased the n-6/n-3 and /docosahexaenoic  ratios. Both interventions improved the anthropometric and MetS characteristics, including , blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and the score of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. In conclusion, the 12-week dietary interventions improved the abnormal metabolic status of middle-aged obese women. CRF was demonstrated to be more effective in ameliorating postprandial glucose level and TIBC in women aged >45 years than in those aged ≤45 years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30008302>Serum metabonomics study on antidiabetic effects of fenugreek flavonoids in streptozotocin-induced rats.</a></h2><p>Fenugreek is a well-known medicinal plant used for treatment of diabetes. In this study, the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was investigated by metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Fenugreek flavonoids were purified using polyamide resin and D101 macroporous adsorption resin, characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. Pharmacological study results indicated that fenugreek flavonoids exerted a strong antidiabetic effect characterized by significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.01), increase in serum insulin level (P < 0.01) and liver glycogen content (P < 0.01), attenuation of  loss, and improvement of pancreatic islet and kidney conditions. The antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was further analyzed by metabonomics. Serum samples of health and diabetic rats treated or not with fenugreek flavonoids were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The PCA model revealed significant differences among the animal groups, and OPLS-DA identified fenugreek flavonoids-induced changes of 11 potential biomarkers involved in lipid metabolism (docosahexaenoic , , sphinganine, sphingosine‑1‑phosphate, and lysophosphatidylcholines 20:4, 18:2, 16:0, and 20:2), amino  metabolism (hippuric  and tryptophan), and kidney function-related metabolism (2‑phenylethanol glucuronide). Our study demonstrates that flavonoids are bioactive components of fenugreek with potent antidiabetic activity, which exert their therapeutic effects by multiple mechanisms, including reducing insulin resistance, improving gluconeogenesis, and protecting islet cells and kidneys from damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work was to study the anti-obesity effects of structured lipids (SL) obtained by enzymatic interesterification, based on olive oil, soy oil and fully hydrogenated crambe oil. Twenty-four C57Bl/6 mice were distributed into four experimental groups according to the diet consumed: Control Diet (CD), Structured Lipids Diet (SLD), High-fat Control Diet (HCD), High-fat Structured Lipids Diet (HSLD). The animals that were fed SLs presented a smaller  gain, despite a larger intake of the diet. The lowest  gain was reflected in reduced amounts of adipose tissue and lower liver . A significant increase in lipids excreted by the animals in the feces was observed, despite there being no sign of toxicity or presence of diarrhea. The animals that consumed the HSLD presented lower total and LDL-cholesterol, increased HDL-cholesterol and increased hepatic  and docosahexaenoic  levels. In addition, they did not develop hepatic steatosis. The study therefore showed that SLs could play a major role in combating or preventing obesity and other resultant diseases, without producing side effects.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to determine the effect of AA on bone mass, quality, and adiposity in diet-induced obesity during growth. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42, 4-week) were randomized into groups fed a control diet (CTRL, AIN-93G), high-fat diet (HFD, 35% kcal fat) or HFD + AA (1% w/w diet) for 6 weeks.  composition, bone mineral density and microarchitecture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and micro-computed tomography. Red blood cell fatty  profile was measured with gas chromatography. Group differences were evaluated using repeated  two-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Total energy intake did not differ among diet groups. At week 6, HFD + AA had significantly greater  fat % (12%),  (6%) and serum leptin concentrations (125%) than CTRL, whereas visceral fat (mass and %, assessed with micro-computed tomography) was increased in both HFD and HFD + AA groups. HFD + AA showed reduced whole  bone mineral content and femur mid-diaphyseal cortical bone cross-sectional area than HFD and CTRL, without impairment in bone strength. Contrarily, HFD + AA had greater femur metaphyseal trabecular vBMD (35%) and bone volume fraction (5%) compared to controls. Inclusion of AA elevated leptin concentrations in male rats. The early manifestations of diet-induced obesity on bone mass were accelerated with AA. Studies of longer duration are needed to clarify the effect of AA on peak bone mass following growth cessation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Early-life microbial exposure is a potentially effective intervention strategy for modulating the health and metabolism of the host. Yet, it has not been well elucidated whether the gut microbiota development in LBW piglets is different from their normal littermates and its possible association with metabolite profiles. In the current study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics was used to investigate differences in the fecal microbiota and metabolites between LBW and normal piglets during early-life, including day 3 (D3), 7 (D7), 14 (D14), 21 (D21, before weaning), and 35 (D35, after birth). Compared to their normal littermates, LBW piglets harbored low proportions of  on D3,  on D7, , , and  on D21, as well as  on D21 and D35. However, the abundance of  on D7 and D21,  on D14 and D35,  and  on D14 and D21, and  on D21 was significantly higher in LBW piglets when compared with normal piglets. The results of the metabolomics analysis suggested that LBW significantly affected fecal metabolites involved in fatty  metabolism (e.g., linoleic , α-linolenic , and ), amino  metabolism (e.g., valine, phenylalanine, and glutamic ), as well as bile  biosynthesis (e.g., glycocholic , 25-hydroxycholesterol, and chenodeoxycholic ). Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant negative association between  and N1-acetylspermine on D7,  and linoleic  on D14,  and chenodeoxycholic  on D21, and  and phenylalanine on D35, respectively. Collectively, LBW piglets have a different gut bacterial community structure when compared with normal-birth- (NBW) piglets during early-life, especially from 7 to 21 days of age. Also, a distinctive metabolic status in LBW piglets might be partly associated with the altered intestinal microbiota. These findings may further elucidate the factors potentially associated with the impaired growth and development of LBW piglets and facilitate the development of nutritional interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29175671>Dietary omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate hepatic pathology.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has suggested that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) modulate inflammation; however, few studies have focused on the pathobiology of PUFA using isocaloric and isolipidic diets and it is unclear if the associated pathologies are due to dietary PUFA composition, lipid metabolism or obesity, as most studies compare diets fed ad libitum. Our studies used isocaloric and isolipidic liquid diets (35% of calories from fat), with differing compositions of omega (ω)-6 or long chain (Lc) ω-3 PUFA that were pair-fed and assessed hepatic pathology, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Consistent with an isocaloric, pair-fed model we observed no significant difference in diet consumption between the groups. In contrast, the  and liver , total lipid level and abdominal fat deposits were significantly higher in mice fed an ω-6 diet. An analysis of the fatty  profile in plasma and liver showed that mice on the ω-6 diet had significantly more  (AA) in the plasma and liver, whereas, in these mice ω-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were not detected and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was significantly lower. Histopathologic analyses documented that mice on the ω-6 diet had a significant increase in macrovesicular steatosis, extramedullary myelopoiesis (EMM), apoptotic hepatocytes and decreased glycogen storage in lobular hepatocytes, and hepatocyte proliferation relative to mice fed the Lc ω-3 diet. Together, these results support PUFA dietary regulation of hepatic pathology and inflammation with implications for enteral feeding regulation of steatosis and other hepatic lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation and deficiency of anti-inflammatory nutrients like omega(n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may contribute to these associations. Fetal supply of n-3 PUFA is dependent on maternal levels and studies have suggested that improved offspring outcomes are associated with higher maternal intake. However, little is known about how maternal obesity affects the response to n-3 supplementation during pregnancy. We sought to determine (1) the associations of obesity with PUFA concentrations and (2) if the systemic response to n-3 supplementation differs by  mass index (BMI). This was a secondary analysis of 556 participants (46% lean, 28% obese) in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network trial of n-3 (Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) + Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)) supplementation, in which participants had 2g/day of n-3 ( = 278) or placebo ( = 278) from 19 to 22 weeks until delivery. At baseline, obese women had higher plasma n-6  concentrations (: 0.96% total fatty acids; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.13, 1.79) and n-6/n-3 ratio (: 0.26 unit; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.48) compared to lean women. In the adjusted analysis, women in all BMI groups had higher n-3 concentrations following supplementation, although obese women had attenuated changes ( = -2.04%, CI: -3.19, -0.90, interaction  = 0.000) compared to lean women, resulting in a 50% difference in the effect size. Similarly, obese women also had an attenuated reduction ( = 0.94 units, CI: 0.40, 1.47, interaction  = 0.046) in the n-6/n-3 ratio (marker of inflammatory status), which was 65% lower compared to lean women.

Cardiac lipids were analyzed using by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.HFD rats showed cardiac fibrosis and enhanced levels of cardiac superoxide anion (O), HOMA index, adiposity, and plasma leptin, as well as a reduction in those of cardiac glucose transporter (GLUT 4), compared with control animals. Cardiac lipid profile analysis showed a significant increase in triglycerides, especially those enriched with palmitic, stearic, and . An increase in levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) was also observed. No changes in cardiac levels of diacyl phosphatidylcholine, or even a reduction in total levels of diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine, diacyl phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelins (SM) was observed in HFD, as compared with control animals. After adjustment for other variables (oxidative stress, HOMA, cardiac hypertrophy), total levels of DAG were independent predictors of cardiac fibrosis while the levels of total SM were independent predictors of the cardiac levels of GLUT 4.These data suggest that obesity has a significant impact on cardiac lipid composition, although it does not modulate the different species in a similar manner. Nonetheless, these changes are likely to participate in the cardiac damage in the context of obesity, since total DAG levels can facilitate the development of cardiac fibrosis, and SM levels predict GLUT4 levels.Copyright © 2017 Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis.

Dietary fatty acids (FA) are critical for growth, but whether blood FA levels are adequate in Ghanaian children is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the association between whole blood FAs and growth parameters in Northern Ghanaian children 2-6 years of age. A drop of blood was collected on an antioxidant treated card and analyzed for FA composition.  and height were measured and z-scores were calculated. Relationships between FAs and growth parameters were analyzed by Spearman correlations, linear regressions, and factor analysis.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors. This review will provide a brief update on the effects of endocannabinoid signalling in atherosclerosis and related metabolic complications.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026499>New generation lipid emulsions increase brain DHA and improve  composition, but not short-term neurodevelopment in parenterally-fed preterm piglets.</a></h2><p>New generation, multicomponent parenteral lipid emulsions provide key fatty acids for brain growth and development, such as docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (AA), yet the content may be suboptimal for preterm infants. Our aim was to test whether DHA and AA-enriched lipid emulsions would increase activity, growth, and neurodevelopment in preterm piglets and limit brain inflammation. Cesarean-delivered preterm pigs were given three weeks of either enteral preterm infant formula (ENT) or TPN with one of three parenteral lipid emulsions: Intralipid (IL), SMOFlipid (SMOF) or an experimental emulsion (EXP). Activity was continuously monitored and weekly blood sampling and behavioral field testing performed. At termination of the study, whole  and tissue metrics were collected. Neuronal density was assessed in sections of hippocampus (HC), thalamus, and cortex. Frontal cortex (FC) and HC tissue were assayed for fatty  profiles and expression of genes of neuronal growth and inflammation. After 3 weeks of treatment, brain DHA content in SMOF, EXP and ENT pigs was higher (P < 0.01) in FC but not HC vs. IL pigs. There were no differences in brain  or neuron density among treatment groups. Inflammatory cytokine TNFα and IL-1β expression in brain regions were increased in IL pigs (P < 0.05) compared to other groups. Overall growth velocity was similar among groups, but IL pigs had higher percent  fat and increased insulin resistance compared to other treatments (P < 0.05). ENT pigs spent more time in higher physical activity levels compared to all TPN groups, but there were no differences in exploratory behavior among groups. We conclude that a soybean oil emulsion increased select brain inflammatory cytokines and multicomponent lipid emulsions enriched with DHA and AA in parenteral lipids results in increased cortical DHA and improved  composition without affecting short term neurodevelopmental outcomes.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570689>Association between Maternal and Foetal Erythrocyte Fatty  Profiles and Birth .</a></h2><p>Regular foetal development is crucial for assuring good health status in the offspring.

A number of animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are established but they significantly differ in the molecular and biochemical changes depending on the genetic modification and diet used. Mice deficient for melanocortin type 4 receptor (Mc4rmut) develop hyperphagia, obesity, and subsequently NAFLD already under regular chow and resemble more closely the energy supply-driven obesity found in humans. This animal model was used to assess the molecular and biochemical consequences of hyperphagia-induced obesity on hepatic lipid metabolism. We analyzed transcriptome changes in Mc4rmut mice by RNA sequencing and used high resolution 1H magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to assess changes in the lipid composition. On the transcriptomic level we found significant changes in components of the triacylglycerol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathways, and lipid transport and storage compared to the wild-type. These findings were supported by increases in triacylglycerol, monounsaturated fatty , and  levels. The transcriptome signatures significantly differ from those of other NAFLD mouse models supporting the concept of hepatic subphenotypes depending on the genetic background and diet. Comparative analyses of our data with previous studies allowed for the identification of common changes and genotype-specific components and pathways involved in obesity-associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29762790>Dietary supplementation with Clostridium butyricum modulates serum lipid metabolism, meat quality, and the amino  and fatty  composition of Peking ducks.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) on the performance, serum lipid metabolism, muscle morphology, meat quality, and fatty  profiles of Peking ducks. A total of 1,500 Peking ducks were randomly divided into five groups with five replicates and were fed a non-antibiotic basal diet (Control) or a basal diet supplemented with either 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg of C. butyricum (2.0 × 109 CFU/g) or 150 mg of aureomycin/kg for 42 d. Compared with the control group, supplementation with C. butyricum increased the average daily  gain but reduced the feed/gain ratio from 1 to 42 d of age. Similarly, dietary C. butyricum increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes but decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid metabolites concentration. C. butyricum supplementation increased the muscle pH value at 45 min postmortem, the redness of the meat, and the contents of inosine  (IMP) and intramuscular fat (IMF) in Peking ducks. By contrast, C. butyricum supplementation lowered the lightness, drip loss, and the shear force of breast meat. Supplementation with C. butyricum increased the concentrations of essential amino acids and flavor amino acids, as well as  (AA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in breast muscle. Dietary C. butyricum could positively improve performance, lipid metabolism, meat quality, and the amino  and fatty  composition in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, C. butyricum is proposed as a feasible alternative feed additive for the production of healthier Peking duck meat with favorable properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28403941>Obesity is positively associated with -derived 5- and 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE).</a></h2><p>Oxylipids are oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites that are responsible for the onset and resolution of the inflammatory response. Enzymatic oxygenation through the lipoxygenase (LOX) or cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways can form oxylipids that have either proinflammatory or proresolving functions depending on the type of PUFA substrate and degree of metabolism. The objective of this study was to determine how PUFA substrates and their corresponding oxylipids are associated with obesity.Plasma non-esterified FA and oxylipids were isolated from 123 Caucasian males using solid phase extraction and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses included linear regressions and polytomous logistic regressions, and the responses were  mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and serum leptin, total adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-peptide. Models were adjusted for age and smoking, and p-values were corrected for false discovery per Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni.We report that BMI, WC, and several serum cytokines were highly associated  (ARA)-derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and vicinal diols (i.e., alcohols on adjacent carbon atoms) derived from several PUFAs. There was a significant linear relationship between BMI, WC, and serum leptin, and ARA-derived 5-, 11-, and 15-HETE. Specifically, BMI and WC were positively associated with proinflammatory 5- and 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE), even after normalization to ARA concentrations and false discovery p-value correction. Individuals with 5-HETE concentrations >5.01nmol/L or 11-HETE concentrations and >0.89nmol/L were over 5 times more likely to be obese compared to those with ≤1.86nmol/L and ≤0.39nmol/L, respectively. Vicinal diols from linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic  were inversely associated with obesity. Across all statistical tests, vicinal diols were inversely associated with obesity whether normalized to parent PUFA concentrations or normalized to precursor epoxides. Interestingly, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α were not associated with any oxylipids. Since 5-HETE is a 5LOX product, 11-HETE is marker of lipid peroxidation, and vicinal diols are formed through soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolism of CYP epoxygenated PUFAs, therefore, these results indicate that obesity is likely associated with altered metabolism with distinct oxygenating pathways. Taken together, our results indicate that obesity is associated with specific oxylipids indicative of altered PUFA metabolism through several pathways (i.e., LOX, reactive oxygen species, and sEH and CYP epoxygenase), rather than attributed solely to altered dietary PUFA intake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although the major dominant microbiota within individuals have been reported, the change of gut microbiome caused by external factors, such as antibiotic use and bowel cleansing, remains unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the change of gut microbiome in overweight male adults after bowel preparation, where none of the participants had been diagnosed with any systemic diseases.A total of 20 overweight, male Taiwanese adults were recruited, and all participants were omnivorous. The participants provided fecal samples and blood samples at three time points: prior to bowel preparation, 7 days after colonoscopy, and 28 days after colonoscopy. The microbiota composition in fecal samples was analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene amplicon sequencing.Our results demonstrated that the relative abundance of the most dominant bacteria hardly changed from prior to bowel preparation to 28 days after colonoscopy. Using the ratio of Prevotella to the sum of Prevotella and Bacteroides in the fecal samples at baseline, the participants were separated into two groups. The fecal samples of the Type 1 group was Bacteroides-dominant, and that of the Type 2 group was Prevotella-dominant with a noticeable presence Bacteroides. Bulleidia appears more in the Type 1 fecal samples, while Akkermensia appears more in the Type 2 fecal samples. Of each type, the gut microbial diversity differed slightly among the three collection times. Additionally, the Type 2 fecal microbiota was temporarily susceptible to bowel cleansing. Predictive functional analysis of microbial community reveals that their activities for the mineral absorption metabolism and  metabolism differed significantly between the two types. Depending on their fecal type, the variance of triglycerides and C-reactive protein also differed between the two types of participants.Depending upon the fecal type, the microbial diversity and the predictive functional modules of microbial community differed significantly after bowel preparation. In addition, blood biochemical markers presented somewhat associated with fecal type. Therefore, our results might provide some insights as to how knowledge of the microbial community could be used to promote health through personalized clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555127>Study on Metabolic Trajectory of Liver Aging and the Effect of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi on Aging Mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic trajectory of liver aging, the effect of FTZ against liver aging in aging mice, and its mechanism using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS).  A total of 80 C57BL/6J Narl mice were randomly divided into five groups: 3-month-old group, 9-month-old group, 14-month-old group, 20-month-old group, and FTZ treatment group (20 months old). The mice in the treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract (1.0 g/kg, on raw material  basis) once daily during the experiment. The other groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution. Liver samples of all five groups were collected after 12 weeks, and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was used to analyze metabolic changes. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to analyze the resulting data. Additionally, cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the liver were determined.  The levels of TC, TG, AST, and ALT were increased, and liver tissue structure was damaged. The secretion levels of TNF-α, IL-6, 5-LOX, and COX-2, as well as their relative mRNA expression in the liver also increased with aging. FTZ administration reduced the symptoms of liver aging. The OPLS-DA score plot illustrated the effect of FTZ against liver aging, with N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4, leukotriene E4, and  among the key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis included  metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the symptoms of liver aging in mice might be related to disorders of the abovementioned pathways.  A metabolomic approach based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and multivariate statistical analysis was successfully applied to investigate the metabolic trajectory of liver aging. FTZ has a protective effect against liver aging, which may be mediated  interference with the metabolism of , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory factors in the liver in mice .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105530>Fatty  Signaling Mechanisms in Neural Cells: Fatty  Receptors.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids (FAs) are typically associated with structural and metabolic roles, as they can be stored as triglycerides, degraded by β-oxidation or used in phospholipids' synthesis, the main components of biological membranes. It has been shown that these lipids exhibit also regulatory functions in different cell types. FAs can serve as secondary messengers, as well as modulators of enzymatic activities and substrates for cytokines synthesis. More recently, it has been documented a direct activity of free FAs as ligands of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear receptors, and cumulative evidence has emerged, demonstrating its participation in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. It has been long known that the central nervous system is enriched with poly-unsaturated FAs, such as  (C20:4ω-6) or docosohexaenoic (C22:6ω-3) acids. These lipids participate in the regulation of membrane fluidity, axonal growth, development, memory, and inflammatory response. Furthermore, a whole family of low molecular  compounds derived from FAs has also gained special attention as the natural ligands for cannabinoid receptors or key cytokines involved in inflammation, largely expanding the role of FAs as precursors of signaling molecules. Nutritional deficiencies, and alterations in lipid metabolism and lipid signaling have been associated with developmental and cognitive problems, as well as with neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism behind these effects still remains elusive. But in the last two decades, different families of proteins have been characterized as receptors mediating FAs signaling. This review focuses on different receptors sensing and transducing free FAs signals in neural cells: (1) membrane receptors of the family of G Protein Coupled Receptors known as Free Fatty  Receptors (FFARs); (2) cytosolic transport Fatty -Binding Proteins (FABPs); and (3) transcription factors Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). We discuss how these proteins modulate and mediate direct regulatory functions of free FAs in neural cells. Finally, we briefly discuss the advantages of evaluating them as potential targets for drug design in order to manipulate lipid signaling. A thorough characterization of lipid receptors of the nervous system could provide a framework for a better understanding of their roles in neurophysiology and, potentially, help for the development of novel drugs against aging and neurodegenerative processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284730>Developmental and reproductive toxicological evaluation of  (ARA)-Rich oil and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)-Rich oil.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the reproductive and developmental toxicity of dietary exposure to DHA-rich oil from Schizochytrium sp. and ARA-rich oil from Mortierella alpina.

Study arms were both the lactating mother and child receiving fish oil intervention (MCI), only the lactating mother receiving fish oil intervention and child receiving placebo control (MI), only the child receiving intervention and mother receiving placebo control (CI), and both mother and child receiving a placebo supplement or control (C). The primary study outcome was linear growth using monthly changes in length-for-age z score. Anthropometric measurements were taken monthly, and hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and blood LC-PUFAs were measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 mo of follow-up. Weekly morbidity surveillance was conducted throughout the study.Fish-oil supplementation significantly increased blood n-3 LC-PUFA concentration (P < 0.01) and decreased the :(docosahexaenoic  + eicosapentaenoic ) ratio (P < 0.001) in all intervention arms. No significant intervention effect was found on linear growth, morbidity, or systemic inflammation.

It binds to a variety of ligands, with a higher affinity for , and is thought to have a diverse array of functions. We investigated a potential role for ApoD in insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and thrombosis-processes related to lipid metabolism-in severely obese women.We measured ApoD expression in a cohort of 44 severely obese women including dysmetabolic and non-dysmetabolic patients. Physical and metabolic characteristics of these women were determined from anthropometric measurements and blood samples. ApoD was quantified at the mRNA and protein levels in samples from three intra-abdominal adipose tissues (AT): omental, mesenteric and round ligament (RL).ApoD protein levels were highly variable between AT of the same individual. High ApoD protein levels, particularly in the RL depot, were linked to lower plasma insulin levels (-40%, p = 0.015) and insulin resistance (-47%, p = 0.022), and increased insulin sensitivity (+10%, p = 0.008). Lower circulating pro-inflammatory PAI-1 (-39%, p = 0.001), and TNF-α (-19%, p = 0.030) levels were also correlated to high ApoD protein in the RL AT.ApoD variability between AT was consistent with different accumulation efficiencies and/or metabolic functions according to the anatomic location of fat depots. Most statistically significant correlations implicated ApoD protein levels, in agreement with protein accumulation in target tissues. These correlations associated higher ApoD levels in fat depots with improved metabolic health in severely obese women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901177>Mating with seminal vesicle-excised male can affect the uterus phospholipid fatty-acids composition during implantation in an experimental mouse model.</a></h2><p>No comprehensive information is available about uterus fatty  (FA) change during implantation period and possible effects of the seminal vesicle secretion on it.In this study, we evaluated FA composition of uterus phospholipids during the implantation period in intact and seminal vesicle-excised (SVX) mated female mice. Forty NMRI female mice were divided into control (mated with intact male) and seminal vesicle excised (SVX)-mated (mated with SVX-male) groups. The phospholipid fatty acids composition was monitored during the fi rst fi ve days of pregnancy using gas chromatography and also implantation rate was evaluated on fi fth day of pregnancy.We found that levels of linoleic  (LNA) and  (ARA) showed a decreasing trend from the fi rst to the third day of pregnancy and then started to increase on the fourth day and peaked on the fi fth day. In contrast, the level of saturated FA (SFA) increased on the second and third day of pregnancy compared to the fi rst (p<0.05) and then decreased on the fourth and fi fth. We also found that the seminal vesicle secretion could affect the levels of LNA, ARA, SFA, and PUFA in uterine phospholipids especially on second and third day. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between ARA level and implantation rate in control but not SVX-mated groups.It can be concluded that several uterus FA that have important roles in early pregnancy could be affected by seminal vesicle secretion.Copyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267642>Fundamental studies of adrenal retinoid-X-receptor: Protein isoform, tissue expression, subcellular distribution, and ligand availability.</a></h2><p>Adrenal gland reportedly expresses many nuclear receptors that are known to heterodimerize with retinoid-X-receptor (RXR) for functions, but the information regarding the glandular RXR is not adequate. Studies of rat adrenal homogenate by Western blotting revealed three RXR proteins: RXRα (55kDa), RXRβ (47kDa) and RXR (56kDa). RXRγ was not detectable. After fractionation, RXRα was almost exclusively localized in the nuclear fraction. In comparison, substantial portions of RXRβ and RXR were found in both nuclear and post-nuclear particle fractions, suggesting genomic and non-genomic functions. Cells immunostained for RXRα were primarily localized in zona fasciculata (ZF) and medulla, although some stained cells were found in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona reticularis (ZR). In contrast, cells immunostained for RXRβ were concentrated principally in ZG, although some stained cells were seen in ZR, ZF, and medulla (in descending order, qualitatively). Analysis of adrenal lipid extracts by LC/MS did not detect 9-cis-retinoic  (a potent RXR-ligand) but identified all-trans retinoic . Since C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can also activate RXR, subcellular availabilities of unesterified fatty acids were investigated by GC/MS. As results,  (C20:4), adrenic  (C22:4), docosapentaenoic  (C22:5), and cervonic  (C22:6) were detected in the lipids extracted from each subcellular fraction. Thus, the RXR-agonizing PUFAs are available in all the main subcellular compartments considerably. The present findings not only shed light on the adrenal network of RXRs but also provide baseline information for further investigations of RXR heterodimers in the regulation of adrenal steroidogenesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthy physical growth is an important objective for the clinical care of children born preterm.The aim of the trial was to examine the effects of supplementing toddlers born preterm with DHA and  (AA) for 180 d on growth and adiposity.Omega Tots, a randomized placebo-controlled trial, was conducted between April 2012 and March 2017. Children born at <35 wk gestation who were 10-16 mo in corrected age were assigned to receive daily oral supplements of DHA and AA (200 mg each, "DHA + AA") or corn oil (placebo) for 180 d. Prespecified secondary outcomes included , length, head circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, BMI, and their respective z scores, and  fat percentage, which were measured at baseline and trial completion. Mixed-effects regression was used to compare the change in outcomes between the DHA + AA and placebo groups, controlling for baseline values.Among 377 children included in the analysis (median corrected age = 15.7 mo, 48.3% female), 348 (92.3%) had growth or adiposity data at baseline and trial end. No statistically significant differences between the DHA + AA and placebo groups in growth or adiposity outcomes were observed. For instance, the change in -for-age z scores was 0.1 for the DHA + AA group and 0.0 for the placebo group (effect size = 0.01, P = 0.99). However, post-hoc subgroup analyses revealed a statistically significant interaction between treatment group and sex, suggesting somewhat slower linear growth for females assigned to the DHA + AA group compared with the placebo group.Among toddlers born preterm, daily supplementation with DHA + AA for 180 d resulted in no short-term differences in growth or adiposity compared with placebo.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A, regulated by miRNA-185, can activate  (ARA) release via the VEGFA signaling pathway, which influences RFM. The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenic mechanism of RFM by investigating the regulatory relationship between miRNA-185 and the VEGFA signaling pathway. Serum samples of healthy Holstein dairy cows (n = 20) and RFM cows (n = 12), with a similar age, parity, , and milk yield, were collected to detect VEGFA and ARA concentrations at 6, 12, and 24 h after calving. Caruncle tissues were collected from healthy (n = 6) and RFM cows (n = 6) at 12 h after calving. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (WB) were performed to detect the mRNA and proteins levels, respectively, of genes involved in the VEGFA signaling pathway. Uterine caruncle epithelial (UCE) cells were cultured by the explant culture method, further purified, and subsequently treated with miRNA-185 mimics, miRNA-185 mimics + MEK inhibitor, or left untreated as a control for detection of the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in the VEGFA signaling pathway. The cellular supernatant was collected for measurement of ARA levels at 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment. Serum levels of VEGFA and ARA from RFM cows were abnormally increased at 12 h after calving, as compared to those in healthy dairy cows. Expression levels of most of the investigated genes (VEGFA, PLC, PRK, RAF, MEK, MAPK, and PLA) were down-regulated in the caruncle tissue of RFM cows. However, P-p44/42 MAPK was up-regulated in the caruncle tissues of cows with RFM (p < .01). In UCE cells treated with the miRNA-185 mimics, expression of VEGFA, PLC, RAF, MEK, MAPK and PLA was significantly down-regulated, while that of P-p44/42 MAPK was significantly up-regulated. Expression of genes involved in the VEGFA signaling pathway was similar to that in the in vivo assay. In UCE cells treated with the miRNA-185 mimics + MEK inhibitors, expression of VEGFA, PLC, RAF, MEK, MAPK and P-p44/42 MAPK was significantly down-regulated, while that of PLA was significantly up-regulated. Meanwhile, the release of ARA was increased (p < .01). These results demonstrate that miRNA-185 can regulate the VEGFA signaling pathway, especially via abnormal expression of P-p44/42 MAPK, which influences the release of the fetal placenta after calving.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In experiment 1, 400 females and 40 males (30 week age) of Ross 308 broiler breeder (20 females and two males in each pen) were randomly assigned to one of the four diets with n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4, 6, 8 and 16 (control). As a measure of hatchability, fertility of eggs and general incubation traits, 1,200 eggs (60 eggs from each pen) were collected and incubated for 21 days and embryo liver and brain fatty  profile in 14 and 21 days were determined. In experiment 2, 48 males (three males in each pen) randomly assigned to one of the four diets with n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4, 6, 8 and 16 (control). Semen was collected twice weekly, and semen volume, spermatozoa concentration and motility and alive and dead spermatozoa were estimated. Egg production and egg mass were decreased by n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4:1 and 6:1 (p < .05). There were no significant differences between treatments on breeder's , eggs fertility and hatchability, embryonic mortality and semen features.

T2DM is associated with a number of pathological complications, including cardiovascular disease that is mostly promoted by the increased oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients. We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of an individualized oral supplementation with α-lipoic  (ALA), carnosine, and thiamine. For that purpose, 82 obese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, and were either supplemented daily with 7 mg ALA/kg , 6 mg carnosine/kg , and 1 mg thiamine/kg  or placebo for 8 weeks. An array of biochemical tests including the estimation of oxidative stress and platelet aggregation were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Moreover, the antiplatelet activity of each of the supplement's components was determined ex vivo at human and washed rabbit platelets. Glucose and HbA levels were significantly reduced after supplementation (135.7 ± 19.5 mg/dL vs. 126.5 ± 16.8 mg/dL and 8.3% ± 0.3% vs. 6.03% ± 0.58%, respectively, P < .05); however, insulin was significantly increased (3.6 ± 0.7 μIU/mL vs. 6.8 ± 0.2 μIU/mL, P < .05). The patients treated with the supplement recorded higher follow-up values for HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, and a significant drop in serum hydroperoxide level. Only ALA inhibited platelets aggregation ex vivo through ADP, platelet activating factor, , epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin pathways. Daily supplementation with an individualized ALA, carnosine, and thiamine supplement effectively reduced glucose concentration in type 2 diabetic patients, probably by increasing insulin production from the pancreas. In addition to that, the reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of platelet aggregation could potentially provide greater cardiovascular protection.

One of the manifestations of the protective effect of salicylic  is its ability to induce changes of lipoxygenase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062233>Correlations between "hie-sho" interview score and progesterone, fat intake, and Kupperman index in pre- and post-menopausal women: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Japanese menopausal women who feel cold, even in a warm room, are said to be experiencing "hie-sho." We assessed the magnitude of coldness by a "hie-sho" interview score. The association between the magnitude of coldness and female hormones, fat intake, and menopausal symptoms is unknown. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between the hie-sho interview scores and female hormones, fat intake, Kupperman index in pre- (pre group) and post- (post group) menopausal women. The hie-sho interview scores, Kupperman index questionnaire results, dietary survey to analyze fat intake, and  were analyzed, and plasma estradiol, progesterone, and lipid levels were measured in the subjects in the pre (n = 9) and post (n = 11) groups. Plasma female hormones and fat intake were different, but the total Kupperman index was not different between pre and post groups. Plasma progesterone was positively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the post group. Plasma triglyceride was positively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the pre group. Intake of cholesterol, , and docosapentaenoic  was negatively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the pre group. The positive correlation between total Kupperman index and hie-sho score was observed only in the pre group. These results indicated that progesterone level was related to coldness in post-menopausal women. Fat intake, plasma triglyceride, and menopausal symptoms may be related to coldness in pre-menopausal women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108061>Genetic correlations between wool traits and meat quality traits in Merino sheep.</a></h2><p>Genetic correlations between 29 wool production and quality traits and 25 meat quality and nutritional value traits were estimated for Merino sheep from an Information Nucleus (IN). Genetic correlations among the meat quality and nutritional value traits are also reported. The IN comprised 8 flocks linked genetically and managed across a range of sheep production environments in Australia. The wool traits included over 5,000 yearling and 3,700 adult records for fleece , fiber diameter, staple length, staple strength, fiber diameter variation, scoured wool color, and visual scores for breech and  wrinkle. The meat quality traits were measured on samples from the and included over 1,200 records from progeny of over 170 sires for intramuscular fat (IMF), shear force of meat aged for 5 d (SF5), 24 h postmortem pH (pHLL; also measured in the , pHST), fresh and retail meat color and meat nutritional value traits such as iron and zinc levels, and long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  levels. Estimated heritabilities for IMF, SF5, pHLL, pHST, retail meat color lightness (), myoglobin, iron, zinc and across the range of long-chain fatty acids were 0.58 ± 0.11, 0.10 ± 0.09, 0.15 ± 0.07, 0.20 ± 0.10, 0.59 ± 0.15, 0.31 ± 0.09, 0.20 ± 0.09, 0.11 ± 0.09, and range of 0.00 (eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and  acids) to 0.14 ± 0.07 (linoleic ), respectively. The genetic correlations between the wool production and meat quality traits were low to negligible and indicate that wool breeding programs will have little or no effect on meat quality. There were moderately favorable genetic correlations between important yearling wool production traits and the omega-3 fatty acids that were reduced for corresponding adult wool production traits, but these correlations are unlikely to be important in wool/meat breeding programs because they have high SE, and the omega-3 traits have little or no genetic variance. Significant genetic correlations among the meat quality traits included IMF with SF5 (-0.76 ± 0.24), fresh meat color * (0.50 ± 0.18), and zinc (0.41 ± 0.19). Selection to increase IMF will improve meat tenderness and color which may address some of the issues with Merino meat quality. These estimated parameters allow Merino breeders to combine wool and meat objectives without compromising meat quality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728763>Maternal Supplementation With Avocado ( Mill.) Pulp and Oil Alters Reflex Maturation, Physical Development, and Offspring Memory in Rats.</a></h2><p>Avocado ( Mill.) is an oleaginous fruit source of fatty acids with high levels of neuroprotective phytocomplexes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the development of reflex and somatic maturation, fatty  profiles in the brain, and memory in different stages of life in the offspring of dams supplemented with avocado pulp and oil during gestation and lactation. The dams were randomly divided into three groups ( = 15 pups/group), and recieved by gavage supplementation: control group (CG)-distilled water; Avocado Oil (AO)-3,000 mg avocado oil/kg animal , and Avocado Pulp (AP)-3,000 mg avocado pulp/kg animal . We performed the following tests: Analysis of Somatic Development and Ontogeny of Postnatal Reflex (T0 to T21), the Open Field Habituation Test and the Object Recognition Test (ORT) in the adolescent (T45) and adult (T90) phases. The cerebral fatty acids content was evaluated at times T0, T21, T45, and T90. The results were analyzed using the statistical program GraphPad Prism and significant statistics were considered when  < 0.05. Acceleration of reflex maturation and reflex ontogeny was observed in the offspring of AO and AP fed dams, with the results being more pronounced in the pulp fed group ( < 0.05). All groups presented a decrease in the ambulation parameter in the second exposure to the Open Field Habituation Test, at T45 and T90 ( < 0.05). In the ORT, the AO and AP offspring presented memory improvements in the short and long term in the adult and adolescent phases ( < 0.05). The results of the brain fatty  profiles presented higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in the AO and AP groups at T21, T45, and T90. The docosahexaenoic fatty  (DHA) content was higher at T21 (AO and AP), at T45 (AO and AP), and at T90 (AP) ( < 0.05). The  (ARA) content was higher at T45 (AO and AP), and at T90 (AO) ( < 0.05). Maternal supplementation with avocado oil and pulp anticipates reflex maturation and somatic postnatal development, and improves memory during the adolescent and adult phases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413362>The type of dietary fat and dietary energy restriction affects the activity of the desaturases in the liver microsomes.</a></h2><p>The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of different dietary oils and the dietary energy restriction on the activity of enzymes participating in the process of  synthesis and on fatty  profile in serum. It was also evaluated how diet modification affects the  of animals and  of the specific organs: liver, kidney and spleen. Wistar male rats were divided into 6 groups according to the diet fed (control, sunflower oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil, fish oil and a group of dietary energy restriction - DER group). The enzyme activities were established indirectly in liver microsomes. To this aim the method of high performance liquid chromatography with UV/VIS detection was used. In addition, the indices of ∆-desaturase (D6D) and ∆-desaturase (D5D) were determined. Significant differences in the concentrations of fatty acids and enzyme activity were observed. The results concerning desaturases show the negative correlation between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and enzymes activity. The highest D6D activity was observed in microsomes obtained from sunflower oil fed rats and the lowest D6D activity was in the DER group. D5D index did not differ much depending on the diet. Among groups supplemented with oils the higher mean values of the  of liver were observed in the group supplemented with rapeseed oil. Consumption of diets supplemented with edible oils of different fatty  profile influence both serum fatty  composition and the activity of ∆- and Δ-desaturase.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Flaxseed is a rich source of α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3 n-3). Feeding flaxseed to hens can increase n-3 fatty acids (FA) in eggs. However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decrease nutrient digestibility and can have a negative impact on egg n-3 FA incorporation. Addition of carbohydrase enzymes to flaxseed-based diets can decrease the anti-nutritive effects of NSP. 2. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of enzyme supplementation on FA composition and gastrointestinal morphology in hens fed flaxseed. A total of seventy-two, 51-week old brown layer hens were randomly assigned to one of the four dietary treatments (six replicates with three hens per replicate): corn-soybean based diet containing 0% flax (Control), 10% flax (Flax), Flax+0.05% enzyme (Flax+E1), or Flax+0.1% enzyme (Flax+E2) in a 120-day feeding trial. 3. Egg  was highest in hens fed Flax+E1 (P < 0.05). Yolk  was higher in Flax+E1 compared with the control and Flax+E2 and was not different from Flax treatment. ALA and total n-3 FA was highest in eggs from Flax+E2 hens (P < 0.05). Addition of enzyme has no effect of on docosahexaenoic  (DHA), total long chain (>20-C FA), or n-6:n-3 FA ratio in eggs from hens fed flaxseed-based diets (P > 0.05). Over nine-fold increase in hepatic ALA was observed in the liver of hens fed flaxseed-based diets when compared with the control diet (P < 0.0001). No effect of enzyme supplementation was observed on liver ALA, DHA or long chain n-3 FA (P > 0.05). Enzyme supplementation reduced , total n-6 and LC n-6 FA in liver tissue from hens fed flaxseed-based diets (P > 0.05). 4. Villi height and width was higher in the duodenum and jejunum of hens fed flax-based diets compared to the control (P < 0.05). Enzyme supplementation led to an increase in villi width in jejunum (P < 0.05) in hens fed Flax+E2 (P < 0.05). No effect of diet was observed in the crypt depth and villi height:crypt depth ratio in the jejunum (P > 0.05). 5.

Traditional Chinese physicians prefer to prescribe the dried whole  of leech processed under high temperatures. It has been reported that dried WP remains clinically effective. However, the therapeutic mechanism has yet not be clearly elucidated.This study was designed to investigate the protective activity of the extract of WP in a high-molecular- dextran-induced blood hyperviscosity rat model, and to explore the role of WP in improving blood hyperviscosity related metabolic disorders and to clarify the possible mechanism of metabolic regulation.The hemorheological parameters were measured with an automated blood rheology analyzer. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the pathological changes in aortic tissues samples. Further, a liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to characterize the metabolic alterations.WP has evident attenuating effects on blood hyperviscosity and related metabolic disorders, and the influences are distinct from those of aspirin. The results showed that WP had good effects in reducing blood viscosity and ameliorating histopathological changes in the thoracic aorta in a high molecular  dextran-induced blood hyperviscosity rat model. The middle dose (2.5 g raw material/kg ) of WP exhibited effects equivalent to aspirin (100 mg/kg) on hemorheological and histopathological parameters (P > 0.05). However, when using metabolomics profiling, we found that WP could significantly improve blood hyperviscosity-related metabolic disorders and restore metabolites to normal levels; while aspirin showed little effect. With principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis, WP regulated many more endogenous metabolites than aspirin. With pathway enrichment analysis, the differential endogenous metabolites were involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism, TCA cycle,  metabolism, etc., highlighting the metabolic reprogramming potential of WP against blood hyperviscosity-induced metabolic disorders.The study suggest that WP has a more potent effect, but a different mechanism, than aspirin in improving either blood hyperviscosity or related metabolic disorders associated with cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previously, we showed that inhibition of the two major endocannabinoid-hydrolyzing enzymes, fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase, in the renal medulla increased the rate of urine excretion (UV) and salt excretion without affecting mean arterial pressure (MAP). The present study evaluated the effects of a selective FAAH inhibitor, N-3-pyridinyl-4-[[3-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenyl]methyl]-1-piperidine carboxamide (PF-3845) on MAP and renal functions. Infusion of PF-3845 into the renal medulla of C57BL/6J mice reduced MAP during the posttreatment phases and increased UV at 15 and 30 nmol/min per gram kidney  (g kwt), relative to the pretreatment control phase. Intravenous PF-3845 administration reduced MAP at the 7.5, 15, and 30 doses and increased UV at the 15 and 30 nmol⋅min⋅g kwt doses. PF-3845 treatment elevated sodium and potassium urinary excretion and medullary blood flow. Homozygous FAAH knockout mice were refractory to intramedullary PF-3845-induced changes in MAP, but UV was increased. Both MAP and UV responses to intramedullary PF-3845 in C57BL/6J mice were diminished by pretreatment with the cannabinoid type 1 receptor-selective antagonist, rimonabant (3 mg/kg, ip) but not the cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor, celecoxib (15 mg/kg, iv). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses showed increased anandamide in kidney tissue and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in plasma after intramedullary PF-3845. These data suggest that inhibition of FAAH in the renal medulla leads to both a diuretic and blood pressure-lowering response mediated by elevated anandamide in kidney tissue or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol in plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28384353>Generation and characterization of epoxide hydrolase 3 (EPHX3)-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize  into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play an important role in blood pressure regulation, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Epoxide hydrolases metabolize EETs to their corresponding diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids; DHETs) which are biologically less active. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1, mEH) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (EPHX2, sEH) were identified >30 years ago and are capable of hydrolyzing EETs to DHETs. A novel epoxide hydrolase, EPHX3, was recently identified by sequence homology and also exhibits epoxide hydrolase activity in vitro with a substrate preference for 9,10-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic  (EpOME) and 11,12-EET. EPHX3 is highly expressed in the skin, lung, stomach, esophagus, and tongue; however, its endogenous function is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the impact of genetic disruption of Ephx3 on fatty  epoxide hydrolysis and EET-related physiology in mice. Ephx3-/- mice were generated by excising the promoter and first four exons of the Ephx3 gene using Cre-LoxP methodology. LC-MS/MS analysis of Ephx3-/- heart, lung, and skin lysates revealed no differences in endogenous epoxide:diol ratios compared to wild type (WT). Ephx3-/- mice also exhibited no change in plasma levels of fatty  epoxides and diols relative to WT. Incubations of cytosolic and microsomal fractions prepared from Ephx3-/- and WT stomach, lung, and skin with synthetic 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 9,10-EpOME revealed no significant differences in rates of fatty  diol formation between the genotypes. Ephx3-/- hearts had similar functional recovery compared to WT hearts following ischemia/reperfusion injury. Following intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, Ephx3-/- mice were not different from WT in terms of lung histology, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts, or fatty  epoxide and diol levels.

The role of  (AA) and its downstream enzymatic cascades, such as cyclooxygenase, in adipogenesis is well established. The exact contribution of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, however, remains to be established. Enzymes belonging to this pathway are mainly encoded by the CYP2J locus which shows extensive allelic expansion in mice. Here we aimed to establish the role of endogenous epoxygenase during adipogenesis under homeostatic and metabolic stress conditions.We took advantage of the simpler genetic architecture of the Cyp2j locus in the rat and used a Cyp2j4 (orthologue of human CYP2J2) knockout rat in two models of metabolic dysfunction: physiological aging and cafeteria diet (CAF). The phenotyping of Cyp2j4 rats under CAF was integrated with proteomics (LC-MS/MS) and lipidomics (LC-MS) analyses in the liver and the adipose tissue.We report that Cyp2j4 deletion causes adipocyte dysfunction under metabolic challenges. This is characterized by (i) down-regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) PPARγ and C/EBPα, (ii) adipocyte hypertrophy, (iii) extracellular matrix remodeling, and (iv) alternative usage of AA pathway. Specifically, in Cyp2j4 rats treated with a cafeteria diet, the dysfunctional adipogenesis is accompanied by exacerbated  gain, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dysregulated gluconeogenesis.These results suggest that AA epoxygenases are essential regulators of healthy adipogenesis.

The HSP27 monomer coexists with the dimer, which can bind unfolded client proteins. Here, we evaluated the in-cell dimer-monomer equilibrium and its relevance to the binding of client proteins in a normal human vascular endothelial cell line. When cells were treated with a membrane-permeable crosslinker, the protein existed primarily as a free monomer (27 kDa) with a markedly smaller percentage of dimer (54 kDa), hetero-conjugates, and minor smear-like bands. When the protein was crosslinked in a cell-free lysate, two of the hetero-conjugates that were crosslinked in live cells were also detected, but the dimer and other complexes were absent. However, when cells were pretreated with fatty  (FA) and/or heat (42.5 °C), dissociation of the dimer was selectively prevented and two types of covalently linked dimers were increased. These changes occurred most prominently in cells treated with docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and heat, which appeared to intensify the heat resistance of the cell. Both the formation of covalently linked dimers and heat resistance were prevented by N-acetylcysteine. By contrast, nearly all of the free monomers in the lysate converted to disulfide bond-linked dimers by a simple, long incubation at 4 °C. These results strongly suggest that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of HSP27 was inversed between the in-cell and cell-free systems. Temperature- and amphiphile-regulated dimerization was restricted probably due to the low hydration of the in-cell crowding environment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, investigations regarding PUFA status and correlates in children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) from low-income countries are scarce. The aim of this study was to describe whole-blood PUFA levels in children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and to identify correlates of PUFAs.We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data from a prospective nutritional intervention trial among 1609 children with MAM aged 6-23 months in Burkina Faso,West Africa. Whole-blood PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography and expressed as percent of total whole-blood fatty acids (FA%). Potential correlates of PUFAs including infection, inflammation, hemoglobin, anthropometry (difference between children diagnosed as having MAM based on low mid-upper-arm-circumference (MUAC) only, low MUAC and -for-height z-score (WHZ), or low WHZ only) and diet were assessed by linear regression adjusted for age and sex.Children with MAM had low concentrations of whole-blood PUFAs, particularly n-3 PUFAs. Moreover, children diagnosed with MAM based only on low MUAC had 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14; 0.50) and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.16; 0.63) FA% lower  (AA) than those recruited based on both low WHZ as well as low MUAC and those recruited with low WHZ only, respectively. Infection and inflammation were associated with low levels of all long-chain (LC)-PUFAs, while hemoglobin was positively associated with whole-blood LC-PUFAs.While PUFA deficiency was not a general problem, overall whole-blood PUFA concentrations, especially of n-3 PUFAs, were low.

The fungus was grown at 20°C temperature for four days initially followed by 12°C temperature for next five days. The basal medium contained starch, yeast extract, and a blend of linseed oil (LSO) and garden cress oil (GCO) in the ratio 1 : 1. Results of the study revealed that, after nine days of total incubation period, the enhancement of biomass was up to 16.7 g/L dry  with a total lipid content of 55.4% (v/w). Enrichment of omega-3 fatty acids indicated a significant increase in fatty  bioconversion (ALA 32.2 ± 0.42%, EPA 7.9 ± 0.1%, and DHA 4.09 ± 0.2%) by 2.5-fold. The two-stage temperature cultivation alters the fatty  profile due to activation of the desaturase enzyme in the cellular levels due to which  (AA) content reduced significantly.

The intake of LCO3-PUFAs has been reported to contribute to bone metabolism. We aimed to investigate the relationships between dietary intakes of LCO3-PUFAs and bone mineral density (BMD) in Spanish women aged 20-79 years old. A total of 1865 female subjects (20-79 years old) were enrolled, and lumbar (L2, L3, L3 and total spine), hip (femoral neck (FN), femoral trochanter (FT) and Ward's triangle (WT)) bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Dietary intakes of total energy, calcium, vitamin D, alpha-linolenic  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and n-6 fatty acids (linoleic  (LA) and  (AA)) were assessed by a self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Spearman's rank correlations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were estimated. Partial correlations controlling for age, , height, dietary calcium, vitamin D, menopausal status and energy were calculated. A multiple regression analysis was computed to assess significant associations with BMD in this population. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, there were positive correlations between ALA, EPA and DHA intake and BMD. According to the WHO diagnosis criteria for osteoporosis, in this population of normal and osteopenic women, the dietary intake of ALA was also significantly associated with BMD at the hip. In normal women, the dietary intake of DHA was also significantly associated with BMD at the lumbar spine. No significant associations between LCO3-PUFAs and BMD were detected in the lumbar spine of osteopenic or osteoporotic women. The dietary intake of LCO3-PUFAs was positively associated with BMD in Spanish women at both the hips and the lumbar spine. We highlight that the intake of LCO3-PUFAs is not significantly associated with BMD in osteoporotic women; however, the intake of LCO3-PUFAs seems to be positively associated with BMD at both the hips and the lumbar spine in normal and osteopenic women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404964>Preparation of High Purity Δ5-Olefinic Acids from Pine Nut Oil via Repeated Lipase-Catalyzed Esterification.</a></h2><p>Δ5-Olefinic acids have been characterized in gymnosperm plants and have been reported to have several biological health benefits. Δ5-Olefinic acids from pine nut oil were effectively concentrated by repeated lipase-catalyzed esterification. The pine nut oil contained three major Δ5-olefinic acids, namely taxoleic  (C18:2 Δ5,9), pinolenic  (C18:3 Δ5,9,12), and sciadonic  (C20:3 Δ5,11,14). The fatty acids present in pine nut oil were selectively esterified with ethanol using Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei as a biocatalyst. The Δ5-olefinic acids were concentrated in the unesterified fatty  fraction. The optimum molar ratio of the substrates (fatty :ethanol), temperature, the enzyme loading, and the reaction time were 1:7, 25°C, 5% of total substrate , and 6 h, respectively. There was no significant effect in the concentration of Δ5-olefinic acids when water was added in the reaction mixture. The same protocol and optimum conditions were employed for two times repeated lipase-catalyzed esterifications. In first lipase-catalyzed esterification, the Δ5-olefinic acids content in the pine nut oil increased from 17 mol% to 51 mol% with a yield of 40 mol%. In a second lipase-catalyzed esterification, with the Δ5-olefinic acids-concentrated fatty acids obtained from the first reaction as the substrate, the Δ5-olefinic acids content increased to 86 mol% with a yield of 15 mol%. Finally, a maximum Δ5-olefinic acids content of ca. 96 mol% with a yield of 6 mol% was obtained via a third lipase-catalyzed esterification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28163995>An efficient multi-stage fermentation strategy for the production of microbial oil rich in  in .</a></h2><p>Fungal morphology and aeration play a significant role in the growth process of . The production of microbial oil rich in  (ARA) in  was enhanced by using a multi-stage fermentation strategy which combined fed-batch culture with precise control of aeration and agitation rates at proper times.The fermentation period was divided into four stages according to the cultivation characteristics of . The dissolved oxygen concentration was well suited for ARA biosynthesis. Moreover, the ultimate dry cell  (DCW), lipid, and ARA yields obtained using this strategy reached 41.4, 22.2, 13.5 g/L, respectively. The respective values represent 14.8, 25.8, and 7.8% improvements over traditional fed-batch fermentation processes.This strategy provides promising control insights for the mass production of ARA-rich oil on an industrial scale. Pellet-like fungal morphology was transformed into rice-shaped particles which were beneficial for oxygen transfer and thus highly suitable for biomass accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206907>A novel bioactive derivative of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) suppresses intestinal tumor development in ApcΔ14/+ mice.</a></h2><p>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds of polyps throughout the colon. Without prophylactic colectomy, most individuals with FAP develop colorectal cancer at an early age. Treatment with EPA in the free fatty  form (EPA-FFA) has been shown to reduce polyp burden in FAP patients. Since high-purity EPA-FFA is subject to rapid oxidation, a stable form of EPA compound has been developed in the form of magnesium l-lysinate bis-eicosapentaenoate (TP-252). We assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of TP-252 on intestinal tumor formation using ApcΔ14/+ mice and compared it with EPA-FFA. TP-252 was supplemented in a modified AIN-93G diet at 1, 2 or 4% and EPA-FFA at 2.5% by  and administered to mice for 11 weeks. We found that administration of TP-252 significantly reduced tumor number and size in the small intestine and colon in a dose-related manner and as effectively as EPA-FFA. To gain further insight into the cancer protection afforded to the colon, we performed a comprehensive lipidomic analysis of total fatty  composition and eicosanoid metabolites. Treatment with TP-252 significantly decreased the levels of  (AA) and increased EPA concentrations within the colonic mucosa. Furthermore, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis revealed that a subset of fatty acids, including EPA and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and their downstream metabolites, including PGE3 and 14-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic  (HDoHE), were strongly associated with antineoplastic activity. These results indicate that TP-252 warrants further clinical development as a potential strategy for delaying colectomy in adolescent FAP patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392754>Does intravenous fish oil affect the growth of extremely low birth  preterm infants on parenteral nutrition?</a></h2><p>Long chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) play a pivotal role during central nervous system development and the provision of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is recommended for the preterm infant. However, there are concerns that oral fish oil, which is a good source of DHA, may adversely affect growth of preterm infants, as it decreases  (ARA). It has been about ten years since fish oil was added to the fat blend of intravenous (IV) lipid emulsions (LE) but information on growth and other clinical outcomes of preterm infants is still scarce. We studied the effect of fish oil containing IV LE vs standard IV LE on growth in a large cohort of preterm infants who received routine parenteral nutrition (PN).We retrospectively reviewed growth data of 546 preterm infants with a birth  (BW) < 1250 g consecutively admitted to our NICU between Oct-2008 and Jun-2017 who received PN starting from the first day of life. Individual patients received only one of 5 commercially available IV LE. For the purpose of this study we grouped the patients who received the fish oil containing LE (IV-FO) and those who received conventional LE (CNTR). We compared PN and enteral nutrition (EN) intakes, and growth from birth to 36 weeks post-menstrual age (W PMA).Demographics, birth data and the incidence of the main complications of prematurity were similar between the two groups (IV-FO: n = 240, Gestational age (GA) 197 ± 16 d, BW 942 ± 181 g; CNTR: n = 237, GA 199 ± 17 d, BW 960 ± 197 g). No difference was found in PN and EN energy and macronutrient intakes from birth to 36W PMA, as well as in the proportion of human milk to infant milk formula.  gain from the regained BW to 36W PMA was slightly but significantly higher in IV-FO group: 17.3 ± 2.8 and 16.8 ± 2.7 g∙kg∙d, IV-FO and CNTR respectively (p = 0.03). There was no difference in length gain and head growth nor in  size at 36W PMA between the two groups.The use of IV fish oil did not negatively affect  gain in a cohort of preterm infants. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of IV fish oil on the complication of prematurity and on selected domains of infant development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Total lipid of hard clams  occupied 1.7 ± 0.2% of wet  and contained six classes: hydrocarbon and wax (HW), triacylglycerol (TAG), free fatty acids (FFA), sterol (ST), polar lipid (PoL), and monoalkyl diacylglycerol (MADAG). Among the constituents, the proportion of PoL accounted was highest, at 45.7%. In contrast, the figures for MADAG were lowest, at 1.3%. Twenty-six fatty acids were identified with the ratios of USAFA/SAFA was 2. The percentage of n-3 PUFA (ω-3) and n-6 PUFA (ω-6) was high, occupying 38.4% of total FA. Among PUFAs,  (AA, 20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) accounted for 3.8%, 7.8%, 2.2% and 12.0% of total lipid of the clam respectively. Phospholipid molecular species were identified in polar lipids of the clams consisting six types: phosphatidylethalnolamine (PE, with 28 molecular species), phosphatidylcholine (PC, with 26 molecular species), phosphatidylserine (PS, with 18 molecular species), phosphatidylinositol (PI, with 10 molecular species), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, with only one molecular species), and ceramide aminoethylphosphonate (CAEP, with 15 molecular species). This is the first time that the molecular species of sphingophospholipid were determined, in  in particular, and for clams in general. Phospholipid formula species of PE and PS were revealed to comprise two kinds: Alkenyl acyl glycerophosphoethanolamine and Alkenyl acyl glycerophosphoserine occupy 80.3% and 81.0% of total PE and PS species, respectively. In contrast, the percentage of diacyl glycero phosphatidylcholine was twice as high as that of PakCho in total PC, at 69.3, in comparison with 30.7%. In addition, phospholipid formula species of PI and PG comprised only diacyl glycoro phospholipids. PE 36:1 (p18:0/18:1), PC 38:6 (16:0/22:6), PS 38:1 (p18:0/20:1), PI 40:5 (20:1/20:4), PG 32:0 (16:0/16:0) and CAEP 34:2 (16:2/d18:0) were the major molecular species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800645>Analysis of endogenous lipids during intestinal wound healing.</a></h2><p>Intestinal wound healing is a new therapeutic goal for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as complete healing of the mucosa is the key element of clinical remission in IBD. Previous studies showed that termination of inflammation can be achieved by adding pro-resolving lipids like DHA and EPA exogenously. However, the roles of these lipids in mucosal healing have not been investigated. To recapitulate intestinal healing process, mice were received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in the drinking water followed by regular tap water for 5 additional days. DSS-induced intestinal inflammation featuring  loss, histological tissue damage, increased cytokine production and infiltration of inflammatory cells was gradually reduced upon switching to water. To investigate whether endogenous lipids play a role in mucosal healing, the lipidomics analysis of mouse serum was performed. Reduced levels of , the biosynthetic precursor of prostaglandin F (PGF)2α, 19H-PGF1α, the metabolite of prostacyclin, and 20H-PGF2α, the metabolite of PGF2α, suggest subsiding inflammation. In contrast, increased levels of an active metabolite of resolvin D1 along with decreased levels of its precursor DHA as well as decreased levels of the precursor of resolvin E, 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic , suggest inauguration of mucosal healing by endogenous lipids. Furthermore, exogenously supplied fish oil enhanced the process even further. These results suggest the presence of mucosal healing regulated by endogenous pro-healing lipids and also indicate that the remission state of IBD could be prolonged by enhancing the levels of these lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549917>Associations among FADS1 rs174547, eicosapentaenoic / ratio, and arterial stiffness in overweight subjects.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal interaction effects between the minor allele of FADS1 rs174547 and overweight on n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Plasma PUFA levels were measured via GC-MS, and arterial stiffness was determined as brachial-ankle PWV (ba-PWV) at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 3 years. The FADS1 rs174547 T > C genotype was analyzed. At 3-years of follow-up, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking and drinking, there were interaction effects between the FADS1 rs174547 T > C genotype and baseline BMI on the changes (from baseline) in plasma  (AA) levels, in the eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)/AA ratio, and in ba-PWV (p for interaction = 0.036, 0.022, and 0.001, respectively). There were smaller increases in AA levels from baseline among normal- C allele carriers (n = 112) and overweight TT subjects (n = 47) than among normal- TT subjects (n = 91). Overweight C allele carriers (n = 37) showed greater reductions in the plasma EPA/AA ratio and greater increases in ba-PWV than the 3 other populations studied. The minor allele of the FADS1 rs174547 polymorphism is associated with age-related decreases in the EPA/AA ratio and increases in ba-PWV among overweight subjects.Copyright © 2018.

In summer, compared with the dredged area including neither zoobenthos nor submerged macrophytes, the algal biomass and density were significantly lower in the area filled with the submerged macrophytes. Interestingly, the minimum algal bloom was observed in the combined area containing submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos, which was due to the synergistic interaction between the zoobenthos and the macrophytes. The metabolite extracts from the numerically dominant zoobenthos Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri had significant algal inhibitory effects of Microcystis aeruginosa, and displayed stimulatory effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and peroxidase activity of the prevalent submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus. 27 active compounds in the worm metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these compounds three chemicals , eicosapentaenoic , and linoleic  with concentrations of 13.92 ± 1.11, 10.57 ± 2.52, 2.75 ± 0.73 mg/kg dry , respectively, were confirmed as the typical allelochemicals with algal inhibition potential. In short, the metabolites allelopathy of L. hoffmeisteri can form and assist the synergistic effect between L. hoffmeisteri and P. malaianus on algal suppression. Thus, it is feasible to simultaneously restore submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos community in the disturbed eutrophic lakes for removing harmful algae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, it was shown that polyphenol-rich extract from rhizome of  (tormentil extract) affects the metabolism of  and exerts both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, suggesting a possible effect on thrombosis. Accordingly, the aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of tormentil extract on haemostasis in a rat model of thrombosis. Lyophilized water-methanol extract from  rhizome was administrated  for 14 days in doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg in a volume of 2 mL/kg in a 5% water solution of gummi arabici (VEH). In the  experiment an electrically induced carotid artery thrombosis model with blood flow monitoring was used in Wistar rats. Collected blood samples were analyzed  functionally and biochemically for changes in haemostasis. Tormentil extract (400 mg/kg) significantly decreased thrombus  and prolonged the time to carotid artery occlusion and bleeding time without changes in the blood pressure. In the  experiment tormentil extract (400 mg/kg) reduced thromboxane production and decreased t-PA activity, while total t-PA concentration, as well as total PAI-1 concentration and PAI-1 activity remained unchanged. Furthermore, tormentil extract (400 mg/kg) decreased bradykinin concentration and shortened the time to reach maximal optical density during fibrin generation. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, QUICK index, fibrinogen level, and collagen-induced aggregation remained unchanged. To investigate the involvement of platelets in the antithrombotic effect of tormentil, the extract was administrated  for 2 days to mice and irreversible platelets activation after ferric chloride induced thrombosis was evaluated under intravital conditions using confocal microscopy system. In this model tormentil extract (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced platelet activation at the same extent as acetylsalicylic . Taken together, we have shown for the first time that tormentil extract inhibits arterial thrombosis in platelet- and endothelial-dependent mechanisms without hemodynamic changes. Further studies on the detailed mechanism of action of tormentil extract toward fibrinolysis and the kinin system should be carried out.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345278>Effects of maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation on milk composition and offspring development.</a></h2><p>Before weaning, breast milk is the physiological form of neonatal nutrition, providing pups with all nutrient requirements. Maternal low-protein diet (LPD) during pregnancy and lactation induces adverse changes in key maternal organs, which have negative effects on pup development. We studied the effects of maternal LPD on liver , mammary gland (MG) cell differentiation, milk composition and production and pup development throughout lactation. We fed rats with control (C) or LPD (R) during pregnancy and lactation. At 7 d early, 14 d mid and 21 d late lactation stages, maternal biochemical parameters, , liver and MG  were analysed. MG cell differentiation was analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining; milk nutrient composition and production were studied; pup , liver and brain , hippocampal  (AA) and DHA were quantified. Results showed lower  and liver , minor MG cell differentiation and lower serum insulin and TAG in R compared with C. R milk contained less protein and higher AA at early and mid stages compared with C. R pup milk and fat intake were lower at all stages. R protein intake at early and mid stages and DHA intake at mid and late stages were lower compared with C. In R pups, lower , liver and brain  were associated with decreased hippocampal AA and DHA.

Obesity is directly linked to breathing problems and medical complications with lung, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma….In the present work, we aimed to investigate the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on lung lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, fatty  composition and proportions in lung and implication in asthma development. The likely protection provided by grape seed extract (GSSE) was also investigated.In order to assess HFD effect on lung and GSSE protection we used a rat model. We analyzed the lipid plasma profile, lung peroxidation and antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT and POD). We also analyzed transition metals (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and iron) and lung free fatty acids using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).HFD induced lipid profile imbalance increasing cholesterol and VLDL-C. HFD also induced an oxidative stress assessed by elevated MDA level and the drop of antioxidant activities such as SOD, CAT and POD. Moreover, HFD induced mineral disturbances by decreasing magnesium level and increasing Calcium and iron levels. HFD induced also disturbances in lung fatty  composition by increasing oleic, stearic and  acids. Interestingly, GSSE alleviated all these deleterious effects of HFD treatment.As a whole, GSSE had a significant preventive effect against HFD-induced obesity, and hence may be used as an anti-obesity agent, and a benefic agent with potential applications against damages in lung tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159211>Should Women Providing Milk to Their Preterm Infants Take Docosahexaenoic  Supplements?</a></h2><p>Based on the available data, a high milk docosahexaenoic  supply to very low-birth- infants and to extremely low-birth- infants at levels that support tissue accretion rates similar to the high rates of intrauterine deposition has the potential to enhance the early visual and cognitive development, and to reduce the occurrence of adverse events, such as severe developmental delay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and allergic manifestations in infancy and early childhood.

Exploratory analyses tested whether child sex, birth , and caregiver depressive symptomatology were moderators of the treatment effect.Omega Tots was a single-site 180-day randomized (1:1), double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Children (n = 377) were age 10 to 16 months at enrollment, born at less than 35 weeks' gestation, assigned to 180 days of daily 200 mg DHA + 200 mg AA supplementation or placebo (400 mg corn oil), and followed after the trial ended to age 26 to 32 months. Caregivers completed a sociodemographic profile and questionnaires about their depressive symptomatology (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and the child's sleep (Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire). Analyses compared changes in sleep between the DHA+AA and placebo groups, controlling for baseline scores. Exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted.Eighty-one percent (n = 156; n = 150) of children had 180-day trial outcome data; 68% (n = 134; n = 122) had postintervention outcome data. Differences in change between the DHA+AA and placebo groups after 180 days of supplementation were not statistically significant for the entire cohort.

The impaired dilator reactivity in OZR reflects a loss in venular nitric oxide and PGI bioavailability, associated with the chronic elevation in oxidant stress. Additionally, with the impaired dilator responses, a modest increase in adrenergic constriction combined with an elevated thromboxane A production may contribute to impaired functional dilator and hyperaemic responses at the venular level. For the shift in skeletal muscle venular function with development of the metabolic syndrome, issues such as aggregate microvascular perfusion resistance, mass transport and exchange within with capillary networks, and fluid handling across the microcirculation are compelling avenues for future investigation.While research into vascular outcomes of the metabolic syndrome has focused on arterial/arteriolar and capillary levels, investigation into venular function and how this impacts responses has received little attention. Using the in situ cremaster muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR; with lean Zucker rats (LZR) as controls), we determined indices of venular function. At ∼17 weeks of age, skeletal muscle post-capillary venular density was reduced by ∼20% in LZR vs. OZR, although there was no evidence of remodelling of the venular wall. Venular tone at ∼25 μm (post-capillary) and ∼75 μm (collecting) diameter was elevated in OZR vs. LZR. Venular dilatation to acetylcholine was blunted in OZR vs. LZR due to increased oxidant stress-based loss of nitric oxide bioavailability (post-capillary) and increased α - (and α -) mediated constrictor tone (collecting). Venular constrictor responses in OZR were comparable to LZR for most stimuli, although constriction to α -adrenoreceptor stimulation was elevated. In response to field stimulation of the cremaster muscle (0.5, 1, 3 Hz), venular dilator and hyperaemic responses to lower frequencies were blunted in OZR, but responses at 3 Hz were similar between strains. Venous production of TxA was higher in OZR than LZR and significantly higher than PGI production in either following  challenge. These results suggest that multi-faceted alterations to skeletal muscle venular function in OZR may contribute to alterations in upstream capillary pressure profiles and the transcapillary exchange of solutes and water under conditions of metabolic syndrome.© 2017 The Authors.

This study characterized the membrane distribution of α-tocopherol in brain regions and investigated the association between membrane α-tocopherol and PUFA content, as well as brain PUFA oxidation products. Nuclear, myelin, mitochondrial, and neuronal membranes were isolated using a density gradient from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CER), striatum (ST), and hippocampus (HC) of adult rhesus monkeys ( = 9), fed a stock diet containing vitamin E (α-, γ-tocopherol intake: ~0.7 µmol/kg /day, ~5 µmol/kg /day, respectively). α-tocopherol, PUFAs, and PUFA oxidation products were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-GC/MS) respectively. α-Tocopherol (ng/mg protein) was highest in nuclear membranes ( < 0.05) for all regions except HC. In PFC and ST,  (AA, µg/mg protein) had a similar membrane distribution to α-tocopherol. Total α-tocopherol concentrations were inversely associated with AA oxidation products (isoprostanes) ( < 0.05), but not docosahexaenoic  oxidation products (neuroprostanes). This study reports novel data on α-tocopherol accumulation in primate brain regions and membranes and provides evidence that α-tocopherol and AA are similarly distributed in PFC and ST membranes, which may reflect a protective effect of α-tocopherol against AA oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28353382>New-Generation Thromboelastography: Comprehensive Evaluation of Citrated and Heparinized Blood Sample Storage Effect on Clot-Forming Variables.</a></h2><p>- Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole blood, real-time analyzer measuring the viscoelastic properties of the hemostasis process and allowing for individualized goal-directed therapy. However, routine use of TEG requires validation of sample storage effect on clot parameters.- To establish the minimum time required for equilibration time and the maximum time for sample storage for all commercially available TEG tests for the new-generation TEG 6s and to determine how those times compare with the older generation TEG 5000.- Citrated and heparinized whole blood samples obtained from 20 healthy donors were analyzed for clot parameters at multiple time points for both the TEG 6s and the TEG 5000. Samples were activated with the citrated multichannel cartridge or the platelet-mapping cartridge in the TEG 6s or with recalcified kaolin in the TEG 5000.- All blood samples yielded TEG parameter results within reference ranges and had a tendency toward hypercoagulable profiles with increased storage time. Sample storage resulted in increased platelet inhibition with significant differences at 4 hours in the platelet-mapping cartridge ( percentage of inhibition, P = .002; adenosine diphosphate percentage of inhibition, P = .02).- For nonemergent cases or in a central laboratory setting, all tests provided reliable results for up to 4 hours in the citrated multichannel cartridge and for 3 hours for platelet function information in the platelet-mapping cartridge. In emergent/urgent situations in which the sample needs to be run immediately, RapidTEG and functional fibrinogen tests may be preferred.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505767>The Effect of Maternal Obesity on Breast Milk Fatty Acids and Its Association with Infant Growth and Cognition-The PREOBE Follow-Up.</a></h2><p>This study analyzed how maternal obesity affected fatty acids (FAs) in breast milk and their association with infant growth and cognition to raise awareness about the programming effect of maternal health and to promote a healthy prenatal . Mother-child pairs ( = 78) were grouped per maternal pre-pregnancy  mass index (BMI): normal- (BMI = 18.5-24.99), overweight (BMI = 25-29.99) and obese (BMI > 30). Colostrum and mature milk FAs were determined. Infant anthropometry at 6, 18 and 36 months of age and cognition at 18 were analyzed. Mature milk exhibited lower  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), among others, than colostrum. Breast milk of non-normal  mothers presented increased saturated FAs and n6:n3 ratio and decreased α-linolenic  (ALA), DHA and monounsaturated FAs. Infant BMI-for-age at 6 months of age was inversely associated with colostrum n6 (e.g., AA) and n3 (e.g., DHA) FAs and positively associated with n6:n3 ratio. Depending on the maternal , infant cognition was positively influenced by breast milk linoleic , n6 PUFAs, ALA, DHA and n3 LC-PUFAs, and negatively affected by n6:n3 ratio. In conclusion, this study shows that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI can influence breast milk FAs and infant growth and cognition, endorsing the importance of a healthy  in future generations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877283>Increased Serum Dihomo-γ-linolenic  Levels Are Associated with Obesity,  Fat Accumulation, and Insulin Resistance in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Objective To clarify the associations between serum omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and obesity-related metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) and  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and obesity-related parameters, including the  mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and  fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and  fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several obesity-related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with obesity,  fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258511>Association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Visceral fat accumulation in overweight status has been resulted in changes of fatty  profiles. The fatty acids profiles can be altered by fatty  desaturase; the activity of which is highly associated with obesity and other metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that fatty  composition, desaturase activity, and accumulation of visceral fat are interrelated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects with different amounts of visceral fat.Healthy overweight subjects (25.0 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m, n=232) were classified into lower (T1), middle (T2), and upper tertiles (T3) according to L4 visceral fat area (T1: <71.8 cm, T2: 71.8 cm-99.6 cm, T3: >99.6 cm).The T3 group showed higher amounts of cis-10-heptadecenoic  and activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase and lower activity of Δ5-desaturase than the T1 group. Additionally, the T3 group showed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, myristic , palmitic , stearic , monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , , n-3 PUFAs, and docosapentaenoic  than the T1 and T2 groups.This study indicates that greater than a certain area (>99.6 cm) of visceral fat is needed to observe altered levels of individual fatty  species and desaturase activities. The results suggest that increased activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase in parallel with decreased Δ5-desaturase activity may be a causative factor in disturbed fatty  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h2><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig  and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased , length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10),  and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty  metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457056>Anti-Arthritic Effect of Garcinol Enriched Fraction Against Adjuvant Induced Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Garcinia indica also known as kokum is used in traditional system of medicine for relieving inflammation and rheumatic pain. Garcinol, a benzophenone obtained from its fruit rind is reported to have anti-inflammatory effect via modulating  metabolism, suppressing iNOS expression, NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression. It has also been studied for antioxidant and anticancer activity. Apart from these, few patents claim that garcinol also has anti-obesity and hepatoprotective effect and has a potential to be used for the treatment of renal disorders, endometriosis and cardiac dysfunction.Garcinol Enriched Fraction (GEF) from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica should be effective in the treatment of arthritis, one of the chronic inflammatory disorder owing to its anti-inflammatory property as indicated by earlier experiments.GEF was prepared from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica and quantified using LC-MS/MS. It was found to contain 89.4% w/w of garcinol. GEF was evaluated at the dose of 10mg/kg for its efficacy against Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis in Wistar albino rats. Paw volumes of both sides were measured by Plethysmometer and  was recorded on 0, 1, 5, 12 and 21st day. The hyperalgesic response was also measured by motility test and stair climbing test.GEF showed a significant reduction in paw swelling (p < 0.0001) and arthritis index (p < 0.0001) exhibiting anti-inflammatory potential. It also improves the motility and stair climbing ability of experimental animals (p < 0.05), thus reducing hyperalgesia.Garcinol enriched fraction shows anti-arthritic activity in experimental animals.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30587920>Gamma linolenic  regulates PHD2 mediated hypoxia and mitochondrial apoptosis in DEN induced hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the known major health problems across the globe, and is sixth ranked among all cancer, due to its high mortality rate. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the formation of a cell membrane, along with the fluidity of the membrane and proteins. Gamma linolenic  (GLA) is member of the ω-6 family of PUFAs and converts into the  via a series of elongation and desaturation reactions. The aim of the current investigation was to scrutinize the effect of GLA on mitochondrial mediated apoptosis and anti-inflammatory pathway against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced HCC.Chemical carcinogenesis in Wistar rats was introduced by an intra-peritoneal dose of DEN (200 mg/kg). The rats received the various doses of GLA for 22 weeks. The progressions of serum biomarkers and histopathology components of hepatic tissue were used to access the prophylactic effects. The antioxidant parameters, cancer preventive agent status, and apoptosis mechanism were reviewed to scrutinize the possible mechanism.Dose-dependent treatment of GLA significantly (<-0.001) modulated the hepatic nodules, hepatic, , antioxidant, and non-hepatic parameters. Curiously, the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting showed the GLA altered reduced the hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammsatory pathways.On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the GLA exhibited a chemo-protective effect against DEN induced HCC that might be due to the altered hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory pathway, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920913>Variability of tissue factor-activated thromboelastography and whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry in healthy dogs.</a></h2><p>To assess interindividual (CV ) and intraindividual (CV ) variability over time for results of thromboelastography (TEG) and whole-blood impedance platelet aggregometry in healthy dogs.Six healthy Beagle dogs.Tissue factor (TF)-activated TEG and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and  (AA)-induced whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry were performed at 3 different time points (days 1, 4, and 6). In addition, platelet count, hematocrit, and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were recorded each study day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, one-stage prothrombin time, antithrombin activity, and D-dimer concentrations were measured on the first day of the study. For TEG, the variables reaction time (R), clotting time (K), rate of clot formation (α), and maximum amplitude (MA) were recorded. For platelet aggregometry, the areas under the curve for ADP (AUC )- and AA (AUC )-induced aggregation were measured. The CV was lower than the CV over time for MA, AUC , and AUC ; however, the CV was higher than the CV for the TEG variables R, K, and α. There were no statistical differences in the platelet count, hematocrit, and fibrinogen measurements over time.In healthy dogs, a subject-based reference interval for ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregometry and the TEG variable MA provide a more sensitive method to detect changes. However, due to the high CV , population-based reference intervals may be more appropriate for interpretation of the TEG variables R, K, and α.© Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29429366>The enhancement of serotonin-induced contraction of rat femoral artery is mediated by angiotensin II release from intact endothelium.</a></h2><p>We have performed an in vitro study on isolated intact or denuded femoral artery (FA) of healthy, diabetic, and/or rats submitted to the FA occlusion.

Further, the contribution of angiotensin II and cyclooxygenase products of  was investigated. A marker of ED, vWF was measured in animal serum. Serotonin induced contraction-dependent contraction of isolated FA, which was increased in preparations with endothelium. Pathological conditions such as endothelial denudation, nicotine-induced ED, diabetes or occlusion of FA reduced serotonin-induced contraction. Comparable reduction of serotonin-induced contraction was achieved after inhibition of AT1 receptors with losartan in isolated FA with intact endothelium. Our results demonstrate that angiotensin II contributes to the enhancement of serotonin-induced contraction of femoral arteries with intact endothelium. This increase is attenuated by endothelium removal, nicotine treatment, vascular occlusion, and/or hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621805>Comparison of the growth performance and long-chain PUFA biosynthetic ability of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared in different salinities.</a></h2><p>To compare the growth and biosynthetic ability of long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) (Oreochromis niloticus) in different water salinities, an 8-week feeding trial was conducted on the GIFT juveniles at 0, 12 and 24 ‰ (parts per thousand; ppt), respectively, with three isonitrogenous (32 %) and isolipidic (8 %) diets (D1-D3). Diet D1 with fish oils (rich in LC-PUFA) as lipid source was used as the control, while D2 and D3 with vegetable oil (free LC-PUFA) blends as lipid source contained different ratios of linoleic  (LA, 18 : 2n-6) and α-linolenic  (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) at 4·04 (D2) and 0·54 (D3), respectively. At the end of feeding trial, the growth performance of D2 and D3 groups under all salinity treatments was as good as that of D1 group, which indicates that the GIFT juveniles may convert dietary LA and ALA into LC-PUFA to meet the requirement of essential fatty acids for normal growth and physiology. When fed the same diets, GIFT at 12 ppt had a better growth performance coupled with a higher liver and muscle  content than those in freshwater. Furthermore, brackish water (24 ppt) significantly promoted the mRNA levels of elongase 5 of very long-chain fatty acids (elovl5) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα) in liver, when compared with freshwater. These results suggest that the GIFT may display better growth performance together with a relatively higher endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthetic ability under brackish water (12 and 24 ppt), probably through improving the expression of elovl5 and pparα in liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697730>Dietary supplementation of α-linolenic  induced conversion of n-3 LCPUFAs and reduced prostate cancer growth in a mouse model.</a></h2><p>α-linolenic  (ALA) is an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) and the substrate for long-chain n-3 PUFAs. The beneficial effects of ALA on chronic diseases are still in dispute, unlike those of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA).The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate the efficiency of ALA uptake from a vegetable oil source and its subsequent conversion to n-3 long-chain PUFAs (LCPUFAs) in the tissues of growing mice, and to investigate its protective role in a prostate cancer animal model. We carried out the investigation in prostate-specific Pten-knockout mice with specified low-ALA (L-ALA, 2.5%) and high-ALA (H-ALA, 7.5%) diets. Total fatty acids in blood, liver, epididymal fat pad, prostate were detected and prostate  were adjusted for  (mg/25 g).We found that dietary ALA triggered significant increases in ALA, EPA, docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and DHA levels and a significant decrease in  levels during the mice's growth stage. A dose-dependent effect was observed for ALA, EPA and DPA, but not DHA. Furthermore, the average prostate  in the L-ALA and H-ALA groups were lower than those in the control and n-6 groups, and similar to those in the EPA and n-3 groups.Our data suggest that dietary supplementation with ALA is an efficient means of improving n-3 LCPUFAs in vivo, and it has a biologically effective role to play in prostate cancer, similar to that of fish oils.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518347>Dietary genistein supplementation in laying broiler breeder hens alters the development and metabolism of offspring embryos as revealed by hepatic transcriptome analysis.</a></h2><p>Genistein (GEN) is a type of isoflavone mainly derived from soy products. In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, , and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty  () in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty  β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y.

We developed bio-flocculation and incubation methods for the marine alga,  CCMP1779, and the oleaginous fungus,  AG77, resulting in increased oil productivity.By growing separately and then combining the cells, the  mycelium could efficiently capture  due to an intricate cellular interaction between the two species leading to bio-flocculation. Use of a high-salt culture medium induced accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) and enhanced the contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including  and docosahexaenoic  in . To increase TAG productivity in the alga, we developed an effective, reduced nitrogen-supply regime based on ammonium in environmental photobioreactors. Under optimized conditions,  produced high levels of TAG that could be indirectly monitored by following chlorophyll content. Combining  and  to initiate bio-flocculation yielded high levels of TAG and total fatty acids, with ~ 15 and 22% of total dry  (DW), respectively, as well as high levels of PUFAs. Genetic engineering of  for higher TAG content in nutrient-replete medium was accomplished by overexpressing , a gene encoding the type II acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 5.

However, this high ARA yield is always achieved in conditions unfavourable for cell growth. In this study, we present a method for obtaining desirable ARA levels from  while simultaneously promoting cell growth using appropriate concentrations of the growth hormone 5-Aminolevulinic  (5-ALA).Both the biomass and the ARA content of  were enhanced by stimulation with 20 mg/L 5-ALA, leading to an optimal ARA yield of 170.32 mg/L-a 70.82% increase compared with control conditions. This ARA yield is the highest ever reported for microalgae. Based on variations in the fatty  composition, total lipids, total proteins, total carbohydrates and pigment content during the cultivation period, we propose that the accumulation of ARA stimulated by 5-ALA occurs at the expense of other UFAs and total proteins, which may be related to decreased zeaxanthin. Lipidomic analysis revealed that triacylglycerols (TAGs) accounted for 47.5 ± 3.6% of all detected lipids, followed by phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). As the levels of the most abundant TAGs increased under 5-ALA promotion and because 78.1 ± 3.4% (by ) of detected TAG-branched chains contained ARA, the increase of ARA was mainly caused by TAG accumulation.This work demonstrated a simple and effective strategy to promote both biomass and ARA yield in  by introducing a small amount of 5-ALA.

However, the overproduction of LC-PUFAs in microalgae has remained challenging. Here, we report a sequential metabolic engineering strategy that systematically overcomes the metabolic bottlenecks and overproduces LC-PUFAs. Malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, catalyzing the first committed step in type II fatty  synthesis, and desaturase 5b, involved in fatty  desaturation, were coordinately expressed in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Engineered microalgae hyper-accumulated LC-PUFAs, with  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) contents of up to 18.98 μg/mg and 9.15 μg/mg (dry ), respectively. Importantly, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) was accumulated up to a highest record of 85.35 μg/mg by metabolic engineering. ARA and EPA were accumulated mainly in triacylglycerides, whereas DHA was found exclusively in phospholipids.

Understanding the molecular pathways responsible for the development of neuropathic pain is essential to the development of novel rationally designed therapeutics. Although lipids make up to half of the dry  of the spinal cord, their relation with the development of neuropathic pain is poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the regulation of spinal lipids in response to neuropathic peripheral nerve injury in mice by utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry, which allows visualization of lipid distribution within the cord. We found that  (AA) containing [PC(diacyl-16:0/20:4)+K]+ was increased temporarily at superficial ipsilateral dorsal horn seven days after spared nerve injury (SNI). The spatiotemporal changes in lipid concentration resembled microglia activation as defined by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) immunohistochemistry. Suppression of microglial function through minocycline administration resulted in attenuation of hypersensitivity and reduces [PC(diacyl-16:0/20:4)+K]+ elevation in the spinal dorsal horn.

Newborn pups of D6D-KO male mice were separated from their dams within 48h and were fed artificial milk. Six formulations of milk were used: Control (Cont) milk (3.9% α-linolenic  and 18% linoleic ), + 1.3%  (ARA), + 1.2% docosahexaenoic  (DHA), + 1.3% eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), + 1.1% ARA + 1.3% DHA, and + 1.3% ARA + 1.3% EPA. After weaning, the mice were fed pelleted diets containing a similar fatty  composition as during lactation. Brain function was measured using a behavioral approach including motor activity and the Morris water maze test at 9 weeks of age. The  of the KO Cont group was significantly lower than that of the wild-type (WT) group; however, the ARA, ARA+DHA and ARA+EPA groups were similar to the WT group. In the Morris water maze test, the DHA and ARA+DHA groups demonstrated learning and memory performance similar to the WT group; however, the Cont group exhibited quite poor learning performance. Interestingly, the ARA, EPA and ARA+EPA groups showed intermediate performance between the Cont and WT groups. These results suggested that the 18-C essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic were not sufficient to support optimal growth and neural performance. ARA was the most critical long-chain PUFA for supporting  growth. In addition, DHA was clearly essential for brain function. Taken together, these results indicate that the combination of DHA and ARA is essential for optimal growth and development in early life.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

P. cruentum was cultivated in six different media conferring different conditions of nitrogen (N) sufficiency/deprivation and phosphorous (P) sufficiency/limitation/deprivation. Over a 16-day cultivation process, the dry- content, proportion of total fatty acids (TFAs), and the concentration in the medium of linoleic  (LA) were greatly improved by a maximum of 2.5-, 1.6-, and 1.1-fold, respectively, under conditions of N or P deprivation compared with N and P sufficiency. In contrast, levels of EPA or ARA were not enhanced under N or P stress conditions. Additionally, the results showed that N deprivation weakened the impact of P deficiency on the content and proportions of LA and EPA, while P deprivation enhanced the impact of N starvation on the content and proportions of LA and EPA. The conditions of N sufficiency and P deprivation (N+P-) were the optimal conditions for the production of LA, while the optimal conditions for EPA, ARA, and TFAs production were N sufficiency and P limitation (N+P-lim).
