However, the mechanical properties of the generated fibers are still lacking. Therefore, we are presenting in this work a promising improvement in the elasticity properties of PVDF nanofibrous membrane through thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) additives. Morphological, physical, and mechanical analyses were performed for membranes developed from different blend ratios. Then, the impact of added  ratio of TPU on the piezoelectric response of the formed nanofibrous composite membranes was studied. The piezoelectric characteristics were studied through impulse loading testing where the electric voltage had been detected under applied mass . Piezoelectric characteristics were investigated further through a pressure mode test the developed nanofibrous composite membranes were found to be mechanically deformed under applied electric potential. This work introduces promising high elastic piezoelectric materials that can be used in a wide variety of applications including energy harvesting, wearable electronics, self-cleaning filters, and motion/vibration sensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659696>When global and local molecular descriptors are more than the sum of its parts: Simple, But Not Simpler?</a></h2><p>In this report, we introduce a set of aggregation operators (AOs) to calculate global and local (group and atom type) molecular descriptors (MDs) as a generalization of the classical approach of molecular encoding using the sum of the atomic (or fragment) contributions. These AOs are implemented in a new and free software denominated MD-LOVIs ( http://tomocomd.com/md-lovis ), which allows for the calculation of MDs from atomic  vector and LOVIs (local vertex invariants). This software was developed in Java programming language and employed the Chemical Development Kit (CDK) library for handling chemical structures and the calculation of atomic . An analysis of the complexities of the algorithms presented herein demonstrates that these aspects were efficiently implemented. The calculation speed experiments show that the MD-LOVIs software has satisfactory behavior when compared to software such as Padel, CDKDescriptor, DRAGON and Bluecal software. Shannon's entropy (SE)-based variability studies demonstrate that MD-LOVIs yields indices with greater information content when compared to those of popular academic and commercial software. A principal component analysis reveals that our approach captures chemical information orthogonal to that codified by the DRAGON, Padel and Mold2 software, as a result of the several generalizations in MD-LOVIs not used in other programs. Lastly, three QSARs were built using multiple linear regression with genetic algorithms, and the statistical parameters of these models demonstrate that the MD-LOVIs indices obtained with AOs yield better performance than those obtained when the summation operator is used exclusively. Moreover, it is also revealed that the MD-LOVIs indices yield models with comparable to superior performance when compared to other QSAR methodologies reported in the literature, despite their simplicity. The studies performed herein collectively demonstrated that MD-LOVIs software generates indices as simple as possible, but not simpler and that use of AOs enhances the diversity of the chemical information codified, which consequently improves the performance of traditional MDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656943>Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Hemophilia or von Willebrand Disease.</a></h2><p>  Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is complex in patients with bleeding disorders. Catheter ablation such as pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been suggested in cases with bleeding disorders. However, data on safety are missing. This report describes the outcome of PVI in patients with bleeding disorders.   A retrospective study in our hemophilia treatment center of patients who underwent a PVI in 2014 to 2018. PVI was done according to local protocol. Clotting factor was given periprocedural. Postprocedural anticoagulation was given for at least 4 weeks, with clotting factor suppletion if needed to maintain factor VIII (FVIII) levels >0.20 IU/mL.   Five patients with hemophilia and one with von Willebrand disease were included. Eight PVIs were performed. Target FVIII levels (>0.80 IU/mL) were met before the procedure. Postprocedural anticoagulation was given: vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dabigatran. All patients obtained long-term sinus rhythm, in two patients after a second PVI. However, late recurrent AF occurred in one patient after 42 months. A notable incidence of groin bleeds was observed: two of eight interventions (25%) compared with 0.9% in the general population. Bleeding seemed to be related to agitation, early mobilization, and bridging of VKA with low molecular  heparin (LMWH). No relevant bleeding was observed when on DOAC therapy.   PVI seems to be effective in the case of bleeding disorders. To reduce the groin bleeds agitation and early mobilization should be avoided and DOAC is preferred over bridging VKA with LMWH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657491>Nonosmotic secretion of ADH and salt loss in hyponatremia in Kawasaki disease.</a></h2><p>The precise mechanism of hyponatremia in Kawasaki disease (KD) remains elusive because assessment of volume status based on serial changes in  is lacking.Seventeen patients who were diagnosed with KD and hyponatremia (serum sodium levels < 135 mmol/L) were analyzed. Volume status was assessed based on serial changes in . Plasma arginine vasopressin (ADH), urine electrolytes, and serum cytokine levels were measured at diagnosis of hyponatremia. An increase and decrease in  by >3% was defined as hypervolemia and hypovolemia, respectively.The volume status was hypervolemic in 3 (18%), euvolemic in 14 (82%), and hypovolemic in no (0%) patient. Five (29%) and no (0%) patients were diagnosed with SIADH and hypotonic dehydration, respectively. The contribution of decreased total exchangeable cations (salt loss) to hyponatremia (5.9% [interquartile range, 4.3%, 6.7%]) was significantly larger than that of increased total  water (-0.7% [-1.8%, 3.1%]) (p = 0.004). Serum interleukin-6 levels were elevated in all of 9 patients who were evaluated. Among 12 (71%) patients who did not meet the criteria of SIADH and hypotonic dehydration, plasma ADH levels were inappropriately high in 10 patients. These patients were also characterized by euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia and salt loss, which might be compatible with a diagnosis of SIADH.Our study shows that hyponatremia in KD is euvolemic or hypervolemic and is associated with nonosmotic secretion of ADH and salt loss in the majority of patients.© 2019 Japan Pediatric Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656980>Investigative Analysis of Lanthanum Oxide Nanoparticles on Elements in Bone of Wistar Rats After 30 Days of Repeated Oral Administration.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (LaONPs) in the femur bone of rats after 30 days of oral administration was explored. Also, the influence of LaONPs on macro and trace elements in the rats' femur bone was assessed. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry (ICP OES) were used for total element determination in the bone after decomposition while laser ablation-ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) was used to investigate element distribution (bio-imaging) in the bone. Some differences in element concentrations in the bone between the rats treated with LaONPs at 1.0 mg kg (T1), 10.0 mg kg (T2), and 100 mg kg (T3)  (bw) and the control rats (CTR) were observed. More differences were observed in the bone of rat treated with 10.0 mg kg LaONPs bw. However, the highest change observed was for Mg, which concentration ranged from 5230 ± 12 μg kg for the CTR group to 4130 ± 138 μg kg for the T3 group. Minor changes were observed for Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Na, Pb, Sr, and Zn between CTR and animals treated with LaONPs at the different levels of concentration. It was possible to observe from LA-ICP-MS analysis that LaONPs were accumulated only on the surface of the bone, not deeper than about 5 μm. LA-ICP-MS allowed also to investigate the distribution of La and the other elements in a cross section of the femur bone head, where higher amounts of the elements are present at the external part of the bone. Therefore, it was demonstrated that LaONPs are incorporated on the surface of the bone and it has a small influence on some of the other elements evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656002>Antimicrobial Activity of Supernatant of Lactobacillus plantarum against Pathogenic Microorganisms.</a></h2><p>We studied ntimicrobial activity of L. plantarum strain against different pathogens: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus. It was shown that supernatant of 48-h L. plantarum culture in liquid nutrient medium exhibits inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms. Supernatant of 24-h culture exhibited lower activity, while supernatant of 72-h culture produced no inhibitory effect. Boiling and proteinase K treatment did not affect activity of the preparation, i.e. antimicrobial activity of the supernatant was not associated with protein or peptide component. These data were confirmed by the results observed after ultrafiltration of the preparation: the growth of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus was inhibited by the low-molecular- fraction, but not high-molecular- fraction of the supernatant. On the other hand, the high-molecular- fraction suppressed the growth of streptococcus by 3 times. We hypothesized that L. plantarum supernatant obtained in our experiments contained at least two antimicrobial components with different molecular .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656995>Epoxidation is the preferred pathway of first-stage metabolism of abiraterone acetate in brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus).</a></h2><p>Twenty juvenile individuals of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), average  77 g, were fed by abiraterone acetate prodrug dissolved in olive oil via gastric probe. Dose applied was 3 mg/10 g fish . After feeding, they were let out into aquarium and kept there for 3 days. Aquarium water containing excreted metabolites was extracted, and sample was purified and finally analyzed by means of HPLC/MS. Expected both primary (products of hydroxylation) and secondary (products of glucuronidation and sulfatation) metabolites of abiraterone acetate were identified. The NMR measurement of one of the prevailing metabolites presumed to be one of possible hydroxy-abiraterones discovered that it is not hydroxy-abiraterone but abiraterone 16,17-epoxide. Closer analysis of MS and MS spectra revealed that one of presumed hydroxy-abiraterone acetates and also some secondary metabolites are probably 16,17-epoxides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657335>[Changes in coagulation of sepsis rats with protein-malnutrition or energy-malnutrition].</a></h2><p>To investigate the changes in coagulation of sepsis rats with protein-malnutrition or energy-malnutrition.108 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three groups by random number table, with 36 rats in each group. The rats in normal feeding group were given a free diet (27 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder), and the rats in protein-malnutrition group were given a low protein diet (27 g/d, containing 5% protein fodder). The rats in energy-malnutrition group were given a low energy diet (9 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder). After 4 weeks of continuous feeding, 8 rats from each group were sacrificed for malnutrition evaluation. The  of , thymus and spleen were measured. The percentages of spleen T lymphocyte subsets and M1 macrophage were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining 28 rats in each group were collected for cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to reproduce the sepsis model, 20 rats of which were used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the other 8 rats were sacrificed at 8 hours after CLP. The levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by ELISA, and the percentage of spleen M1 macrophages was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in liver tissue were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 and IL-6 in rats after CLP.(1) After 4 weeks of feeding, the rats in the normal feeding group and protein-malnutrition group gained , while those in the energy-malnutrition group lost 25% of their initial . The  of , thymus and spleen in the protein-malnutrition group and the energy-malnutrition group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding group. Compared with the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group, the percentages of spleen CD3T lymphocytes, CD4T lymphocytes, M1 macrophages and plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the energy-malnutrition group [CD3T lymphocytes percentage: (52.1±3.7)% vs. (46.9±3.9)%, (44.5±2.2)%; CD4T lymphocyte percentages: (35.0±3.6)% vs. (26.3±2.2)%, (25.1±2.3)%; M1 macrophage percentages: (8.7±2.0)% vs. (3.2±1.3)%, (4.2±1.1)%; IL-6 (ng/L): 129.4±16.2 vs. 48.1±10.0, 53.0±8.3, all P < 0.05]. (2) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 7 days after CLP showed: all rats in the energy-malnutrition group died, and the 7-day cumulative survival rate was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group [0% (0/20) vs. 35% (7/20), 55% (11/20), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of the normal feeding group was 65%, which was consistent with moderate CLP mortality, indicating that the CLP model was successfully prepared. After CLP, the plasma IL-6 level in the protein-malnutrition group was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group [IL-6 (ng/L): 154.6±34.7 vs. 233.4±41.2, P < 0.05]. Compared with the normal feeding group, the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in liver and plasma IL-6 levels in the energy-malnutrition group were significantly increased [TF mRNA (2): 4.5±2.2 vs. 1.1±0.7, PAI-1 mRNA (2): 3.3±1.8 vs. 1.3±0.9, IL-6 (ng/L): 382.7±118.2 vs. 233.4±41.2, all P < 0.05], the percentage of M1 macrophages in spleen was significantly lowered [(8.9±2.4)% vs. (15.2±5.4)%, P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in plasma IL-10 level among all the groups. Correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in the liver of rats after CLP were positively correlated with plasma IL-6 level (r = 0.644, r = 0.574, both P < 0.01).Long-term sustained stress (starvation) leads to sustained chronic inflammatory state, and stimulated the release of related inflammatory factors and activation of the coagulation system after infection. And the inflammatory factors in sepsis rats without sustained stress protein malnutrition were significantly reduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661334>A narrative review of adjuvants in  fertilisation: evidence for good clinical practice.</a></h2><p>A review of studies published between January 1, 1984 and January 31, 2019 was performed with the aim of analysing the efficacy and adverse effects of commonly used adjuvants to in vitro fertilisation. The authors preferentially selected recent systematic reviews and randomised control trials (where available) from an electronic literature search. The review showed that low molecular  heparin, corticosteroids and embryo glue may be of use in selected patient groups. Other adjuncts (such as growth hormone, assisted hatching, endometrial disruption and dehydroepiandrosterone) cannot currently be recommended as collated results showed no overall benefit to clinical pregnancy rates or live birth rates. There is a significant lack of robust evidence in this field, and areas in particular need of further research have been highlighted. In conclusion, caution should be exercised in prescribing adjuvants in in vitro fertilisation, either individually or in combination as further research is needed to ascertain their efficacy. Many adjuvants carry the risk of adverse effects which should also be considered. Patients should be clearly informed of the evidence, and where it is lacking, for these treatments. There is a need for further good quality trials to address the questions regarding best practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659708>Glycyrrhizic acid modulates the atrazine-induced apoptosis in rabbit spleen.</a></h2><p>Atrazine (ATR) is a common herbicide used worldwide. It is a potent endocrine disruptor that causes hormonal imbalance. We investigated the modulatory role predisposed by glycyrrhizic acid (GA) against the hazardous effects caused by the ATR in the rabbit spleen. Sixty rabbits were assigned into 4 groups. The first group is the negative control; the ATR group received 1/10 of the oral LD  ATR; the GA group received 50 mg/kg  daily intraproteinally; and group 4 received both ATR and GA concurrently. ATR and GA administrations were done for 60 days. ATR-induced humoral immunotoxicity was illustrated by decreased serum total protein, albumin, and globulin levels and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus antibody titer, 4 weeks after vaccination. Moreover, upregulation of spleen Fas and caspase-III genes was recorded in ATR-exposed rabbits. Clear splenocyte apoptosis was observed in the immunohistochemical examination by the caspase-III technique. GA diminished the ATR-induced splenocyte apoptosis through downregulation of Fas and caspase-III expressions. In conclusion, our findings bounced a new perspective into the mechanism by which ATR induces immunotoxicity and assumed the potential modulatory role of GA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655873>Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs) in Soil of the Pearl River Delta, China: Spatial Distribution, Sources, and Ecological Risk Assessment.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the levels, spatial distribution, sources, and ecological risks of 16 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in 68 surface soil samples (0-20 cm) from 7 cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. Sixteen target PFCs, including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C-C, C, and C) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs, C, C, C, and C), were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-negative electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). Concentrations of total PFCs (∑PFCs) ranged from 2.19 to 98.5 μg kg (dry , dw), with an average of 5.97 μg kg dw. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFC, accounting for 23.9% of ∑PFCs. The highest ∑PFCs was found in the soil sample collected from Dongguan with a large number of manufacturing industries. There were no significant differences of ∑PFCs among unban, industrial, and agricultural soils, indicating similar pollution sources in soil of the PRD. More than 70% of ∑PFCs in soil of the PRD could be attributed to the four principal components, represented by PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA). Ecological risk assessment indicated that PFOA had low risk to soil plants and animals. However, the risk of PFOS to soil plants was relatively high in some studied regions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655497>Analysis of luteinizing hormone (LH): Validation of a commercial ELISA kit for LH analysis and quantification in doping control samples.</a></h2><p>Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a dimeric glycoprotein produced and secreted by the pituitary gland, with a molecular  of approximately 30 000 Da. The main clinical use for exogenous LH-administration is typically linked to the treatment of infertility, in both men and women. The desired effect of LH misuse in sport is due to the enhancement of testicular production of testosterone. Elevated LH levels may also indicate the usage of gonadotropin-releasing factors or estrogen blockers. Therefore, LH is listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a prohibited substance in male athletes, and according to the WADA technical document, laboratories should determine the the total LH concentrations in urine. The TD lists two different assays that are suitable for measuring total LH in urine, Delfia and Siemens Immulite. Other fit-for-purpose assays can be used, as long as they are capable of detecting total LH in urine. In case an assay not listed in the TD will be used, population-based reference values have to be determined in the validation procedure. In this study a new immunoassay was validated for the measurement of LH in urine. The assay (AccuBind ELISA Microwells, Luteinizing Hormone, Monobind Inc.), originally intended for serum, showed adequate sensitivity and was proven fit-for-purpose in routine doping control. Population-based distribution of the assay was in good agreement with the results of Delfia and Immulite assays, for which the method-specific cut-off-values are 40 IU/L (Delfia) and 60 IU/L (Siemens Immulite).This article is protected by copyright.

Major facilitator superfamily domain 3 (MFSD3) is a family of membrane-bound solute carriers whose expression has been recently associated with nutrient intake and adipose tissue homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate a possible association between MFSD3 preoperative methylation pattern and  regain after bariatric surgery.This is a longitudinal study comprising 24 obese ( mass index > 35 m/kg) women submitted to gastric bypass. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated at preoperative time and 1, 2, and 3 y after surgery, and then  regain was calculated. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was bisulfite modified by specific kits, according manufacturer's instructions. Methylation analysis was performed with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K bead chip technology, and methylation level was expressed as a β value ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Shapiro-Wilk, repeated-means analysis of variance, Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney, and independent t tests were used in statistical analysis (P < 0.05).A total of 25% of patients regained significant .  regain after bariatric surgery was positively correlated with cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation levels (r = 0.6804, P = 0.0126). Moreover, cg00010266 MFSD3 baseline methylation levels were significantly higher in regainer patients than non-regainers (6.2 ± 1.5 versus 3.9 ± 1.2%, P = 0.026). Patients allocated in the higher cg00010266 MFSD3 preoperative methylation group had higher  regain (4.1 ± 1.8 versus 6.7 ± 2.2 kg, P = 0.037).Preoperative hypermethylation of MFSD3 gene is significantly associated with  regain and a worse response to gastric bypass.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We assessed resolution of NAFLD in a general population cohort of urban Sri Lankans adults.Participants were selected by age-stratified random sampling from electoral lists. They were initially screened in 2007 and re-evaluated in 2014. On both occasions structured interview, anthropometric-measurements, liver ultrasonography, and biochemical/serological tests were performed. NAFLD was diagnosed on ultrasound criteria for fatty liver, safe-alcohol consumption (<14-units/week for men, <7-units/week for women) and absence of hepatitis B/C markers. Non-NAFLD was diagnosed on absence of any ultrasound criteria for fatty liver and safe-alcohol consumption. Resolution of NAFLD was defined as absence of ultrasound criteria for fatty liver. Changes in anthropometric indices [, -Mass-Index (BMI), waist-circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR)], clinical [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] and biochemical measurements [Triglycerides (TG), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Total Cholesterol (TC), HbA1c%] at baseline and follow-up were compared.Of the 2985 original study participants, 2148 (71.9%) attended follow-up after 7 years.

The traditional treatment of pneumothorax is chest drain placement. Recently, modified pigtail catheter has been proposed as a less traumatic approach despite limited experience in infants. To compare the effectiveness and safety of pigtail catheters versus traditional straight chest drains in term and preterm infants with pneumothorax, in two tertiary neonatal units: Policlinico Hospital in Bari, IT and John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 47 newborns with pneumothorax admitted to the two units between October 2009 and June 2017, and treated with either pigtail catheters or straight chest drains. Three newborns (6.7%) were excluded from the study because they were treated with both types of drains. The remaining 44 neonates were included in the analysis. Overall, 56.8% (n = 25/44) of pneumothoraces were drained with pigtail catheters and 43.2% (n = 19/44) with straight drains. No differences in gestational age and birth  were found. The success rate, defined as complete radiological resolution of the pneumothorax after drainage, was significantly higher in the pigtail group (96.0% versus 73.7%; p < 0.05). Days of drainage, length of hospital stay and duration of respiratory support were not significantly different. Subcutaneous emphysema and drain dislodgement/malfunction occurred only in the straight drain group (0.0% versus 11.1%; p = 0.181). No significant differences in mortality between the two groups were found (28.0% pigtail group versus 26.3% straight drain group; p > 0.05).Conclusion: Pigtail catheters are a safe and effective alternative to traditional chest drains for infants with pneumothorax. What is Known: • Air leaks in newborns can represent an emergency, especially among preterms; • The first treatment in a life-threatening pneumothorax is thoracentesis with needle aspiration or placement of a chest drain. What is New: • Pigtail catheter have been described as an alternative to traditional chest drains; • Pigtail catheters are a safe and effective alternative to traditional chest drains for infants with pneumothorax.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660821>Development of the modified Occimum gratissimum seeds for orally disintegrating tablets.</a></h2><p>Natural materials have been encouraged in controlled drug release and improved drug bioavailability.This study aimed to develop a modification process for the use of a natural material, Occimum gratissimum seeds (OGS), in orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs).The OGS was investigated with four different modification processes including only milling, swelling, swelling/milling, and swelling/milling/incubation. The ODTs containing the modified OGS as a disintegrant were prepared by the wet granulation method. Furthermore, an evaluation to assess parameters of tablets such as  variation, hardness, friability, wetting time, disintegration time, drug content, dissolution studies was performed.The modification of OGS using the swelling/ milling process resulted in a completion of OGS modification, leading to an ideal wetting time, disintegrating time and dissolution rate. The OGS concentrations also affected the wetting and disintegrating time with the optimal range of ODTs from 15% to 20%. On the other hand, the modification with the incubation processes varied by temperature and time increased the wetting time and disintegrating time.The modified OGS demonstrated that it is a potential material with the advantages of cost-effectiveness, non-toxicity and easy manufacture in the preparation of ODTs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660941>CoQ10 ameliorates monosodium glutamate-induced alteration in detrusor activity and responsiveness in rats via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and channel inhibiting mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Competent detrusor muscles with coordinated contraction and relaxation are crucial for normal urinary bladder storage and emptying functions. Hence, detrusor instability, and subsequently bladder overactivity, may lead to undesirable outcomes including incontinence. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity including inflammation and oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the possibility that CoQ10 may have a potential therapeutic role in detrusor overactivity.Forty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 100-150 g were used in the present study. Rats were divided (10/group) into control (receiving vehicles), monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated (receiving 5 mg/kg MSG daily for 15 consecutive days), MSG + OO-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and olive oil for 15 consecutive days), MSG + CoQ10-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and 100 mg/kg CoQ10 daily for 15 consecutive days) groups.MSG resulted in significant increase in bladder  and sensitised the bladder smooth muscles to acetylcholine. MSG has also resulted in significant increase in bladder TNF-α, IL-6, malondialdehyde, nerve growth factor and connexion 43, with significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase.

Survival within host phagocytic cells is one mechanism by which S. aureus evades antibiotic treatment. A novel THIOMAB™ antibody-antibiotic conjugate (TAC) strategy was developed to kill S. aureus intracellularly and mitigate the spread of infection. In this report, we used a longitudinal whole- bioluminescence imaging method to study the antibacterial dynamics of TAC alone or in combination with vancomycin in a mouse infection model. Injections of stably luminescent S. aureus bacteria into mice resulted in exponential increases in whole  bioluminescence with a reduction in  and survival rate. Vancomycin, a standard-of-care antibiotic, suppressed bacterial growth in mice. However, bacterial growth rebounded in these animals once treatment was discontinued. In contrast, single dose of TAC showed rapid reduction of bioluminescence intensity, which persisted for up to 19 days. The combination of TAC and vancomycin achieved a more sustained and significantly greater reduction of bioluminescence compared with vancomycin alone. In summary, the present study showed an imaging method to longitudinally assess antibacterial drug dynamics in mice and demonstrated that TAC monotherapy or in combination with vancomycin had superior and sustained activity compared to vancomycin alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661531>Transcript profile of skeletal muscle lipid metabolism genes affected by diet in a piglet model of low birth .</a></h2><p>Dysregulated skeletal muscle metabolism (DSMM) is associated with increased inter- and intramuscular fat deposition in low birth  (L) individuals. The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth . To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid metabolism in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth  (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth , diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth  groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth  groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth  groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid metabolism associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth . Whilst, many of the adaptions to diet and age appear to be similar in birth  groups, the magnitude of response and individual changes underpin the previously observed lower fat oxidation in L pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656174>Later achievement of infant motor milestones is related to lower levels of physical activity during childhood: the GECKO Drenthe cohort.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to investigate whether age of infant motor milestone achievement is related to levels of physical activity (PA),  status and blood pressure at age 4-7 years of age.In the Dutch GECKO (Groningen Expert Center of Kids with Obesity) Drenthe cohort, the age of achieving the motor milestone 'walking without support' was reported by parents.  status and blood pressure were assessed by trained health nurses and PA was measured using the Actigraph GT3X between age 4 and 7 years.Adjusted for children's age, sex and the mother's education level, infants who achieved walking without support at a later age, spent more time in sedentary behaviour during childhood and less time in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Later motor milestones achievement was not related to higher BMI Z-score, waist circumference Z-score, diastolic or systolic blood pressure.The results of this study indicate that a later age of achieving motor milestone within the normal range have a weak relation to lower PA levels at later age. It is not likely that this will have consequences for  status or blood pressure at 4-7 years of age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659243>Continuous feeding versus intermittent bolus feeding for premature infants with low birth : a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Clinical risks and advantages of both continuous feeding and intermittent feeding for preterm infants have been presented in previous studies. To determine the most appropriate feeding method for low-birth- infants, a meta-analysis was conducted.Articles related to this topic were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database from the onset to May 2019. Heterogeneity analysis was performed with Chi-square and I test. Pooled analysis was based on fixed effects model, if heterogeneity between the eligible studies was negligible (I < 50%, P > 0.05). In contrast, a random effects model was carried out. The quality of including studies were evaluated by Cochrane assessment tool.A total of 1030 articles identified. Altogether, eight articles including 707 infants were included in final analysis based on eligibility criteria. In continuous feeding infants, time to achieving full feeds was longer ( mean difference 0.98 (95% CI 0.26-1.71, P = 0.008) days) compared with intermittent feeding infants. Pooled analysis indicated there were no significant difference in other variables such as feeding intolerance, duration of hospitalization, days to regain birth , days to first successful oral feeding, duration of parenteral feeding,  growth, length increment, head circumference growth, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, and probable necrotizing enterocolitis. In subgroup analysis for birth  (<1000 g and >1000 g), we did not identify significant difference in time to full feeds, time to regain birth , and duration of hospitalization.Intermittent feeding may be more beneficial for low-birth  infants, However, well-designed studies and evidenced-based clinical practice are required to determine the most appropriate feeding method for premature infants with low birth .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659860>Standard medical nutrition therapy of 25kcal/kg ideal /day often does not reach even resting energy expenditure in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In Japan, an ideal  (IBW) calculated by 22 × height (m) has commonly been used in the planning of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). However, there have been concerns regarding calorie deficits in fulfilling resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing MNT as defined by 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.To measure REE in patients with type 2 diabetes and verify the validity of MNT with 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age was 65.9 ± 7.3 years,  65.0 ± 11.3 kg,  mass index 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m ). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.Mean REE was 1601.0 ± 253.1 kcal/day. Assuming that all patients strictly observed daily energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW/day, 41 of 52 patients (78.9%) did not reach their REE. The greater the , the greater the difference between assumed energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW and REE.We call attention to the potential risk of total dietary energy intake set to 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated  gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655518>Abdominal girth has a strong correlation with actual and ultrasound estimated epidural depth.</a></h2><p>To assess the correlation between the actual epidural depth (ND), ultrasound estimated epidural depth in the paramedian sagittal oblique plane (ED/PSO) and transverse median plane (ED/TM) with the abdominal girth (AG),  mass index (BMI), and  of the patients.One hundred and thirty patients of either sex scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernia repair were enrolled.

One hundred and eighty (180) fingerlings with ten fish per tank having an average  of 9.8 ± 0.5 g were randomly distributed within six treatments in triplicates following a completely randomised design. The amylase and lipase activities in the whole intestine did not vary significantly (P > 0.05), but protease activity varied significantly with respect to DORB level in the diet. At higher (53 and 58%) inclusion level of DORB, the protease activities were lower. T33, T38 and T43 groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity compared to the other groups, whereas lowest activity was recorded in the group fed with highest inclusion level (58%). The oxidative stress enzyme like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione-S-transferase exhibited significantly higher activities in liver of T58 group of L. rohita. However, the activity of catalase and SOD showed no significant variation in gill tissue. The haematological parameter values such as red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) were lower in the highest DORB fed group (T58) as compared to their lower DORB inclusion counterparts. No change in NBT value was recorded irrespective of DORB inclusion level in the diet. Hence, from these results, it can be concluded that the dietary inclusion of DORB up to 43% in the diet of L. rohita at 26% crude protein and 7% lipid level is best for the optimal activity of digestive, metabolic and haematological parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659691>Identification of a Huperzine A-producing endophytic fungus from Phlegmariurus taxifolius.</a></h2><p>Highly prized huperzine A (Hup A), a natural alkaloid formerly isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Huperzia serrata, has been widely used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, inspiring us to search for endophytic fungi that produce this compound.

In turn, dietary fatty acids can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial : 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in liver caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the fatty acid content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of complications after a total hip arthroplasty such as poor wound healing, periprosthetic joint infection, instability, and aseptic loosening.This paper presents an in-vitro study on composite femoral models to investigate the impact of different  loading conditions on the mechanical environment of the hip joint endoprosthesis considering normal- and overweight individuals from 70 to 110 kg. The micro strains on the femur during single-leg stance of gait were measured on critical stress points based on the Gruen femoral zones.The micro strains increase as the  increases implying that the displacement in the hip joint endoprosthesis is higher for overweight subjects enhancing the risk of failure. The highest increase was measured in Gruen zone 1 by 5.60% indicating that the great trochanter is subjected to higher stress shielding with increasing the .

While the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is well recognized for its peripheral effects on reproductive behavior, release of OXT from somatodendrites and axonal terminals within the central nervous system (CNS) is also implicated in the control of control of energy balance. In this review we summarize historical data highlighting the effects of exogenous OXT as a short-term regulator of food intake in a context specific manner and the receptor populations that may mediate these effects. We also describe what is known about the physiological role of endogenous OXT in the control of energy balance and whether serum and brain levels of OXT relate to obesity on a consistent basis across animal models and humans with obesity. We describe recent data on the effectiveness of chronic CNS administration of OXT to decrease food intake and  gain or to elicit  loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese mice and rats. Of clinical importance is the finding that both chronic central and peripheral OXT treatment evoke  loss in obese animal models with impaired leptin signaling at doses that are not associated with visceral illness, tachyphylaxis, or adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these results have been largely recapitulated following chronic subcutaneous or intranasal treatment in DIO nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) and obese humans, respectively. We also identify plausible mechanisms that contribute to the effects of OXT on  and glucose homeostasis in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. We conclude by describing ongoing challenges that remain in order for OXT-based therapeutics to be used as a long-term strategy to treat obesity in humans.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657284>Thrombolysis in elderly stroke patients in Italy (TESPI) trial and updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h2><p>Since its approval, the use of alteplase had been limited to patients aged ≤80 years.TESPI trial had been designed to evaluate whether alteplase treatment within 3 h in patients with acute ischemic stroke aged >80 years resulted in favorable benefit/risk ratio compared with standard care.

But since the contraceptive methods available for women have their limitations such as urinary tract infections, allergies, cervical erosion and discomfort, a desperate need exists to develop safe methods. Vaginal contraceptives may be the answer to this problem, as these are the oldest ways of fertility regulation, practiced over the centuries. With minimal systemic involvement, these are also the safest. Natural substances blocking or impairing the sperm motility offer as valuable non-cytotoxic vaginal contraceptives. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) isolated from plants, animals and microorganisms are known to possess sperm immobilizing and spermicidal properties. Following this, in the quest for alternative means, we have cloned, over expressed and purified the recombinant sperm agglutinating factor (SAF) from Staphylococcus warneri, isolated from the cervix of a woman with unexplained infertility.Genomic library of Staphylococcus warneri was generated in Escherichia coli using pSMART vector and screened for sperm agglutinating factor (SAF). The insert in sperm agglutinating transformant was sequenced and was found to express ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase-α sub unit. The ORF was sub-cloned in pET28a vector, expressed and purified. The effect of rSAF on motility, viability, morphology, Mg-dependent ATPase activity and acrosome status of human sperms was analyzed in vitro and contraceptive efficacy was evaluated in vivo in female BALB/c mice.The 80 kDa rSAF showed complete sperm agglutination, inhibited its Mg-ATPase activity, caused premature sperm acrosomal loss in vitro and mimicked the pattern in vivo showing 100% contraception in BALB/c mice resulting in prevention of pregnancy. The FITC labeled SAF was found to bind the entire surface of spermatozoa. Vaginal application and oral administration of rSAF to mice for 14 successive days did not demonstrate any significant change in vaginal cell morphology, organ  and tissue histology of reproductive and non-reproductive organs and had no negative impact in the dermal and penile irritation tests.The Sperm Agglutinating Factor from Staphylococcus warneri, natural microflora of human cervix, showed extensive potential to be employed as a safe vaginal contraceptive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657286>Genetic parameters for haemoglobin levels in sows and piglets as well as sow reproductive performance and piglet survival.</a></h2><p>Genetic parameters were estimated for haemoglobin (Hb) levels in sows and piglets as well as sow reproductive performance and piglet survival. Reproductive traits were available between 2005 and 2014 for 7857 litters from 1029 Large White and 858 Landrace sows. In 2012 and 2013, Hb levels, sow BW and sow back fat depth were measured on 348 sows with 529 litters 5 days prior to farrowing. In addition, Hb levels were available for 1127 one-day-old piglets from 383 litters (a maximum of three piglets per litter) of 277 sows with Hb levels. The average Hb levels in sows (sow Hb), their litters (litter Hb, based on average Hb of three piglets) and individual piglets (piglet Hb) were 112 ± 12.6 g/l, 103 ± 15.3 g/l and 105 ± 21.7 g/l, respectively. Heritabilities for Hb levels were 0.09 ± 0.07 for sow Hb, 0.19 ± 0.11 for litter Hb and 0.08 ± 0.05 for piglet Hb. Estimates for the permanent environment effect of sows were 0.09 ± 0.09 for sow Hb, 0.11 ± 0.12 for litter Hb and 0.12 ± 0.03 for piglet Hb. In comparison, heritabilities for both number of stillborn piglets and pre-weaning survival were lower (0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01). Sow BW had no significant heritability, while sow back fat depth was lowly heritable (0.10 ± 0.08). Positive genetic correlations were found between sow Hb and litter Hb (0.64 ± 0.47) and between litter Hb and sow back fat depth (0.71 ± 0.53). Higher litter Hb was genetically associated with lower number of stillborn piglets (-0.78 ± 0.35) and higher pre-weaning survival (0.28 ± 0.33). Negative genetic correlations between sow Hb and average piglet birth  of the litter (-0.60 ± 0.34) and between piglet Hb and birth  of individual piglets (-0.37 ± 0.32) indicate that selection for heavier piglets may reduce Hb levels in sows and piglets. Similarly, selection for larger litter size will reduce average piglet birth  (rg: -0.40 ± 0.12) and pre-weaning survival (-0.57 ± 0.13) and may lead to lower litter Hb (-0.48 ± 0.27). This study shows promising first results for the use of Hb levels as a selection criterion in pig breeding programs, and selection for higher Hb levels may improve piglet survival and limit further reduction in Hb levels in sows and piglets due to selection for larger and heavier litters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656615>Comparisons of doxycycline solution with talc slurry for chemical pleurodesis and risk factors for recurrence in South Korean patients with spontaneous pneumothorax.</a></h2><p>Talc slurry (TS) has been commonly used with high success rates in managing spontaneous pneumothroax (SP), but there were concerns of post-procedural complications. Alternatively, doxycycline solution (DS) was used successfully. This retrospective study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety between talc and doxycycline as a sclerosing agent and to investigate risk factors for recurrence in patients with SP.The review of medical records between January 2011 and December 2014 was conducted on 83 patients with SP who underwent pleurodesis with either TS (n=16) or DS (n=67). Recurrence and complications were compared between the DS and TS groups. Associations between recurrence after DS treatment and various factors were analysed.Recurrence was significantly higher in the DS group than in the TS group (P=0.033), whereas complications were higher in the TS group than the DS group: fever was significantly higher in the TS group (P=0.001). Recurrences associated with doxycycline use were found significantly more often in patients with recurrent diagnosis of SP, height/ ≥3.25 cm/kg and  <55 kg.Talc was more effective without recurrence compared with doxycycline. Clinically insignificant fever associated with pleurodesis was more common with talc. Low , high height to  ratio and recurrent diagnosis of SP were associated with higher recurrence after doxycycline treatment.© European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

The resulting hybrid nanostructures (ZnFeO@AgNWs) show a thin and uniform layer of ZnFeO NPs at an optimum  ratio of 1:6 between the two component nanostructures. The hybrid nanostructures retain the high crystal quality and phase purity of their constituents. It is demonstrated that the ZnFeO@AgNWs hybrid nanostructures are effective at inhibiting the biofilm formation of  cells. The biofilm inhibition activity of the hybrid nanostructures is estimated to be more than 50% at a low concentration of 100 µg/mL from both crystal violet assay and XTT assay, which are more than 8-fold higher than those of pure AgNWs and ZnFeO NPs. This greatly enhanced biofilm inhibition activity is attributed to the ZnFeO NPs-carrying membrane penetration by AgNWs and the subsequent interaction between  cells and ZnFeO NPs. These results indicate that the ZnFeO@AgNWs hybrid nanostructures have great potential as a new type of novel antibiofilm agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659650>Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Semen Quality, Sperm Antioxidant Ability, and Seminal and Blood Plasma Mineral Profiles in Cashmere Goats.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effects of the different dietary zinc (Zn) levels on semen quality, on spermatozoa and seminal plasma antioxidant status, and on the seminal and blood plasma mineral status in mature male Cashmere goats during the breeding season. Twenty-eight mature male Liaoning Cashmere goats were divided into four groups based on  (56.2 ± 2.45 kg) and semen characteristics; these goats were fed with basal diet supplemented with 0, 20, 40, or 80 mg Zn/kg DM (zinc sulfate) for 3 months. Results showed that the Zn-supplemented diets linearly increased the semen volume (0.98, 1.04, 1.27, and 1.17 ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05) and the total sperm output (3.87, 4.52, 5.73, and 5.33 × 10/ml for the 0, 20, 40, and 80 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation, respectively) (P < 0.05); by contrast, Zn supplementation exerted no effect on sperm concentration, motility, and abnormal sperms rate. The activities of copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (linear P < 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.01) were highest in the intermediate supplementation (40 mg Zn/kg DM). Moreover, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of spermatozoa decreased linearly (P < 0.01) with the increase in Zn supplementation. In seminal plasma, the highest GSH-Px activity was observed in 20 mg Zn/kg DM supplementation (P < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities both in the spermatozoa and seminal plasma showed no difference in all treatments. Seminal plasma Zn level was highest in 40 mg Zn/kg DM (linear P = 0.068), and K increased linearly (P = 0.001) with increasing Zn level. Furthermore, blood plasma Zn (linear P < 0.01; quadratic P < 0.05), Fe (linear P < 0.05; quadratic P < 0.05), and Mg (linear P < 0.05) increased with increasing Zn supplementation. These results indicated that dietary Zn supplementation in Cashmere goats during the breeding season improved the semen quality and quantity, elevated the antioxidative indices and Zn concentration, and decreased the MDA content both in spermatozoa and seminal plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657655>Iron toxicity-induced physiological and metabolite profile variations among tolerant and sensitive rice varieties.</a></h2><p>Iron toxicity stress causes physiological and metabolic changes in rice and other plants. To date, there is little information about the metabolite profile of rice under Fe toxicity conditions. In fact, metabolite has a contribution to the physiological condition of plants. Plant metabolomics is a study of low-molecular  metabolites in plants under certain conditions. The objective of the research was to investigate physiological and metabolic changes in rice under Fe toxicity stress. Two-week-old seedlings of four rice varieties with various Fe toxicity tolerance levels were stressed hydroponically with 400 ppm FeSO7HO for 10 d. Numerous physiological characters were observed and untargeted metabolomic analysis was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). The results showed Fe toxicity induced physiological and metabolite variation in rice. By comparing the metabolites synthesized in Fe toxicity-stressed plants with control plants, it showed that elaidic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid could be as metabolite marker candidates for rice response to Fe toxicity stress. When plants exposed to Fe toxicity stress, elaidic acid increased, whereas linoleic- and linolenic acid decreased. The alteration of fatty acid composition in the root and shoot suggests the alteration of metabolites is one of the tolerance strategies of rice to Fe toxicity stress. This finding offers an insight about the tolerance strategies of rice under Fe toxicity stress related to the maintenance process of the cell membranes during this stress. The genes underlying biosynthesis of the fatty acid could be a target of future research on responsible genes for Fe toxicity tolerance in rice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655526>RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH RENAL TRANSPLANTATION.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate anesthesia management in cesarean operation of pregnant women undergone renal transplantation and their effects on postoperative renal function retrospectively.After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee of our hospital, the records of pregnant women who underwent kidney transplantation and cesarean section between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients' demographic data, concomitant disease history, treatment received, type of anesthesia were retrospectively evaluated and recorded in the follow-up form.It was found that a total of 47 women who had undergone renal transplantation had 47 live births by cesarean section. The mean age of the pregnant women was 30±5.34 years. The mean time between renal transplantation and conception was 95.34±55.02 months. It was found that 14 (29%) of a total of 47 patients had their first pregnancy. The number of patients with a gravidity of 4 and above was 9 (19%). A total of 21(44.7%) pregnant women had spontaneous miscarriage. Five (10.6%) patients were treated with curettage for therapeutic purposes. Twenty-two (46%) of the patients whose immunosuppressive therapy was continuing were on azathioprine, tacrolimus and prednisolone. The mean gestational age of delivery was 36.5±1.59 weeks. The rate of pre-pregnancy hypertension diagnosis was 25.5% (n=12), while the rate of developing gestational hypertension was 21.3% (n=10). Spinal anesthesia was administered to 42 (91%) of 47 patients who underwent cesarean section. In the preoperative period, the mean serum blood urea nitrogen value was 62.88±41.97 mg/dL and the mean serum creatinine level was 3.21±6.17 mg/dL. In the postoperative period, these values were respectively 44.4±29.9 mg/dL and 1.91±1.63 mg/dL. When the preoperative and postoperative serum urea and creatinine levels were compared, they were found to be lower in the postoperative period; however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). The mean  of the newborns was determined as 2707.3±501.5 g. While the number of newborns with a low birth  (<2500gr) was 18 (38%), of these, 3 (0.6%) were below 2000 g.

Exposure to 4000 µg BPA/kg bw/day (BPA HIGH) reduced sperm motility and altered the straight-line velocity (VSL) and linearity (LIN). Effects on steroidogenesis were evident, with testosterone (T) being up-regulated by both treatments and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) down-regulated by BPA HIGH. Plasma levels of 17β-estradiol (E) were not affected. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) increased in the BPA HIGH group. Interestingly, the levels of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds were significantly reduced after both treatments. Unpredictably, a few changes were noticed in the expression of genes coding for ECS enzymes, while the receptors were up-regulated depending on the BPA dose. Reproductive markers in testis (leptin receptor (), estrogen receptors (, ), progesterone receptors () and the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ()) were up-regulated.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine 5-20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth  (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.5) l h for CL and 5.29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA.

This species was previously controlled by imazamox, but the continuous use of this herbicide has selected for resistant biotypes. Two biotypes of E. heterophylla from southern Brazil, one resistant (R) and one susceptible (S) to imazamox, were compared. The resistance of the R biotype was confirmed by dose-response assays since it required 1250.2 g ai ha to reduce the fresh  by 50% versus 7.4 g ai ha for the S biotype. The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme activity was studied using ALS-inhibiting herbicides from five different chemical families. The R biotype required the highest concentrations to reduce this enzyme activity by 50%. A Ser653Asn mutation was found in the ALS gene of the R biotype. The experiments carried out showed that imazamox absorption and metabolism were not involved in resistance. However, greater C-imazamox root exudation was found in the R biotype (~70% of the total absorbed imazamox). Target site mutation in the ALS gene is the principal mechanism that explains the imazamox resistance of the R biotype, but root exudation seems to also contribute to the resistance of this biotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656698> obtained from mangrove exhibits antagonistic activities against -induced damping-off of cucumber.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted to investigate the potential of  obtained from  mangrove roots in inhibiting  and damping-off disease of cucumber.  exhibited in vitro inhibition of  growth.

We evaluated the relation of self-reported severe  loss with fatigue and the predictors for fatigue in old patients at hospital discharge. Severe  loss was defined according to involuntary  loss ≥5% in the last three months. We determined fatigue with the validated  questionnaire. The regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbidities, medications/day, and BMI. Of 424 patients aged between 61 and 98 y, 34.1% had severe  loss. Fatigue was higher in patients with severe  loss (3.7 ± 2.3 vs. 3.2 ± 2.3 points,  = 0.021). In a multinomial regression model,  loss was independently associated with higher risk for moderate fatigue (OR:1.172, CI:1.026-1.338,  = 0.019) and with increased risk for severe fatigue (OR:1.209, CI:1.047-1.395,  = 0.010) together with the number of medications/day (OR:1.220, CI:1.023-1.455,  = 0.027). In a binary regression model, severe  loss predicted moderate-to-severe fatigue in the study population (OR:1.651, CI:1.052-2.590,  = 0.029). In summary, patients with self-reported severe  loss at hospital discharge exhibited higher fatigue levels and severe  loss was an independent predictor of moderate and severe fatigue, placing these patients at risk for impaired outcome in the post-hospital period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656673>Early decongestive therapy versus high-flow nasal cannula for the prevention of adverse clinical events in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.</a></h2><p>Few studies have investigated the role of decongestive therapy and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in preventing reintubation and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE).Data from patients with ACPE who were weaned from mechanical ventilation in the cardiac intensive care unit between January 2013 and December 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. All patients were treated with HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy (COT), such as a nasal cannula or venturi mask, immediately after extubation. Decongestive therapy (intravenous furosemide infusion) was administered at the discretion of the attending physician.Of 212 patients treated during the study period, 47 were excluded due to recent open-heart surgery and two, due to insufficient clinical data. The remaining 163 patients had a mean age of 67.4±14.3 years, and 92 (56.4%) were male; 44 patients received HFNC, and 119 COT. Mean  loss within 72 hours of extubation was -0.86±2.03 kg. A total of 38 patients (23.3%) required reintubation, 21 of whom (12.9%) required reintubation within 72 hours of extubation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 16 patients (9.8%). Multivariate analysis showed that  increase within 72 hours of extubation was independent determinants of reintubation (OR =1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2; P<0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR =1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1; P=0.005). The use of HFNC was not associated with reintubation or in-hospital mortality.Our findings indicate that early  loss resulted in reduced reintubation and in-hospital mortality in patients with ACPE. However, HFNC and COT did not differ in the prevention of reintubation and in-hospital mortality. Therefore, aggressive decongestive therapy, rather than HFNC, should be considered early after extubation.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

However, the welfare of cattle accommodated on them has been questioned. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of floor and diet on hoof health and lying behaviours of housed dairy-origin bulls, from a mean age of 8 months to slaughter at 15.5 months old. Forty-eight bulls, which had a mean initial live  of 212 (SD = 23.7) kg, were allocated to one of four treatments, which consisted of two floors and two diets arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The floors evaluated were a fully slatted concrete floor and a fully slatted concrete floor overlaid with rubber, while the diets offered were either a high concentrate diet or a grass-silage-based diet supplemented with concentrates. The mean total duration of the study was 216 days. Floor had no significant effect on claw measurements measured on day 62 or 139. However, bulls accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber had a tendency to have a higher front toe length measured pre-slaughter than those accommodated on concrete slats (P = 0.063). Floor had no significant effect on the net growth of toes or heels during the duration of the study. The number of bruises (P < 0.01) and the bruising score (P < 0.05) were significantly higher on day 62 in bulls accommodated on fully slatted concrete floors than on concrete slats overlaid with rubber, but there was no significant effect of floor on these parameters on day 139 or at the measurement taken pre-slaughter. There was a tendency for bulls accommodated on concrete slats to have a higher probability of having sole bruising at the end of the experiment than those accommodated on slats overlaid with rubber (P = 0.052). Diet had no significant effect on toe length or heel height, number of bruises, or overall bruising score at any time point of the study.

Generally, it is a chronic and progressive disease, however in many cases it can be prevented or treated. Nevertheless, effective control of this disease requires awareness of symptoms in the society.The aim of the study was to assess the level of HF knowledge in the Polish population.The questionnaire concerning knowledge about HF prepared by the Competence Network HF under the patronage of the European Heart Failure Association of the ESC, was used. The survey included 534 contributors who formed three groups: medical students - in vast majority at first half of the study course (MS) - 198 (37.1%), HF Awareness Day participants (HFDP) - 134 (25.1%) and other (OP) - 202 (37.8%).Study groups differed in terms of gender, age and level of education.

The "crescent medial" and "vertical medial" thigh lifting techniques (CMTL/VMTL) are the most effective type of surgery to treat laxity and excess of skin and soft tissues in the medial region of the thighs Aim of this article is to suggest which patients may be eligible for a surgical thighplasty with an acceptable risk of postoperative complications.We performed a retrospective study with 30 female patients who underwent a surgical thighplasty between 2018 and 2008. Several parameters were evaluated such as age, patient  and BMI before  loss and before plastic surgery, the mode of  loss (surgical vs. non-surgical), the type of technique performed ("crescent medial" vs. "vertical medial"), the association with other surgical procedures of size reduction plastic operation (ICD10 Procedure Code 8683), smoking at the time of the intervention. The correlations between these preoperative parameters and the development of postoperative complications were taken into consideration and different outcomes were evaluated, of which the modification of the size of the trousers after the thigh lifting operation, the days of hospitalization, the maintenance time drainage, the time needed to return to normal daily activities and improvement in the same, in walking and in physical activity after the execution of the procedure and the satisfaction in general of the patients.The association with other excisional surgeries such as brachioplasty, abdominoplasty or mastopexy, the BMI before thighplasty and  loss modality condition significantly influence patient's post-operative outcomes. However, there is no clear correlation with age, smoking, the type of plastic surgery performed and its possible association with liposuction, and a drastic "drop" of BMI.In our opinion, even more than a single parameter predicts patients' post-operative complications. Acting on the significant findings of our investigation, surgeons could minimize post-operative risks as well as surgical minor complications.Therefore we advise to evaluate these factors before the intervention in order to select the patients more accurately and define the ideal candidate patient for inguinocrural dermolipectomy, so as obtain a reduction in postoperative complications. contouring, Massive  loss, Thigh lift.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656510>Effect of nutrient intakes on anthropometric profiles among university students from a selected private University in Klang Valley, Malaysia.</a></h2><p>Dietary composition is the cornerstone of  management.

The secondary outcome was .The proportion of individuals achieving the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables increased (18%; 95% CI: 2% to 36%; P = 0.031), whereas the number of individuals consuming soft drinks and exchanging main meals for snacks or junk food decreased (-35%; 95% CI: -45% to -22%; P < 0.001 and -16%; 95% CI: -29% to -1%; P = 0.037). The number of active individuals increased during leisure time (37%; 95% CI: 19% to 58%; P < 0.001), at work (17%; 95% CI: 4% to 32%; P = 0.009), and in the household (14%; 95% CI: 0% to 31%; P = 0.047).  decreased among individuals with overweight or obesity.This intervention promoted pronounced lifestyle changes (i.e., increased physical activity and healthier food choices) in the entire city, providing scientific-based evidence on which to build effective public health policies in Latin America.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656100> Loss and Blood Pressure Changes, Roles Played by Genetic Susceptibility and Macronutrients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660303>The dilemma of aspirin resistance in obese patients.</a></h2><p>Aspirin resistance (AR) commonly refers to the concept of reduced aspirin efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease and platelet inhibition. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease three- to four-fold and has been associated with AR. Aspirin is used as a tool for both primary and secondary prevention, but recent studies suggest that its lack of efficacy for primary prevention is partly attributable to obesity. Several mechanisms have been described that contribute to AR in obese patients using pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. AR may be attenuated through  loss, alternative dosing regimens, and different drug formulations. With the global rise of obesity, it is imperative to find preventive therapies that adequately address atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in this population.2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Eight individuals with recent spinal cord injury performed six weekly submaximal exercise tests. The first and last measurement additionally contained a wheelchair circuit and peak graded exercise test. Fifteen experienced individuals performed all above-mentioned tests on one occasion.  Mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique did not change during the five weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. Peak power output during peak graded test and performance time on the wheelchair circuit improved between the first and the last week. No difference in propulsion technique, peak power output, and performance time was found between the persons with a recent injury and the experienced group. Mechanical efficiency was higher after the correction for the difference in relative power output in the experienced group.  The group with a recent injury did not improve mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique over the period of active rehabilitation, despite significant improvements on the wheelchair circuit and in work capacity. The only significant difference between the groups was found in mechanical efficiency. Implications for rehabilitation The lack of time-dependent changes in mechanical efficiency and propulsion technique in the group with a recent spinal cord injury, combined with the lack of differences in technique, work capacity and on the wheelchair circuit between the groups, suggest that important adaptations of motor learning may happen even earlier in rehabilitation and emphasize that the group in active rehabilitation was relatively skilled. Standardized observational analyses of handrim wheelchair propulsion abilities during early spinal cord injury rehabilitation provide detailed understanding of wheelchair technique, skill as well as wheelchair propulsion capacity. Measurement of external power output is critical to interpretation of gross efficiency, propulsion technique, and capacity. Wheelchair quality and  - next to wheelchair fitness and skill - require careful consideration both in early rehabilitation as well as in the chronic phase of spinal cord injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661553>Population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in obesity: finding the optimal dose for (morbidly) obese individuals.</a></h2><p>For vancomycin treatment in obese patients, there is no consensus on the optimal dose that will lead to the pharmacodynamic target (AUC 400-700 mg*h L ). This prospective study quantifies vancomycin pharmacokinetics in morbidly obese and non-obese individuals, in order to guide vancomycin dosing in the obese.Morbidly obese individuals (n=20) undergoing bariatric surgery and non-obese healthy volunteers (n=8) (total  (TBW) 60.0-234.6 kg) received a single vancomycin dose (obese: 12.5 mg kg , maximum 2500 mg; non-obese: 1000 mg) with plasma concentrations measured over 48 hours (11-13 samples per individual). Modelling, internal validation, external validation using previously published data and simulations (n=9950 individuals, TBW 60-230 kg) were performed using NONMEM.In a three-compartment model, peripheral volume and clearance increased with TBW (both p<0.001), which was confirmed in the external validation. A dose of 35 mg kg per day (maximum 5500 mg/day) resulted in a >90% target attainment (AUC>400 mg*h L ) in individuals up to 200 kg, with corresponding trough concentrations of 5.7-14.6 mg L (twice daily dosing). For continuous infusion, a loading dose of 1500 mg is required for steady state on day 1.In this prospective, rich sampling pharmacokinetic study, vancomycin clearance was well predicted using TBW. We recommend that in obese individuals without renal impairment, vancomycin should be dosed as 35 mg kg per day (maximized at 5500 mg/day). When given over two daily doses, trough concentrations between 5.7-14.6 mg L correspond to the target exposure in obese individuals.This article is protected by copyright.

Within an hour of the last administration, the sciatic nerve motor conduction velocity (MNCV) of each group was measured, and the morphological changes of rat sciatic nerve were observed by HE, Weil's staining and electron microscopy. The expression of TRPV-1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rats was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of CGRP protein in the spinal cord was analyzed by Western blot. Results Compared with the nondiabetic control group, elevated blood glucose, decreased  and reduced average mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), additionally, the sciatic nerves showed significantly slowed conduction velocity (both p&lt;0.001) and damaged pathological structure, the expression of TRPV1 and CGRP were decreased (both p&lt;0.001) in the diabetic groups. Compared with the diabetic control group, down-regulation of TRPV1 and CGRP in spinal cord was significant for the diabetic group A and B treated with 0.25% and 0.75% ropivacaine, the higher concentration of ropivacaine correlated with a greater change. Conclusion Ropivacaine can significantly block sciatic nerve conduction velocity in DPN rats in a concentration-dependent manner, which may be related to the expression of the TRPV1-CGRP pathway.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660665>The effects of early life adversity on growth, maturation, and steroid hormones in male and female rats.</a></h2><p>Early life adversity is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, yet the mechanisms by which adversity increases this risk are still being delineated. Here we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) manipulation in rats that models a low resource environment to examine effects on growth, developmental milestones, and endocrine endpoints. In LBN, dams and pups, from pups' postnatal days 2-9, are exposed to a limited resource environment where dams lack proper materials to build a nest. This manipulation is compared to control housing conditions, where rat dams have access to ample nesting materials and enrichment throughout pups' development. We found that the LBN condition altered maternal care, increasing pup-directed behaviors while reducing self-care. This, perhaps compensatory, increase in nursing and attention to pups did not mitigate against changes in metabolism, as LBN reduced  gain in both sexes and this effect persisted into adulthood. Although adult stress hormone levels in both sexes and vaginal opening and estrous cycle length in females were not disrupted, there was other evidence of endocrine dysregulation. Compared to controls, LBN rats of both sexes had shorted anogenital distances, indicating reduced androgen exposure. LBN males also had higher plasma estradiol levels in adulthood. This combination of results suggests that LBN causes a demasculinizing effect in males that could contribute to lasting changes in the brain and behavior. Importantly, alterations in metabolic and endocrine systems due to early life adversity could be one mechanism by which stress early in life increases risk for later disease.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661341>Thinness, overweight, and obesity in indigenous school children and youth in Mexico.</a></h2><p> The prevalence of overweight (OWT) and obesity (OB), defined by the  mass index (BMI, kg/m) among children and youth has increased worldwide in the last 30-40 years.

Little is known of the role of estrogens in the LV responses to this condition. The aim of the study was to compare LV remodeling in female rats with severe AR in absence of estrogens by ovariectomy (Ovx). In a first study, we investigated over 6 months the development of hypertrophy in four groups of female Wistar rats: AR or sham-operated (sham) and Ovx or not. Ovx reduced normal heart growth. As expected, volume overload (VO) from AR resulted in significant LV dilation (42% and 32% increase LV end-diastolic diameter in intact and Ovx groups vs. their respective sham group;  < 0.0001). LV  was also significantly and similarly increased in both AR groups (non-Ovx and Ovx). Increase in stroke volume or cardiac output and loss of systolic function were similar between AR intact and AR Ovx groups compared to sham. We then investigated what were the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2; 0.03 mg/kg/day) treatment on the parameters studied in Ovx rats. Ovx reduced uterus  by 85% and E2 treatment restored up to 65% of the normal . E2 also helped normalize heart size to normal values. On the other hand, it did not influence the extent of the hypertrophic response to AR. In fact, E2 treatment further reduced LV hypertrophy in AR Ovx rats (41% over Sham Ovx + E2). Systolic and diastolic functions parameters in AR Ovx + E2 were similar to intact AR animals. Ovx in sham rats had a significant effect on the LV gene expression of several hypertrophy markers. Atrial natriuretic peptide () gene expression was reduced by Ovx in sham-operated females whereas brain natriuretic peptide () expression was increased. Alpha () and beta () myosin heavy chain genes were also significantly modulated by Ovx in sham females. In AR rats, LV expression of both  and  genes were increased as expected. Ovx further increased it of AR rats for  and did the opposite for . Interestingly, AR in Ovx rats had only minimal effects on  and  genes whereas they were modulated as expected for intact AR animals. In summary, loss of estrogens by Ovx in AR rats was not accompanied by a worsening of hypertrophy or cardiac function. Normal cardiac growth was reduced by Ovx in sham females but not the hypertrophic response to AR. On the other hand, Ovx had important effects on LV gene expression both in sham and AR female rats.©2019 Walsh-Wilkinson et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658728>Vision Based Modeling of Plants Phenotyping in Vertical Farming under Artificial Lighting.</a></h2><p>In this paper, we present a novel method for vision based plants phenotyping in indoor vertical farming under artificial lighting. The method combines 3D plants modeling and deep segmentation of the higher leaves, during a period of 25-30 days, related to their growth. The novelty of our approach is in providing 3D reconstruction, leaf segmentation, geometric surface modeling, and deep network estimation for  prediction to effectively measure plant growth, under three relevant phenotype features: height,  and leaf area. Together with the vision based measurements, to verify the soundness of our proposed method, we also harvested the plants at specific time periods to take manual measurements, collecting a great amount of data. In particular, we manually collected 2592 data points related to the plant phenotype and 1728 images of the plants. This allowed us to show with a good number of experiments that the vision based methods ensure a quite accurate prediction of the considered features, providing a way to predict plant behavior, under specific conditions, without any need to resort to human measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656922>Photo-Assisted Removal of Tetracycline Using Bio-Nanocomposite-Immobilized Alginate Beads.</a></h2><p>In the present study, we report an efficient method for tetracycline (TC) removal from contaminated wastewater using alginate beads, immobilized with bio nanocomposite (BNC) consisting of FeO (iron oxide) and TiO (titanium dioxide) nanoparticles along with dead biomass of TC-resistant bacteria  sp. Chemically synthesized FeO nanoparticles and commercially available TiO (P) nanoparticles were combined to form nanocomposite followed by encapsulation within alginate beads along with heat-killed biomass of sp. for the efficient degradation and adsorption of the target pollutant. The primary characterization of chemically synthesized nanoparticles was carried out with Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The batch studies for TC removal were performed by varying the reaction parameters such as bead , initial TC concentration, and pH in a photoreactor with UV-C irradiation. TC concentration of 10 mg/L, bead  10 g, and pH 6 were fixed as the optimum condition where 98 ± 0.5% of TC was removed from the solution. The possible removal mechanism was investigated with the help of UV-visible, total organic carbon, oxidation-reduction potential, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analyses. The applicability of the process was successfully tested with the natural water systems spiked with TC at 10 mg/L. To assess the ecotoxic effects of the treated effluents, the cell viability assay was performed with the algal strains, , and sp. and the bacterial strains, and .

An important factor for children's well-being is good nutrition. Therefore, the malnutrition status of children under the age of five is an important outcome measure for children's health. This study uses the proportional odds model to identify risk factors associated with child malnutrition in Ethiopia using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data.This study uses the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey results. Based on -for-height anthropometric index (Z-score) child nutrition status is categorized into four levels namely- underweight, normal, overweight and obese. Since this leads to an ordinal variable for nutrition status, an ordinal logistic regression (OLR)proportional odds model (POM) is an obvious choice for analysis.The findings and comparison of results using the cumulative logit model with and without complex survey design are presented. The study results revealed that to produce the appropriate estimates and standard errors for data that were obtained from complex survey design, model fitting based on taking the survey sampling design into account is better. It has also been found that for children under the age of five,  of a child at birth, mother's age, mother's  Mass Index (BMI), marital status of mother and region (Affar, Dire Dawa, Gambela, Harari and Somali) were influential variables significantly associated with underfive children's nutritional status in Ethiopia.This child's age of a child, sex,  of child at birth, mother's BMI and region of residence were significant determinants of malnutrition of children under five years in Ethiopia. The effect of these determinants can be used to develop strategies for reducing child malnutrition in Ethiopia.

We undertook the current analysis to replicate our findings in a different study population that included women and non-smokers. We conducted a nested case-control study in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Cases (n=323) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/- 1 year), race, date of blood collection (+/- 30 days) and sex. We performed conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between quartiles of circulating DBP and risk of RCC. We observed a statistically significant positive association between DBP and RCC that persisted after adjustment for history of diabetes, history of hypertension, family history of renal cancer,  mass index (BMI), and smoking status (mv-adj Q4 vs. Q1 OR=4.1, 95% CI=2.2-7.8; p-trend <0.0001). These findings were similar when we restricted to cases with at least two years of follow-up and no major  loss, suggesting that our findings are not due to reverse causality. In the present study, those with higher serum concentrations of DBP were at increased risk of RCC, in contrast to previously published findings. Further research is necessary to determine the true association between DBP and risk of RCC, and whether different DBP phenotypes may have different associations with risk of RCC.

It is a key player in some types of hereditary angioedema and is involved in septic shock, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke, among others. Activation of the plasma contact system leads to elevated levels of plasma kallikrein, which cleaves high molecular  kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Drug development for bradykinin-meditated pathologies has focused on designing inhibitors to the enzymes that cleave HK (to prevent bradykinin release) or antagonists of endothelial bradykinin receptors (to prevent downstream bradykinin action). Here we show a strategy to block bradykinin generation by using an HK antibody that binds to HK, preventing its cleavage and subsequent bradykinin release. We show that this antibody blocks dextran sodium sulfate-induced HK cleavage and bradykinin production. Moreover, while the pathogenic AD peptide β-amyloid (Aβ)42 cleaves HK and induces a dramatic increase in bradykinin production, our HK antibody blocked these events from occurring. These results may provide strategies for developing treatments for bradykinin-driven pathologies.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

However, 2,129 proteins remain listed as missing proteins (MPs) in the newest neXtProt release (2019-02). The main reasons for MPs are a low-abundance, low-molecular- (LMW), unexpected modifications, membrane characteristics, etc. Moreover, more than 50% of the MS/MS data have not been successfully identified in shotgun proteomics. Open-pFind, an efficient open search engine, recently released by the pFind group in China, might provide the opportunity to identify these buried MPs in complex samples. In this study, proteins and potential MPs were identified using Open-pFind and three other search engines to compare their performance and efficiency with three large-scale datasets digested by three enzymes (Glu-C, Lys-C, and Trypsin) with specificity on different amino acid (AA) residues. Our results demonstrated that Open-pFind identified 44.7-93.1% more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), and 21.3-61.6% more peptide sequences than those identified by the second-best search engine. As a result, Open-pFind detected 53.1% more candidate MPs than MaxQuant and 8.8% more candidate MPs than Proteome Discoverer. In total, 5 (PE2) of the 124 candidate MPs identified by Open-pFind were verified from two unique peptides containing more than 9 AA by using spectrum theoretical prediction with pDeep, and synthesized peptide matching with pBuild, after spectrum quality analysis, isobaric post-translational modification, and single amino acid variant (SAAV) filtering. These five verified MPs can be saved as PE1 proteins. In addition, three other candidate MPs were verified with two unique peptides (one peptide containing more than 9 AA and the other containing only 8 AA), which were slightly lower than the criteria listed by C-HPP, and required additional verification information. More importantly, unexpected modifications were detected in these MPs.

As the reported literature on silicone tungsten composite is rare, thus, a complete possible spectrum of silicone tungsten composites series with tungsten loading of 0-88.1 %wt has been fabricated by RTV method and studied as a flexible gamma shielding material. Flexible silicone/tungsten composite formulations containing different  percentages of tungsten powder (0, 30.1, 47.8, 59.8, 68.1, and 88.1 wt %) were developed by the room-temperature vulcanization route. Two lead collimators with diameters of 0.6 cm were used to make a narrow beam geometry for gamma rays emitted from aCs (gamma-ray energy of 662 keV) point source. Uncollided flux was measured with a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector enclosed in lead shielding to reduce the background radiation level. The measured mass attenuation coefficient for our composites with 88.1 wt % tungsten was 0.1035 cm/g, which is nearly 3.5% higher than that of commercially available silicone/tungsten composites named T-Flex (nearly 0.095 cm/g) containing the same tungsten loading. Similarly, superior half value layers (HVL) of our composites with 88.1 % wt loading of tungsten i.e 1.01 cm versus 1.27 cm for the reported T-Flex counterpart with additional advantage of insitu fabrication on complex geometries. It was also found that the effectiveness of gamma-ray shielding increases with increase in density of the composites, which is due to the increase in the  percent of tungsten powder. Our material will have applications as shielding material for both mobile and stationary radiation sources and it can also be used as fabrication material for gloves, safety shoes, coats, etc. to protect workers in a radiation environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mhp infection rates differ across pig breeds, with Chinese native pig breeds that exhibit high fecundity (e.g., Jiangquhai, Meishan, Erhualian) more sensitive than Duroc, Landrace, and other imported pig breeds. However, the genetic basis of the immune response to Mhp infection in different pig breeds is largely unknown.The aims of this study were to determine the relative Mhp susceptibility of the Chinese native Jiangquhai breed compared to the Duroc breed, and identify molecular mechanisms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach.Jiangquhai and Duroc pigs were artificially infected with the same Mhp dose. The entire experiment lasted 28 days. Daily  gain, Mhp-specific antibody levels, and lung lesion scores were measured to evaluate the Mhp infection susceptibility of different breeds. Experimental pigs were slaughtered on the 28th day. Lung tissues were collected for total RNA extraction. RNA-seq was performed to identify DEGs, which were enriched by gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia annotation of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. DEGs were validated with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Infection with the same Mhp dose produced a more serious condition in Jiangquhai pigs than in Duroc pigs. Jiangquhai pigs showed poorer growth, higher Mhp antibody levels, and more serious lung lesions compared with Duroc pigs. RNA-seq identified 2,250 and 3,526 DEGs in lung tissue from Jiangquhai and Duroc pigs, respectively. The two breeds shared 1,669 DEGs, which were involved in immune-relevant pathways including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and chemokine signaling pathway. Compared to Jiangquhai pigs, more chemokines, interferon response factors, and interleukins were specifically activated in Duroc pigs; , ,  and  genes were significantly up-regulated, which may help Duroc pigs enhance immune response and reduce Mhp susceptibility.This study demonstrated differential immune-related DEGs in lung tissue from the two breeds, and revealed an important role of genetics in the immune response to Mhp infection. The biological functions of these important DEGs should be further confirmed and maybe applied as molecular markers that improve pig health.©2019 Ni et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656729>Alkaline serine protease from the new halotolerant alkaliphilic  strain AK-R: purification and properties.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the purification and characterization of an alkaline protease from the alkaliphilic  (formerly ) strain AK-R, which was previously isolated from Egyptian soda lakes.

PMSF caused complete inhibition of the enzyme activity, suggesting that AK-R belongs to the serine protease family. In addition, the enzyme was completely inhibited by EDTA, revealing the requirement of metal ions for AK-R protease activity; hence, it can be classified as a metalloprotease. AK-R protease is a mostly thiol-independent enzyme, since thiol reductants such as β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol had no effect on the enzyme activity. AK-R protease exhibited high stability in several organic solvents, including butanol, amyl alcohol, dimethyl ether, toluene, diethyl ether and methanol. Moreover, AK-R protease showed significant stability to a variety of surfactants and commercial detergents. The features and properties of AK-R alkaline protease are favourable and suggest its potential applications in various industries, particularly in the laundry detergent industry.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659427>Aggregated aluminium exposure: risk assessment for the general population.</a></h2><p>Aluminium is one of the most abundant elements in earth's crust and its manifold uses result in an exposure of the population from many sources. Developmental toxicity, effects on the urinary tract and neurotoxicity are known effects of aluminium and its compounds. Here, we assessed the health risks resulting from total consumer exposure towards aluminium and various aluminium compounds, including contributions from foodstuffs, food additives, food contact materials (FCM), and cosmetic products. For the estimation of aluminium contents in foodstuff, data from the German "Pilot-Total-Diet-Study" were used, which was conducted as part of the European TDS-Exposure project. These were combined with consumption data from the German National Consumption Survey II to yield aluminium exposure via food for adults. It was found that the average weekly aluminium exposure resulting from food intake amounts to approx. 50% of the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/kg  (bw)/week, derived by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). For children, data from the French "Infant Total Diet Study" and the "Second French Total Diet Study" were used to estimate aluminium exposure via food. As a result, the TWI can be exhausted or slightly exceeded-particularly for infants who are not exclusively breastfed and young children relying on specially adapted diets (e.g. soy-based, lactose free, hypoallergenic). When taking into account the overall aluminium exposure from foods, cosmetic products (cosmetics), pharmaceuticals and FCM from uncoated aluminium, a significant exceedance of the EFSA-derived TWI and even the PTWI of 2 mg/kg bw/week, derived by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, may occur. Specifically, high exposure levels were found for adolescents aged 11-14 years. Although exposure data were collected with special regard to the German population, it is also representative for European and comparable to international consumers. From a toxicological point of view, regular exceedance of the lifetime tolerable aluminium intake (TWI/PTWI) is undesirable, since this results in an increased risk for health impairments. Consequently, recommendations on how to reduce overall aluminium exposure are given.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655590>Heated egg white has no effect, but lactic fermented and unheated egg white reduces abdominal fat in rats.</a></h2><p>We previously reported the abdominal fat-reducing effect of unheated egg white proteins (EWP); however, unheated egg white is actually rarely consumed. We thus investigated the effect of heated egg white on abdominal fat in rats.Male SD rats were divided into two groups that were allowed to consume different dietary preparations containing casein or heated egg white for 4 weeks (Trial 1). We studied whether a heated form and a lactic fermented form of egg white (FLE) are as effective as unheated egg white for reducing abdominal fat. For this, we divided male SD rats into four groups that were allowed to consume different dietary preparations containing casein, unheated egg white, heated egg white, or lactic fermented egg white for 4 weeks (Trial 2).Animals in the heated egg white group showed no significant difference in abdominal fat  compared with those in the casein group (Trial 1). Animals in the unheated egg white group and the FLE group had significantly lower levels of abdominal fat  than those in the casein group (Trial 2). Ovalbumin in heated egg white was degraded by pepsin, whereas ovalbumin in unheated egg white and lactic acid fermented egg white was not degraded appreciably by pepsin. It was reported that EWP inhibit triglyceride absorption in rat. In the present study, EWP pepsin hydrolysate inhibited the micellar solubility of fatty acids in vitro. In particular, ovalbumin inhibited the micellar solubility of fatty acids.These results indicate that lactic fermented egg white reduces visceral fat in rats and suggest that different levels of susceptibility of ovalbumin to pepsin digestion underlie the varying effectiveness among the egg white preparations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658922>Associations of early-life growth with health using an allostatic load score in young, urban African adults: Birth to Twenty Plus Cohort.</a></h2><p>Growth in early life is associated with various individual health outcomes in adulthood, but limited research has been done on associations with a more comprehensive measure of health. Combining information from multiple biological systems, allostatic load (AL) provides such a quantitative measure of overall physiological health. We used longitudinal data from the Birth to Twenty Plus cohort in South Africa to calculate an AL score at age 22 years and examined associations with birth  and linear growth and  gain from age 0 to 2 years and 2 to 5 years, as attenuated by trajectories of  mass index and pubertal development in later childhood and adolescence. Differences in total AL score between males and females were small, though levels of individual biological factors contributing to AL differed by sex. Increased  gain from age 2 to 5 years among males was associated with an increased risk of high AL, but no other early-life  were associated with AL. Increased adiposity through childhood and adolescence in females was associated with higher AL in early adulthood. These results illustrate that patterns of early-life growth are not consistently associated with higher AL. While more research is needed to link AL in young adulthood to later health outcomes, these results also suggest increased adiposity during childhood and adolescence represents a potential early sign of later physiological risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657026>Psychological features in obesity: A network analysis.</a></h2><p>Enhanced understanding of psychosocial factors associated with obesity may improve knowledge of their interplay mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between psychosocial variables in individuals with obesity using a network analysis.Patients seeking treatment for obesity were consecutively recruited from a rehabilitative residential treatment program for severe obesity between January 2016 and March 2019. Each patient completed the following questionnaires: Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90, Obesity Related Well-Being, and  Bias Internalization Scale. In addition, current  mass index (BMI) was measured, and maximum acceptable and dream BMI were assessed.The sample comprised 996 patients with obesity (age 52.3 [SD = 16.0] years; BMI 41.8 [SD = 7.8] kg/m ; 65.7% women; 52.2% married or living with a partner). Network analysis showed that interpersonal sensitivity and shape- concern, but also internalized  stigma, were the most central and highly interconnected nodes in the network. In contrast, objective binge-eating episodes and dietary restraint were the most peripheral and least connected nodes. Eating disorder features and psychological distress formed two clearly separate clusters. No difference in network structure was found between men and women.The pattern of network node connections supports the importance of assessing psychological distress, interpersonal sensitivity, shape- concern, and internalized  stigma in patients seeking treatment for obesity.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656476>Risk factors of stillbirth among mothers delivered in public hospitals of Central Zone, Tigray, Ethiopia.</a></h2><p>Stillbirth is a death before the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother.

Restoring salt and water homeostasis in hemodialysis patients has been a permanent quest by nephrologists summarized by the 'dry ' probing approach. Although this clinical approach has been associated with benefits on cardiovascular outcome, it is now challenged by recent studies showing that intensity or aggressiveness to remove fluid during intermittent dialysis is associated with cardiovascular stress and potential organ damage. A more precise approach is required to improve cardiovascular outcome in this high-risk population. Fluid status assessment and monitoring rely on four components: clinical assessment, non-invasive instrumental tools (e.g., US, bioimpedance, blood volume monitoring), cardiac biomarkers (e.g. natriuretic peptides), and algorithm and sodium modeling to estimate mass transfer. Optimal management of fluid and sodium imbalance in dialysis patients consist in adjusting salt and fluid removal by dialysis (ultrafiltration, dialysate sodium) and by restricting salt intake and fluid gain between dialysis sessions. Modern technology using biosensors and feedback control tools embarked on dialysis machine, with sophisticated analytics will provide direct handling of sodium and water in a more precise and personalized way. It is envisaged in the near future that these tools will support physician decision making with high potential of improving cardiovascular outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659553>Purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serralysin-like alkaline metalloprotease from a novel source.</a></h2><p>Serratiopeptidase is an alkaline metalloendopeptidase, which acquired wide significance because of its therapeutic applications. The present study was undertaken for purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serratiopeptidase produced from Streptomyces hydrogenans var. MGS13.The crude enzyme was purified by precipitating with ammonium sulfate, dialysis, and Sephadex gel filtration, resulting in 34% recovery with a 12% purification fold. The purified enzyme S.AMP13 was spotted as a single clear hydrolytic band on casein zymogram and whose molecular  was found to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor and stability studies revealed that this enzyme is metalloprotease, thermostable, and alkaline in nature. The maximum serratiopeptidase activity was observed at 37 °C and pH 9.0. The partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme S.AMP13 by LC-MS/MS analysis shows the closest sequence similarities with previously reported alkaline metalloendopeptidases. The amino acid sequence alignment of S.AMP13 shared a conserved C-terminus region with peptidase-M10 serralysin superfamily at amino acid positions 128-147, i.e., ANLSTRATDTVYGFNSTAGR revealed that this enzyme is a serralysin-like protease. The kinetic studies of the purified enzyme revealed a K of 1 mg/mL for its substrate casein and V of 319 U/mL/min. The 3D structure of the purified enzyme was modeled by using SWISS-MODEL, and the quality of the structure was authenticated by assessing the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK server, which suggested that the enzyme was stable with good quality.Inhibitor, stability, electrophoretic, and bioinformatic studies suggested that the purified enzyme obtained from S. hydrogenans var.

Leptin has an important role in the regulation of energy balance and hunger. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal leptin levels with maternal obesity, gestational  gain (GWG), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the leptin gene, and the age-adjusted birth  of the child.Maternal leptin levels (n = 740) and SNPs (n = 504) were analyzed in blood samples taken within the Uppsala Biobank of Pregnant women at pregnancy weeks 16-19.Maternal leptin levels differed significantly between  mass index (BMI) groups. Normal  women had the lowest median leptin levels and levels increased with each BMI group. Leptin SNP genotype was not associated with leptin levels or BMI. There was also no association between maternal leptin levels and age-adjusted birth  of the child except for a negative association between leptin levels and birth  in the morbid obese group.Maternal BMI was identified as the best positive explanatory factor for maternal leptin levels. Leptin was a strong positive explanatory factor for GWG. Birth  of children of uncomplicated pregnancies was, however, dependent on maternal height, BMI, GWG, and parity but not leptin levels, except for in morbid obese women where a negative association between maternal leptin levels and birth  was found. We speculate that this indicates altered placental function, not manifested in pregnancy complication. We conclude that maternal leptin levels do not affect the birth  of the child more than BMI, GWG, and parity.© 2019 S.

The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy  change on the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate.Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy  change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy  of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy  change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis.Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy  gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy  loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy  gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m.These findings confirm that interpregnancy  change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum  loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy  before conceiving again.

The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal function (digestion and barrier), oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg /day prior to daily heat stress (40 °C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing inflammation in heat-stressed rats.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach detected QTL conditioning desirable fruit quality traits in papaya.For this, a linkage map was constructed comprising 219 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci across 10 linkage groups and covering 509 centiMorgan (cM). In total, 21 QTLs were identified for seven key fruit quality traits, including flesh sweetness, fruit , fruit length, fruit width skin freckle, flesh thickness and fruit firmness. Several QTL for flesh sweetness, fruit , length, width and firmness were stable across harvest years and individually explained up to 19.8% of the phenotypic variance of a particular trait. Where possible, candidate genes were proposed and explored further for their application to marker-assisted breeding.This study has extended knowledge on the inheritance and genetic control for key papaya physiological and fruit quality traits.

However, CF is a multi-organ disease and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance as many of these studies provide proof-of-concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extra-pulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction. In this concise review of the literature, we summarize the results of key publications that have evaluated the effects of CFTR modulators on  and growth, pancreatic function, the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems, sinus disease, bone disease, exercise tolerance, fertility, mental health, and immunity. While many of these studies have reported beneficial extra-pulmonary effects related to the use of ivacaftor (IVA) in CF patients with at least one gating mutation, most of the evidence is low or very low quality given the limited number of patients evaluated and the lack of a control group. Based on an even smaller number of studies evaluating the extra-pulmonary effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM-IVA), the benefits are less clear. While limited, these studies may provide the basis for future clinical trials to evaluate CFTR modulators on the extra-pulmonary manifestations of CF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655593>Lower than average HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in Lithuanian population.</a></h2><p>The aim of our study was to evaluate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) efflux capacity in healthy controls and patients with severe dyslipidemia. Evaluation of HDL function may be beneficial for better understanding of cardiovascular diseases, as well as for taking actions to minimize residual cardiovascular risk.During 2016-2017 a total of 93 participants - 48 (51.6%) women and 45 (48.4%) men - were included in this cross-sectional study. Data of 45 (48.4%) participants with severe dyslipidemia (SD) and 48 (51.6%) controls without dyslipidemia was used for statistical analysis. Total lipid panel, concentration of lipoprotein (a) and apolipoproteins were measured, data about cardiovascular risk factors were collected and detailed evaluation of HDL-C quality was performed for all patients.Increased HDL-C concentration was associated with higher ApoA1 (r = 0.866 in controls, r = 0.63 in SD group), ApoA2 (r = 0.41 in controls, r = 0.418 in SD group) and LDL-C concentrations (r = - 0.412 in SD group), lower ApoE (r = - 0.314 in SD group) and TG concentrations (r = - 0.38 in controls, r = - 0.608 in SD group), lower ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (r = - 0.567 in control group), below average HDL-C efflux capacity (r = - 0.335 in SD group), lower BMI (r = - 0.327 in controls, r = - 0.531 in SD group) and abdominal circumference (r = - 0.309 in women with SD). Below-average HDL-C efflux capacity was found in 67.7% (N = 63) of participants. It was more often found among patients with normal  or BMI 30-31 kg/m2. HDL-C efflux capacity was inversely associated with HDL-C concentration (r = - 0.228).Abnormal HDL function may be associated with residual cardiovascular risk in Lithuanian population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657637>Cooling of Lower Extremity Muscles According to Subcutaneous Tissue Thickness.</a></h2><p>When using an ice bag, previous researchers recommended cooling times based on the amount of subcutaneous tissue.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the diagnosis of a large sharp foreign  in the distal third of the neck by plain radiography and its retrieval through esophagotomy and subsequent survival of the fowl.An Aseel breed of domestic fowl () was referred to the surgery department with a history of swelling in the neck and subsequent anorexia since 24 h, but normal water intake. Radiological examination revealed a large fish bone in esophagus. Because of the sharp edges of the foreign  esophagotomy was performed rather than per os (po) retrieval or milking of the foreign  into the crop and performing an ingluviotomy.Esophagotomy was performed under local infiltration using a diluted solution of lignocaine. Fish bone pieces were retrieved from the esophagus of the fowl. The esophagotomy incision was closed in two layers using polyglactin 910 no: 3-0. Postoperatively, the owner was advised to administer Enrofloxacin po at 10 mg/kg  (BW)/day for seven days and Tramadol (10 mg/kg BW, BID) for three days in water. This case was followed up for 8 months. There were no complications noticed by the owner.It could be concluded that prompt intervention and surgical management may be necessary for retrieval of sharp esophageal foreign bodies lodged in the distal cervical esophagus of domestic fowl.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655626>A randomized controlled trial comparing lithium plus valproic acid versus lithium plus carbamazepine in young patients with type 1 bipolar disorder: the LICAVAL study.</a></h2><p>Treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) usually requires drug combinations. Combinations of lithium plus valproic acid (Li/VPA) and lithium plus carbamazepine (Li/CBZ) are used in clinical practice but were not previously compared in a head-to-head trial.The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of Li/VPA versus Li/CBZ in treating type 1 BD in any phase of illness in young individuals.LICAVAL was a randomized, unicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial that was conducted from January 2009 to December 2012 in a tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were between 18 and 35 years old and were followed up for 2 years. Our primary outcome was the number of participants achieving/maintaining response and remission during the acute and maintenance phases of BD treatment, respectively. Other outcomes assessed were symptom severity and adverse events throughout the study. In the analysis of the primary outcome, we compared groups by using a two-way repeated  analysis of variance and estimated effect sizes by using Cohen's d.Of our 64 participants, 36 were allocated to Li/VPA and 28 to Li/CBZ. Our sample was composed predominantly of females (66.6%) and the average age was 27.8 years. A total of 27 (45.0%) participants had depression, 17 (28.3%) had mania/hypomania, and 16 (26.7%) had a mixed state. We found no between-group differences in CGI-BP (Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for use in bipolar disorder) scores (P = 0.326) or in any other outcome. Side effects differed significantly between groups only in the first week of treatment (P = 0.021), and there were more side effects in the Li/VPA group.

This is a community-based key informant (KI) method survey of children with CP in the southwest regency of Sumba Island, Indonesia (child population∼152 471). Children with suspected CP identified by trained community volunteers (KIs) underwent a detailed neurodevelopmental assessment by a multidisciplinary medical assessment team to confirm diagnosis of CP. Anthropometric measurements were taken,  scores were calculated, and nutritional status was determined following the World Health Organization guideline. Descriptive analyses were performed, multivariable linear regression model was fitted to identify potential predictors of malnutrition.  One hundred and thirty children with CP aged <18 years were included in the study. The majority were severely underweight (78.8%) and severely stunted (85.9%). Severe malnutrition was overrepresented among young children, children who had spastic tri/quadriplegia, Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III-V, had at least one associated impairment, speech impairment and/or swallowing difficulties. Age and presence of visual impairment were found to be significantly associated with -for-age  score (i.e., underweight) whereas, epilepsy was significantly associated with the height-for-age  score (i.e., stunting) when adjusted for other covariates.  The substantial-high burden of malnutrition among children with CP in remote Sumba Island highlights their vulnerability to poor health-related outcomes. There is an urgent need for nutritional rehabilitation services to avert such consequences among children with CP in low and middle-income countries like Indonesia. Implications for rehabilitation Malnutrition among children with cerebral palsy (CP) is alarmingly high in the remote Sumba island of Indonesia. Children with severe gross motor function limitations or spastic tri/quadriplegia had the most severe malnutrition. There is an urgent need for rehabilitation services including nutrition and feeding interventions for children with CP in low and middle-income countries like Indonesia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658128>Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty in 109 Consecutive Children and Adolescents With Obesity: Two-Year Outcomes of a New Modality.</a></h2><p>Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) uses full-thickness sutures that restrict the stomach to a sleeve-like configuration. There is no published evidence on endoscopic tissue apposition techniques in pediatric patients. In this article, we report our ESG experience with the first 109 pediatric patients with obesity who underwent ESG under our care.ESG was offered as a day-case procedure under a standardized protocol and clinical pathway that included surgical, medical, and endoscopic modalities for the treatment of pediatric and adult obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: .The 109 patients in this study had a baseline  mass index and age of 33.0 ± 4.7 and 17.6 ± 2.2 (range: 10-21) years, respectively. Ninety-nine (90.8%) were females. The mean procedure time was 61 ± 19 minutes. The mean % total  loss at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 14.4% ± 6.5%, 16.2% ± 8.3%, 15.4% ± 9.2%, and 13.7% ± 8.0%, respectively. Fourteen adolescents visited the ambulatory clinic for analgesia. One patient (aged 19.8 years) requested removal of endoscopic stitches due to abdominal pain, and another underwent Redo-ESG for insufficient  loss. There were no blood transfusions, emergency admissions, mortality, or significant morbidity.In this first study to date on ESG in pediatric patients, we observed that the procedure is safe and effective in children and adolescents with obesity.

Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry  and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino acids were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino acid in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657558>Green Analysis: High Throughput Analysis of Emerging Pollutants in Plant Sap by Freeze-Thaw-Centrifugal Membrane Filtration Sample Preparation - HPLC-MS/MS Analysis.</a></h2><p>Emerging and fugitive contaminants (EFCs) released to our biosphere have caused a legacy- and continuing-threat to human and ecological health, contaminating air, water, and soil. Polluted media are closely linked to food security through plants, especially agricultural crops. However, measuring EFC's in plant tissues remains difficult, and high-throughput screening is of greater challenge. A novel rapid freeze-thaw/centrifugation extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis was developed for high-throughput quantification of eleven EFCs with diverse chemical properties, including: estriol, codeine, oxazepam, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine, bisphenol-A, triclosan, caffeine, carbamazepine, lincomycin, and DEET, in three representative crops, corn, tomato, and wheat. The internal aqueous solution, i.e. sap, is liberated via a freeze/thaw cycle, and separated from macromolecules utilizing molecular  cut-off membrane centrifugal filtration. Detection limits ranged from 0.01 μg L-1 to 2.0 μg L-1. Recoveries of spiked analytes in three species ranged from 83.7% to 109%. Developed methods can rapidly screen EFCs in agriculture crops and can assess pollutant distribution at contaminated sites and gain insight on EFCs transport in plants to assess transmembrane migration in vascular organisms. The findings contribute significantly to environmental research, food security, and human health, as it assesses the first step of potential entry into the food chain, that being transmembrane migration and plant uptake, the primary barrier between polluted waters or soils and our food.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656493>Predictors of recurrent TB in sputum smear and culture positive adults: a prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>To explore simple inexpensive non-culture based predictors of recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).HIV-infected and uninfected adults with the first episode of smear positive, culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in a high tuberculosis burden country.A nested prospective cohort study of participants with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) presenting to a hospital out-patient clinic.A total of 630 TB culture confirmed participants were followed up for eighteen months of which 57 (9%) developed recurrent recurrent TB.

The feather shaft is an important connective unit, made of a lightweight material, which also contributes to aiding flight. The shaft can withstand loads from different directions and has outstanding compression resistance. In this study, the microstructure and composition of the A. fabalis feather shaft were observed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and its compression resistance was studied by compression testing. The results indicated that the mechanical property of the shaft is related to its microstructure. Compression testing verified that the primary feathers had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the secondaries, and finally the alulae. Under the same conditions, the specific energy absorption of the three feather types was 5.96, 5.02, and 3.17 J/g, respectively. With increasing moisture content, the rachis was softened and the energy absorption was reduced. At low moisture content, the specific energy absorption of the primaries was reduced to 1.03 J/g, that of the secondaries was reduced to 1.72 J/g, and that of the alulae to 0.39 J/g.

Adherence to recommendations (yes/no) for physical activity, fruit and vegetable servings/day, avoiding tobacco, and healthy  was summed to create an overall lifestyle quality score. Polytomous logistic regression was used to evaluate correlates of good (reference group), moderate, and poor overall lifestyle quality. Potential correlates included sociodemographic characteristics, cancer-related factors, and indicators of health and well-being.CRC survivors with poor adherence were 2- to 3.4-fold significantly more likely to report multiple comorbidities, poor physical functioning, fatigue, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and poor social participation. In multivariable analyses, poor physical functioning was the only significant correlate of poor adherence to lifestyle recommendations, compared to good adherence [OR (95% CI) 3.4 (1.8-6.4)]. The majority of survivors, 71% and 78%, indicated interest in receiving information on exercise and eating a healthy diet, respectively.Future lifestyle promotion programs for CRC survivors should carefully consider indicators of physical and psychosocial health and well-being, especially poor physical functioning, in the design, recruitment, and implementation of these health programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660294>Antitumor activity of  extract against benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung tumorigenesis in Swiss Albino mice.</a></h2><p>Lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates among various types of cancer and is the most frequent cancer in the world. The incidence of lung cancer is increasing rapidly, in parallel with an increased incidence of smoking. Effective chemoprevention may be an alternative strategy to control the incidence of lung cancer. Thus, the objective of current work was to ascertain the possible preventive and therapeutic efficacies of  extract in a mouse model of lung tumorigenesis and its cytotoxicity toward the A549 human lung cancer cell line. Lung tumorigenesis was induced by the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene (50 mg/kg b.w.) twice per week to Swiss albino mice for 4 weeks. Benzo(a)pyrene-treated mice were orally administered  (300 mg/kg , 5 days/week) for 2 weeks before or 9 weeks after the first benzo(a)pyrene dose, for a total of 21 weeks. At the end of the administration period, various parameters were measured in the serum and lung tissues. The results revealed that the oral administration of benzo(a)pyrene resulted in increases in relative lung , serum levels of tumor markers (ADA, AHH, and LDH), and the inflammatory marker NF-κB, and a decreased total antioxidant capacity compared with the control. In addition, decreased levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, with a concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation, metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-12), and the angiogenic marker VEGF were detected in lung tissues. Moreover, benzo(a)pyrene administration induced the upregulation of PKCα, COX-2, and Bcl-2 expression, with the downregulation of BAX and caspase-3 expression.  treatment alleviated all alterations in these parameters, which was further confirmed by the histopathological analysis of lung tissues. The findings of the current work provide the first verification of the preventive and therapeutic potentials of  extract against benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656040>Direct quantification of intact FIM in monkey plasma using a selective chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method: Application in a pharmacokinetic study.</a></h2><p>FIM protein, which consists of 155 amino acids, was developed as a novel GLP-1 analog to reduce blood glucose, and pharmacodynamic results showed that it had a certain effect when used in treating Alzheimer's disease. The molecular  of FIM is 16304Da. In theory, the concentration of FIM in biological samples should be determined by the LBA method or indirectly quantified using LC-MS/MS instrumentation. However, the above methods were complex and time-consuming. In this study, we successfully developed a simpler LC-MS/MS method for directly quantifying the intact FIM protein in monkey plasma for the first time. The chromatographic separation of FIM was achieved by using an InertSustain Bio C18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (A)-water containing 0.1% formic acid (B) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Good linearity was observed in the concentration range of 5~500 ng/mL (r >0.99). The intra- and inter-day precision (expressed as relative standard deviation, RSD) of FIM was 2.30%~12.8% and 7.30%~13.2%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracy (expressed as a relative error, RE) was -12.7%~6.55% and -10.1%~0.892%, respectively.

Throughput is traditionally limited by the need for deoxygenation in radical polymerizations, but advances in photopolymerization now provide opportunities for "in-air" polymerizations. Here, we have developed a protocol using liquid handling robots (or multichannel pipettes) with blue light photolysis of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer agents and tertiary amine deoxygenation to enable the synthesis of polymer libraries in industry-standard 96-well plates with no specialized infrastructure and no degassing step. The roles of solvents and amine deoxygenators are explored to optimize the polymerization, particularly to look at alternatives to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for hydrophobic monomer (co)polymerization. DMSO is shown to aid the degassing process but is not easy to remove and hence prevents isolation of pure polymers. In contrast, using dioxane in-plate evaporation or precipitation of the tertiary amine allowed isolation of polymers in-plate. This removed all reaction components yielding pure polymers, which is not easily achieved with systems using metal catalysts and secondary reductants, such as ascorbic acid. As an example of the throughput, in just under 40 h, 392 polymers were synthesized and subsequently analyzed direct from plates by a 96-well plate sampling size exclusion chromatography system to demonstrate reproducibility. Due to less efficient degassing in dioxane (compared to DMSO), the molecular  and dispersity control were limited in some cases (with acrylates giving the lowest dispersities), but the key aim of this system is to access hundreds of polymers quickly and in a format needed to enable testing. This method enables easy exploration of chemical space and development of screening libraries to identify hits for further study using precision polymerization methods.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646118>A review of the evidence for alternative and complementary medical approaches in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</a></h2><p>The use of complementary and alternative medicine approaches has increased in the recent years.

Herein, we report a case of A-P fistula due to stab chest assessed by two- and three-dimensional (3D) imaging.A 30-year-old man presented with a history of being stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver. The chest wall laceration was sutured, an intercostal drain inserted for a haemopneumothorax, and he was subsequently discharged. He presented 3 weeks later with exertional dyspnoea, fever, rigours, and loss of . On examination, he had a wide pulse pressure and a harsh continuous murmur in the 2nd left intercostal space associated with a palpable thrill. Blood tests revealed raised infective markers and anaemia. All blood cultures were sterile. On echocardiography, the aortic and pulmonary valve was severely damaged, with suspicion of superimposed vegetations secondary to IE. There was severe aortic and pulmonary valve regurgitation. A fistulous connection was noted between the aorta and main pulmonary artery, just below the commissure adjoining the right and left coronary sinus of the aortic valve. On 3D imaging, the defect was quantified. The patient was subsequently referred for aortic and pulmonary valve replacement and closure of the A-P fistula. The presence of multiple vegetations was confirmed intraoperatively. He also received a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics.We have described a rare case of an A-P fistula due to a stab wound to the chest complicated by IE. In a patient with stab wound to the chest, a high index of suspicion of cardiac involvement must be maintained, and a careful search for intracardiac shunts must be made on echocardiography, prior to discharge. Furthermore, in addition to two-dimensional imaging, 3D imaging proved useful in providing a comprehensive assessment of the morphology of the lesion prior to surgery.© The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study was further investigated the endocrine disrupting effect of NP exposure to F2 generation male mice. Mice were divided into 2 groups; (1) CON, control animals and (2) NP-50 (50 μg/L), animals were treated with NP via drinking water. NP exposures were continuously conducted from parental pre-mating period until the postnatal day (PND) 55 of F2 offsprings. Mice were sacrificed on PND 55 and the reproductive tissue  were measured. The initial (at PND 21) and terminal (PND 55)   of the NP-50 group animals were not significantly different from those of control group animals. NP exposure fail to induce a significant  change of the testes, seminal vesicle and prostate except absolute epididymal  (<0.05). However, pathohistological studies revealed that NP-treated F2 animals showed evident decrease in seminiferous tubule diameters, reduced luminal area and number of germ cells. Also, sloughing morphologies in the tubules were notable. In the caudal epididymis, fewer mature sperms and swollen epithelial cells were found in the NP-treated group. The present study demonstrated that the subchronic low-dose NP exposure induced pathohistological abnormalities in testis and epididymis of F2 mice, and we assumed that these 'qualitative' changes in reproductive tissues could be derived from the epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, altered DNA accessibility and chromatin structure. Further studies are needed to achieve a better understanding on the multi- or trans-generational effects of NP on the reproductive health and a human application.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656282>Effect of olive oil consumption on aging in a senescence-accelerated mice-prone 8 (SAMP8) model.</a></h2><p>Background : Mediterranean diets have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer, vascular illnesses, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Olive oil is the primary fat source in the Mediterranean diet ; however, only a few studies have investigated the effect of olive oil on aging. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether consumption of olive oil significantly influences aging and memory in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8). Methods : SAMP8 and senescence-accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were fed either 7% soy oil or 1% olive oil and 6% soy oil during a six-month study period. Reduction in memory in passive avoidance learning was examined after two months from the initiation of the experiment. Results : The  of organs including the liver, kidney, spleen, and fat tissue changed significantly and memory performance was reduced in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 mice. There were no significant differences in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice; however, blood triglyceride level decreased significantly in SAMP8 mice fed on olive oil. Conclusions : These results suggest that consuming olive oil may not have a protective role in aging and memory recall, but beneficial effects may be related to improvement in lipid metabolism. J.

Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing  loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (△SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; =0.001) or in DBP (△DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (=0.018), months 12 (=0.007), and months 24 (=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all  values >0.05). Our data indicate that genetic susceptibility may affect BP changes in response to -loss diet interventions, and protein intake may modify the genetic associations with changes in BP.

A 21-year-old female presented with abdominal distention, diarrhea, nausea, fever,  loss, and night sweats. Serum CA-125 level was 563 U/L (normal range: <35 U/L) and other tumor markers were within normal range. Radiologic studies showed massive ascites, smooth minimal thickening and increased contrast enhancement of peritoneum, omental nodularities, hepatomegaly, and right pleural effusion. No underlying malignancy that could cause this condition was detected clinically and radiologically. Ultrasound-guided omental tru-cut biopsy was performed to exclude carcinomatosis peritonei. Histopathologic examination showed small-medium-sized granulomas with caseous necrosis. Molecular microbiology tests of biopsy specimens confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Major control  involve vaccination which requires continuous harmonization owing to antigenic drift. The present study focused on assessing the protective efficacy of an inactivated recombinant equine influenza virus (rgEIV) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Montanide Pet Gel in murine model. The rgEIV was generated using reverse genetics by incorporating HA and NA segments from EIV/H3N8, clade 2 - Florida sublineage in an A/WSN/33 /H1N1 backbone and inactivated by formalin. The vaccine was prepared by mixing inactivated rgEIV with Montanide Pet Gel adjuvant followed by intranasal inoculation into BALB/c mice intranasally. The immune responses and protective efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated by measurement of antibody titer, immunoglobulin subtyping, cytokines, clinical signs and pathological lesions after immunization and challenge with wild EIV. Serology and cytokine expression pattern indicated that the vaccine activated mixed Th1- and Th2-like responses of vaccine. Booster immunization stimulated strong antibody responses (HAI titre: 192 ± 28.6) at 42 days post immunization and the predominant antibody subtype was IgG1. Upregulation of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-2 levels indicates effective induction of Th1 type response. We found that vaccination has protected mice against equine influenza virus challenge as adjudged through a lack of nonappearance of visible clinical signs of disease, no loss of  loss, reduced pathology in the lungs and markedly reduced virus shedding from the respiratory tract. Therefore, we conclude that recombinant EIV vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Montanide Pet Gel could aid in quick harmonization of the vaccines through replacement of HA and NA genes for control of EIV outbreaks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655991>Chemokine Expression in Neutrophils and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Cells Obtained during Abdominoplasty from Patients with Obesity and Normal .</a></h2><p>The study was aimed at assessing the role of chemokines in inflammatory changes in tissue following abdominoplasty.

A systematic query-based search was performed on PubMed, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library to identify eligible records that quantitatively measured  change after interventions. This review included six RCTs that reported different strategies for  loss achievement: increasing daily water intake, replacement of caloric beverages with water, and premeal waterload. All the studies showed a  loss effect after follow-up, ranged from -0.4 kg to -8.8 kg with a mean percentage of  loss of 5.15%. The most effective intervention among the studies was the replacement of caloric beverages with water. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of  loss was rated low to moderate. The main limitation of these results is the short-term follow up-period.

Herein, we developed a novel reversible-deactivation radical polymerization based on the strong and selective fluorine-fluorine interaction, allowing chain-transfer agents spontaneously differentiate into two groups that take charges of chain growth and reversible-deactivation of growing chains, respectively. This method enables dramatically improved livingness of propagation, providing UHMW polymers with surprisingly narrow molecular  distribution ( Đ ~ 1.1) from a variety of fluorinated (meth)acrylates and acrylamide at quantitative conversions under visible-light irradiation.

To this end, thiolated chitosan-hyaluronic acid composite polymeric complex next-generation of the periodontal membrane was manufactured by solvent casting method. FTIR spectroscopic analysis displayed successful immobilization of thiol groups on the manufactured thiolated periodontal membrane. Moreover, XRD, DSC, AFM and TGA of the membrane confirmed the compatibility of ingredients and modifications in surface chemistry. The thiolated periodontal film was also investigated in terms of thickness,  uniformity, water-uptake capacity, drug content, pH, entrapment efficiency, lysozymal degradation and release patterns. Also, mucoadhesion profile was explored on gingival mucosa. The immobilized thiol groups on thiolated chitosan and thiolated hyaluronate were found to be 168 ± 11 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) and 189 ± 8 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) respectively. Swelling capacity of the thiolated periodontal membrane was significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. The obtained thiolated membrane depicted 3 -old higher mucoadhesive features as compared to the un-modified membrane. In vitro release kinetics indicated approximately more than 80% prolonged release within 7 days. Mechanical strength of the Thiolated bandage was also significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. Ex-vivo retention study revealed enhanced retention of thiolated membrane as compared to unmodified membrane. In-vitro antimicrobial studies demonstrated that thiolated membrane could efficiently kill Porphyromonas gingivalis cells as compared to the native membrane. Moreover, ex-vivo biodegradation results indicated that 90% of the thiolated membrane was biodegradable in 28 days.

Radiotherapy is the main method to treat esophageal cancer; however, it concurrently leads to malnutrition. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is superior to three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dosimetry and clinical outcomes. In this cohort study, we aimed to compare the effect of 3D-CRT and IMRT on malnutrition status.We retrospectively included 79 esophageal cancer patients (IMRT: n=27, 3D-CRT: n=52) who received radiotherapy. We collected nutrition indexes at the beginning, the second week, and the end of radiotherapy. Paired-T test was used to evaluate the nutrition status during radiotherapy in each group. Chi-square test and independent-sample -test were applied to compare the dynamic changes of indexes between IMRT and 3D-CRT groups.The baselines of the two groups are comparable. Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score, , BMI, hemoglobin, lymphocyte, total protein, and albumin values were significantly reduced during radiotherapy in both groups. The dynamic changes of nutrition indexes during radiotherapy were not significantly different between the IMRT and 3D-CRT groups.

Renal resistive index (RI) by using renal Doppler can be a helpful tool in detecting functional alterations in renal hemodynamics. This study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents with type 1 DM. They were further subdivided into two equal subgroups: group 1 with type 1 DM and normo-albuminuria [urinary albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 hours], and group 2 with type 1 DM and hyper-albuminuria (increased UAE >30 mg/24 hours). There were 37 males (37%) and 63 females (63%); their mean ages were 13.6±2.53 (range, 10-19) years and mean disease duration was 8.867±2.260 (range, 5-13) years. Progressive increase in RI was significantly associated with increased disease duration more than 10 years, elevated serum HbA1c more than 7.5% and early pubertal stages. While not significantly related to sex, , height, blood pressure or serum lipid profile, diabetic micro-vascular complications (nephropathy and sensory neuropathy) were more prevalent among patients with RI more than 0.58.

Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced , autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal inflammation. In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer colitis, Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced , and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous inflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660682>Early clinical experience with varian halcyon V2 linear accelerator: Dual-isocenter IMRT planning and delivery with portal dosimetry for gynecological cancer treatments.</a></h2><p>Varian Halcyon linear accelerator version 2 (The Halcyon 2.0) was recently released with new upgraded features. The aim of this study was to report our clinical experience with Halcyon 2.0 for a dual-isocenter intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning and delivery for gynecological cancer patients and examine the feasibility of in vivo portal dosimetry.Twelve gynecological cancer patients were treated with extended-field IMRT technique using two isocenters on Halcyon 2.0 to treat pelvis and pelvic/or para-aortic nodes region. The prescription dose was 45 Gy in 25 fractions (fxs) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose of 55 or 57.5 Gy in 25 fxs to involved nodes. All treatment plans, pretreatment patient-specific QA and treatment delivery records including daily in vivo portal dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. For in vivo daily portal dosimetry analysis, each fraction was compared to the reference baseline (1st fraction) using gamma analysis criteria of 4 %/4 mm with 90% of total pixels in the portal image planar dose.All 12 extended-field IMRT plans met the planning criteria and delivered as planned (a total of 300 fractions). Conformity Index (CI) for the primary target was achieved with the range of 0.99-1.14. For organs at risks, most were well within the dose volume criteria. Treatment delivery time was from 5.0 to 6.5 min. Interfractional in vivo dose variation exceeded gamma analysis threshold for 8 fractions out of total 300 (2.7%). These eight fractions were found to have a relatively large difference in small bowel filling and SSD change at the isocenter compared to the baseline.Halcyon 2.0 is effective to create complex extended-field IMRT plans using two isocenters with efficient delivery.

Higher LGB climate scores (i.e., more supportive environments) were associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity among all students. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among female students suggested that the association between LGB climate scores and  status was similar to the overall female sample. Sexual orientation-stratified findings among male students showed a more complex relationship between LGB climate scores and  status. More work is needed to disentangle the observed associations, and to investigate other contextual factors, like state- and city-level policies, social networks and norms, and individual resiliency within these contexts to better understand the contextual influences on sexual orientation disparities in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656734>Production and purification of laccase by  sp. using millet husks and its pesticide degradation application.</a></h2><p>Lignocellulosic agricultural bi-products, pearl millet (PM) and finger millet (FM) husks, were used for the production of laccase using  sp. PS under solid-state fermentation (SSF). Abiotic variables such as substrate (PM, FM) concentration (1-5%), incubation time (24-96 h) and pH (5-10) were optimized using Response surface methodology (RSM) to maximize the laccase production. The predicted model showed maximum laccase activity of 402 U/mL appearing after 96 h of incubation with PM 2.0 g/L and FM 1.5 g/L at pH 7.0. Single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed homogeneity of the laccase with a molecular  of 63-75 kDa. The partially purified laccase effectively degraded the pesticides (Tricel, 71.8 ± 3.5 and Phoskill 77.3 ± 3.4%) within 5 days of incubation (40 °C) in pH 7.0. The pesticide degradation was further confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the chromatograms showed the single dominant peaks at retention time 2.482 (tricel) and 2.608 (phoskill) min, respectively. Pesticide-degrading laccase was produced by  sp.

Using accelerometry to develop a better understanding of the complex gait of these agile canines may help to eliminate injury contributing factors. This study used a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer to characterise the galloping of thirty-one greyhounds on five different race tracks. The dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior accelerations were analysed in both the time and frequency domains. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Morlet wavelet transform were applied to signals. The time-domain signals were synced with the corresponding high frame rate videos of the race. It was observed that the acceleration peaks in the dorsal-ventral accelerations correspond to the hind-leg strikes which were noted to be fifteen times the greyhound's . The FFT analysis showed that the stride frequencies in all tracks were around 3.5 Hz. The Morlet wavelet analysis also showed a reduction in both the frequency and magnitude of signals, which suggests a speed reduction throughout the race. Also, by detecting abrupt changes along the track, the wavelet analysis highlighted potentially hazardous locations on the track. In conclusion, the methods applied in this research contribute to animal safety and welfare by eliminating the factors leading to injuries through optimising the track design and surface type.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658724>Valorization of Red Grape Pomace Waste Using Polyethylene Glycol and Fibrolytic Enzymes: Physiological and Meat Quality Responses in Broilers.</a></h2><p>The amount of grape pomace (GP) waste that can be included as a functional feed in broiler diets is limited by anti-nutritional compounds such as fiber and condensed tannins. This study evaluated the effect of pre-treating GP with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a cellulolytic enzyme mixture on physiological and meat quality parameters of broilers. Cobb 500 broilers (249.2 ± 20.31 g live-) were reared on five isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets: 1. Commercial chicken diet (CON); 2. CON containing untreated GP at 100 g/kg (dGP); 3. CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with PEG (50 g/kg) (dPEG); 4. CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with enzyme (1 g/kg) (ENZ); and 5. CON containing 100 g/kg GP pre-treated with PEG (50 g/kg) and enzyme (1 g/kg) (PENZ). Overall  gains were similar in broilers reared on the CON, dPEG, ENZ and PENZ diets but lower in dGP chickens. The meat of birds reared on dPEG, ENZ, dGP and CON had a similar water-holding capacity, which was lower than in PENZ chickens. Diets influenced the size of duodenum, ileum, jejunum and caeca. Polyethylene glycol treatment promoted similar  gains and hot carcass  as the commercial control diet, suggesting that the anti-nutritional effects of condensed tannins were successfully ameliorated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656735>Physiological response of tomato plant to chitosan-immobilized aggregated  CBMB20 inoculation under salinity stress.</a></h2><p>The use of plant growth promoting bacteria as bioinoculant to alleviate salt stress is a sustainable and eco-friendly approach in agriculture. However, the maintenance of the bacterial population in the soil for longer period is a major concern. In the present study, chitosan-immobilized aggregated  CBMB20 was used as a bioinoculant to improve tomato plant ( Mill.) growth under salt stress. The chitosan-immobilized aggregated  CBMB20 was able to enhance plant dry , nutrient uptake (N, P, K and Mg), photosynthetic efficiency and decrease electrolyte leakage under salt stress conditions. The oxidative stress exerted by elevated levels of salt stress was also alleviated by the formulated bioinoculant, as it up-regulated the antioxidant enzyme activities and enhanced the accumulation of proline which acts as an osmolyte. The chitosan-immobilized aggregated  CBMB20 was able to decrease the excess Na influx into the plant cells and subsequently decreasing the Na/K ratio to improve tomato plant growth under salt stress conditions. Therefore, it is proposed that the chitosan-immobilized aggregated .  CBMB20 could be used as a bioinoculant to promote the plant growth under salt stress conditions.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658268>Male long-distance migrant turned sedentary; The West European pond bat (Myotis dasycneme) alters their migration and hibernation behaviour.</a></h2><p>During autumn in the temperate zone, insectivorous male bats face a profound energetic challenge, as in the same period they have to make energy choices related to hibernation, mating and migration. To investigate these energetic trade-offs, we compared the  mass of male and female pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) through the summer season, characterized the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compared their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Towards the end of summer, males began losing  whilst females were simultaneously accumulating fat, suggesting that males were pre-occupied with mating. We also found evidence for a recent adaptation to this energetic trade-off, males have colonised winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas, which has consequently led to a change in the migration patterns for the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist in raising offspring, males have ample time to restore their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer range not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season of the individual male. Our findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655994>Combined Effects of Hypokinesia and Ambient Temperature on Heart Remodeling in Normotensive and Hypertensive Rats.</a></h2><p>We studied the effect of hypokinesia combined with cold exposure on morphological parameters of the heart in Wistar-Kyoto rats and rats with spontaneous genetically determined hypertension (SHR). The pathological processes developing in the heart of white laboratory rats significantly affected cardiac function and manifested in the deterioration of the morphological structure of the heart: reduction of heart , thinning of the free wall of the left ventricle. These changes indicate transition to a lower energy level of functioning. At the same time, hypertrophy of the right free wall develops in both rat lines.

We divided four-week-old BABL/c mice into control (Ctrl), antibiotic exposure (Abx), Lactobacillus plantarum PC-170 (PC), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) group and the Abx, LGG, and PC group received an one-week antibiotic/antibiotic + probiotic treatment. The fecal microbiota and the expression of splenic cytokines were determined. Following the ceftriaxone treatment, the  gain of Abx was delayed compared with others. The ceftriaxone treatment significantly decreased the alpha-diversity of the fecal microbiota and altered the fecal microbiota but LGG and PC can partly alleviate the effect. At the end of the study, the microbial community of LGG and PC group were more similar to Ctrl compared with Abx group. The results indicated that ceftriaxone could significantly alter intestinal microbiota. Lactobacilli might alleviate the side effects of antibiotics by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660867>Changes in waist circumference and risk of all-cause and CVD mortality: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk) cohort study.</a></h2><p> of abdominal adiposity are strongly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, data are limited and conflicting regarding the consequences of changes in  fat distribution. The main aims of this paper are to investigate the association between changes in waist circumference (WC) and all-cause and CVD mortality and to examine these changes in relation to concurrent changes in .The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) study recruited 25,639 participants between 1993 and 1997, aged 39-79, a number of whom also attended a second examination (1998-2000), and were followed up to 2016 for mortality. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had WC,  and height measurements at both time-points; those with a self-reported history of CVD or cancer,  mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 or missing data on covariates were excluded, leaving 12,337 participants for analyses. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 16.4 (15.7, 17.2) years. Hazard Ratios (HRs) for all-cause (2866 deaths) and CVD mortality (822 deaths), by categories of WC change, were determined using Cox proportional hazards analyses.After multivariable adjustment, the HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality for men and women with a WC gain (WCG) >  5 cm were 1.51 (1.29-1.75) and 1.25 (1.06-1.46) respectively. For CVD mortality in men and women with a WCG >  5 cm, the HRs were 1.84 (1.39-2.43) and 1.15 (0.85-1.55) respectively. In analyses of concurrent changes in WC and , the greatest risk (HRs) (95% CIs) in men occurred with  loss and WCG: 1.80 (1.13-2.86) for all-cause and 2.22 (1.03-4.82) for CVD mortality. In women, the greatest risk for both all-cause (HR 1.50 (1.16-1.95)) and CVD mortality (HR 1.81 (1.15-2.85)) was observed in those with  loss and maintenance of WC (WCM).Objectively measured WCG > 5 cm, was associated with subsequent higher total mortality risk and higher CVD mortality risk in men.

At 28 days of age, sixty broilers were randomly divided into the control group (25 ± 2 °C; 24 h/day) and the heat stress group (36 ± 2 °C; 8 h/day lasted for 1 week or 2 weeks). Fifteen broilers per group were respectively euthanized, and some samples were respectively collected from the control and the heat stress groups at the end of the 1st week or the 2nd week of heat stress. A typical heat stress response has been observed at this temperature. Compared with the control group, the birds subjected to heat stress at the end of the 1st week reduced (P ＜ 0.05)  (BW), average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), the activity of serum antioxidant enzyme and content of glutathione (GSH), while increased (P ＜ 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), serum corticosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, when the heat stress lasted for the end of the 2nd week, there was no significant difference (P ＞ 0.05) in ADFI, ADG, FCR and serum contents of corticosterone, MDA and GSH. Regardless of duration of thermal stress, the localization of ABCG2 protein had no change. Moreover, heat stress also did not affect (P ＞ 0.05) the IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in the pectorales, crureus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and spleen, while significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05) the corresponding tissues ROS production at the end of the 1st week of heat stress. In contrast, at the end of the 2nd week of heat stress, IOD of the ABCG2 positive portion and the expression of the ABCG2 mRNA in heat stress group significantly increased (P ＜ 0.05), while the corresponding tissues ROS production had no difference (P ＞ 0.05) compared to the control group. Collectively, duration of thermal stress affects growth performance, serum oxidative stress indices, and the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production of broiler tissues in a time-dependent manner. There is a negative correlation between the expression of ABCG2 and the ROS production in the corresponding tissues under heat stress.Copyright © 2019.

Early screening and prevention of obesity is critical for averting associated morbidity, disability, and mortality. Ethiopia has been using the international (WHO's) BMI cut-off for diagnosing obesity even though its validity among Ethiopian population was questioned. To address this problem, a new  mass index cut-off was developed for Ethiopian adults using population-specific data. However, its performance in diagnosing obesity has not been validated. Therefore, this study determined the performance of the newly developed Ethiopian and World Health Organization (WHO) BMI cut-offs in detecting obesity among Ethiopian adults.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 704 employees of Jimma University from February to April 2015. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique based on their payroll. Data on sociodemographic variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters including  and height were measured according to WHO recommendation.  fat percentage (BF%) was measured using the air displacement plethysmography (ADP) after calibration of the machine. The diagnostic accuracy of the WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) for obesity in both sexes and Ethiopian BMI cut-off (> 22.2 kg/m for males and >  24.5 kg/m for females) were compared to obesity diagnosed using ADP measured  fat percentage (> 35% for females and >  25% for males). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa agreements were determined to validate the performance of the BMI cut-offs.In males, WHO BMI cut-off has a sensitivity of 5.3% and specificity of 99.4% (Kappa = 0.047) indicating a slight agreement. However, the Ethiopian cut-off showed a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 87.7% (Kappa = 0.752) indicating a substantial agreement. Similarly, in females, the WHO BMI cut-off showed a sensitivity of 46.9%, while its specificity was 100% (Kappa = 0.219) showing a fair agreement. The Ethiopian BMI cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity 80.0% and a specificity 95.6% (Kappa = 0.701) showing a substantial agreement. The WHO BMI cut-off underestimated the prevalence of obesity by a maximum of 73.7% and by a minimum of 28.3% among males, while the values for underestimation ranged from 31.4-54.1% in females. The misclassification was minimal using the newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off. The prevalence of obesity was underestimated by a maximum of 9.2% and overestimated by a maximum of 6.2%. The WHO BMI cut-off failed to identify nearly half (46.6%) of Ethiopian adults who met the criteria for obesity using BF% in the overall sample.The findings suggest that WHO BMI cut-off (≥ 30 kg/m) is not appropriate for screening obesity among Ethiopian adults. The newly developed Ethiopian BMI cut-off showed a better performance with excellent sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and agreement indicating the diagnostic significance of it use as a simple, cost-effective, and valid indicator in clinical and community setups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657577>Multi-functional polymer sponge with molecule recognition: facile mechanic induced separation.</a></h2><p>Polymer sponges with molecular recognition provide a facile approach to water purification and industrial separation with easy-operation, but its fabrication still challenging because some critical issues of selective adsorption, high mechanical strength, and easy collection/re-use are difficult to be achieved in one material. Here, inspired by natural sponges, a novel of multi-functional polymer sponges was developed which were fabricated by ice-templating with multi-functional amine (PEI) and diepoxide cross-linker (PEG-DE) for highly efficient harvesting of dyes and simultaneous pure water recovery both in mechanic pressing and filtration processes. The as-prepared sponge (SP-1) was further modified by poly(caffeic acid) through a simple dipping-crosslinking process to obtain the hybrid polymer sponge (SP-2), which showed higher compress strength than SP-1. These sponges possessed a crosslinked three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure with quick water absorbing property over ten times of their own  within 20 seconds directed by capillary. The adsorption behavior of the obtained polymer sponges to eleven hydrophilic dyes was studied in detail by mechanic induced separation. All these polymer sponges exhibited the high selective adsorption to hydrophilic dyes in water. For example, SP-1 has high adsorption capacity over 150 μmol/g to Erythrosin B (ETB), which is 20 times higher than that of Calcein. With the modified poly(caffeic acid) layer, SP-2 exhibited a different adsorption properties for Methylene Blue (MB, 180 μmol/g) to SP-1(~0 μmol/g), indicating that the tailorable structures of sponge can regulate their selectivity to guest molecules. Based on the unique recognition to guest molecules, the methodology of dynamic separation of dye's mixture in water was demonstrated by using these sponges through mechanical pressing or fast filtration, which provides a facile alternative with easy-operation for water purification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658122>Increased Risk of Osteoporotic Fracture in Postgastrectomy Gastric Cancer Survivors Compared With Matched Controls: A Nationwide Cohort Study in Korea.</a></h2><p>Gastrectomy can lead to bone loss. Previous studies have suggested that there is an increased risk of fracture in gastric cancer survivors. However, these studies were performed without proper control groups. Therefore, we used Korean national health insurance data to compare the fracture risk in gastric cancer survivors who received gastrectomy to that of the general population.A total of 133,179 gastric cancer survivors were included and matched to noncancer controls using 1:1 propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of fracture between the gastric cancer survivors and matched controls. We also examined the factors associated with fracture in gastric cancer survivors.Compared with the matched controls, gastric cancer survivors had an elevated risk of osteoporotic fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-1.70), which was most prominent in patients who underwent total gastrectomy (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.96-2.44) and adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.81-2.23). In multivariate analysis, anemia was significantly associated with increased fracture risk (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.59), while decrease in  >5% was not (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89-1.25).Gastric cancer survivors who underwent gastrectomy had an increased osteoporotic fracture risk than did matched controls. Total gastrectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and anemia were associated with an even higher risk in these patients. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal strategies, such as screening for osteoporosis and preventive interventions, that will reduce fracture risk in this population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658487>Do We Know How to Avoid OASIs in Non-Supine Birth Positions?

Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of the supine and upright positions on the incidence of OASIs after adjusting for risk factors and obstetric interventions. In total, 239 (13.8%) births occurred in upright positions, and 1,489 (86.2%) in supine positions. Grade-III lacerations occurred in 43 (2.5%) patients, and grade-IV lacerations occurred in 3 (0.2%) women. Supine positions had a significant protective effect against severe lacerations, odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0,47 [0.22-0.99], adjusted for the use of forceps 4.80 [2.15-10.70], nulliparity 2.86 [1.44-5.69], and birth  3.30 [1.56-7.00]. Anesthesia ( < 0.070), oxytocin augmentation ( < 0.228), shoulder dystocia ( < 0.670), and episiotomy ( < 0.559) were not associated with the incidence of severe lacerations. Upright birth positions were not associated with a lower rate of perineal tears.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of confirmed congenital dengue in Saudi Arabia.Dengue infection is not commonly associated with congenital anomalies and no biologic mechanism has yet been established for its teratogenicity. Congenital dengue in neonates can be confirmed by identification of the dengue virus in cord blood samples.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are necessary for the 's metabolism, growth and development. Although PUFAs play an important role in the regulation of female reproduction, their role in ovarian development in PCOS is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (omega-3/omega-6) on ovary development in PCOS rats. Serum levels of reproductive hormones and enzymes related to steroidogenesis were assessed. The results indicated that PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) significantly increased ovarian  and improved the ovarian structure although they had no significant effect on  in PCOS rats. Meanwhile, apoptosis was attenuated accompanied by increased cell proliferation by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15). Moreover, serum levels of hormones (FSH and E2) were also significantly increased by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) accompanied by decreased T levels. To investigate whether PUFAs regulate the expression of enzymes related to hormone synthesis, western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of CYP51, CYP19, StAR and 3β-HSD. The results showed that PUFAs significantly increased the protein levels of all of these enzymes. These results indicate that PUFAs enhance the reproductive performance of PCOS by increasing the expression of steroidogenesis enzymes, which are related to hormone secretion and ovarian functions. These findings provide evidence that a balanced n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is beneficial for PCOS reproduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657428>Wettability patterning in microfluidic devices using thermally-enhanced hydrophobic recovery of PDMS.</a></h2><p>Spatial control of wettability is key to many applications of microfluidic devices, ranging from double emulsion generation to localized cell adhesion. A number of techniques, often based on masking, have been developed to produce spatially-resolved wettability patterns at the surface of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomers. A major impediment they face is the natural hydrophobic recovery of PDMS: hydrophilized PDMS surfaces tend to return to hydrophobicity with time, mainly because of diffusion of low molecular  silicone species to the surface. Instead of trying to avoid this phenomenon, we propose in this work to take advantage of hydrophobic recovery to modulate spatially the surface wettability of PDMS. Because temperature speeds up the rate of hydrophobic recovery, we show that space-resolved hydrophobic patterns can be produced by locally heating a plasma-hydrophilized PDMS surface with microresistors. Importantly, local wettability is quantified in microchannels using a fluorescent probe. This "thermo-patterning" technique provides a simple route to in situ wettability patterning in closed PDMS chips, without requiring further surface chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658069>Compared to CPAP extubation to non-invasive ventilation is associated with higher risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely low birth  infants.</a></h2><p>While non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been associated with improved extubation rates, its impact on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains unclear.In this retrospective, chart review study of infants admitted to the Cleveland Clinic, we aimed to compare the incidence of BPD among extremely low birth  (ELBW) infants extubated to continuous positive pressure (CPAP) versus those extubated to NIV via RAM cannula or biphasic CPAP. Data collected included demographics, ventilatory modes, extubation data, and presence of complications. Infants extubated to either CPAP or NIV were compared using Wilcoxon rank- sum and Chi-square tests, and data were corrected using logistic regression models. Data are presented as medians.A total of 120 infants were included, of whom 62% were extubated to NIV. The incidence of BPD was significantly lower in the CPAP group vs NIV (57% vs. 78%, p = 0.011). Infants in the CPAP group were heavier (birth  (BWT) of 833 vs 724 grams, p = 0.005), more mature (gestation age (GA) 27 vs 25 weeks, p <  0.001) and were extubated significantly earlier (2 vs 8 days, p <  0.001). After adjusting for BWT and GA, NIV continued to be significantly associated with higher incidence of BPD among those extubated on the first day of life (odds ratio 5.9; 95% CI: 1.2-29.1, p = 0.029).This study concludes that, as compared to CPAP, early use of NIV is associated with higher risk of BPD in ELBW infants. Further investigation using prospective studies is recommended to validate these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656252>1,2,3-Triazolyl ester of ketorolac (15K), a potent PAK1 blocker, inhibits both growth and metastasis of orthotopic human pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice.</a></h2><p>More than 90% of human pancreatic cancers carry the oncogenic mutant of Ki-RAS and their growth depends on its downstream kinase PAK1, mainly because PAK1 blocks the apoptosis of cancer cells selectively. We developed a highly cell-permeable PAK1-blocker called 15K from an old pain-killer (ketorolac), that is shown here to inhibit the growth of three pancreatic cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging 41-88 nM in vitro. The anti-cancer effect of 15K was further investigated in an orthotopic xenograft model with gemcitabine (GEM)-resistant human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1 and BxPC-3) expressing luciferase in athymic mice. During 4 weeks, 15K blocks total burden (growth) of both AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 tumors (measured as radians/sec) with the IC50 below daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg, i.p. In a similar manner 15K reduced both their invasion and metastases as well, while it had no effect on either  or hematological parameters even at 5 mg/kg/day. To the best of our knowledge, 15K is so far the most potent among synthetic PAK1-blockers in vivo, and could be potentially useful for therapy of GEM-resistant cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656520>Humic acid as a feed additive in poultry diets: a review.</a></h2><p>Many studies tested different feed additives, among these additives, humic substances (HS) have been used in livestock and poultry diets. Humic substances commonly present in nature as they are created from the organic matter decomposition, and are normally found in the soil and natural water. Active components of HS consist of humic acid (HA), humus, ulmic acid, fulvic acid, humin and certain microelements. Humic acid is widely used as an alternative growth promoter for antibiotics in improving poultry performance and health. Moreover, supplementation of a commercial substance as a source of HS through the drinking water or diet improved the feed consumption, feed efficiency and  gain of broiler chickens, and also improved egg , egg mass, and egg production of laying hens. This review describes the useful applications and recent facets of HA including its modes of action and various valuable uses in improving the production and health safeguarding of livestock and poultry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659983>The Obesity Paradox Revisited:  Mass Index and Long-Term Outcomes After PCI From a Large Pooled Patient-Level Database.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the relationship between  mass index (BMI) and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous revascularization.In 13 randomized trials 22,922 patients were stratified (in kg/m2) as underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal  (18.5≤BMI&lt;25, used as reference), overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and obese (Class I [30≤BMI&lt;35], Class II [35≤BMI&lt;40], or Class III [BMI≥40]). The primary endpoint was all-cause death at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were cardiac and non-cardiac death, target (TLR) and non-target lesion revascularization (NTLR), myocardial infarction (MI), and definite/probable stent thrombosis. Despite adjustment for multiple confounders, overweight and Class I obesity were associated with lower all-cause mortality vs normal  (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.96 and HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.69-0.96 respectively); however, non-cardiac death was the major contributor to this effect (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94 for overweight). Conversely, cardiac mortality was higher in severely obese individuals (HR 1.62; 95%CI 1.05-2.51 for Class III obesity). Obesity was associated with higher rates of NTLR (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.04-1.58 for Class II obesity) but not with TLR, MI and stent thrombosis.Moderately increased BMI is associated with improved survival post-PCI, mostly due to lower non-cardiac but not cardiac mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661561>Extensions of the probabilistic ranking metrics of competing treatments in network meta-analysis to reflect clinically important relative differences on many outcomes.</a></h2><p>One of the key features of network meta-analysis is ranking of interventions according to outcomes of interest. Ranking metrics are prone to misinterpretation because of two limitations associated with the current ranking methods. First, differences in relative treatment effects might not be clinically important and this is not reflected in the ranking metrics. Second, there are no established methods to include several health outcomes in the ranking assessments. To address these two issues, we extended the P-score method to allow for multiple outcomes and modified it to measure the mean extent of certainty that a treatment is better than the competing treatments by a certain amount, for example, the minimum clinical important difference. We suggest to present the tradeoff between beneficial and harmful outcomes allowing stakeholders to consider how much adverse effect they are willing to tolerate for specific gains in efficacy. We used a published network of 212 trials comparing 15 antipsychotics and placebo using a random effects network meta-analysis model, focusing on three outcomes; reduction in symptoms of schizophrenia in a standardized scale, all-cause discontinuation, and  gain.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To use MLR, firstly the most important input data were selected, and then, the best model to predict the taste of orange was applied. In this research, methodology of ANFIS consisted of selection of dependent orange taste, fuzzification, fuzzy inference rule, membership function, and defuzzification process. The predictive capability of these models was evaluated by various descriptive statistical indicators such as mean square error () and determination coefficient ( ). The results showed that the prediction performance of the MLR model has a strong significant relationship between orange taste and vitamin C (0.897), red color (0.901), and blue color (0.713). Also, the results of ANFIS model showed that with low error for train and check data increased the most accuracy for prediction of orange taste. Moreover, the results indicated that the success rate of taste determination for orange is higher by using ANFIS compared to the MLR.

MDD and BD were compared regarding their symptom profiles and time to response and remission. Furthermore, the concordance between the MINI-Plus and clinical diagnosis was analyzed.Patients were on average 52 and 47 years old in the MDD and BD group, respectively, and 66 versus 64% were female. Compared to patients with BD, patients with MDD scored higher on  loss (p = 0.02), whereas the BD group showed a higher long-term likelihood of response (hazard ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.16-3.20, p for interaction with time = 0.04). Although the same association was seen for remission, the interaction with time was not significant (p = 0.48). Efficiency between the MINI-Plus and clinical diagnosis of BD was high (0.90), suggesting that the MINI-Plus is an adequate ROM diagnostic tool.In routine clinical inpatient care, minor differences in the symptom profile and the course of depressive symptomatology may be helpful in distinguishing MDD and BD, particularly when using sequential ROM assessments.© 2019 S.

The present study investigated the anaerobic digestion (AD) performances of HTL-AP under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions, and molecular and metabolic analysis were conducted to provide insights into the different performances. The results showed that thermophilic AD had lower COD removal efficiency compared to mesophilic AD (45.0% vs. 61.6%). Liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection and organic nitrogen (LC-OCD-OND) analysis showed that both high molecular  (HMW) and low molecular  (LMW) compounds were degraded to some extent and more LMW acids (LMWA) and recalcitrant aromatic compounds were degraded in the mesophilic reactor, which was the main reason of higher COD removal efficiency. Phenyl compounds (e.g. phenol and 2 methoxyphenol), furans and pyrazines were the recalcitrant chemicals detected through GC-MS analysis. Fourier transform ion cyclone resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis demonstrated the complexity of HTL-AP and the proportions of phenolic or condensed aromatic compounds increased especially in the thermophilic effluents. Metabolites analysis showed that the reasons contributing to the differences of mesophilic and thermophilic AD were not only related to the degradation of organic compounds (e.g. benzoate degradation via CoA ligation) in HTL-AP but also related to the microbial autogenesis (e.g. fatty acid biosynthesis) as well as the environmental information processing. In addition, the enrichment of Mesotoga, responsible for the high degradation efficiency of LMWA, and Pelolinea, involved in the degradation of phenyl compounds, were found in mesophilic reactor, which was consistent with higher removal of corresponding organics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of frequent intake of sucrose, sucralose or steviol glycosides, on selected anthropometric, biochemical and immunological parameters in healthy, young adults. 38 individuals with normal  mass index were recruited and randomly divided into three experimental groups. After a washout week (where food with added sweeteners was restricted), each group was supplemented with sucrose (8 × 5 g packets/day), sucralose or steviol glycosides (4 × 1 g packets/day each) for 6 weeks. Selected variables were measured before and after treatment in each group and differences within and among groups were assessed. Our results showed that, compared to baseline, there was a modest but significant increase in  (p = 0.0293) in the sucralose group, while the steviol glycosides group reduced their fat mass (p = 0.0390). No differences were observed in glycaemia; however, there was a significant increase in serum triglycerides (77.8-110.8 mg/dL) and cholesterol (162.0-172.3 mg/dL) in the sucrose group, whereas the steviol glycosides group presented lower triglycerides (104.7-92.8 mg/dL) and TNF-α concentrations (51.1-47.5 pg/mL). Comparison among groups showed differences in serum triglycerides (p = 0.0226), TNF-α (p = 0.0460) and IL-β (p = 0.0008). Our results suggest that, even in a short time span, frequent intake of steviol glycosides may have positive effects on metabolic parameters that may be relevant for human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655853>Histone deacetylase inhibitor CG200745 ameliorates high-fat diet-induced hypertension via inhibition of angiotensin II production.</a></h2><p>Obesity is growing rapidly worldwide due to consumption of westernized diet and lack of exercise. Obesity is one of the major risk factors of hypertension. The novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor CG200745 was originally developed to treat various cancers. Previous studies showed that CG200745 attenuated hypertension through inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone acetate-induced hypertensive rat. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of CG200745 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertension. Nine-week old C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD for 17 weeks. Each group of mice was treated with vehicle or CG200745 by intraperitoneal injection for 9 days. HFD group showed higher , blood pressure (BP), HDAC activities, angiotensinogen and renin expressions in kidney, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression in the lung, serum angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration, and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in mesenteric artery compared with ND group. CG200745 lowered BP, HDAC activity, renin and angiotensinogen in the kidney, ACE in the lung, serum Ang II level, and phosphorylation of MLC in HFD group. In conclusion, CG200745 ameliorated HFD-induced hypertension through inhibition of HDAC/Ang II/vascular contraction axis.

Infliximab (IFX), a chimeric anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, has been widely used for the treatment of CD. However, no study in Japanese CD patients receiving continuous IFX for more than 1 year has been reported. To avoid therapeutic failure during long-term administration in Japanese CD patients, we evaluated the variable factors of IFX pharmacokinetics and the optimal trough IFX concentration at 8 weeks after administration.Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was performed using the nonlinear mixed-effect model based on the IFX serum concentration in 832 samples from 121 patients. A one-compartment model was used to examine interindividual variability in the systemic clearance (CL) of intravenously administered IFX.PPK estimates (estimated value, RSE%) were total clearance (CL: 0.018 L/h, 9.1) and volumes of distribution (Vd: 7.35 L, 12.0). Interindividual variability for CL and Vd of 0.11 and 0.16, respectively, was found. , antibody to IFX (ATI), and albumin level were factors affecting the IFX CL. IFX CL was greater in the ATI-positive than in the ATI-negative group. CL was also greater in nonremission patients. There was a significant association between the predicted serum IFX trough concentration at 8 weeks and therapeutic response with long-term continuous administration (p < 0.05), with a higher concentration at 8 weeks seen in the remission group.Using these variables including , ATI, and albumin level, the IFX dose could be calculated for individual CD patients to achieve the optimal therapeutic range. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658595>Quality of Work Life and Organizational Performance: Workers' Feelings of Contributing, or Not, to the Organization's Productivity.</a></h2><p>This is a pioneering study on the relationship between quality of work life and the employee's perception of their contribution to organizational performance. It unveils the importance of subjective and behavioral components of quality of work life and their influence on the formation of the collaborator's individual desire to contribute to strengthening the organization's productivity. The results obtained indicate that for workers: feeling their supervisors' support through listening to their concerns and by sensing they take them on board; being integrated in a good work environment; and feeling respected both as professionals and as people; positively influence their feeling of contributing to organizational performance. The results are particularly relevant given the increased  of services in the labor market, together with intensified automation and digitalization of collaborators' functions.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether dietary apple polyphenol (APP) supplementation in finishing pigs could provide pork with high quality and nutritional value. In the present study, 36 castrated Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire pigs with an average  of 71.25 ± 2.40 kg were randomly divided into three treatments and fed with a basal diet supplemented with 0, 400, or 800 mg kg-1 APPs for 7 weeks. The results showed that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation not only decreased backfat thickness and abdominal adipose tissue index but also decreased L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. The LD muscle crude protein content, the proportions of essential amino acids, flavor amino acids, and total amino acids, as well as the amino acid transporter (SLC7A1, SLC7A2, SLC7A7, SLC1A2) mRNA levels were increased by 800 mg kg-1 APPs. The proportions of docosahexaenoic acid and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acid in LD muscle were increased by 400 mg kg-1 APPs. Meanwhile, dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation decreased the contents of blood urea nitrogen and total cholesterol, as well as increased the content of inosinic acid in LD muscle. In conclusion, these results suggested that dietary 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the carcass traits, meat color, and meat flavor in finishing pigs. These results also suggested that dietary 400 mg kg-1 and 800 mg kg-1 APP supplementation improved the meat nutritional value in finishing pigs. The present study provides effective evidence for the application of APP supplementation for healthy high-quality and nutritional value pork production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661671>Leptin and insulin in young adulthood are associated with  in infancy.</a></h2><p>Low  in early infancy is a known risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome in adult life. However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight, or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of metabolic function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their  composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low  at age two years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult  = -0.21, p<0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (p<0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low  at age two years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low  in early infancy and increased cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood in heathy subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658379>Population pharmacokinetics of a triple-secured fibrinogen concentrate administered to afibrinogenaemic patients: observed age- and - related differences and consequences for dose adjustment in children.</a></h2><p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of a triple-secured fibrinogen concentrate (FC) was assessed in patients ≥40 kg by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) over a period of 14 days with multiple blood samples. Limited PK time point assessments in children lead to consideration of using Bayesian estimation for paediatric data. The objectives were (i) to define the population PK of FC in patients with afibrinogenaemia; (ii) to detect age- and -related differences and consequences for dose adjustment.A population PK model was built using plasma fibrinogen activity data collected in 31 patients aged 1 to 48 years who had participated in a single-dose PK study with FC 0.06 g kg .A one-compartment model with allometric scaling accounting for  was found to best describe the kinetics of FC. Addition of age and gender as covariates did not improve the model. Incremental in vivo recovery assessed at the end of infusion with the predicted maximal concentrations was lower, -adjusted clearance was higher, and fibrinogen elimination half-life was shorter in patients <40 kg than patients ≥40 kg. Interpatient variability was similar in both groups.Dosing in patients ≥40 kg based on the previous empirical finding using NCA where FC 1 g kg raises the plasma fibrinogen activity by 23 g L was confirmed. In patients <40 kg, (covering the age range from birth up to about 12 years old) FC 1 g kg raises the plasma fibrinogen by 19 g L . Dosing should be adapted accordingly unless therapy is individualized.This article is protected by copyright.

This study investigates the impact of SES in childhood and adulthood on health satisfaction across the life course. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and education as a central marker of SES, we test whether parental education (i.e., childhood SES) affects adult health satisfaction, directly and/or indirectly through own educational attainment (i.e., adult SES) as a mediating variable. Moreover, we apply diagonal reference models to disentangle the independent effect of intergenerational educational mobility. Our findings show that parental education has both direct and indirect effects. Yet, the relative  of parents' education as a predictor of health satisfaction is found to depend on when in the life course health satisfaction is measured: parental education shows an increasing relevance as a predictor of health satisfaction at higher ages. On top of (additive) effects of parental and own education, we find significant mobility effects in earlier adulthood: upward educational mobility is conducive to health satisfaction and the reverse for downward educational mobility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential relationship between tobacco smoke exposure and ultrasound-measured renal characteristics has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that exposure to tobacco smoke would be associated with reduced kidney dimensions.This was a cross-sectional study that included all individuals over age 18 at a single site in Mojokerto, Indonesia. A questionnaire was used to assess prior history and environmental exposure, and blinded evaluators performed ultrasound assessments. Six kidney parameters (length, width, and parenchymal thickness of each kidney) were considered as dependent variables, and statistical relationships were assessed using multivariate analysis. Echogenicity was evaluated using a 5-point grading scale described previously.Of the 445 participants assessed, a total of 138 male and 269 female subjects were included in the final analysis. There was a statistically significant association between kidney  and the following independent variables: pack years smoking (p < 0.001), height (p < 0.001),  (p < 0.001), and beginning to smoke at the age of 25 or younger (p < 0.001). There was not a statistically significant association between kidney  and hypertension (p > 0.05) or diabetes (p > 0.05). Echogenicity was similar among all smoking groups.Kidney dimensions were decreased in individuals with increased smoking history. This association is notable, particularly given that statistically significant associations were not observed between renal dimensions and hypertension or diabetes. The null findings using echogenicity are consistent with previous studies. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656197>Global management of patients with knee osteoarthritis begins with quality of life assessment: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent form of chronic joint disease associated with functional restrictions and pain. Activity limitations negatively impact social connectedness and psychological well-being, reducing the quality of life (QoL) of patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing information on QoL in KOA patients and share the reported individual factors, which may influence it.We conducted a systematic review examining the literature up to JAN/2017 available at MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO using KOA and QOL related keywords. Inclusion criteria were QOL compared to at least one demographic factor (e.g., age, gender), lifestyle factor (e.g., functional independence), or comorbidity factor (e.g., diabetes, obesity) and a control group. Analytical methods were not considered as part of the original design.A total of 610 articles were reviewed, of which 62 met inclusion criteria. Instruments used to measure QoL included: SF-36, EQ-5D, KOOS, WHOQOL, HAS, AIMS, NHP and JKOM. All studies reported worse QoL in KOA patients when compared to a control group. When females were compared to males, females reported worse QOL. Obesity as well as lower level of physical activity were reported with lower QoL scores. Knee self-management programs delivered by healthcare professionals improved QoL in patients with KOA. Educational level and higher total mindfulness were reported to improve QoL whereas poverty, psychological distress, depression and lacking familial relationships reduce it. Surgical KOA interventions resulted in good to excellent outcomes generally; although, results varied by age, , and depression.KOA has a substantial impact on QoL. In KOA patients, QoL is also influenced by specific individual factors including gender, , physical activity, mental health, and education. Importantly, education and management programs designed to support KOA patients report improved QoL. QoL data is a valuable tool providing health care professionals with a better comprehension of KOA disease to aid implementation of the most effective management plan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h2><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of metabolic dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

Owing to their iron-chelating ability, they are produced mainly when the organism faces iron scarcity. The present study empirically investigated the importance of applying hydroxamate siderophore extracted from Aspergillus nidulans to the cells of Bacillus subtilis for bioremediation of cadmium salt. This investigation deals with siderophore-mediated intracellular Cd accumulation by bacterial cells, growth estimation, biochemical assays like lipid peroxidation, total protein content, carbohydrate content, and iron content estimation. In silico docking and STRING analyses revealed specific interaction between Aspergillus siderophore and receptors present on B. subtilis. Estimation of intracellular Cd by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed more accumulation of Cd ions by B. subtilis in the presence of hydroxamate siderophore. This suggests a possibility of confiscating environmental Cd by utilizing metal chelation property of siderophores and hence can lead to emerging bioremediation mechanisms for heavy metals. In silico studies support experimental investigation and suggest higher affinity of siderophore for Cd ions as compared with ferric ions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659893>Flexible Multifunctional Porous Nanofibrous Membranes for High-Efficiency Air Filtration.</a></h2><p>Particulate matters (PMs) discharged along with the rapid industrialization and urbanization hazardously threaten ecosystems and human health. Membrane-based filtration technology has been proved to be an effective approach to capture PMs from the polluted air. However, the fabrication of filtration membranes with excellent reusability and antibacterial activity has rarely been reported. Herein, the flexible multifunctional porous nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by embedding Ag nanoparticles into the electrospun porous SiO2-TiO2 nanofibers via an impregnation method, which integrated the abilities of PM filtration and antibacterial performance. Compared with the reported air filters, the resultant membrane (Ag@STPNM) with high surface polarity and the porous structure possessed the low density, high removal efficiency, and small pressure drop. For instance, the removal efficiency and the pressure drop of Ag@STPNM with basis  of only 3.9 g·m-2 for PM2.5 reached to 98.84% and 59 Pa, respectively. In terms of the excellent thermal stability of Ag@STPNM, the adsorbed PMs could be removed simply by a calcination process. The filtration performance of Ag@STPNM kept stable during five purification-regeneration cycles, and the long-time filtration for 12 h, exhibiting excellent recyclability and durability. Furthermore, the embedded Ag nanoparticles could achieve the effective resistance to the breeding of bacteria on Ag@STPNM, giving the bacteriostatic rate of 95.8%. Therefore, Ag@STPNM holds promising potentials as a highly efficient, reusable, and antibacterial air filter in the practical purification of indoor environment or personal air.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659677>Disseminated Emergomyces pasteurianus Infection in India: A Case Report and a Review.</a></h2><p>We report here a case of disseminated Emergomyces pasteurianus infection from India in a patient with AIDS.

IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more , had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with insulin/AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661458>Modelling PAHs removal in activated sludge process: effect of disintegration.</a></h2><p>The removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in activated sludge was evaluated using two laboratory-scale bioreactors, coupled or not with a disintegration system (sonication). Mass balances performed on each system underlined that PAHs removal was significantly improved after sludge disintegration, especially for the higher molecular  PAHs studied, which tended to adsorb to suspended matter. A model was developed in order to study the effect of sludge disintegration on the content of dissolved and colloidal matter (DCM), and to predict the potential impacts on PAHs availability and degradation. Results showed that this new model was efficient for capturing apparent degradation improvement trends and for discriminating between the involved mechanisms. This study showed that DCM content increased after sludge disintegration, and proved to be the main driver for improving PAHs apparent degradation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660381>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Conventional-Dose vs Triple-Dose Oseltamivir in Severely Immunocompromised Children With Influenza.</a></h2><p>This randomized phase 1b study evaluated the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of conventional-dose (30-75 mg twice daily [BID]) vs triple-dose (90-225 mg BID; -adjusted) oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in severely immunocompromised children <13 years. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) C and AUC were ~2-fold higher with triple-dose vs conventional-dose oseltamivir. Increased dose/exposure of oseltamivir/OC did not improve virological outcomes or reduce viral resistance. Median time to cessation of viral shedding was similar with triple-dose and conventional-dose oseltamivir (150.7 vs 157.1 hours, respectively); median time to alleviation of baseline fever was longer with conventional-dose oseltamivir (28.4 vs 11.3 hours).

Current most common material choice for clinically used implants is the combination of polymer-on-metal structures. Unfortunately, these joints often suffer from high friction and wear, leading to associated inflammation and infection and ultimate failure of the artificial joints. Here, we propose an alternative solution to this tribologically-induced failure of the joint materials. We demonstrate that friction and wear behavior of ultra-high-molecular- polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium tribopair, used to mimic the artificial joint interface, can be improved by introducing nanodiamond (ND) particles in the sliding contact. Characterization of the wear track using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the tribofilm formed from embedded NDs during sliding significantly suppressed the wear of the UHMWPE surface. In addition to the improved lubrication characteristics, NDs exhibit high biocompatibility with the bone cells and promising antibacterial properties against S. aureus, the most common strain associated with artificial joint infection. These results indicate that NDs can be used as a promising nontoxic human- lubricant with anti-wear and antibacterial features, thus demonstrating their great potential to treat artificial joint complications through intra-articular injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660424>Accelerometer-determined physical activity and cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults from two generations of the Framingham Heart Study.</a></h2><p>Physical activity (PA) may play a role in maintenance of cognitive function in both middle and older ages and prevention of outcomes such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Cross-sectional regression analyses were performed in Framingham Heart Study Third Generation (n = 1861) and Offspring (n = 909) cohort participants assessing the association of accelerometry-measured PA with cognitive function, adjusting for age, sex, accelerometer wear time, education, occupational status/PA, and smoking status.In each cohort, achieving just 10-21.4 min/day moderate-to-vigorous PA related to better executive function ( < .02); and just 10 min/day moderate-to-vigorous PA was associated with better verbal memory in middle-aged adults in the Third Generation cohort ( = .02).

Mammalian hosts include cattle, deer, sheep, goats, humans, and horses. This tick is known to transmit a number of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases, and was the vector of a recent serious outbreak of oriental theileriosis in New Zealand. A New Zealand-USA consortium was established to sequence, assemble, and annotate the genome of this tick, using ticks obtained from New Zealand's North Island. In New Zealand, the tick is considered exclusively parthenogenetic and this trait was deemed useful for genome assembly. Very high molecular  genomic DNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 and the long-read Pac Bio Sequel platforms. Twenty-eight SMRT cells produced a total of 21.3 million reads which were assembled with Canu on a reserved supercomputer node with access to 12 TB of RAM, running continuously for over 24 days. The final assembly dataset consisted of 34,211 contigs with an average contig length of 215,205 bp. The quality of the annotated genome was assessed by BUSCO analysis, an approach that provides quantitative  for the quality of an assembled genome. Over 95% of the BUSCO gene set was found in the assembled genome. Only 48 of the 1066 BUSCO genes were missing and only 9 were present in a fragmented condition.

Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of inflammation following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular  (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of inflammation in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659712>Using Chou's General Pseudo Amino Acid Composition to Classify Laccases from Bacterial and Fungal Sources via Chou's Five-Step Rule.</a></h2><p>Laccases are a group of enzymes with a critical activity in the degradation process of both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular , aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free energy between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases. These results also suggested an association between efficacy and physicochemical features of laccase enzymes from different sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658593>The Influence of Post Weld Heat Treatment Precipitation on Duplex Stainless Steels Weld Overlay towards Pitting Corrosion.</a></h2><p>Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) are complex materials and they have been widely used in the marine environment and gas industries, primarily offering a better resistance of pitting corrosion and good mechanical properties. In the present work, the effects of heat treatment on duplex stainless steel (DSS) weld overlay samples that were heat treated at three different temperatures, namely 350 °C, 650 °C, and 1050 °C, and followed by air cooling and water quenching were studied. Stress relief temperature at 650 °C had induced sigma phase precipitation in between delta ferrite and austenite (δ/γ) grain boundaries, resulting in the loss of corrosion resistance in the weld metal. Interestingly, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) test samples that were reheated to solution annealing temperature had shown no  loss. The ferrite count determination in the region of weld metal overlay increased at hydrogen relief and decreased at stress relief temperatures due to slow cooling, which is more favorable to austenite formation. The amount of ferrite in the weld metals was significantly reduced with the increment of solution anneal temperature to 1050 °C because of sufficient time for the formation of austenite and giving optimum equilibrium fraction in the welds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660971>Down-regulation of long non-coding RNA SNHG14 protects against acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide through microRNA-34c-3p-dependent inhibition of WISP1.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has shown the important roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in acute lung injury (ALI). This study aimed to investigate the potential role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI.Expression of SNHG14, microRNA-34c-3p (miR-34c-3p) and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in LPS-exposed mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and lung tissues from mice with LPS-induced ALI was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The interactions among SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1 were analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Using gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches, the contents of proinflammatory proteins were determined and MH-S cell viability was assessed to evaluate the in vitro functions of SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1, and wet/dry  ratio and proinflammatory proteins in lung tissues were determined to assess their in vivo effects.SNHG14 and WISP1 expression was increased, while miR-34c-3p was decreased in ALI models. SNHG14 bound to miR-34c-3p, resulting in impaired miR-34c-3p-dependent down-regulation of WISP1. Both SNHG14 silencing and miR-34c-3p over-expression reduced the levels of proinflammatory proteins IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and inhibited MH-S cell viability. SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression decreased the wet/dry  ratio in lung tissues from ALI mice. The reductions induced by SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression were rescued by WISP1 over-expression.This study demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG14 silencing alleviated inflammation in LPS-induced ALI through miR-34c-3p-mediated inhibition of WISP1. Our findings suggest that lncRNA SNHG14 may serve as a therapeutic target for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656970>Precipitating factors and maternal and neonatal outcomes of heart failure in pregnancy: a retrospective analysis in a large tertiary hospital in China, 2012-2017.</a></h2><p>To investigate the precipitating factors of heart failure (HF) and to investigate the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with HF.We reviewed the medical records of pregnant women with HF who were treated at West China Second University Hospital between September 2012 and September 2017. We recorded baseline characteristics, onset and treatment of HF, comorbidities, modes of delivery, and maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to explore the comorbidities in different subgroups.Seventy pregnant women with HF were identified. The most common pregnancy-specific conditions were severe preeclampsia (36/70, 51.43%) and multiple pregnancies (16/70, 22.86%). The most common nonpregnancy-specific conditions were lung infections (34/70, 48.57%) and cardiac problems (25/70, 35.71%). Sixty patients (85.71%) developed HF during pregnancy. Sixty-seven pregnancies (95.71%) ended in cesarean section. Three maternal deaths (4.29%) from HF were recorded. Of the 87 fetuses, three fetuses (3.45%) ended in miscarriages and stillbirth occurred in 5.75% of fetuses. The mean birth  of a neonate was 2174.49 ± 609.57 (817-3430) g.

Besides its chemotherapeutic effectiveness, cisplatin administration was associated with numerous side effects. Of these, the most clinically significant and common effect is nephrotoxicity. Recent studies reported that oxidative stress and inflamation are probably the most important mechanisms that contribute to the nephrotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In the present study, the effects of NAC on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity were investigated. Materials nad Methods: Rats were divided into four groups including eight rats: CONT, NAC-250, CP, CP+NAC. Rats in experimental groups were treated with a single dose intraperitoneally (i.p.) cisplatin (10 mg/kg ) and i.p. NAC (250 mg/kg ) for three consequitive days. Nephrotoxicity was determined by plasma BUN and creatinine levels. In tissue samples myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), Total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured. Kidneys were analyzed histopathologically as well.It was revealed that cisplatin was not effective on MPO, HMGB-1 and NF-kB levels but increased TOS levels and decreased TAS levels in tissue samples, interestingly NAC elevated MPO and HMGB-1 levels significantly. Nevertheless NAC ameliorated histological and functional changes in kidney tissues.It is suggested that inflammation has limited effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity in this experimental design and as reflected by decreased BUN and creatinine levels NAC can be used as an additional therapeutic agent to standard cisplatin treatment protocols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656030>The fragility of perceived social rank following exercise in anorexia nervosa: an ecological momentary assessment study of shame and pride.</a></h2><p>Pride and shame are self-conscious emotions closely associated with perceived social rank. Goss and Gilbert (In: Gilbert and Miles (eds)  shame: conceptualization, research & treatment. Brunner-Routledge, Hove, 2002) proposed that -control behaviours in anorexia nervosa (AN) provide a temporary sense of increased rank that dissipates afterwards, thereby perpetuating further symptoms. This pilot study tested their theory by examining whether shame increases and pride decreases as time passes post-exercise in individuals with AN. Pre-exercise patterns were also explored.Over 2 weeks, 23 females with AN provided ecological momentary assessment data via six semi-random daily signals and after each exercise episode. The State Shame and Guilt Scale assessed pride and shame. Items modified from the Experience of Shame Scale and the Other as Shame Scale assessed general shame and /eating shame. Multilevel models analyzed patterns of shame and pride prior to and following exercise episodes.In the hours after exercise, pride decreased, /eating shame increased, and general shame increased on one measure. Pride was, therefore, higher and shame lower immediately after exercise as compared to later in the day. In the hours before exercise, pride increased, but shame levels did not change significantly.The anticipation and immediate aftermath of exercise may be associated with higher perceived social rank in people with AN, but their feelings about self may worsen as time passes after exercise. Fluctuations in shame and pride may contribute to the maintenance of exercise in people with AN.IV, multiple time series analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656971>IGF-1 is associated with estimated bone strength in anorexia nervosa.</a></h2><p>IGF-1 and leptin are two nutritionally dependent hormones associated with low bone mass in women with anorexia nervosa.

IGF-1 and leptin are two nutritionally dependent hormones that have been associated with low bone mass in women with anorexia nervosa. We hypothesized that IGF-1 and leptin would also be positively associated with estimated bone strength in women with anorexia nervosa.In this cross-sectional study of 38 women (19 with anorexia nervosa and 19 normal- controls), we measured serum IGF-1 and leptin and performed finite element analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT images to measure stiffness and failure load of the distal radius and tibia.IGF-1 was strongly correlated with estimated bone strength in the radius (R = 0.52, p = 0.02 for both stiffness and failure load) and tibia (R = 0.55, p = 0.01 for stiffness and R = 0.58, p = 0.01 for failure load) in the women with anorexia nervosa but not in normal- controls. In contrast, leptin was not associated with estimated bone strength in the group of women with anorexia nervosa or normal- controls.IGF-1 is strongly associated with estimated bone strength in the radius and tibia in women with anorexia nervosa.

One-hundred and twenty weaned male rabbits (New Zealand White and Rex) of 6 weeks of age and 770.5 ± 20 g  were allotted randomly into four groups in a factorial arrangement. The obtained results indicated that there were non-significant differences in all growth performance traits, blood profile and economic parameters due to the breed effect. However, there were significant differences in most of carcass traits due to the breed effect except total giblets and New Zealand White breed showed the highest value of these parameters including dressing % (p < .01), forequarter and loin % (p < .001) and hindquarter % (p < .003) compared with Rex breed counterparts.

Although higher feed cost and total costs in treated groups than control ones in each breed, they showed higher total return and net return. Rex non-treated rabbit breed showed the lowest profitability  compared with other groups. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of multi-enzyme with sodium butyrate is highly recommended in growing rabbits due to their beneficial effects on the growth performance and profitability.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661273>Multi-organ systems study reveals Igfbp7 as a suppressor of gluconeogenesis after gastric bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery reduces  in obese patients. A marked decrease in blood glucose levels occurs before  loss; however, key molecules that improve glycemic profile remain largely unknown. Using a murine RYGB surgery model, we performed multi-organ proteomics and bioinformatics to monitor the proteins and molecular pathways that change in this early glycemic response. Multiplexed proteomic kinetics data analysis revealed that the Roux limb, biliopancreatic limb, liver and pancreas each exhibited unique temporal and molecular responses to the RYGB surgery. In addition, protein-protein network analysis indicated that the changes to the microbial environment in the intestine may play a crucial role in the beneficial effects of RYGB surgery. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7) was identified as an early induced protein in the Roux limb. Known secretory properties of Igfbp7 prompted us to further investigate its role as a remote organ regulator of glucose metabolism. Igfbp7 overexpression decreased blood glucose levels in diet-induced obese mice, and attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. Secreted Igfbp7 appeared to mediate these beneficial effects. These results demonstrate that organs responded differentially to RYGB surgery, and indicate Igfbp7 may play an important role in improving blood glucose levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658816>Racial/Ethnic Differences in Diet Quality and Eating Habits Among WIC Pregnant Women: Implications for Policy and Practice.</a></h2><p>One of the major federal food assistance programs, the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), serves approximately 1.5 million low-income pregnant women per year; however, limited information is available on their dietary habits. This is critical because low-income women are at higher risk of gaining excess  during pregnancy. Thus, the study objectives were to (1) determine the overall diet quality of WIC pregnant women and (2) examine diet quality and eating behaviors by race/ethnicity and other sociodemographics.This was a cross-sectional study.One of the 3 WIC offices in a north-central county in North Carolina, USA.Pregnant women (n = 198) in the second trimester.Interviews included sociodemographics, food security, diet, and eating behaviors. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010 scores.Descriptives, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.Average participant age was 26 years, and the mean HEI-2010 score was 56 of maximum score of 100. Specifically, African American women consumed significantly lower servings of whole grains (β = -1.71; 95% CI: -3.10 to -0.32;  < .05) and dairy (β = -1.42; 95% CI: -2.51 to -0.33;  < .05) compared with non-Hispanic white women. Hispanic women scored higher in daily intake of fruits (β = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.17-1.79;  < .05) and for consuming empty calories in moderation (β = 1.57; 95% CI: 0.06-3.09;  < .05). Frequency of intake of fast foods/outside meals was higher among African American women (57%,  = .025).Efforts are warranted to promote optimal nutrition among WIC pregnant women. Specifically, African American women are highly vulnerable to poor dietary habits during pregnancy. Further investigation of barriers/facilitators for healthy eating is necessary to address nutrition disparities among WIC pregnant women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657516>Is Inflow Modulation Always Needed in Small Volume Liver Grafts?

The authors have rightly shown we can go down the GRWR of 0.8 taking portal pressures as the target end point, even without inflow modulation. However still some questions remain unanswered like how low is too low in preoperative graft selection as their protocol was on actual graft  (0.6 preoperative vs 0.54 intraoperative). Also needed to addressed in context of right vs left lobe although numbers in left lobe were very low.

With sufficiently large training datasets, models can typically avoid overfitting their data; however, for medical imaging it is often difficult to obtain enough data from a single site. Sharing data between institutions is also frequently nonviable or prohibited due to security  and research compliance constraints, enforced to guard protected health information (PHI) and patient anonymity.In this paper, we implement cyclic  transfer with independent datasets from multiple geographically disparate sites without compromising PHI. We compare results between single-site learning (SSL) and multi-site learning (MSL) models on testing data drawn from each of the training sites as well as two other institutions.The MSL model attains an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0:690 on the holdout institution datasets with a volume correlation of 0:914, respectively corresponding to a 7% and 5% statistically significant improvement over the average of both SSL models, which attained an average DSC of 0:646 and average correlation of 0:871.We show that a neural network can be efficiently trained on data from two physically remote sites without consolidating patient data to a single location. The resulting network improves model generalization and achieves higher average DSCs on external datasets than neural networks trained on data from a single source.© 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659705>Outcomes of mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children.</a></h2><p>We examined the outcomes following mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children and identified the predictors for mortality and reoperation.Medical records from 49 children who underwent mitral valve replacement between 1982 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Median age and  at initial mitral valve replacement were 2.4 years and 9.7 kg, respectively. The median follow-up was 13 years. Surgical results and predictors for mortality and reoperation were investigated.There was no operative mortality; eight late deaths occurred. The actuarial survival rates were 89.5%, 84.2%, and 80.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, after initial mitral valve replacement. The actuarial freedom rates from related complications were 89.5%, 78.3%, and 70.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Nineteen patients required 1st re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 5.9 years; six of these 19 required 2nd re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 8.9 years after 1st re-MVR. The actuarial freedom rates from re-mitral valve replacement were 86.0%, 56.8%, and 44.2% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. No predictor for death was determined; however, the predictor for re-mitral valve replacement was initial valve diameter less than 19 mm.Survival outcomes among children after mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in biventricular heart were satisfactory. However, complications, including re-mitral valve replacement, were frequent and the predictor was of a small prosthesis size.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659077>Indirect Evidence of Circulating Parasite Hapten Immune Complexes in Visceral Leishmaniasis.</a></h2><p>Hypergammaglobulinemia is present in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), inducing the formation of immune complexes (ICs), which interferes in conventional serology. Parasitic haptens block antibodies, making it difficult to identify and detect them. ICs could be determined indirectly by acid dissociative ELISA (DE) seroconversion in natural and experimental VL.We determined the frequency of samples that seroconverted in DE or presented a 10% increase in DE (ΔDE) in 3 types of VLs-hamster, canine, and human samples-with larger antigen determination by direct antigen capture in experimental samples.The ΔDE frequency is increased in all VL models: human (34%), canine (27%), and hamster (25%) samples. Seroconversion was present in hamster (14%), dog (1%), and human (6%) samples. During experimental infection, higher frequencies (28%) of circulating antigens were observed at the 30th day, associated with higher ΔDE (47%) and seroconversion (22%), with lower frequencies in other periods.The frequency of ΔED and seroconversion samples found in natural and experimental infection suggests that specific antibodies can be blocked by low molecular  antigens that interfere qualitatively (seroconversion) or quantitatively (ΔDE) in serology. Several antigen types may be involved, as high molecular  proteins and low molecular  glycoconjugates. The higher frequency of those indirect demonstrations of antibody-blocking antigen or haptens that could be acid-removed in VL has implications for the development of assays for detection of circulating or antibody-bound 1- to 3-kDa antigens, which could interfere in diagnosis and also in the immune response of the host.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659466>Trends in age- and sex-adjusted  mass index and the prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer over 42 months after diagnosis: a single-center cohort study.</a></h2><p>The adequate nutritional status of pediatric cancer patients is particularly important to enable them to cope with the demands of the disease and its treatment and to maintain normal growth. Malnutrition and obesity have both been associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity. We investigated trends in the age- and sex-adjusted  mass index (ISO-BMI) and the prevalence of malnutrition in a Finnish cohort of 139 consecutive children receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with a follow-up period of 42 months after diagnosis. In total, 28% (39/139) of the patients experienced malnutrition (ISO-BMI < 17 or > 10%  loss), and 12% (16/139) had a nasogastric tube or underwent gastrostomy. Patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemia (5/10), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (5/13), or solid tumors (13/31) most frequently suffered from malnutrition. There was a significant increase in the ISO-BMI of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (+ 2.1 kg/m) and lymphomas (+ 2.4 kg/m) during the first 6 months, and the ISO-BMI of patients with ALL remained higher at 42 months compared to baseline (+ 1.9 kg/m).Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of malnutrition in Finnish pediatric cancer patients is comparable to that reported in other populations. The nutritional status of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, CNS tumors, or solid tumors should be monitored with extra care to facilitate early intervention in the case of impending malnutrition. What is known: • Both malnutrition and obesity are associated with reduced survival and increased drug toxicity in pediatric cancer patients. What is new: • Overall, 28 % of Finnish children receiving chemotherapy for cancer suffer from malnutrition during the first 42 months following the initial cancer diagnosis. • ISO-BMI curves from initial diagnosis to 42 months after diagnosis are provided for patients with different types of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656225>Pediatric Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: Evidence, Barriers, and Best Practices.</a></h2><p>Severe obesity among youth is an "epidemic within an epidemic" and portends a shortened life expectancy for today's children compared with those of their parents' generation. Severe obesity has outpaced less severe forms of childhood obesity in prevalence, and it disproportionately affects adolescents. Emerging evidence has linked severe obesity to the development and progression of multiple comorbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in end-organ damage in adulthood. Lifestyle modification treatment has achieved moderate short-term success among young children and those with less severe forms of obesity, but no studies to date demonstrate significant and durable  loss among youth with severe obesity. Metabolic and bariatric surgery has emerged as an important treatment for adults with severe obesity and, more recently, has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy for groups of youth with severe obesity. However, current data suggest that youth with severe obesity may not have adequate access to metabolic and bariatric surgery, especially among underserved populations. This report outlines the current evidence regarding adolescent bariatric surgery, provides recommendations for practitioners and policy makers, and serves as a companion to an accompanying technical report, "Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery for Pediatric Patients With Severe Obesity," which provides details and supporting evidence.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659843>Fungal isolate and crop cultivar influence the beneficial effects of root inoculation with entomopathogenic fungi in strawberry.</a></h2><p>Root inoculations of crop plants with beneficial fungi constitute a promising strategy for growth promotion and control of above-ground pests and diseases. Here, strawberry roots (cultivar 'Albion' and 'Pircinque') were inoculated with 25 different Brazilian entomopathogenic fungal isolates of three genera and the effects on Tetranychus urticae oviposition and plant growth were evaluated in greenhouse experiments.Reductions in the number of T. urticae eggs compared to control treatments were observed on both cultivars inoculated with almost all isolates. For the cultivar 'Albion', Metarhizium anisopliae (ESALQ 1604, ESALQ 1669), M. robertsii (ESALQ 1622, ESALQ 1635), Metarhizium sp. Indet. (ESALQ 1684), and Beauveria bassiana (ESALQ 3323) increased dry  of roots and leaves, and fruit yield, while M. robertsii (ESALQ 1634), and Metarhizium sp. Indet. (ESALQ 1637) and (ESALQ 1636) enhanced fruit yield and dry  of leaves, respectively. For the cultivar 'Pircinque', M. anisopliae (ESALQ 1669) was the only isolate observed to increase dry  of roots.The results suggest that inoculation of strawberry roots with entomopathogenic fungi may be an innovative strategy for pest management aboveground. Further, these inoculations may also stimulate plant growth and strawberry production, but the effects depend on fungal strains and crop cultivar. This article is protected by copyright.
