Previous studies have shown that Lactobacillus has a protective effect on intestinal morphology, intestinal  integrity and appropriate maturation of -associated tissues. Here, gene expression in jejunum tissue of weaned piglets was investigated by RNA-seq analysis after administration of sterile saline, Lactobacillus reuteri, or an antibiotic (chlortetracycline). In total, 401 and 293 genes were significantly regulated by chlortetracycline and L. reuteri, respectively, compared with control treatment. Notably, the HP, NOX1 and GPX2 genes were significantly up-regulated in the L. reuteri group compared with control, which is related to the antioxidant ability of this strain. In addition, the expression of genes related to  metabolism and linoleic  metabolism enriched after treatment with L. reuteri. The fatty  composition in the jejunum and colon was examined by GC-MS analysis and suggested that the MUFA C18:1n9c, and PUFAs C18:2n6c and C20:4n6 were increased in the L. reuteri group, verifying the GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the RNA-seq results. The results contribute to our understanding of the probiotic activity of this strain and its application in pig production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28404744>The role of CB in intestinal permeability and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid system has previously been shown to play a role in the permeability and inflammatory response of the human . The goal of our study was to determine the effects of endogenous anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on the permeability and inflammatory response of intestinal  under normal, inflammatory, and hypoxic conditions. Human intestinal mucosa was modeled using Caco-2 cells. Human tissue was collected from planned colorectal resections. Accumulation of AEA and 2-AG was achieved by inhibiting their metabolizing enzymes URB597 (a fatty  amide hydrolase inhibitor) and JZL184 (a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor). Inflammation and ischemia were simulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ and oxygen deprivation. Permeability changes were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. The role of the CB receptor was explored using CB-knockdown (CBKd) intestinal epithelial cells. Endocannabinoid levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cytokine secretion was measured using multiplex and ELISA. URB597 and JZL184 caused a concentration-dependent increase in permeability  CB ( < 0.0001) and decreased cytokine production. Basolateral application of JZL184 decreased permeability  CB ( < 0.0001). URB597 and JZL184 increased the enhanced (worsened) permeability caused by inflammation and hypoxia ( < 0.0001 and  < 0.05). CBKd cells showed reduced permeability response to inflammation ( < 0.01) but not hypoxia. 2-AG levels were increased in response to inflammation and hypoxia in Caco-2 cells. In human mucosal tissue, inflammation increased the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-12, -13, and -15, which was prevented with  treatment with URB597 and JZL184, and was inhibited by a CB antagonist. The results of this study show that endogenous AEA and 2-AG production and CB activation play a key modulatory roles in normal intestinal mucosa permeability and in inflammatory and hypoxic conditions.-Karwad, M.
