Stored RBC units contain high concentrations of RBC- EVs, thereby increasing the concentration of EVs in the circulation after transfusion. The mechanisms underlying the clearance of donor RBC-EVs after transfusion are unknown. This study investigates whether membrane markers that are associated with clearance of RBCs are also implicated in clearance of RBC-EVs in human endotoxemic recipients of a transfusion.Six volunteers were injected with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and after two hours transfused with an autologous RBC unit donated 35 days earlier. Samples were collected from the RBC unit and the volunteers before and after transfusion. RBC-EVs were labeled with (anti) glycophorin A, combined with (anti) CD44, CD47, CD55, CD59, CD147, or lactadherin to detect phosphatidylserine (PS) and analyzed on a A50 Micro flow cytometer.In the RBC unit, RBC-EVs solely exposed PS (7.8%). Before transfusion, circulating RBC-EVs mainly exposed PS (22%) and CD59 (9.1%), the expression of the other membrane markers was much lower. After transfusion, the concentration of RBC- EVs increased 2.4-fold in two hours. Thereafter, the EV concentration decreased towards baseline levels. The fraction of EVs positive for all tested membrane markers decreased after transfusion.Besides a minor fraction of PS-exposing EVs, RBC-EVs produced during storage do not expose detectable levels of RBC membrane markers that are associated with clearance, which is in contrast to the EVs produced by the circulating RBCs.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we characterized a novel porcine β-defensin (pBD129) and explored its role in alleviating bacterial endotoxin-induced  and intestinal epithelium atrophy. The  gene was cloned and expressed in . A recombinant pBD129 protein was also purified. To explore its role in alleviating the endotoxin-induced , mice, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were treated by pBD129 at different doses. The recombinant pBD129 showed significant antimicrobial activities against the  and  with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic assays showed that the pBD129 had no detrimental impact on cell viabilities. Interestingly, we found that pBD129 attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by decreasing serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α ( < 0.05). Moreover, pBD129 elevated the intestinal villus height ( < 0.05) and enhanced the expression and localization of the major tight junction-associated protein ZO-1 in LPS-challenged mice. Additionally, pDB129 at a high dose significantly decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) concentration ( < 0.05) and reduced intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis ( < 0.05) in LPS-challenged mice. Importantly, pBD129 elevated the expression level of Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bcl-2), but down-regulated the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes such as the B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax), BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and caspase-9 in the intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05). These results suggested a novel function of the mammalian defensins, and the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of pBD129 may allow it a potential substitute for conventionally used antibiotics or drugs.Copyright © 2019 Xie, Xie, Su, Chen, Yu, Mao, Huang, Yu, Luo, Zheng, Luo and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882365>The vasculature in sepsis: delivering poison or remedy to the brain?</a></h2><p>Survivors of sepsis and other forms of critical illness frequently experience significant and disabling cognitive and affective disorders.

The lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapies for people with CF (PWCF) represents a significant challenge.To identify altered immunometabolism in the CF neutrophil, and investigate the feasibility of specific inhibition of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as a CF anti-inflammatory strategy in vivo.Key markers of increased aerobic glycolysis, known as a Warburg effect, including cytosolic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), phosphorylated PKM2, succinate, HIF-1α, lactate and the interleukin (IL)-1β precursor pro-IL-1β, as well as caspase-1 activity and processing of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome, were measured in neutrophils from blood and airway secretions from healthy controls (n=12), PWCF (n=16) and PWCF post-double-lung transplant (n=6). The effects of specific inhibition of NLRP3 on airway inflammation and bacterial clearance in a murine CF model were subsequently assessed in vivo.CF neutrophils display increased aerobic glycolysis in the systemic circulation. This effect is driven by low-level , unaffected by CFTR modulation, and resolves post-transplant. The increased pro-IL-1β produced is processed to its mature active form in the lipopolysaccharide-rich CF lung by the NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-1. Specific NLRP3 inhibition in vivo with MCC950 inhibited IL-1β in the lungs of CF mice (P<0.0001), resulting in significantly reduced airway inflammation and improved Pseudomonas clearance (P<0.0001).CF neutrophil immunometabolism is altered in response to inflammation.

Although selectins and integrins mediate recruitment in many tissues, they have a minimal role in the lungs and liver. Exploiting an unbiased in vivo functional screen, we identified a lung and liver homing peptide that functionally abrogates neutrophil recruitment to these organs. Using biochemical, genetic, and confocal intravital imaging approaches, we identified dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) as the target and established its role as a physical adhesion receptor for neutrophil sequestration independent of its enzymatic activity. Importantly, genetic ablation or functional peptide blocking of DPEP1 significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and liver and provided improved survival in models of .

Platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) is a member belongs to PDGF family and has been recently reported higher expressed in survivors of severe sepsis patients. However, the exact role and underlying mechanisms of PDGF-BB in sepsis remains unclear. In this study, we found that PDGF-BB levels were significantly elevated in patients with sepsis, and higher PDGF-BB levels were negatively correlated with the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8), and chemokines (CXCL-1 and CCL2). PDGF-BB was also found increased in experimental sepsis in mice. Blockade of PDGF-BB using Tyrphostin AG 1296 aggravated, whereas recombinant PDGF-BB treatment improved survival and tissues injury in both two murine models of CLP-induced sepsis and LPS- induced . PDGF-BB blockade increased, whereas PDGF-BB administration decreased the inflammatory responses, as reflected by proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8), and chemokines (CXCL-1 and CCL2). PDGF-BB also showed inhibitory effect on immune cell activation and cytokines production in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, our findings suggest that PDGF-BB plays a protective role in sepsis by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. PDGF-BB thus may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to define altered MS-metabolomic responses during high-fat (HF)-induced NASH that are restored by GTE utilizing livers from an earlier study in which GTE decreased endotoxin-TLR4-NFκB liver injury.Mice are fed a low-fat (LF) or HF diet for 12 weeks and then randomized to LF or HF diets containing 0% or 2% GTE for an additional 8 weeks. Global MS-based metabolomics and targeted metabolite profiling of catechins/catechin metabolites are evaluated. GTE in HF mice restores hepatic metabolites implicated in dyslipidemia insulin resistance, and inflammation. These include 122 metabolites: amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, bile acids, flavonoids, xenobiotics, and carbohydrates. Hepatic amino acids, B-vitamins, and bile acids are inversely correlated with biomarkers of insulin resistance, liver injury, steatosis, and inflammation. Further, phosphatidylcholine metabolites are positively correlated with biomarkers of liver injury and NFκB inflammation. Thirteen catechin metabolites are identified in livers of GTE-treated mice, mostly as phase II conjugates of parental catechins or microbial-derived valerolactones.The defined anti-inflammatory/metabolic interactions advance an understanding of the mechanism by which GTE catechins protect against NFκB-mediated liver injury in NASH.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The severity of pulmonary edema is controlled by multiple barriers, and in particular the alveolar epithelial barrier and pulmonary microvasculature. However, to date, the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on both of these barriers in the lung has not been directly and simultaneously measured. In addition the effects of alcohol on systemic, indirect lung injury versus direct injury have not been compared. In this study, we used tissue morphometry and Evans Blue permeability assays to assess the effects of alcohol and  injury on pulmonary barrier function comparing intraperitoneal (IP) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to intratracheal (IT) administration. Consistent with previous reports, we found that in alcohol-fed mice, the alveolar barrier was impaired, allowing Evans Blue to permeate into the airspaces. Moreover, IT administered LPS caused a significant breach of both the alveolar epithelial and vascular barriers in alcohol-fed mice, whereas the endothelial barrier was less affected in response to IP administered LPS. The alveolar barrier of control mice remained intact for both IP and IT administered LPS. However, both injuries caused significant interstitial edema, independently of whether the mice were fed alcohol or not. These data suggest that in order to properly target pulmonary edema due to alcoholic lung syndrome, both the alveolar and endothelial barriers need to be considered as well as the nature of the "second hit" that initiates ARDS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The early identification of an infectious process that is rapidly evolving to a critical illness might prompt a quicker and more intensive treatment, thereby potentially leading to better patient outcomes. The Endotoxin Activity (EA) assay can be used at the bedside as a reliable biomarker of systemic . The detection of elevated endotoxin activity levels has been repeatedly shown to be associated with an increased disease severity in patients with sepsis and septic shock. The assay is quick and easy to perform. Briefly, after sampling, an aliquot of whole blood is mixed with an anti-endotoxin antibody and with added LPS. Endotoxin activity is measured as the relative oxidative burst of primed neutrophils as detected by chemioluminescence. The assay's output is expressed on a scale from 0 (absent) to 1 (maximal) and categorized as "low" (<0.4 units), "intermediate" (0.4-0.59 units), or "high" (≥0.6 units).

Here, we test the hypothesis that brainstem antiinflammatory pathways of α7/α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) modulate endotoxic cardiovascular derangements. Pharmacologic and molecular studies were performed to determine the influence of nicotine or selective α7/α4β2-nAChR ligands on cardiovascular derangements and brainstem neuroinflammation caused by  in conscious rats. The i.v. administration of nicotine (50 μg/kg) abolished the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg i.v.)-evoked: (i) falls in blood pressure and spectral measure of cardiac sympathovagal balance (ratio of the low-frequency to high-frequency power, LF/HF), (ii) elevations in immunohistochemical protein expressions of NFκB and α4β2-nAChR in medullary neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and (iii) decreases in medullary α7-nAChR protein expression. These favorable nicotine influences were replicated in rats treated intracisternally (i.c.) with PHA-543613 (selective α7-nAChR agonist) or 5-iodo-A-85380 (5IA, selective α4β2-nAChRs agonist). Measurement of arterial baroreflex activity by the vasoactive method revealed that nicotine, PHA, or 5IA reversed the LPS depression of reflex bradycardic, but not tachycardic, activity. Moreover, the counteraction by nicotine of LPS hypotension was mostly inhibited after treatment with i.c. methyllycaconitine (MLA, α7-nAChR antagonist) in contrast to a smaller effect for dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE, α4β2-nAChR antagonist), whereas the associated increases in LF/HF ratio remained unaltered.

To mimic obese humans with metabolic , high-fat-diet-fed mice (HF group) were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to yield the obese kidney fibrosis-metabolic  mouse model (HL group). Therapeutic effects of ROS, cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were analyzed with a quantitative comparison of immunohistochemistry stains and morphometric approach in the tubulointerstitium of different groups. Compared with basal and HF groups, the HL group exhibited the most prominent obese kidney fibrosis, tubular epithelial lipid vacuoles, and lymphocyte infiltration in the tubulointerstitium. Furthermore, inhibitors of nonspecific ROS, cPLA2 and COX-2 ameliorated the above renal damages. Notably, the ROS-inhibitor-treated group ameliorated not only oxidative injury but also the expression of cPLA2 and COX-2, indicating that ROS functions as the upstream signaling molecule in the inflammatory cascade of obese kidney fibrosis.

The α7 nAChR partial agonist GTS-21 reduces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) in models of  and sepsis, and its anti-inflammatory effects are widely ascribed to α7 nAChR activation. However, mechanistic details of α7 nAChR involvement in GTS-21 effects on inflammatory pathways remain unclear. Here, we investigate how GTS-21 acts in two cell systems including the non-immune rat pituitary cell line GH4C1 expressing an NFκB-driven reporter gene and cytokine secretion by ex vivo cultures of primary mouse macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GTS-21 does not change TNF-stimulated NFκB signaling in GH4C1 cells expressing rat α7 nAChRs, suggesting that GTS-21 requires additional unidentified factors besides α7 nAChR expression to allow anti-inflammatory effects in these cells. In contrast, GTS-21 dose-dependently suppresses LPS-induced IL6 and TNF secretion in primary mouse macrophages endogenously expressing α7 nAChRs. GTS-21 also blocks TNF-induced phosphorylation of NFκB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), an important intermediary in NFκB signaling. However, α7 antagonists methyllycaconitine and α-bungarotoxin only partially reverse GTS-21 blockade of IL6 and TNF secretion. Further, GTS-21 significantly inhibited LPS-induced IL6 and TNF secretion in macrophages isolated from knockout mice lacking α7 nAChRs. These data indicate that even though a discrete component of the anti-inflammatory effects of GTS-21 requires expression of α7 nAChRs in macrophages, GTS-21 also has anti-inflammatory effects independent of these receptors depending on the cellular context.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364085>Anti-endotoxin Properties of Polymyxin B-immobilized Fibers.</a></h2><p>Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that shows strong bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria, by binding to and inactivating endotoxin.

In the present study, we determined the functions and mechanisms of hirsutanolA (HA), which is isolated from the red alga-derived marine fungus  sp. NTOU4196, on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators produced from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells. Our results showed that HA suppressed LPS-triggered MMP-9-mediated gelatinolysis and expression of protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner without effects on TIMP-1 activity. Also, HA significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, HA significantly inhibited LPS-mediated STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and ERK1/2 activation in THP-1 cells. In an LPS-induced  mouse model, studies indicated that HA pretreatment improved -induced acute sickness behavior, including acute motor deﬁcits and anxiety-like behavior. HA also attenuated LPS-induced phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 activity in the hippocampus. Notably, HA reduced pathologic lung injury features, including interstitial tissue edema, inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and alveolar collapse. Likewise, HA suppressed the induction of phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 in lung tissues.

Once infected by virus or bacteria, patients can die due to systemic inflammation within a short period of time. Cytokine storm plays an essential role in causing organ dysfunction and septic shock. Thus, inhibition of cytokine secretion is considered very important in sepsis therapy. In this study, we found that TFP, an antipsychotic drug mainly used to treat schizophrenia by suppressing dopamine secretion, inhibited cytokine release from activated immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Trifluoperazine (TFP) decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines without altering their transcription level. In LPS-induced  and cecal content injection (CCI) models, TFP intraperitoneal administration improved survival rate. Thus, TFP was considered to inhibit the secretion of proteins through a mechanism similar to that of W7, a calmodulin inhibitor. Finally, we confirmed that TFP treatment relieved organ damage by estimating the concentrations of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum. Our findings were regarded as a new discovery of the function of TFP in treating sepsis patients.

One such stimulus was given to adult male Wistar rats by injecting different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50, 300, 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg i.p.). To verify the systemic effect of the LPS administration, the serum content of C-reactive protein (CRP), the variation of body weight and cellular changes in the spleen, liver and kidney were determined. Motor impairment was evaluated by rotarod and open field tests. Microglia activation and dopaminergic degeneration was confirmed by immunolabelling for CD11b/c (microglia) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), respectively. The cell counting was performed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), microglial activation was explored in SNpc, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), substantia nigra pars compacta dorsal (SNcd) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). For the statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (p ≤ 0.05) was used. On day 7 post intraperitoneal administration of LPS, cellular atrophy was detected in the liver, kidney and spleen at 5 mg/kg, without significant changes in CRP levels. Body weight loss and motor impairment was present only on day 1 post LPS administration. The dosage of 500 g/kg and 5 mg/kg of LPS caused the loss of dopaminergic neurons (40%) in SNpc and microglia migration in a dose-dependent manner in SNcd, SNpc and SNpr.

Therefore, the development of drugs to control the pathogen-induced inflammatory responses associated with sepsis is essential. To address this, our study examined the transcriptomes of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced dendritic cells (DCs), identifying TANK-binding kinase1 (Tbk1) as a key factor involved in the inflammatory response. These data suggested drug repositioning of the Tbk1 inhibitor CYT387, currently used for the treatment of myelofibrosis and some cancers, as a candidate for regulating the LPS-induced inflammatory response. CYT387 also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine and surface molecule expression by mature DCs after LPS exposure. These effects correlated with both Akt phosphorylation and IκBα degradation. Finally, CYT387 demonstrated therapeutic effects in LPS-induced  and Escherichia coli K1-induced mouse models of sepsis and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, our study suggests that drug repositioning of CYT387 may serve as a potential therapeutic for sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cardiovascular complications greatly increase sepsis-associated mortality. Although murine models are routinely used for preclinical studies, the benefit of using genetically engineered mice in sepsis is countered by discrepancies between human and mouse sepsis pathophysiology. Therefore, recent guidelines have called for standardization of preclinical methods to document organ dysfunction. We investigated the course of cardiac dysfunction and myocardial load in different mouse models of sepsis to identify the optimal measurements for early systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Methods and Results We performed speckle-tracking echocardiography and assessed blood pressure, plasma inflammatory cytokines, lactate, B-type natriuretic peptide, and survival in mouse models of  or polymicrobial infection (cecal ligation and puncture, [ CLP ]) of moderate and high severity. We observed that myocardial strain and cardiac output were consistently impaired early in both sepsis models. Suppression of cardiac output was associated with systolic dysfunction in  or combined systolic dysfunction and reduced preload in the CLP model. We found that cardiac output at 2 hours post- CLP is a negative prognostic indicator with high sensitivity and specificity that predicts mortality at 48 hours. Using a known antibiotic (ertapenem) treatment, we confirmed that this approach can document recovery. Conclusions We propose a non-invasive approach for assessment of cardiac function in sepsis and myocardial strain and strain rate as preferable measures for monitoring cardiovascular function in sepsis mouse models. We further show that the magnitude of cardiac output suppression 2 hours post- CLP can be used to predict mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008870>Effect of Vasopressors on The Macro- and Microcirculation During Systemic Inflammation In Humans in vivo.</a></h2><p>Comparing the effects of different vasopressors in septic shock patients is hampered by high heterogeneity and the fact that current guidelines dictate the use of norepinephrine. Herein, we studied the effects of three vasopressor agents, norepinephrine, phenylephrine and vasopressin, on the macro- and microcirculation during experimental human , a standardized, controlled model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo.We performed a randomized controlled study in which 40 healthy male volunteers were assigned to a five-hour infusion of either 0.05 μg/kg/min norepinephrine (n = 10), 0.5 μg/kg/min phenylephrine (n = 10), 0.04 IU/min vasopressin (n = 10), or saline (n = 10), starting one hour before intravenous administration of two ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The macrocirculation was monitored using arterial catheter-derived parameters with additional blood pressure waveform contour analysis (PCA) until 4.5 hours following LPS administration. Sublingual microcirculatory density and flow were assessed using a handheld video microscope until 6 hours post-LPS.LPS administration affected all macrocirculatory and microcirculatory parameters. The LPS-induced decrease in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was refractory to low-dose norepinephrine and phenylephrine, and to a lesser extent, to vasopressin. Only vasopressin exerted effects on PCA parameters compared to placebo, by mitigating the LPS-induced decrease in diastolic blood pressure by stabilizing SVR and cardiac output. The -induced decreased indices of microvascular flow and density were not influenced by vasopressor therapy.In a highly controlled model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo, a five-hour infusion of various vasopressors revealed distinctive effects on macrohemodynamic variables without affecting the sublingual microcirculation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959577>Fructose Promotes Leaky Gut, , and Liver Fibrosis Through Ethanol-Inducible Cytochrome P450-2E1-Mediated Oxidative and Nitrative Stress.</a></h2><p>Fructose intake is known to induce obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to evaluate the effects of fructose drinking on gut leakiness, , and NAFLD and study the underlying mechanisms in rats, mice, and T84 colon cells. Levels of ileum junctional proteins, oxidative stress markers, and apoptosis-related proteins in rodents, T84 colonic cells, and human ileums were determined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analyses. Fructose drinking caused microbiome change, leaky gut, and hepatic inflammation/fibrosis with increased levels of nitroxidative stress marker proteins cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1), inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nitrated proteins in small intestine and liver of rodents. Fructose drinking significantly elevated plasma bacterial endotoxin levels, likely resulting from decreased levels of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins (zonula occludens 1, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4), adherent junction (AJ) proteins (β-catenin and E-cadherin), and desmosome plakoglobin, along with α-tubulin, in wild-type rodents, but not in fructose-exposed Cyp2e1-null mice. Consistently, decreased intestinal TJ/AJ proteins and increased hepatic inflammation with fibrosis were observed in autopsied obese people compared to lean individuals. Furthermore, histological and biochemical analyses showed markedly elevated hepatic fibrosis marker proteins in fructose-exposed rats compared to controls. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that intestinal TJ proteins were nitrated and ubiquitinated, leading to their decreased levels in fructose-exposed rats. Conclusion: These results showed that fructose intake causes protein nitration of intestinal TJ and AJ proteins, resulting in increased gut leakiness, , and steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis, at least partly, through a CYP2E1-dependent manner.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31114691>Obesity related metabolic  is associated with oxidative stress and impaired sperm DNA integrity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is known to be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and a resulting reduction in sperm DNA integrity. Importantly, obesity is also reported to be associated with an increase in intestinal permeability with the passage of intestinal bacteria into the circulation (metabolic ) that triggers a systemic state of inflammation and resultant oxidative stress. Therefore, we hypothesised that this obesity related increase in intestinal permeability and resultant metabolic  (ME) may activate inflammation within the male reproductive tract, leading to increased reactive oxygen species production, sperm oxidative stress and a decline in DNA integrity.Our pilot study of 37 infertile men confirmed a significant positive correlation between body mass index (BMI), increased intestinal permeability (serum zonulin), metabolic  (LBP), sperm DNA oxidative damage (seminal 8 OhDG) and increasing levels of sperm DNA fragmentation (Halosperm). Metabolic  was positively correlated with increasing levels of sperm DNA oxidative damage with this relationship remaining significant, even after adjustment for relevant confounders such as age, BMI and days of abstinence. These observations suggest that metabolic  and its associated oxidative stress may be a key driver of sperm DNA damage in obese men.This study confirms a link between obesity, increasing intestinal permeability and endotoxin exposure, and oxidative mediated sperm DNA damage. This warrants further investigation to fully understand the effect of metabolic  on male reproductive function which could result in the new therapies to improve male fertility potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962268>B-cell dynamics during experimental  in humans.</a></h2><p>Recently, B cells with regulatory functions suppressing T-cell immunity were identified.

The impact of  on B-cell dynamics, regulatory B cells (Breg) and its contribution to immune dysfunction is unknown. It is the aim of the present study to characterize the dynamics of the B-cell compartment and Breg in an experimental human  model.In this randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study, 20 healthy males received an intravenous injection of endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide, LPS, 0.8 ng/kg body weight) or placebo (saline 0.9%) on two otherwise identical study days. B cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at baseline and repeatedly up to 72 h after endotoxin/placebo injection.Absolute CD19 B cells counts showed a significant decrease 3 h after endotoxin injection. Memory B cells were partially depleted from the circulation; the total number of Breg was significantly diminished 3 h after LPS challenge. Production of anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 (IL-10) by Breg was unaltered after LPS challenge. Systemic B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels were significantly increased with a maximum after 24 h and remained increased up to 72 h post-injection. causes a transient depletion of memory B cells and Breg from the circulation.

Recently research have found the anti-inflammatory effects of emodin. Here, we investigated the potential effects of emodin on a mouse model with a lethal dose of the potential mechanisms and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory lung injury in mice. The pulmonary histological abnormalities, the Evans blue's leakage, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the grades of TNF-α, IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), lactic acid (LA) in lung tissues were determined 18 h post exposure of LPS. Based on the expression of LC3-II with BECN1 was determined using Western blotting. Besides, the LPS-exposed mice for survival rate was monitored. The results indicated that intervention with emodin was important for mitigating LPS-induced pulmonary histological change and LPS-induced leakage of Evans blue, which were associated with suppressed elevation of MPO activity and inhibited up-regulation of TNF-α, IL-6, NO with LA in lung tissues. Moreover, intervention with emodin enhanced the survival rate of LPS-exposed mice. Finally, therapy with emodin increased the LC3 and BECN1 in lungs of LPS-exposed mice. Treatment with 3-MA (the autophagy inhibitor) reversed the beneficial effects of emodin. In conclusion, emodin might provide pharmacological benefits in LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury, and the mechanisms might be related to the restoration of autophagy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176010>The role of serpin protein on the natural immune defense against pathogen infection in Lampetra japonica.</a></h2><p>Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are a large protein family that is involved in various physiological processes and is known to regulate innate immunity pathways. However, research for the functional study of serpins in lamprey is limited. In the present study, a serpin gene was cloned and characterized from Lampetra japonica at molecular, protein and cellular levels, named L-serpin which belongs to family F serine protease inhibitors (serpin family). The L-serpin includes a serpin domain in the N-terminus. The mRNA transcript of L-serpin was extensively expressed in kidney, supraneural body, intestine, liver, heart, gill and the highest expression in leukocytes. The mRNA expression level of L-serpin increased significantly after Vibrio anguillarum, Staphylocccus aureus and Poly I:C stimulation and dramatically peak at 8 h. It is demonstrated that the L-serpin protected cells from lethal Gram-negative  through associating with inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered cell death and inflammatory factors expression. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and the microbe binding assay were used to determine that L-serpin interacts directly with LPS (KD = 6.14 × 10 M). Furthermore, we confirmed L-serpin is a major inhibitor of complement activation by inactivating lamprey-C1q protein (KD = 2.06 × 10 M). Taken together, these findings suggest that L-serpin is a endogenous anti-inflammatory factor to defend against Gram-negative bacterial challenge and involved in lamprey innate immunity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our recent preliminary study showed that the ADAM10 genetic polymorphism was clinically associated with the development of sepsis, and little is known about the underlying mechanism. The aim of this study was to confirm the association between the ADAM10 promoter rs653765 G→A polymorphism and the progression of sepsis and to discover the underlying mechanism. Clinical data showed that the rs653765 G→A polymorphism was positively correlated with the development of sepsis, as evidenced by a multiple-center case-control association study with a large sample size, and showed that EGR1 and ADAM10 levels were associated well with the different subtypes of sepsis patients.  results demonstrated that the rs653765 G→A variants could functionally modulate ADAM10 promoter activity by altering the binding of the EGR1 transcription factor (TF) to the ADAM10 promoter, affecting the transcription and translation of the  gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated the direct interaction. Functional studies further identified that the EGR1/ADAM10 pathway is important for the inflammatory response. EGR1 intervention  decreased host proinflammatory cytokine secretion and rescued the survival and tissue injury of the mouse  model. Sepsis is characterized as life-threatening organ dysfunction, with unacceptably high mortality. Evidence has indicated that functional SNPs within inflammatory genes are associated with susceptibility, progression, and prognosis of sepsis. These mechanisms on which these susceptible sites depended often suggest the key pathogenesis and potential targets in sepsis. In the present study, we confirmed that a functional variant acts as an important genetic factor that confers the progression of sepsis in a large sample size and in multiple centers and revealed that the variants modulate the EGR1/ADAM10 pathway and influence the severity of sepsis. We believe that we provide an important insight into this new pathway involving the regulation of inflammatory process of sepsis based on the clinical genetic evidence, which will enhance the understanding of nosogenesis of sepsis and provide the potential target for inflammation-related diseases.Copyright © 2019 Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337751>Acetate attenuates inflammasome activation through GPR43-mediated Ca-dependent NLRP3 ubiquitination.</a></h2><p>Acetate has been indicated to be elevated and to regulate inflammation in inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The inflammasome serves as a key component of immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to various inflammatory disorders. However, little is known about the effects of acetate on inflammasome activation and the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that acetate attenuates inflammasome activation via GPR43 in a Ca-dependent manner. Through binding to GPR43, acetate activates the G subunit and subsequent phospholipase C-IP signaling to decrease Ca mobilization. In addition, acetate activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), promotes NLRP3 inflammasome ubiquitination by PKA, and ultimately induces NLRP3 degradation through autophagy. In vivo, acetate protects mice from NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis and LPS-induced . Collectively, our research demonstrates that acetate regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via GPR43 and Ca-dependent mechanisms, which reveals the mechanism of metabolite-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation and highlights acetate as a possible therapeutic strategy for NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952817>Deletion of Biliverdin Reductase A in Myeloid Cells Promotes Chemokine Expression and Chemotaxis in Part via a Complement C5a--C5aR1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Biliverdin reductase (BVR)-A is a pleotropic enzyme converting biliverdin to bilirubin and a signaling molecule that has cytoprotective and immunomodulatory effects. We recently showed that biliverdin inhibits the expression of complement activation fragment 5a receptor one (C5aR1) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In this study, we investigated the role of BVR-A in determining macrophage inflammatory phenotype and function via regulation of C5aR1. We assessed expression of C5aR1, M1-like macrophage markers, including chemokines (RANTES, IP-10), as well as chemotaxis in response to LPS and C5a in bone marrow-derived macrophages from   and     mice (conditional deletion of BVR-A in myeloid cells). In response to LPS, macrophages isolated from   showed significantly elevated levels of C5aR1 as well as chemokines (RANTES, IP10) but not proinflammatory markers, such as iNOS and TNF. An increase in C5aR1 expression was also observed in peritoneal macrophages and several tissues from   mice in a model of . In addition, knockdown of BVR-A resulted in enhanced macrophage chemotaxis toward C5a. Part of the effects of BVR-A deletion on chemotaxis and RANTES expression were blocked in the presence of a C5aR1 neutralizing Ab, confirming the role of C5a-C5aR1 signaling in mediating the effects of BVR. In summary, BVR-A plays an important role in regulating macrophage chemotaxis in response to C5a via modulation of C5aR1 expression. In addition, macrophages lacking BVR-A are characterized by the expression of M1 polarization-associated chemokines, the levels of which depend in part on C5aR1 signaling.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445407>Symbolic analysis of heart rate fluctuations identifies cardiac autonomic modifications during LPS-induced .</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to compare linear and symbolic dynamics (SD) indices for detecting the autonomic cardiac changes produced by  in freely-moving rats. In this context, we analyzed ECG-derived R-R time series in freely moving Dark Agouti rats, which received lipopolysaccharide (LPS, n = 9), or vehicle (V, n = 7). Five minutes R-R time series were assessed every hour up to +12 h and + 24 h post-LPS injection. We found that SD indices showed significant differences at +7 h between V vs. LPS groups and at +9 h between basal levels of LPS (-3 h) and post-LPS injection (pre-LPS vs. post-LPS). In general, SD seems more appropriate than linear indices to evaluate the autonomic changes of endotoxemic rats. Overall, the symbolic parameters detected decreased R-R variability and complexity, which indicate a modification of the autonomic regulation during LPS-induced . This modification is probably related to a reduced activity of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway at the long term.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the role of the small intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) in CLD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the duodenal MAM and both small intestinal permeability and liver disease severity in CLD.Subjects with CLD and a disease-free control group undergoing routine endoscopy underwent duodenal biopsy to assess duodenal MAM by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Small intestinal permeability was assessed by a dual sugar (lactulose: rhamnose) assay. Other assessments included transient elastography, , serum markers of hepatic inflammation, dietary intake, and anthropometric measurements.Forty-six subjects (35 with CLD and 11 controls) were assessed. In subjects with CLD, the composition (P = 0.02) and diversity (P < 0.01) of the duodenal MAM differed to controls. Constrained multivariate analysis and linear discriminate effect size showed this was due to Streptococcus-affiliated lineages. Small intestinal permeability was significantly higher in CLD subjects compared to controls. In CLD, there were inverse correlations between microbial diversity and both increased small intestinal permeability (r = -0.41, P = 0.02) and serum alanine aminotransferase (r = -0.35, P = 0.04).

However, the temporal aspects and exposure-response relationship of endotoxin and resulting cytokine induction and tolerance development is less well defined. The aim of this work was to establish an in silico model that simultaneously captures and connects the in vivo time-courses of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and associated tolerance development. Data from six studies of porcine  in anesthetized piglets (n = 116) were combined and used in the analysis, with purified endotoxin (Escherichia coli O111:B4) being infused intravenously for 1-30 h in rates of 0.063-16.0 μg/kg/h across studies. All data were modelled simultaneously by means of importance sampling in the non-linear mixed effects modelling software NONMEM. The infused endotoxin followed one-compartment disposition and non-linear elimination, and stimulated the production of TNF-α to describe the rapid increase in plasma concentration. Tolerance development, observed as declining TNF-α concentration with continued infusion of endotoxin, was also driven by endotoxin as a concentration-dependent increase in the potency parameter related to TNF-α production (EC50). Production of IL-6 was stimulated by both endotoxin and TNF-α, and four consecutive transit compartments described delayed increase in plasma IL-6. A model which simultaneously account for the time-courses of endotoxin and two immune response markers, the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the development of endotoxin tolerance, was successfully established. This model-based approach is unique in its description of the time-courses and their interrelation and may be applied within research on immune response to bacterial endotoxin, or in pre-clinical pharmaceutical research when dealing with study design or translational aspects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135706>Nicotine Improves Survivability, Hypotension, and Impaired Adenosinergic Renal Vasodilations in Endotoxic Rats: Role of α7-Nachrs/HO-1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>The nicotinic/cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway protects against acute kidney injury and other end-organ damages induced by . In this study, we tested the hypothesis that functional α7-nAChRs/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is imperative for the nicotine counteraction of hemodynamic and renovascular dysfunction caused by acute  in rats. Renal vasodilations were induced by cumulative bolus injections of acetylcholine (ACh, 0.01 nmol-7.29 nmol) or ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist, 1.6 nmol-100 nmol) in isolated phenylephrine-preconstricted perfused kidneys. The data showed that 6-h treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg i.p.) decreased systolic blood pressure and renal vasodilations caused by NECA but not Ach. The endotoxic insult also increased the mortality rate and elevated serum urea and creatinine. These LPS effects were sex-unrelated, except hypotension, and enhanced mortality which were more evident in male rodents, and abrogated after co-administration of nicotine (0.5, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent fashion. The advantageous effects of nicotine on NECA vasodilations, survivability, and kidney biomarkers in endotoxic male rats disappeared upon concurrent exposure to methyllycaconitine citrate (α7-nAChR blocker) or zinc protoporphyrin (HO-1 inhibitor) and were reproduced after treatment with bilirubin, but not hemin (HO-1 inducer) or tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (carbon monoxide-releasing molecule).

Intestinal injury and intestinal  (IETM) contribute greatly in the development of AH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have been reported to affect intestinal injury. The present study aims to investigate the role of miR‑141 in intestinal injury and IETM of AH. An AH model was successfully established in mice and they were the injected with a series of miR‑141 mimic, miR‑141 inhibitor or toll like receptor 4 monoclonal antibody (TLR4mAb; an inhibitor of the Toll‑like receptor TLR pathway). After that, the intestinal tissues and intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from differently treated AH mice. The expression of miR‑141 and TLR pathway‑associated genes and the levels of inflammatory factors were determined. Furthermore, a target prediction program and a luciferase reporter assay were employed to examine whether miR‑141 targets TLR4. Finally, MTT and transwell assays were carried out to detect cell viability and cell permeability. Intestinal tissues from AH mice treated with miR‑141 mimic or TLR4mAb exhibited lower levels of inflammatory factors and reduced expression of the TLR pathway‑associated genes, suggesting a decreased inflammatory response as well as inactivation of the TLR pathway by miR‑141. The luciferase reporter assay suggested that miR‑141 negatively regulated TLR4. Intestinal epithelial cells treated with miR‑141 mimic or TLR4mAb demonstrated enhanced viability and reduced permeability. Opposite results were observed in AH mice treated with a miR‑141 inhibitor. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑141 could ameliorate intestinal injury and repress the progression of IETM through targeting TLR4 and inhibiting the TLR pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376095>Investigation of Extracellular Matrix Protein Expression Dynamics Using Murine Models of Systemic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins form the structural support for migration of leukocytes and provide multiple signals to assist in their functions during inflammatory conditions. Presence of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues results in the remodelling of matrices which could modify the functions of extravasated leukocytes. Previous reports have shown changes in the expression of ECM proteins during local inflammatory responses. In this study, we have investigated the time- and tissue-specific expression profile of key ECM proteins in systemic inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models. The results show that compared to naïve tissues, within 12 h following CLP surgery, a 20-30-fold increase was observed in the expression of collagen-IV (Col-IV) transcripts in the mesentery tissues with a 2.4-fold increase in the protein by 24 h. However, Western blot band intensities indicated that vimentin and fibrinogen were remarkably expressed in more quantity compared to Col-IV. Secondly, in CLP group of mice, fibrinogen showed 6-40-fold increase in mRNA level in various tissues with about 2-fold increase in the protein level compared to respective naïve tissues. Similar studies in the LPS-injected mice showed up to 2-3 fold increase in the expression of Col-IV, fibrinogen and vimentin at protein level in the lungs. In such animals, although similar pattern was observed for fibrinogen in kidney and liver tissues, the mesentery showed prominent changes in Col-IV and vimentin mRNA compared to CLP. Further, bioinformatics analysis showed multiple pathways which could be associated with vimentin, Col-IV and fibrinogen under inflammatory conditions both in human and mouse.

Moreover, the mice were simultaneously injected with PSGL-1 antibody for intervention. The survival rate, morphologic changes of lung tissues, platelet-leukocyte adhesion, tissue factor expression on leukocytes, fibrinogen deposition in lung tissues, serum levels of inflammatory factors and the activation of VECs were determined.The results showed that the aggregation and recruitment of platelets and leukocytes in lung tissues, the expression of tissue factor on leukocytes, the serum levels of inflammatory factors, the activation of VECs, and the fibrinogen deposition in lung tissues were increased in endotoxemic mice, which were significantly alleviated by administration of PSGL-1 antibody. Moreover, blockade of PSGL-1 markedly increased survival rate, and alleviated coagulation disturbance and lung injury in endotoxemic mice.Taken together, PSGL-1 played an important role in pathogenesis of SIRS and coagulation dysfunction and ALI in endotoxemic mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the sevelamer group, but not the nicotinamide group, serum levels of urea, uric acid, and fibroblast growth factor-23 were significantly reduced after 6 months of treatment. The other circulating uremic toxins and toxin precursors remained unchanged in response to either phosphate-lowering agent. Sevelamer treatment led to a marked decrease in serum lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.001) whereas nicotinamide treatment induced an only modest decrease of borderline significance (p = 0.057). There was no change in C-reactive protein levels.In contrast to sevelamer, nicotinamide did not reduce circulating levels of low-molecular-weight uremic toxins other than phosphate, and neither agent reduced circulating uremic toxins of high-molecular-weight or protein-bound toxins. Sevelamer, but not nicotinamide, reduced serum endotoxin levels. Despite no change in serum C-reactive protein, the endotoxin-lowering effect of sevelamer may help to attenuate the inflammatory status of patients with chronic kidney disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515596>Protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum against chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in the murine model.</a></h2><p>Long-term alcohol consumption causes liver injuries such as alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver, and . Some probiotics were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel microbiota-based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386827>Telluric acid ameliorates hepatic ischemia reperfusion-induced injury in rats: Involvement of TLR4, Nrf2, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>In past tellurium-based compounds had limited use, however, their therapeutic potential have been target of interest recently due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities in experimental . Nevertheless, their potential hepatoprotective effect against ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is still obscure. This study examined the possible hepatoprotective effect of telluric acid (TELL), one of tellurium-based compound, against the deteriorating effect hepatic IR injury in rats through directing toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) cascade, phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt axis, and nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) pathway as possible mechanisms contributed to TELL's effect. Indeed, male Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups: sham-operated, control IR and TELL (50 µg/kg). TELL was administrated once daily for seven consecutive days prior to the IR induction. Pretreatment with TELL attenuated hepatic IR injury as manifested by hampered plasma aminotransaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Also, TELL opposed IR induced elevation in tissue expression/activity of high-mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB1), TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (p-NF-κB p65), phospho-mitogen activated protein kinasep38 (p-MAPKp38) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Moreover, TELL reduced the elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances along with increased both Nrf-2 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, beside replenishment of hepatic reduced glutathione. In addition, TELL induced obvious upregulation of p-PI3K and p-Akt protein expressions together with restoration of histopathological changes in IR injury. In conclusion, TELL purveyed conceivable novel hepatoprotective mechanisms and attenuated events associated with acute hepatic injury via inhibition of TLR4 downstream axis and activation of Nrf-2 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades. Thus, TELL may provide a novel therapeutic potential for complications of hepatic IR injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated (i) the nicotine modulation of hemodynamic and renal vasodilatory responses to  in rats, and (ii) roles of α7 or α4β2-nAChRs and related HSP70/TNFα/iNOS signaling in the interaction. was induced by ip lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg/day, for 2 days) and changes in systolic blood pressure and vasodilator responsiveness of isolated perfused kidney to acetylcholine or 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, adenosine receptor agonist) were evaluated.Lipopolysaccharide had no effect on serum creatinine, reduced blood pressure, and increased renal vasodilations induced by acetylcholine or NECA in male and female preparations. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide reduced renal HSP70 expression, but increased α7-nAChRs, α4β2-nAChRs and iNOS expressions. The co-administration of aminoguanidine (iNOS inhibitor), pentoxifylline (TNFα inhibitor), or nicotine attenuated lipopolysaccharide mediation of renal vasodilations and elevations in α7/α4β2-nAChR and iNOS expressions. Nicotine also reversed the downregulating effect of lipopolysaccharide on HSP70 expression. α7-nAChRs (methyllycaconitine citrate, MLA) or α4β2-nAChRs (dihydro-β-erythroidine, DHβE) blockade potentiated the lipopolysaccharide enhancement of renal vasodilations, and abolished the depressant effect of nicotine on lipopolysaccharide responses. A similar abolition of nicotine effects was seen after HSP70 inhibition by quercetin. Alternatively, lipopolysaccharide hypotension was eliminated in rats treated with DHβE/nicotine or quercetin/nicotine regimen in contrast to no effect for nicotine alone or combined with MLA.These findings establish that nicotine offsets lipopolysaccharide facilitation of renal vasodilations possibly through a crosstalk between HSP70 and nAChRs of the α7 and α4β2 types.Copyright © 2019 Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Sepsis and  impair HPV. We previously showed that nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) is required, but not sufficient, for the effect of endotoxin on HPV. The aim of the current study was to identify additional factors that might contribute to the impairment of HPV during .Gene expression profiling was determined using pulmonary tissues from NOS2-deficient (NOS2) and wild-type mice subjected to endotoxin or saline challenge (control). HPV was accessed as the percentage increase in left pulmonary vascular resistance (LPVR) in response to left main bronchus occlusion (LMBO) in wild-type mice.Among the 22,690 genes analyzed, endotoxin induced a greater than three-fold increase in 59 and 154 genes in the lungs of wild-type and NOS2 mice, respectively. Of all the genes induced by endotoxin in wild-type mice, arginase 1 (Arg1) showed the greatest increase (16.3-fold compared to saline treated wild-type mice). In contrast, endotoxin did not increase expression of Arg1 in NOS2 mice. There was no difference in the endotoxin-induced expression of Arg2 between wild-type and NOS2-deficient mice. We investigated the role of arginase in HPV by treating the mice with normal saline or the arginase inhibitor N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (norNOHA). In control mice (in the absence of endotoxin) treated with normal saline, HPV was intact as determined by profound LMBO-induced increase in LPVR (121 ± 22% from baseline). During  and treatment with normal saline, HPV was impaired compared to normal saline treated control mice (33 ± 9% vs. 121 ± 22%, P < 0.05). HPV was restored in endotoxin-exposed mice after treatment with the arginase inhibitor norNOHA as shown by the comparison to endotoxemic mice treated with normal saline (113 ± 29% vs, 33 ± 9%, P < 0.05) and to control mice treated with normal saline (113 ± 29% vs, 121 ± 22%, P = 0.97).The results of this study suggest that  induces Arg1 and that arginase contributes to the endotoxin-induced impairment of HPV in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467920>Late Brain Involvement after Neonatal Immune Activation.</a></h2><p>The neonatal immune system is still immature, which makes it more susceptible to the infectious agents. Neonatal immune activation is associated with increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, causing an inflammatory cascade in the CNS and altering behavioral and neurochemical parameters. One of the hypotheses that has been studied is that neuroinflammation may be involved in neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluate visuospatial memory, cytokines levels, and the expression of tau and GSK-3 proteins in hippocampus and cortex of animals exposed to neonatal . C57BL/6 mice aging two days received a single injection of subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At 60,120, and 180 days of age, visual-spatial memory was evaluated and the hippocampus and cortex were dissected to evaluate the cytokines levels and expression of tau and GSK-3 proteins. The animals exposed to LPS in the neonatal period present with visuospatial memory impairment at 120 and 180 days of age. Here there was an increase of TNF- and IL-1 levels in the hippocampus and cortex only at 60 days of age. Here there was an increase in the expression of GSK-3 in hippocampus of the animals at 60, 120, and 180 days of age. In the cortex, this increase occurred in the 120 and 180 days of age. Tau protein expression was high in hippocampus and cortex at 120 days of age and in hippocampus at 180 days of age.

Sepsis is associated with primary injury to the intestinal mucosa, which in turn induces bacterial translocation and hyperpermeability. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide synthesized by several cell types, whose immunomodulatory activity has been reported in experimental models of inflammation. We hypothesized that the CCK treatment could modulate the inflammatory response and protect the integrity of the intestinal barrier in endotoxemic rats. Ten minutes before the  induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, rats were pretreated with CCK at two doses (0.4 or 40 μg/kg). Mucosal permeability, bacterial translocation, cytokines production, histology injury and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins were the parameters assessed. In the early phase of , rats exhibited impaired intestinal barrier function, increased mucosal permeability, bacterial translocation and also hyperactivation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, the pretreatment with CCK modulated only the mucosal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased the expression of seal-forming TJ proteins (occludin, claudin-1 and JAM-A) and reduced the bacterial counts in the mesenteric lymph nodes. However, CCK has a site specific mechanism of action in the colon via CCK-1R, which is upregulated by the CCK treatment. In synergy with previous findings from our research group, the present results demonstrated that CCK preserves the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and might be a promising hormonal adjuvant therapy for the treatment of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814897>Evaluation of antiproliferative and protective effects of Eupatorium cannabinum L. extracts.</a></h2><p>Eupatorium cannabinum L. (Asteraceae) has been used for a long time for medicinal purposes due to its various pharmacological effects and richness in active compounds such as phenolics, sesquiterpenes, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and polysaccharides. Despite the high content of compounds that have important roles in medicinal plants, there are still limited literature data regarding this valuable species. The plant was fractioned using chloroform (EC) and distilled water (EA) and HPLC analysis revealed the presence of eupatorin, eupatilin, and quercetin in EC and caefic acid and rutin in EA. The antiproliferative potential on BT-20, HepG2, Caco-2, and Jurkat cancer cell lines was assessed by MTS test. Jurkat cells were more sensitive to both extracts (IC50 of 7.35 ± 0.35 for EC and 13.77 ± 2.16 µg/mL for EA), while the other lines were susceptible only to EC (IC50 88.27 ± 1.34 on Caco-2 cells and over 100 µg/mL on BT20 and HepG2 cells) after 24 h of exposure. In an LPS-induced damage mouse model of , we showed that preventive administration increases the survival times of mice and leads to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. Both polar and nonpolar compounds are involved in exerting these effects, but further analytical studies are needed to identify the key responsible compounds and their biochemical pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776389>PFKFB3 promotes -induced myocardial dysfunction through inflammatory signaling and apoptotic induction.</a></h2><p>Cardiac dysfunction is a vital complication during  (ETM). Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced glycolytic metabolism promotes inflammatory and myocardial diseases. In this study, we performed deep mRNA sequencing analysis on the hearts of control and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and identified that the glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) might play an indispensable role in ETM-induced cardiac damage. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the transcriptional upregulation of PFKFB3 in the myocardium of LPS-challenged mice and immunoblotting and immunostaining assays confirmed that LPS stimulation markedly increased the expression of PFKFB3 at the protein level both in vivo and in vitro. The potent antagonist 3-(3pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) was used to block PFKFB3 activity in vivo (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and in vitro (10 μM). Echocardiographic analysis and TUNEL staining showed that 3PO significantly alleviated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and apoptotic injury in vivo. 3PO also suppressed the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and lactate in the serum, in addition to lactate in the myocardium. PFKFB3 inhibition also diminished the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in both adult cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis showed that 3PO inhibited LPS-induced apoptotic induction in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PFKFB3 participates in LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction via mediating inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the role of burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility (BIGD) in promoting bacterial translocation following burn injury, and the protective effect of ghrelin in this process.We assessed gastric emptying (GE%) and intestinal transit (IT by geometric center "GC") in a 60% total body surface area scald burn rat model and measured bacterial counts in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and distal small intestine by colony-forming unit per gram of tissue (CFU/g). A group of animals was treated with ghrelin or saline after burn.Scald burn was associated with a significant delay in GE (62% ± 4% vs 74% ± 4%; P = .02) and a trend of delay in intestinal transit (GC: 5.5 ± 0.1 vs 5.8 ± 0.2; P = .09). Concurrently, there was a marginal increase in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (6 × 10 vs 2 × 10  CFU/g; P = .05) and significant translocation to MLN (2 × 10 vs 4 × 10 ; P = .03). We observed a negative correlation between GE and intestinal bacterial overgrowth (r  = -0.61; P = .002) and between IT and translocation (r  = -0.63; P = .004). Ghrelin administration significantly accelerated GE following burn injury (91% ± 3% vs 62% ± 4; P = .03), reduced small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and completely inhibited translocation to MLN (0.0 vs 5 × 10 ; P = .01).Burn-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility is correlated with the systemic translocation of gram-negative gut bacteria that are implicated in multiple organ failure in burn patients.

We report herein that chronic subclinical , a risk factor for atherosclerosis, skewed neutrophils into a nonresolving inflammatory state with elevated levels of inflammatory mediators (Dectin-1, MMP9, and LTB4) and reduced levels of homeostatic mediators (LRRC32, TGFβ, and FPN). The polarization of neutrophils was due to ROS-mediated activation of oxCAMKII, caused by altered peroxisome homeostasis and reduced lysosome fusion. Application of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) enhanced peroxisome homeostasis of neutrophils, reduced oxCAMKII, and rebalanced the expression profiles of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that FcGRIIb deficient mice (FcGRIIb-/-; a lupus mouse model) are susceptible to LPS tolerance-induced decreased cytokine responses that inadequate for the organismal control. Thus, understanding the relationship between FcGRIIb and LPS tolerance could improve the therapeutic strategy for lupus. LPS tolerance can be induced through sequential LPS stimulations in either cells or a model organism. In RAW264.7 (a mouse macrophage cell-line), sequential LPS stimulation induced the secretion of Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) despite reduced cytokine secretion and severe energy depletion, as measured by the extracellular flux analysis, typical of LPS tolerance. In contrast, treatment with recombinant Lcn-2 (rLcn-2) attenuated LPS tolerance, as shown by an increase in secreted cytokines and altered macrophage polarization toward M1 (increased  and ) in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest a role of Lcn-2 in LPS tolerance attenuation. In bone marrow derived macrophages, Lcn-2 level was similar in LPS tolerant FcGRIIb-/- and wild-type (WT) cells despite the increased LPS tolerance of FcGRIIb-/- cells, suggesting relatively low basal levels of Lcn-2 produced in FcGRIIb-/- cells. In addition, attenuation of LPS tolerance effectuated by granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reduced Lcn-2 in both cell types, implying an inverse correlation between Lcn-2 and the severity of LPS tolerance. Consequently, rLcn-2 improved LPS tolerance only in FcGRIIb-/- macrophages and attenuated disease severity of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis pre-conditioning with sequential LPS injection (LPS-CLP model) only in FcGRIIb-/- mice, but not in WT mice. To summarize, inadequate Lcn-2 production in FcGRIIb-/- macrophage might, at least in part, be responsible for the inordinate LPS tolerance compared with WT cells. Additionally, supplementation of rLcn-2 attenuates LPS tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- macrophages in vitro, and in FcGRIIb-/- mice with LPS-CLP sepsis in vivo. In conclusion, Lcn-2 secreted by macrophages is possibly an autocrine signal to counter the reduced cytokine secretion in LPS tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425341>Sevoflurane Preconditioning Prevents Septic Myocardial Dysfunction in Lipopolysaccharide-Challenged Mice.</a></h2><p>Myocardial dysfunction accompanied by severe sepsis could significantly increase the mortality rate of septic patients. This study investigated the effects and the potential mechanisms of sevoflurane preconditioning on septic myocardial dysfunction which was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; from Escherichia coli O55:B5; 18 mg/kg) in mice. Results indicated that one hour after the administration, LPS induced a significant increase in cell-surface Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cytoplasmic IKKα protein expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) protein (P<0.05), which was attenuated by preconditioning with sevoflurane. Two hours after the administration, inhalation of sevoflurane significantly reduced the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 (P < 0.05). Twelve hours after administration, LPS caused pathological damage to the heart and elevated the serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB; P < 0.05). Echocardiography indicated that sevoflurane preconditioning significantly improved systolic and diastolic function. The inhalation of sevoflurane inhibited increases in myeloperoxidase (MPO), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), TNF-α and IL-1β levels (P < 0.05) induced by , whereas IL-6 release was facilitated. Sevoflurane attenuated the myocardial levels of nitric oxide (NO; P < 0.05) without an apparent influence on malondialdehyde (MDA), or superoxide dismutase (SOD; P > 0.05).

The aim of this review was to update the available information indicating the potential of iron chelators as adjuvant drugs in the management of obesity and its comorbidities. The pharmacological actions of iron chelators, mainly deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone, on adipose tissue and liver alterations associated with obesity, were reviewed. Renal and other organ modifications observed in experimental obesity models (, β-cell function, and systemic inflammation) were included, as well as data from clinical studies that were relevant to this review. The experimental results obtained with iron chelators showed their potential in the control of obesity-induced alterations in the adipose tissue and liver. However, knowledge about the possible systemic effects on  and low-grade inflammation in obesity models is still lacking. In  in humans, data obtained did not corroborate the anti-inflammatory effect described in experimental models. Clinical and experimental data reveal renal, β-cell protection and inhibition of advanced glycation end products, which have long-term benefits in obesity. Experimental models of obesity demonstrated the beneficial effects of iron chelators on the adipose tissue, liver, kidneys, and β-cells.

The anti-inflammatory effects of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator metformin in sepsis has been revealed. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. In the present study, the potential roles of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in the effects of metformin on endothelial pro-inflammatory responses were investigated. The results showed that metformin pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of HDAC5 at serine 498, leading to the upregulation of KLF2, and eliminated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor ⍺ (TNF⍺)-induced upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Furthermore, the adhesion of HL60 leukocytes to endothelial monolayer was effectively inhibited by metformin. In addition, the in vivo data confirmed that AMPK activation attenuated local and systemic inflammation in endotoxic mice induced by LPS via mediating phosphorylating HDAC5 and restoring KLF2 expression. Our findings revealed that AMPK activation-mediated HDAC5 phosphorylation and KLF2 restoration is, at least partially, responsible to the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin in -induced endothelial cells, which has important implications for the future development of interfering therapies of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) ameliorates the histological features of NASH; satisfactory antifibrotic effects have not yet been reported. Here, we investigated the combined effects of OCA + a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fifty Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino-acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 12 weeks. The in vitro and in vivo effects of OCA + sitagliptin were assessed along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade and intestinal barrier function. Direct inhibitory effects of OCA + sitagliptin on activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSCs) were assessed in vitro.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin potentially inhibited hepatic fibrogenesis along with Ac-HSC proliferation and hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, α1(I)-procollagen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) mRNA expression and hydroxyproline levels. Obeticholic acid inhibited hepatic TLR4 expression and increased hepatic matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. Obeticholic acid decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating CDAA diet-induced zonula occludens-1 disruption, whereas sitagliptin directly inhibited Ac-HSC proliferation. The in vitro suppressive effects of OCA + sitagliptin on TGF-β1 and α1(I)-procollagen mRNA expression and p38 phosphorylation in Ac-HSCs were almost consistent. Sitagliptin directly inhibited the regulation of Ac-HSC.Treatment with OCA + sitagliptin synergistically affected hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting  induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing Ac-HSC proliferation.

The causes, interrelationships, and consequences of CVID-associated CD4 T-cell derangements to hypogammaglobulinemia, autoantibody production, or both remain unclear.We sought to determine how circulating CD4 T cells are altered in CVID subjects with autoimmune cytopenias (AICs; CVID+AIC) and the causes of these derangements.Using hypothesis-generating, high-dimensional single-cell analyses, we created comprehensive phenotypic maps of circulating CD4 T cells. Differences between subject groups were confirmed in a large and genetically diverse cohort of CVID subjects (n = 69) by using flow cytometry, transcriptional profiling, multiplex cytokine/chemokine detection, and a suite of in vitro functional assays measuring naive T-cell differentiation, B-cell/T-cell cocultures, and regulatory T-cell suppression.Although CD4 T cell profiles from healthy donors and CVID subjects without AICs were virtually indistinguishable, T cells from CVID+AIC subjects exhibited follicular features as early as thymic egress. Follicular skewing correlated with IgA deficiency-associated  and endotoxin-induced expression of activin A and inducible T-cell costimulator ligand. The resulting enlarged circulating follicular helper T-cell population from CVID+AIC subjects provided efficient help to receptive healthy donor B cells but not unresponsive CVID B cells.

The conductance catheter-derived pressure-volume loop area reflects left ventricular stroke work (LV SW). Dividing LV SW by time, a measure of LV SW min is obtained sharing the same unit as CPO (W). We aimed to validate CPO as a marker of LV SW min under various inotropic states.We retrospectively analysed data obtained from experimental studies of the hemodynamic impact of mild hypothermia and hyperthermia on acute heart failure. Fifty-nine anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated closed-chest Landrace pigs (68 ± 1 kg) were instrumented with Swan-Ganz and LV pressure-volume catheters. Data were obtained at body temperatures of 33.0 °C, 38.0 °C and 40.5 °C; before and after: resuscitation, myocardial infarction, , sevoflurane-induced myocardial depression and beta-adrenergic stimulation. We plotted LVSW min against CPO by linear regression analysis, as well as against the following classical indices of LV function and work: LV ejection fraction (LV EF), rate-pressure product (RPP), triple product (TP), LV maximum pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of rise of LVP (LV dP/dt).CPO showed the best correlation with LV SW min (r = 0.89; p < 0.05) while LV EF did not correlate at all (r = 0.01; p = 0.259). Further parameters correlated moderately with LV SW min (LVP r = 0.47, RPP r = 0.67; and TP r = 0.54). LV dP/dt correlated worst with LV SW min (r = 0.28).CPO reflects external cardiac work over a wide range of inotropic states.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to improve glucose control and the inflammatory response. We aimed to determine the effects of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) enriched with ω-3 fatty acids (O3KD) on glucose levels and inflammation in mice with .Adult mice were fed 1 of 3 diets (control diet [CD], EKD, or O3KD). After 4 weeks, each group received saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally during the postprandial (PPP) or postabsorptive (PAP) periods. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL) 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of serum fatty acids was determined by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.During the PPP, glucose curves were comparable among the experimental groups. During the PAP, EKD showed a more pronounced increase in glucose levels at the first hour after LPS challenge compared with the CD-LPS group. During the PAP, IL6 was lower in O3KD-LPS compared with CD-LPS and EKD-LPS groups. These differences disappeared in the PPP. Similarly, TNF-α was lower in the O3KD-LPS group compared with the EKD-LPS group.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal gluconeogenesis gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome dysbiosis" is a factor in the development of "metabolic " and T2DM.

We have previously shown that exercise training improves intestinal metabolism in healthy men. To understand whether changes in intestinal metabolism interact with gut microbiota and its release of inflammatory markers, we studied the effects of sprint interval (SIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on intestinal metabolism and microbiota in insulin resistance.Twenty-six, sedentary subjects (prediabetic n=9, T2D n=17; age 49[SD 4] years; BMI 30.5[SD 3]) were randomized into SIT or MICT. Intestinal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (GU) and fatty acid uptake (FAU) from circulation were measured using PET. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and serum inflammatory markers with multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunoassay kit.VO2peak improved only after SIT (p=0.01). Both training modes reduced systematic and intestinal inflammatory markers (TNF α, LBP) (time p<0.05). Training modified microbiota profile by increasing Bacteroidetes phylum (time p=0.03) and decreasing Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (time p=0.04). Moreover, there was a decrease in Clostridium genus (time p=0.04) and Blautia (time p=0.051). Only MICT decreased jejunal FAU (p=0.02). Training had no significant effect on intestinal GU.

However, the molecular mechanism of such changes remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the possible involvement of connexin43- and connexin45-based hemichannels (Cx43 and Cx45 HCs, respectively) as putative mediators of sarcolemmal dysfunctions induced by LPS in control (Cx43Cx45) and Cx43/Cx45 expression-deficient (Cx43Cx45:Myo-Cre) skeletal mice myofibers. At 5 h of , control myofibers presented Cx43 and Cx45 proteins forming functional HCs. Additionally, myofibers from endotoxic control mice showed dye uptake in vivo, which was inhibited by carbenoxolone, a Cx HC blocker. A similar increase in membrane permeability was observed in myofibers freshly isolated from skeletal muscle of mice treated for 5 h with LPS, which was blocked by the Cx HC blocker and was absent in myofibers from mice simultaneously treated with LPS and boldine, which is a Cx HC blocker.

VIP has, therefore, been proposed as a novel anti-inflammatory which could be used in the treatment of Gram negative sepsis. However, the effect of VIP has not been reported in mice infected with viable Gram negative bacteria. Here, we show that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 4/74 significantly increased expression of mRNA of a type 1 receptor (VPAC1) for anti-inflammatory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in murine ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes at day 6 post-infection (d6 pi) and in the spleen at d3 pi. When VIP (5 nmol/ml) was administered to S. Typhimurium-infected mice, there was a significant increase in the number of S. Typhimurium cultured from murine faeces and ileum at d3 and 6 pi and in MLN and spleen at d3 dpi, compared to faeces and tissues examined from mice infected with S. Typhimurium (without VIP administration). Administration of VIP to S. Typhimurium-infected mice also altered the splenic architecture, resulting in a lack of discernable periarterial lymphoid sheaths or marginal zones at d6 pi but liver histology appeared similar on both d3 and d6 pi. The effects of VIP administration were correlated with a significant decrease in expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA, associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of bacteraemia and acute sepsis. We conclude that VIP inhibits expression of diagnostic/prognostic cytokine biomarkers of sepsis in S. Typhimurium-infected mice. However, this occurred with a concomitant increase in Salmonella growth in tissues and increased bacterial shedding in faeces. Thus, VIP may have potential as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics in sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we tested the possible use of PEL in the treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated vascular inflammatory responses. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, neutrophils adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mice. We found that PEL inhibited LPS-induced barrier disruption, expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and adhesion/transendothelial migration of neutrophils to human endothelial cells. PEL also suppressed LPS-induced hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in vivo. Furthermore, PEL suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 by LPS. Moreover, treatment with PEL resulted in reduced LPS-induced lethal .

Hypercatabolism was measured by insulin resistance, muscle protein synthesis, and atrophy. Serum gastrointestinal hormones, hypothalamic ghrelin, growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1α (GHS-R1α), and AMPK-autophagy-POMC markers were also detected.GF increased serum total, acylated, desacylated, and hypothalamic ghrelin and decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). But no effect on pancreatic polypeptide (PYY) and hypothalamic GHS-R1α was observed. JF showed no effect on hypothalamic ghrelin, GHS-R1α, and serum total, acylated, and desacylated ghrelin and even further aggravated GLP-1 and PYY. GF could effectively augment hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy-POMC and hypercatabolism. However, JF showed no effect on hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy-POMC and hypercatabolism.GF could activate hypothalamic AMPK-autophagy and suppress POMC expression via gastrointestinal hormones to ameliorate hypercatabolism compared with JF, which suggested that GF may be the preferred route of EN in endotoxemic rats.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412673>Metabolic : A Potential Underlying Mechanism of the Relationship between Dietary Fat Intake and Risk for Cognitive Impairments in Humans?</a></h2><p>(1) Background: Nutrition is a major lifestyle factor that can prevent the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

Bioactive compounds derived from plants are an important source of potential novel therapies for the treatment of chronic diseases. In search for new immune based treatments of obesity associated insulin resistance, we screened for tissue relevant anti-inflammatory properties in 20 plant-based extracts.We screened 20 plant-based extracts to assess for preferential production of IL-10 compared to TNFα, specifically targetting metabolic tissues, including the visceral adipose tissue. We assessed the therapeutic potential of the strongest anti-inflammatory compound, indigo, in the C57BL/6J diet-induced obesity mouse model with supplementation for up to 16 weeks by measuring changes in body weight, glucose and insulin tolerance, and gut barrier function. We also utilized flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and histology to measure changes to immune cells populations and cytokine profiles in the intestine, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and liver. 16SrRNA sequencing was performed to examine gut microbial differences induced by indigo supplementation.We identifed indigo, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand agonist, as a potent inducer of IL-10 and IL-22, which protects against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance and fatty liver disease in the diet-induced obesity model. Therapeutic actions were mechanistically linked to decreased inflammatory immune cell tone in the intestine, VAT and liver. Specifically, indigo increased Lactobacillus bacteria and elicited IL-22 production in the gut, which improved intestinal barrier permeability and reduced .

Previously, we reported that orphan nuclear receptor TR3/Nur77 was a critical mediator of angiogenesis to regulate tumor growth and skin wound healing via regulating the expression of the junctional proteins and integrins. However, the molecular mechanism, by which TR3/Nur77 regulates angiogenesis is not completely understood. Here, we were the first to find that TR3/Nur77, via its various amino acid fragments, regulated the expression of DLL4 and Jagged 1 in cultured endothelial cells. DLL4 and Jagged1 mediated TR3/Nur77-induced angiogenic responses and signaling molecules, but not the expression of integrins. Instead, integrins regulated the expressions of DLL4 and Jagged1 induced by TR3/Nur77. Further, DLL4, Jagged1 and integrins α1, α2, β3 and β5 were regulated by TR3/Nur77 in animal sepsis models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced , and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), in which, TR3/Nur77 expression was significantly and tranciently increased.

Both intestinal permeability and serum endotoxin levels were higher in colchicine-treated mice than in control mice. Although colchicine-poisoned mice died within 25 h, those that also received TAK-242 treatment survived for more than 48 h.Colchicine disrupted intestinal barrier function and caused endotoxin shock. Therapeutic inhibition of LPS-TLR4 signaling might be beneficial for treating acute colchicine poisoning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822415>Ultralow doses of dextromethorphan protect mice from endotoxin-induced sepsis-like hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Dextromethorphan, a wildly used over-the-counter antitussive drug, is reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that dextromethorphan at micromolar doses displays potent hepatoprotective effects and enhances mice survival in a sepsis model. Moreover, we also observed potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of subpicomolar concentrations of dextromethorphan in rodent primary neuron-glial cultures. The purpose of this study was to provide a proof of principle that ultralow dose dextromethorphan displays anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in animal studies. Here, we report that subpico- and micromolar doses of dextromethorphan showed comparable efficacy in protecting mice from lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-induced hepatotoxicity and mortality. Mice were given injections of dextromethorphan from 30 min before and 2, 4 h after an injection of LPS/GalN (20 μg/600 mg/kg). Our results showed that dextromethorphan at subpicomolar doses promoted survival rate in LPS/GalN-injected mice. Ultralow dose dextromethorphan also significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activity, TNF-α level and liver cell damage of  mice. Mechanistic studies using primary liver Kupffer cell cultures revealed that subpicomolar concentrations of dextromethorphan reduced the NADPH oxidase-generated superoxide free radicals from Kupffer cells, which in turn reduced the elevation of its downstream reactive oxygen species (iROS) to relieve the oxidative stress and decreased TNF-α production in Kupffer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel therapeutic concept of using ultralow doses of dextromethorphan for the intervention of sepsis or septic shock.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192483>Inducible nitric oxide synthase: Regulation, structure, and inhibition.</a></h2><p>A considerable number of human diseases have an inflammatory component, and a key mediator of immune activation and inflammation is inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO) from l-arginine. Overexpressed or dysregulated iNOS has been implicated in numerous pathologies including sepsis, cancer, neurodegeneration, and various types of pain. Extensive knowledge has been accumulated about the roles iNOS plays in different tissues and organs. Additionally, X-ray crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures have shed new insights on the structure and regulation of this enzyme. Many potent iNOS inhibitors with high selectivity over related NOS isoforms, neuronal NOS, and endothelial NOS, have been discovered, and these drugs have shown promise in animal models of , inflammatory and neuropathic pain, arthritis, and other disorders. A major issue in iNOS inhibitor development is that promising results in animal studies have not translated to humans; there are no iNOS inhibitors approved for human use. In addition to assay limitations, both the dual modalities of iNOS and NO in disease states (ie, protective vs harmful effects) and the different roles and localizations of NOS isoforms create challenges for therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes the structure, function, and regulation of iNOS, with focus on the development of iNOS inhibitors (historical and recent). A better understanding of iNOS' complex functions is necessary before specific drug candidates can be identified for classical indications such as sepsis, heart failure, and pain; however, newer promising indications for iNOS inhibition, such as depression, neurodegenerative disorders, and epilepsy, have been discovered.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357788>[Role of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease].</a></h2><p>Chronic excess alcohol intake triggers the formation of enterogenic .

However, the underlying mechanism of its beneficial effect in this inflammatory scenario remains poorly understood. Macrophages play an important role in the early stage of sepsis as they are tasked with eliminating invading microbes and also attracting other immune cells by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, the authors hypothesized that sevoflurane mitigates the proinflammatory response of macrophages, while maintaining their bactericidal properties.Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide in the presence and absence of 2% sevoflurane. Expression of cytokines and inducible NO synthase as well as uptake of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli (E. coli) were measured. The in vivo  model consisted of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection after anesthesia with either ketamine and xylazine or 4% sevoflurane. Male mice (n = 6 per group) were observed for a total of 20 h. During the last 30 min fluorescently labeled E. coli were intraperitoneally injected. Peritoneal cells were extracted by peritoneal lavage and inducible NO synthase expression as well as E. coli uptake by peritoneal macrophages was determined using flow cytometry.In vitro, sevoflurane enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced inducible NO synthase expression after 8 ;h by 466% and increased macrophage uptake of fluorescently labeled E. coli by 70% compared with vehicle-treated controls. Inhibiting inducible NO synthase expression pharmacologically abolished this increase in bacteria uptake. In vivo, inducible NO synthase expression was increased by 669% and phagocytosis of E. coli by 49% compared with the control group.Sevoflurane enhances phagocytosis of bacteria by lipopolysaccharide-challenged macrophages in vitro and in vivo via an inducible NO synthase-dependent mechanism.

In this study, we sought to determine the effects of prebiotic fibre supplementation, aerobic exercise, and the combination of the two interventions, on the development of metabolic knee osteoarthritis in a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet-induced rat model of obesity. Twelve-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into five groups: a non-exercising control group fed a standard chow diet, a non-exercising group fed a HFS diet, a non-exercising group fed a HFS diet combined with prebiotic fibre supplement, an exercise group fed a HFS diet, and an exercise group fed a HFS diet combined with prebiotic fibre supplement. Outcome measures included knee joint damage, percent body fat, insulin sensitivity, serum lipid profile, serum endotoxin, serum and synovial fluid cytokines and adipokines, and cecal microbiota. Prebiotic fibre supplementation, aerobic exercise, and the combination of the two interventions completely prevented knee joint damage that is otherwise observed in this rat model of obesity. Prevention of knee damage was associated with a normalization of insulin resistance, leptin levels, dyslipidemia, gut microbiota, and  in the HFS-fed rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31512266>Malnutrition Predisposes to Endotoxin-Induced Edema and Impaired Inflammatory Response in Parenterally Fed Piglets.</a></h2><p>Poor nutrition status is common among hospitalized children and children in low-income countries and may be associated with increased susceptibility to edema and infections. We hypothesized that poor nutrition status, established with a suboptimal composition of parenteral nutrition (PN), predisposes to -induced edema, oxidative stress, and dysregulated immune responses.Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, 3-day-old piglets (n = 40) were given either optimal or suboptimal composition of PN for 7 days and then infused with either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 9 hours to induce an acute-phase reaction. Abdominal tissue edema and blood markers of immunity, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed.Piglets receiving suboptimal nutrition showed signs of malnutrition with restricted growth, signs of inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6, and serum amyloid A levels), oxidative stress (lower erythrocyte glutathione/hemoglobin and α-tocopherol/cholesterol ratios), and liver dysfunction (increased liver weight and blood bilirubin levels). Perirenal edema was more excessive in malnourished LPS-infused animals, relative to healthy LPS-infused control animals (P < .01). Malnutrition reduced the inflammatory response to LPS (lower CRP, tumor necrosis factor-α, haptoglobin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) but did not influence LPS-induced oxidative stress markers.We conclude that  and malnutrition in combination lead to acute-phase hyporesponsiveness and perirenal edema in piglets. This finding may have implications for pediatric patients that suffer from malnutrition, as their response to bacterial infections may differ substantially from patients of normal nutrition status.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605364>Evaluation of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin as a Predictor of Glomerular Filtration Rate and Amikacin Clearance During Early Rat : Comparison with Traditional Endogenous and Exogenous Biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Renal elimination of amikacin and other aminoglycosides is slowed down in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury increasing the risk of adverse effects. Since neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and aminoglycosides share the mechanisms for renal excretion, the predictive power of NGAL was examined towards the changes in amikacin pharmacokinetics during early  in anesthetized Wistar rats.Endogenous biomarkers of inflammation and acute kidney injury were assessed including NGAL in saline-injected controls and two groups of rats challenged with an intravenous injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5 mg/kg)-a fluid-resuscitated group (LPS) and a fluid-resuscitated group infused intravenously with 8 μg/kg/h terlipressin (LPS-T). Sinistrin and amikacin were infused to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and amikacin clearance (CL). The investigations included blood gas analysis, chemistry and hematology tests and assessment of urine output, creatinine clearance (CL) and sinistrin clearance (CL).Within 3 h of injection, systemic and renal inflammatory responses were induced by lipopolysaccharide. Gene and protein expression of NGAL was increased in the kidneys and the concentrations of NGAL in the plasma (pNGAL) and urine rose 4- to 38-fold (P < 0.01). The decreases in CL and the GFR markers (CL, CL) were proportional, reflecting the extent to which  impaired the major elimination mechanism for the drug. Terlipressin attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced renal dysfunction (urine output, CL, CL) and accelerated CL. The pNGAL showed a strong association with the CL (rs = - 0.77, P < 0.0005). Concerning prediction of CL, pNGAL was comparable to CL (mean error - 24%) and inferior to CL (mean error - 6.4%), while the measurement of NGAL in urine gave unsatisfactory results.During early  in the rat, pNGAL has a moderate predictive ability towards CL.

DCs recognize and respond to bacteria through multiple PRRs, including TLRs. Heat shock protein gp96/grp94 is a master essential chaperone for TLRs in the endoplasmic reticulum. We generated DC-specific gp96-knockout (KO) mice and showed that gp96 KO DCs were unable to respond to multiple TLR ligands. TLR-mediated hyperinflammatory response can lead to sepsis. However, the roles of neither DCs nor the DC-intrinsic gp96 in the process are completely understood. In a LPS-induced sepsis model, we hereby found that deletion of gp96 in DCs significantly reduced serum TNF-α levels and improved survival. Furthermore, using the well-defined polymicrobial sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture, we found that DC-specific ablation of gp96 improved survival with significantly attenuated liver and renal injuries, decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines, altered DC maturation and activation, and increased serum Ig. Collectively, we demonstrate that deletion of gp96 in DCs is beneficial in protecting mice against sepsis induced by both  and polymicrobial infections. We conclude that targeting gp96 in DCs may provide a potential novel approach for reducing the morbidity and mortality of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911151>-induced endothelial fibrosis inhibition improves hypotension, tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, cytokine response, oxidative stress, and survival.</a></h2><p>Sepsis syndrome is the leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care. However, current therapies for sepsis treatment are unsatisfactory, and the mortality rate is still high. The main pathological characteristics observed during sepsis syndrome and  include hypotension, tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), tissue damage, and cytokine and oxidative bursts. These conditions severely decrease the survival rates of endotoxemic patients. As a consequence of , large amounts of endotoxin circulate in the bloodstream throughout the vascular system and interact directly with endothelial cells that cover the inner wall of blood vessels. Endothelial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharides exhibit conversion to activated fibroblasts. By means of endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis, endothelial cells downregulate the expression of endothelial proteins and express fibrotic and ECM markers throughout endothelial protein expression reprogramming. Although endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis should, in theory, be detrimental to endothelial vascular function, the role of endothelial fibrosis in sepsis syndrome or  is not known. Therefore, we employed a rat model to investigate whether the inhibition of endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis protects against  and whether this inhibition increases survival. Our results show that the inhibition of endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis reduced both hypotension and tachycardia. -induced MODS was also decreased when endothelial fibrosis was inhibited; treated rats showed normal kidney and liver function, inhibition of muscle mass wasting and normal glycemia. Liver and kidney histology was preserved, and organ fibrosis and fibrotic protein expression were reduced. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and NOX-2-mediated oxidative stress bursts were decreased when endothelial fibrosis was inhibited. Remarkably, the risk of death associated with sepsis syndrome at early and late time points was decreased when -induced endothelial fibrosis was inhibited, and a significant increase in survival was observed.

In the present study, we modeled SAE by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally to mice at a concentration of 3.0 mg/kg. We investigated regional preferences for cytokine-mediated brain reactions to  and at what time point brain inflammation begins, as well as what cytokines are involved in acute brain reactions. Brains were divided into seven parts: cortex (CTX), olfactory system (Olf), hippocampus (Hip), striatum (Str), diencephalon (Die), brain stem (BS), and cerebellum (CBL). In each brain region, we determined the tissue concentrations of 11 cytokines: CCL2, CCL3, CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in mice injected with LPS or saline, at 1, 4, and 24 h after injection using multiplex cytokine assays. Every brain region responded with the production of multiple cytokines to LPS-induced systemic inflammation during the acute phase (4-24 h) after LPS injection. IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, and TNF-α were "early cytokines" that increased only at 4 h but not at 24 h after LPS injection in most brain regions. CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF were "late cytokines" that were elevated up to 24 h after LPS injection in selected brain regions. The regions Olf, Hip, and Die were the most responsive to ; these regions produced ten cytokines and continued to produce three "late cytokines" up to 24 h after LPS injection. Str was the least responsive to . The widespread nature of brain cytokine production explains the characteristics of SAE. Further studies on the roles of CCL11, CXCL10, and G-CSF may be especially important in terms of potential prevention of SAE between 4 and 24 h after the onset of sepsis.Copyright © 2019.

The loss of IEB integrity promotes , that is, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation from the intestinal lumen to the circulatory system. This condition induces an enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which leads to neuroinflammation through the gut-brain axis. Orexin-A (OX-A), a neuropeptide implicated in many physiological functions and produced mainly in the brain lateral hypothalamic area, is expressed also in several peripheral tissues. Orexin-producing neurons have been found in the myenteric plexus to project to orexin receptor 1 (OX-1R)-expressing enterocytes of the intestinal villi. In the present study we investigated the protective role of OX-A against LPS-induced increase of IEB permeability and microglia activation in both an  and  model of the gut-brain axis.

However, there are different doses of LPS used in several studies, and the hemodynamic responses were not always well characterized. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the arterial pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, and baroreflex function from rats, over time, to different doses of LPS. Femoral artery and vein catheters were inserted into anesthetized Wistar-Hannover male rats for arterial pressure recording and LPS administration, respectively. On the next day, the arterial pressure was recorded before and after (90, 180, and 360 min) LPS injection (0.06, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg). All doses of LPS tested increased the heart rate and decreased baroreflex sensitivity over time. In addition, while LPS administration of 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg increased the mean arterial pressure over time, 0.06 mg/kg decreased the mean arterial pressure at 360 min, as compared to baseline values. Furthermore, high doses of LPS decreased the power of the HF band of the cardiac interval spectrum over time, and the higher dose increased the power of the LF band. Our data indicate that high doses of LPS promote hypertensive response over time, while a low dose decreases arterial pressure. Moreover, the changes in heart rate variability and baroreflex function elicited by LPS may be not associated with arterial pressure response produced by the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024522>Forebrain Cholinergic Signaling Regulates Innate Immune Responses and Inflammation.</a></h2><p>The brain regulates physiological functions integral to survival. However, the insight into brain neuronal regulation of peripheral immune function and the neuromediator systems and pathways involved remains limited. Here, utilizing selective genetic and pharmacological approaches, we studied the role of forebrain cholinergic signaling in the regulation of peripheral immune function and inflammation. Forebrain-selective genetic ablation of acetylcholine release and vagotomy abolished the suppression of serum TNF by the centrally-acting cholinergic drug galantamine in murine . Selective stimulation of acetylcholine action on the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR) by central administration of the positive allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) suppressed serum TNF (TNFα) levels in murine . This effect was recapitulated by peripheral administration of the compound. BQCA also improved survival in murine  and these effects were abolished in M1 mAChR knockout (KO) mice. Selective optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons innervating brain regions with abundant M1 mAChR localization reduced serum TNF in endotoxemic mice. These findings reveal that forebrain cholinergic neurons regulate innate immune responses and inflammation, suggesting the possibility that in diseases associated with cholinergic dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease this anti-inflammatory regulation can be impaired.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of RIC on septic cardiomyopathy and associated multi-organ failure in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis mouse model. Balb/c mice were divided into sham, LPS, and LPS + RIC groups. LPS 10 mg/kg or saline control was injected intraperitoneally. RIC was performed by four cycles of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion of the left lower limb just before the LPS injection. Cardiac function on echocardiography, circulating mediators, blood biochemistry, and MAPK signalling was assessed. Survival 7 days after LPS injection was evaluated in sham-treated, RIC, and daily repeated RIC groups. An LPS-induced decrease in cardiac output was ameliorated by RIC with preserved left ventricular systolic function. LPS-induced increases in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) were significantly suppressed by RIC. RIC also suppressed increases in plasma cardiac troponin I, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine with suppressed ERK and JNK phosphorylation in heart, liver, and kidney tissue. RIC significantly improved survival rate (p = 0.0037). Survival rate in the daily repeated RIC group was 100%, and it was higher than that in the RIC group (p = 0.0088). In summary, RIC reduced circulating and myocardial inflammatory mediators associated with septic cardiomyopathy, and led to improved ventricular function, cardiac output, and survival. Our data also revealed that chronic RIC has additional benefit in terms of mortality in sepsis. While further studies are required, RIC may be a clinically useful tool to ameliorate sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811958>miR-144-mediated Inhibition of ROCK1 Protects against LPS-induced Lung Endothelial Hyperpermeability.</a></h2><p>Dysfunctional endothelial cell (EC) barrier and increased lung vascular permeability is a cardinal feature of acute lung injury and sepsis that may result in a pathophysiological condition characterized by alveolar flooding, pulmonary edema, and subsequent hypoxemia. In lung ECs, activation of Rho-associated kinase-1 (ROCK1) phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC)-associated phosphatase at its inhibitory site, which favors phosphorylation of MLC, stress fiber formation, and hyperpermeability during acute lung injury. The role of microRNA-144 (miR-144) has been well investigated in many human diseases, including cardiac ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury, lung cancer, and lung viral infection; however, its role in pulmonary EC barrier regulation remains obscure. Here, we investigated the miR-144-mediated mechanism in the protection of endothelial barrier function in an LPS-induced lung injury model. By using transendothelial electrical resistance and transwell permeability assay to examine  permeability and immunofluorescence microscopy to determine barrier integrity, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-144 effectively blocked lung EC barrier disruption and hyperpermeability in response to proinflammatory agents. Furthermore, using a gain-and-loss-of-function strategy, overexpression of miR-144 significantly decreased ROCK1 expression. Concomitantly, miR-144 inhibits ROCK1-mediated phosphorylation of MLC phosphatase and thus phosphorylation of MLC to counteract stress fiber formation in LPS-activated EC. Finally, in LPS-challenged mice, intranasal delivery of miR-144 mimic via liposomes attenuated -induced increases in lung wet/dry ratio, vascular permeability, and inflammation. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-144-attenuated activation of inflammatory ROCK1/MLC pathway in vascular ECs is a promising therapeutic strategy to counter inflammatory lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154574>CNS-Specific Synthesis of Interleukin 23 Induces a Progressive Cerebellar Ataxia and the Accumulation of Both T and B Cells in the Brain: Characterization of a Novel Transgenic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Interleukin 23 (IL-23) is a key mediator in neuroinflammation in numerous autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the pathophysiology of IL-23 and how it contributes to neuroinflammation is poorly defined. To further clarify the role of IL-23 in CNS inflammation, we generated a transgenic mouse model (GF-IL23) with astrocyte-targeted expression of both IL-23 subunits, IL-23p19, and IL-23p40. These GF-IL23 mice spontaneously develop a progressive ataxic phenotype, which corresponds to cerebellar tissue destruction, and inflammatory infiltrates most prominent in the subarachnoidal and perivascular space. The CNS-cytokine milieu was characterized by numerous inflammatory mediators such as IL-17a and IFNγ. However, the leukocytic infiltrates were surprisingly predominated by B cells. To further examine the impact of the CNS-specific IL-23 synthesis on an additional systemic inflammatory stimulus, we applied the LPS-induced  model. Administration of LPS in GF-IL23 mice resulted in early and pronounced microglial activation, enhanced cytokine production and, in sharp contrast to control animals, in the formation of lymphocytic infiltrates. Our model confirms a critical role for IL-23 in the induction of inflammation in the CNS, in particular facilitating the accumulation of lymphocytes in and around the brain. Thereby, CNS-specific synthesis of IL-23 is able to induce a cascade of inflammatory cytokines leading to microglia activation, astrocytosis, and ultimately tissue damage. The presented transgenic model will be a useful tool to further dissect the role of IL-23 in neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410314>Cortisol, progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and TSH responses in dogs injected with low-dose lipopolysaccharide.</a></h2><p>Stress and diseases such as  induce cortisol synthesis through a complex biosynthetic pathway involving intermediates (progesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP)) and suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis.To measure plasma concentrations of cortisol, progesterone, 17α-OHP, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in dogs experimentally injected with intravenous low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our hypothesis was that LPS treatment would elicit a significant increase in cortisol and its precursors, and a significant decrease in TSH concentration.Hormone measurements were performed on blood samples left over from a previous investigation (2011) on the effect of low-dose LPS on hematological measurands. Five sexually intact female dogs, none in estrous at the time of the study, were administered saline treatment two weeks prior to LPS treatment. LPS was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.1 µg/kg. Blood was collected before (baseline, time -24 hours) and 3-, 6- and 24-hours post-injection. Mixed model analysis for repeated measures was used, with both treatment and time as the repeated factors. Ranked transformation were applied when diagnostic analysis exhibited violation of normality and equal variance assumptions. Post hoc multiple comparisons were performed with Tukey's adjustment. Statistical significance was defined as  < 0.05.Significant differences relative to baseline values were detected following both treatments. Compared to baseline, dogs had significantly higher cortisol and 17α-OHP at 3-hours, and significantly lower TSH at 3- and 6-hours following LPS treatment. Dogs had significantly lower TSH at 6- and 24- following saline treatment. Though not statistically significant, the trend in progesterone concentrations was similar to cortisol and 17α-OHP, with an increase at 3-hours post-injection followed by a decrease close to baseline following both LPS and saline. Cortisol and 17α-OHP concentrations were higher after LPS treatment than after saline treatment at 3- and 6-hours post-injection, but differences were not statistically significant, and no significant differences between treatments were detected for any other hormone or timepoint.Cortisol and its adrenal precursors are released in the bloodstream following a low dose of LPS, while TSH appears to decrease. Similar changes occurred following saline treatment, suggesting that even routine handling and saline injection in conditioned dogs can elicit alterations in the internal equilibrium with subsequent modification of both hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and thyroid axes. Changes to adrenal and thyroid hormone concentrations must be interpreted in light of clinical information. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms of adrenal steroidal hormone synthesis and secretion in response to various stressful stimuli in both neutered and intact animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941189>Protective Effects of Evodiamine against LPS-Induced Acute Kidney Injury through Regulation of ROS-NF-B-Mediated Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical care syndrome, which is usually associated with sepsis-related . Evodiamine (EVO) is an active ingredient of many traditional medicinal formulations that possess a battery of biological activities. In the study, we aimed to evaluate the potential protective effect of EVO against lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced AKI and cytotoxicity. LPS-resulted pathological injuries were significantly ameliorated by the administration of EVO. EVO reduced the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine in LPS-treated rats. EVO also inhibited LPS-induced reduction of cell viability in NRK-52E cells. LPS-resulting increase of TNF and IL-1 in both serum and kidney of rats and NRK-52E cells was inhibited by EVO. LPS-induced increase of P65 NF-B expression was markedly inhibited by EVO. EVO-induced reduction of TNF and IL-1 expression in LPS-treated cells was blocked by overexpression of P65 NF-B. Moreover, the increase of cell viability in LPS-treated cells induced by EVO was remarkably suppressed by overexpression of P65 NF-B. LPS-resulting increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was suppressed by EVO. HO suppressed EVO-induced decrease of P65 NF-B expression and increase of cell viability in LPS-treated NRK-52E cells. Moreover, the antioxidant NAC significantly promoted EVO-induced decrease of P65 NF-B expression and increase of cell viability in LPS-treated NRK-52E cells. In conclusion, EVO had crucial protective effects against LPS-induced AKI and cytotoxicity through the antioxidant activities and thus the inhibition of inflammation.

GsdmD is detrimental in lethal  but protective in bacterial sepsis. However, little is known about its role during noninfectious/sterile injuries. In this study, we examined the contribution of GsdmD using WT and GsdmD mice in two models of noninfectious liver injury: hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS/R) and acetaminophen (APAP) overdose. GsdmD mice had significantly increased liver damage at 6 h after HS/R or APAP vs WT, shown by significantly elevated ALT level and extended areas of cell death in liver. Caspase-8, a mediator of multiple cell death pathways, was highly elevated in GsdmD mice after injury. Significantly increased cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequent high levels of apoptosis were found in livers of GsdmD mice after HS/R, a relatively mild ROS-induced liver injury. However, during more severe APAP-mediated ROS-induced liver injury, caspase-8 cleavage in GsdmD liver was inhibited compared with WT, resulting in accumulation of pro-caspase-8 and increased levels of necroptosis. Our findings indicate a novel hepatoprotective role for GsdmD in noninfectious inflammation models via regulation of caspase-8 expression and downstream cell death pathways. The effects of GsdmD protection are likely injury specific and may also depend on injury severity and levels of ROS produced. These data suggest modulation of GsdmD/caspase-8 may be a novel therapeutic option in ROS-mediated liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897322>Amitriptyline Reduces Inflammation and Mortality in a Murine Model of Sepsis.</a></h2><p>During sepsis, an unchecked pro-inflammatory response can be detrimental to the host. We investigated the potential protective effect of amitriptyline (AT).We used two murine models of sepsis: Cecal ligation and puncture and  following LPS challenge. Aural temperatures were taken and cytokines quantified by cytometric bead assay. Lung injury was determined histologically and by protein determination in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Cell accumulation in the peritoneum was analyzed by flow cytometry, as well as cytokine production and p38-phosphorylation. Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated using an in vitro transwell assay.Our findings demonstrate that AT-treated septic mice have improved survival and are protected from pulmonary edema. Treatment with AT significantly decreased serum levels of KC and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as the accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes in the peritoneum of septic mice. Peritoneal IL-10 levels in septic mice were increased upon AT treatment. Direct treatment of septic mice with IL-10 recapitulated the effects of AT. Endotoxemic mice also exhibited enhanced IL-10 production upon AT-administration and peritoneal macrophages were identified as the ATinfluenced producers of IL-10. Treatment of these cells with AT in vitro resulted in increased p38-phosphorylation and IL-10 generation, whereas ceramide and p38 inhibition had the opposite effect.Altogether, AT treatment improved survival, increased IL-10 levels, and mitigated a pro-inflammatory response during sepsis. We conclude that AT is a promising therapeutic to temper inflammation during septic shock.© Copyright by the Author(s).

More neutrophils were recruited to endotoxemic C57Bl/6 cochleae compared with both TLR4 and GCSF-KO cochleae.  enhanced BLB trafficking of biocytin-TMR in endotoxemic C57Bl/6 cochleae and this was attenuated in both TLR4 and GCSF-KO mice.Together these results suggest that TLR4-mediated innate immunity cytokine/chemokine signaling alone is not sufficient for -enhanced trafficking of biocytin-TMR and that downstream neutrophil activity is required to enhance BLB trafficking.

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In cytopathic hypoxia, impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation decreases aerobic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and potentially induces MODS. Shen-Fu (SF) injections are widely used in the treatment of various diseases. SF exhibits cardiovascular protective effects. For example, it can stretch the coronary artery, stabilize blood pressure, regulate IRI, and improve the overall heart function. Clinical studies have demonstrated that SF injections have notable therapeutic effects on septic and hemorrhagic shocks.

Host iron acquisition by pathogens and systemic inflammatory response are key events in the pathogenesis of sepsis. In sepsis, hepcidin induces iron sequestration to limit iron availability to pathogens. Hepcidin is also known to limit inflammation. Since its role in pathophysiology of sepsis-associated AKI is unknown, we investigated the effect of exogenous hepcidin in endotoxin- and peritonitis-induced pathology and AKI.  C57BL/6 mice were treated with saline or 50-100 µg of hepcidin, pre- and post-LPS injection, or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP, model of peritonitis). Splenectomized mice were challenged with LPS, with and without hepcidin. Mice were euthanized at 24 h after LPS injection and at different time points after CLP. Systemic inflammation and renal injury markers were assessed. Direct effect of hepcidin on renal tubular and endothelial cells was evaluated using endotoxin-induced cytotoxic serum. Role of heavy chain ferritin (H-ferritin) in mediating hepcidin-induced anti-inflammatory effect on LPS stimulated macrophages was evaluated with siRNA studies.  Twenty-four hours pretreatment with hepcidin significantly reduced LPS-induced AKI. Hepcidin ameliorated LPS-induced increase in serum TNFα and renal Cox-2, and prevented loss in PGC1α and cytochrome c oxidase activity. This was associated with reduced glomerular injury and preserved mitochondrial structure. Hepcidin did not exert direct protection on the renal parenchymal cells but reduced endotoxin-induced serum cytotoxicity to mitigate renal injury. Splenectomy reduced LPS-induced early inflammation and AKI, independent of hepcidin, indicating the importance of systemic inflammation. Higher splenic H-ferritin in hepcidin-treated animals was associated with reduced splenocytes apoptosis and inflammation. Hepcidin reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in macrophages in H-ferritin dependent manner. Hepcidin significantly reduced CLP-induced AKI, and mortality (20% hepcidin treated vs 80% PBS treated). Importantly hepcidin reduced bacteremia and AKI even when administered after onset of sepsis.  We demonstrate a protective role of hepcidin in endotoxin- and peritonitis-induced pathologies and AKI, exerted primarily through its anti-inflammatory effects, and antibacterial property. Macrophage H-ferritin plays an important role in hepcidin-mediated protection against endotoxin-induced inflammation. We uncover a novel prophylactic and therapeutic role of hepcidin in sepsis-associated bacteremia, AKI, and mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645541>The flavonoid-rich Quzhou Fructus Aurantii extract modulates gut microbiota and prevents obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>Flavonoids are reported to modulate the composition of gut microbiota, which play an important role in preventing obesity and associated metabolic diseases.

When the animals completed 46 days old, they received PBS or Imipramine for 14 days. At the age of 60 days, it was evaluated the consumption of sucrose; immobility time; adrenal gland and the hippocampus weight; levels of plasma corticosterone and hippocampal BDNF.It was observed that the animals exposed to LPS in the neonatal period and evaluated in adulthood had a decrease in the consumption of sucrose; an increase of immobility time; reduction of hippocampus weight; an increase of adrenal gland weight; and an increase in plasma levels of corticosteroids. The use of imipramine only did not modify the decreased hippocampal weight. On the other hand, there were no alterations in the BDNF levels in hippocampus with or without the use of imipramine.These results suggest that neonatal immune activation may be associated with depressive-like parameters in adulthood.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is responsible for LPS-associated immune response and is expressed on numerous immune cells including B lymphocytes. TLR4 is expressed in a functional form on mouse B lymphocytes, a species much less susceptible to  compared with humans who are highly sensitive to endotoxin. Humans possess B lymphocytes that are not responsive to LPS. Likewise, horses are highly susceptible to  but the expression and function of TLR4 on horse B lymphocytes is not known. Colic, the major cause of mortality in horses, is often complicated by resultant . The objective of this study was to determine the expression and function of TLR4 on equine B lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were collected from six horses, and the expression and function of TLR4 was analyzed for each horse. Flow cytometry results indicate TLR4 is expressed on horse B lymphocytes but stimulation with LPS did not alter this expression (P = 0.99) compared with unstimulated B lymphocytes after 24 h. After 72 h of in vitro LPS stimulation, analysis of cell proliferation dye by flow cytometry demonstrated that equine B lymphocytes did not proliferate, while mouse B lymphocytes predictably did. Furthermore, the total number of LPS stimulated equine B lymphocytes did not significantly differ from unstimulated cells after 72 h of culture (P = 0.92). Horse lymphocytes exhibited no significant differences in the measured TLR4 signaling pathway genes (TLR4, IL-10, IL-6, IFNβ, and TNFα) when expression was compared with LPS stimulated vs. unstimulated cells. In conclusion, while TLR4 is expressed on horse B lymphocytes, it appears minimally responsive to LPS in vitro, similar to results seen in human B lymphocytes. While further studies are still needed, our work reveals a potential link between B lymphocyte TLR4 expression and endotoxin sensitivity.© The Author(s) 2019.

Increased intestinal permeability may favour  generated by lipopolysaccharides, a substance present in the cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and, consequently, an increase in systemic inflammation and metabolic diseases. In contrast (On the other hand), consumption of a healthy diet can help in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome. In this way, chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.), rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, may present an anti-inflammatory role. In addition, chia is rich in antioxidants like caffeic and gallic acid and fiber. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between chia seeds, inflammatory mechanisms and intestinal permeability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of chia administration on metabolism in obese mice. Swiss mice were fed a hyperlipidic diet either supplemented with or without 3% chia flour for 16 weeks. The results showed that supplementation could not reduce the deleterious effects of the lipid-rich diet in terms of body composition, glucose intolerance and activity of antioxidants enzymes in the liver. In addition, supplementation with chia in the control diet decreased the amount of occludin in the intestinal colon. In conclusion, although chia did not improve metabolic parameters it seemed to restore the intestinal barriers integrity. The beneficial effects of chia seem to be dependent of the quantity used, since our data conflict with those in the literature; however, it is important to note that other studies, unlike our protocol, used chia in the form of seeds or oil, and not flour.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The previously used lot of endotoxin, which was used for over a decade, is no longer approved for human use and a new Good Manufacturing Practices-grade batch has become available. We compared the inflammatory response induced by either bolus or continuous administration of either the previously used lot #1188844 or new lots of endotoxin (#94332B1 and #94332B4). Compared with lot #1188844, bolus administration of lot #94332B1 induced a more pronounced systemic inflammatory response including higher plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and more pronounced clinical signs of inflammation. In contrast, continuous infusion of lot #94332B4 resulted in a slightly less pronounced inflammatory response compared with lot #1188844. Furthermore, we evaluated whether lot #1188844 displayed in vivo potency loss by reviewing inflammatory parameters obtained from 17  studies performed in our centre between 2007 and 2016. Despite inter-study variability in -induced effects on temperature, heart rate, symptoms, and leukocyte counts, the magnitude of these effects did not decrease over time.

Importantly, preclinical models have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor antagonism prevents the lung injury and subsequent abnormal development that typically results following perinatal exposure to inflammatory stresses. This receptor is activated by two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α and IL-1β. While many studies have linked IL-1β to BPD development, IL-1α is relatively under-studied. The objective of our study was to determine whether systemic inflammatory stress induces IL-1α expression in the neonatal lung, and if so, whether this expression is mediated by innate immune NFκB signaling. We found that  induced IL-1α expression during the saccular stage of neonatal lung development and was not present in the other neonatal organs or the adult lung. This IL-1α expression was dependent upon sustained pulmonary NFκB activation, which was specific to the neonatal lung. Using  and  approaches, we found that pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of NFκB signaling attenuated IL-1α expression. These findings demonstrate that innate immune regulation of IL-1α expression is developmentally regulated and occurs via an NFκB dependent mechanism. Importantly, the specific role of developmentally regulated pulmonary IL-1α expression remains unknown. Future studies must determine the effect of attenuating innate immune IL-1α expression in the developing lung before adopting broad IL-1 receptor antagonism as an approach to prevent neonatal lung injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268775>Renal progenitor cells revert LPS-induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition by secreting CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 antiseptic peptides.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Endothelial cells (ECs) acquired a fibroblast-like phenotype and contributed to myofibroblast generation through the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) process. Of note, human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) enhance the tubular regenerative mechanism during AKI but little is known about their effects on ECs. Following LPS exposure, ECs proliferated, decreased EC markers CD31 and vascular endothelial cadherin, and up-regulated myofibroblast markers, collagen I, and vimentin. The coculture with ARPCs normalized the EC proliferation rate and abrogated the LPS-induced EndMT. The gene expression analysis showed that most of the genes modulated in LPS-stimulated ARPCs belong to cell activation and defense response pathways. We showed that the ARPC-specific antifibrotic effect is exerted by the secretion of CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 produced after the anaphylatoxin stimulation. Next, we investigated the molecular signaling that underlies the ARPC protective mechanism and found that renal progenitors diverge from differentiated tubular cells and ECs in myeloid differentiation primary response 88-independent pathway activation. Finally, in a swine model of LPS-induced AKI, we observed that activated ARPCs secreted CXCL6, SAA4, and BPIFA2 as a defense response.

Interestingly, transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 7 (TRPM7) ion channel controlling Ca2+ and Mg2+ permeability is involved in cytokine production and inflammatory response.

Overall survival time was estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots. Inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was monitored at various intervals after LPS injection and individual reagent administration. Pathological alternations in lungs and liver were analyzed.Pirenzepine and atropine pretreatment improved survival rate of LPS-induced septic shock; in contrast, AF-DX116 accelerated death from sepsis. Moreover, TNF-α plasma level was decreased in response to pirenzepine or atropine, whereas increased in response to AF-DX116. Pirenzepine and atropine relieved whereas AF-DX116 accelerated LPS-induced pulmonary and hepatic injury. Pirenzepine reduced proportion of M1 subtype of macrophages, while AF-DX116 promoted polarization of macrophages to M1 subtype.

Calcium and vitamin D may be involved in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, the dysfunction of which may lead to  and inflammation, and contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. We investigated supplemental calcium (1200 mg, daily) and/or vitamin D (1000 IU daily) effects on intestinal barrier function-related biomarkers in a subset of 105 participants from a large colorectal adenoma recurrence chemoprevention clinical trial. We assessed expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLD), and mucin-12 (MUC12) in the normal-appearing colorectal mucosa using standardized, automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis. Following 1 year of treatment, in the calcium relative to the no calcium group, the CLDN1, OCLD, and MUC12 expression increased by 14% (P = 0.17), 23% (P = 0.11), and 22% (P = 0.07), respectively.

Data were analysed using linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework.20TT in the heat increased I-FABP and elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) compared to pre-exercise values but did not result in . Completion time was not statistically different between conditions (mean difference [95% credible interval] = 11 s [- 23, 44]). Relative to CON, GLUT did not alter any physiological or perceptual measures during the 20TT.Glutamine supplementation does not improve 20TT performance in the heat or preserve neuromuscular function when compared to a placebo. These findings suggest that glutamine is not an ergogenic aid or prophylactic intervention for heat-induced gut damage during short-duration self-paced exercise in hot environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330482>Anthocyanins protect the gastrointestinal tract from high fat diet-induced alterations in redox signaling, barrier integrity and dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract can play a critical role in the development of pathologies associated with overeating, overweight and obesity. We previously observed that supplementation with anthocyanins (AC) (particularly glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin) mitigated high fat diet (HFD)-induced development of obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and steatosis in C57BL/6J mice. This paper investigated whether these beneficial effects could be related to AC capacity to sustain intestinal monolayer integrity, prevent , and HFD-associated dysbiosis. The involvement of redox-related mechanisms were further investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Consumption of a HFD for 14 weeks caused intestinal permeabilization and , which were associated with a decreased ileum expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1), increased expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX1 and NOX4) and NOS2 and oxidative stress, and activation of redox sensitive signals (NF-κB and ERK1/2) that regulate TJ dynamics. AC supplementation mitigated all these events and increased GLP-2 levels, the intestinal hormone that upregulates TJ protein expression. AC also prevented, in vitro, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization, NOX1/4 upregulation, oxidative stress, and NF-κB and ERK activation. HFD-induced obesity in mice caused dysbiosis and affected the levels and secretion of MUC2, a mucin that participates in intestinal cell barrier protection and immune response. AC supplementation restored microbiota composition and MUC2 levels and distribution in HFD-fed mice. Thus, AC, particularly delphinidin and cyanidin, can preserve GI physiology in HFD-induced obesity in part through redox-regulated mechanisms. This can in part explain AC capacity to mitigate pathologies, i.e. insulin resistance and steatosis, associated with HFD-associated obesity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The enterosorbent Enterosgel (Polymethylsiloxane polyhdrate) is recommended as a symptomatic treatment for acute diarrhoea and chronic diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Since 1980's there have been many Enterosgel clinical trials, however, the detailed mechanism of Enterosgel action towards specific toxins and interaction with concomitantly administered medications has not been fully investigated. Our in vitro study assessed the adsorption capacity of Enterosgel for bacterial enterotoxins and endotoxin, bile acids and interaction with the pharmaceutical drugs; Cetirizine and Amitriptyline hydrochloride. Our data demonstrate the good adsorption capacity of Enterosgel for bacterial toxins associated with gastrointestinal infection, with a lower than the comparator charcoal Charcodote capacity for bile acids whose levels can be raised in IBS patients. Adsorption capacity for the two drugs varied but was significantly lower than Charcodote. These findings suggest that the mechanism of Enterosgel action in the treatment of gastrointestinal infection or IBS is adsorption of target molecules followed by removal from the body. This therapy offers a drug free approach to prevention and treatment of infectious and chronic non-infectious diseases, where intestinal flora and  play a role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444399>TRPM7 mediates kidney injury, endothelial hyperpermeability and mortality during .</a></h2><p>Sepsis is the main cause of mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units. During sepsis, endothelial permeability is severely augmented, contributing to renal dysfunction and patient mortality. Ca influx and the subsequent increase in intracellular [Ca] in endothelial cells (ECs) are key steps in the establishment of endothelial hyperpermeability. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) ion channels are permeable to Ca and are expressed in a broad range of cell types and tissues, including ECs and kidneys. However, the role of TRPM7 on endothelial hyperpermeability during sepsis has remained elusive. Therefore, we investigated the participation of TRPM7 in renal vascular hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality induced by . Our results showed that endotoxin increases endothelial hyperpermeability and Ca overload through the TLR4/NOX-2/ROS/NF-κB pathway. Moreover, endotoxin exposure was shown to downregulate the expression of VE-cadherin, compromising monolayer integrity and enhancing vascular hyperpermeability. Notably, endotoxin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was substantially inhibited by pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression. The endotoxin was shown to upregulate the expression of TRPM7 via the TLR4/NOX-2/ROS/NF-κB pathway and induce a TRPM7-dependent EC Ca overload. Remarkably, in vivo experiments performed in endotoxemic animals showed that pharmacological inhibition and specific suppression of TRPM7 expression inhibits renal vascular hyperpermeability, prevents kidney dysfunction, and improves survival in endotoxemic animals. Therefore, our results showed that TRPM7 mediates -induced endothelial hyperpermeability, renal dysfunction, and enhanced mortality, revealing a novel molecular target for treating renal vascular hyperpermeability and kidney dysfunction during , sepsis, and other inflammatory diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885503>Circulating plasma microRNAs dysregulation and metabolic  induced by a high-fat high-saturated diet.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet increase two to three times the plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and induce subclinical inflammation. Diet can modify gene expression due to epigenetic processes related to MicroRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important role in the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulation of expression of genes related to the inflammatory response. Also, diet can indirectly induce post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, which may affect the risk for the development of chronic diseases.This study investigated the effect of high-fat high-saturated meal ingestion on plasma miRNA expression and LPS levels during the postprandial period in healthy women.An interventional study was carried out in which a high-fat breakfast (1067.45 kcal), composed mainly of saturated fatty acids (56 g), and 500 mL of water, was offered. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 1, 3 and 5 h after meal intake. The studied population consisted of healthy women (n = 11), aged between 20 and 40 years, and body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25 kg/m. Plasma levels of lipid profile, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and LPS were measured at the 3 time points. A profile of 752 human plasma miRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR assay. These analyzes were performed for all blood collection time-points.Expression profile analysis revealed 33 differentially expressed plasma circulating miRNAs compared to that of the control group. MiR-145-5p and miR-200 were differentially modulated in all time-points post meal consumption. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma LPS, triglycerides, myristic and palmitic saturated fatty acids levels at the 3 time-points in comparison with the control basal levels. We also observed increased levels of the plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) cytokine and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) levels after 5 h post meal ingestion.Ingestion of high-fat high-saturated meal was able to induce metabolic  and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF-alpha and VCAM-1, as well as modulating circulating miRNAs possibly controlling inflammatory and lipid metabolism proteins at the postprandial period.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Citrulline (Cit), which has been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in other situations, may be of interest in this setting. Our aim was to assess the effect of Cit in three catabolic models relevant to critical illness:  (LPS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and TBI with infectious complications (TBI-Ec), which are characterized by different alterations in protein homeostasis. Fifty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g) were randomized to receive a standard diet ad libitum (CON, n = 9) or to undergo catabolic injuries on day 0 (D0, n = 49), and EN (Sondalis HP energy® 290 kcal/kg/d) from day 1 (D1) combined with Cit (2 g/kg/d) or isonitrogenous non-essential AAs (NEAAs) until day 3 (D3).  was induced by IP injection of LPS from E. coli (3 mg/kg), TBI by hydraulic percussion, and infectious complications (TBI-Ec) by administration of luminescent E. coli on D1. Nitrogen balance (ΔN) and 3-methylhistidine (3-MHis) were measured daily. Muscle protein synthesis (MPS, measured by the SUnSET method) and mTORC1 activation (S6K-1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation) were measured on D3 2 h after the arrest of enteral nutrition in soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles. ΔN was lower (p < 0.001) in all three models of injury compared with basal and CON from D1 to D3, and more negative in the LPS-CIT (p < 0.05) than in the LPS group. The 3-MHis/creatinine ratio was significantly increased on D1 in all groups compared with CON, and on D2 only in the LPS and TBI groups (p < 0.0001, LPS and TBI vs. CON). MPS was similar in all groups in soleus and tibialis but significantly higher in EDL in LPS-CIT [LPS-CIT: 4.5 ± 1.7 (mean ± SD) vs. CON: 2.3 ± 1.2; and vs. LPS-NEAA: 3.1 ± 2.3] and in gastrocnemius (LPS-CIT vs. CON; p = 0.05). S6K-1 phosphorylation in the EDL was also higher in LPS-CIT vs. CON (LPS-CIT: 0.94 ± 0.51 CON: 0.42 ± 0.28), but not in gastrocnemius. IL-6 plasma level was significantly higher in all the catabolic groups vs. CON (p < 0.005) with no difference between treatments (Cit or NEAAs). In conclusion, the TBI model showed only a rise in muscle proteolysis, whereas the LPS model displayed a rise in both protein synthesis and proteolysis. Secondly, our results show that the Cit effect varies according to the type of injury and to the muscle under study. The stimulation of MPS rate and the mTOR pathway in LPS-treated rats contrasts with degraded ΔN, suggesting that the Cit effect on protein metabolism in critically ill rats is limited at the whole-body level.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

In equine medicine, although no consensus definition is available, sepsis is commonly described as a dysregulated host systemic inflammatory response to infection. Defense against host infection is the primary role of innate immune cells known as neutrophils. Neutrophils also contribute to host injury during sepsis, making them important potential targets for sepsis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This review will present both historical and updated perspectives on the systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) and sepsis; it will also discuss the impact of sepsis on neutrophils, and the impact of neutrophils during sepsis. Future identification of clinically relevant sepsis diagnosis and therapy depends on a more thorough understanding of disease pathogenesis across species. To gain this understanding, there is a critical need for research that utilizes a clearly defined, and consistently applied, classification system for patients diagnosed with, and at risk of developing, sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660669>PCSK9 decreases during Experimental .</a></h2><p>We read Rannikko et al.'s article about proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels in patients with bacteremia [1] with great interest.

Pericytes are the major source of myofibroblasts during chronic kidney disease (CKD), but their involvement in AKI is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the occurrence of pericyte-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation (PMT) in sepsis-induced AKI. In a swine model of sepsis-induced AKI, PMT was detected within 9 h from LPS injection, as evaluated by the reduction of physiologic PDGFRβ expression and the dysfunctional α-SMA increase in peritubular pericytes. The therapeutic intervention by citrate-based coupled plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA) significantly reduced LBP, TGF-β, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) serum levels, and furthermore preserved PDGFRβ and decreased α-SMA expression in renal biopsies. In vitro, both LPS and septic sera led to PMT with a significant increase in Collagen I synthesis and α-SMA reorganization in contractile fibers by both SMAD2/3-dependent and -independent TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, the removal of LBP from septic plasma inhibited PMT. Finally, LPS-stimulated pericytes secreted LBP and TGF-β and underwent PMT also upon TGF-β receptor-blocking, indicating the crucial pro-fibrotic role of TLR4 signaling. Our data demonstrate that the selective removal of LBP may represent a therapeutic option to prevent PMT and the development of acute renal fibrosis in sepsis-induced AKI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451009>Improvement of Lipoprotein Profile and Metabolic  by a Lifestyle Intervention That Modifies the Gut Microbiota in Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious health problem over the world; thus, the aim of the present work was to develop a lifestyle intervention to decrease the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and reduce the biochemical abnormalities of MetS. Methods and Results The prevalence of MetS was evaluated in 1065 subjects of Mexico City, Mexico, and the gut microbiota in a subsample. Subjects with MetS were selected for a pragmatic study based on a lifestyle intervention with a low-saturated-fat diet, reduced-energy intake, with functional foods and physical activity, and a second group was selected for a randomized control-placebo study to assess the gut microbiota after the dietary intervention. Prevalence of MetS was 53%, and the higher the body mass index, the higher the gut microbiota dysbiosis. The higher the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The pragmatic study revealed that after 15 days on a low-saturated-fat diet, there was a 24% reduction in serum triglycerides; and after a 75-day lifestyle intervention, MetS was reduced by 44.8%, with a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small low-density lipoprotein particles, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide, and branched-chain amino acid. The randomized control-placebo study showed that after the lifestyle intervention, there was a decrease in the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota associated with a reduction in the Prevotella/ Bacteroides ratio and an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Conclusions A lifestyle intervention significantly decreased MetS components, small low-density lipoprotein particle concentration, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and metabolic , reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.

This study investigated serum choline and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) responses, and their correlations with inflammatory, oxidative stress and tissue damage biomarkers, including paraoxanase-1 (PON1), and clinical signs in calves with  and the effect of choline treatment in these responses. Healthy calves (n = 20) were divided equally into 4 groups: Control (0.9% NaCl, iv), Choline (C; 1 mg/kg/iv,once), Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 μg/kg/iv,once) and LPS + C. Clinical and laboratory examinations were performed before and 0.5-48 h (hrs) after treatments. Following LPS administration, serum choline level increased at 0.5-24 h (P < .01), whereas serum BChE and PON1 level decreased at 48 h (P < .01) compared to their baselines. In LPS + C group, the increase in serum choline level was significantly higher (P < .01) than that of C and LPS groups. LPS did not decrease serum BChE levels significantly in calves treated with choline. Serum choline and BChE results correlated negatively with white blood cell count and positively (P < .001) with PON1 levels, oxidative stress index, inflammation and hepato-muscular injury markers. In conclusion serum choline and BChE may have a role in the pathophysiology of  in calves. High serum choline concentration is associated with an improvement in response to LPS administration in calves treated with choline, probably by preventing the imbalances between oxidative stress and anti-oxidant capacity, preventing the serum BChE and PON1 decreases, and inhibition/attenuation of acute phase reaction and hepato-muscular injury in calves with .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Animals were fed a 17-week cafeteria diet (CAF diet), supplemented with daily GSPE doses (100 or 500 mg kg body weight) during the final two weeks. CAF diet enhanced the intestinal permeation of an orally administered marker (ovalbumin, OVA) and increased the plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 2-3-fold.

Endotoxin and oxidative stress activate endothelial cells via a convergent signaling pathway (TLR4/MyD88/PI3 K/PLCɣ/NF-B) that stimulates both the transcription of SELP gene (which encodes for human P-selectin) and the release of P-selectin from Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). However, time course pattern of P-selectin surface aggregation has not been established in endothelial cells under 24 h of endotoxic or oxidative stress. Our study shows that P-selectin has at least two waves of aggregation at the cell surface: one 10 min and the other 12 h after endotoxic or oxidative stress. The first wave depends exclusively on WPB delivery to the cell membrane, while the second depends on P-selectin translation machinery, ER-Golgi sorting, and WPB surface delivery.

While NC was shown to be capable of inhibiting topoisomerase I (TOP1), NC analogs that could not inhibit TOP1 failed to increase IL-10 production. Moreover, medicinal TOP1 inhibitors TPT and SN-38 also augmented IL-10 production significantly, whereas knockdown of TOP1 prevented NC, TPT, and SN-38 from enhancing IL-10 expression. Thus, NC promoted IL-10 production by inhibiting TOP1. In LPS-induced endotoxemic mice, NC and TOP1 inhibitors increased IL-10 production, suppressed inflammatory responses, and reduced mortality remarkably. The anti-inflammatory activities of TOP1 inhibition were markedly reduced by IL-10-neutralizing antibody and largely absent in IL-10-deficient mice. In LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and in peritoneal macrophages from endotoxemic mice, NC and TOP1 inhibitors significantly enhanced the activation of Akt, a critical signal transducer for IL-10 production, and inhibition of Akt prevented these compounds from enhancing IL-10 production and ameliorating . These data indicated that NC and TOP1 inhibitors are able to exert anti-inflammatory action through enhancing Akt-mediated IL-10 production and may assist with the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

These changes to haemostasis are exacerbated following resuscitation with 0.9% saline, a commonly used crystalloid in clinical settings.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

VIS was calculated as dopamine + dobutamine + 10 × milrinone + 100 × epinephrine + 100 × norepinephrine (all μg/kg/min) + 10000 × vasopressin (U/kg/min) after initial stabilization in the operating room and upon arrival at the intensive care unit. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were a composite of in-hospital mortality, delayed right ventricular assist device (RVAD) implantation, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The pre-operative biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress,  and gut-derived metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured in a subset of 61 patients.Median VIS was 20.0 (interquartile range 13.3-27.9). VIS was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.09, p < 0.001) and composite outcome (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = 0.008). In-hospital mortality increased for each VIS quartile (0% vs 3.9% vs 7.6% vs 12.3%, p = 0.002). VIS was superior to other established LVAD risk models as a predictor of in-hospital mortality (area under the curve 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.82). The optimal cut-off point for VIS as a predictor of in-hospital mortality was 20. Pre-operative hemoglobin level was the only independent predictor of VIS ≥ 20 (p = 0.003). Patients with a high VIS were more likely to have elevated TMAO pre-operatively (53.6% vs 25.8%, p = 0.03).A high post-operative VIS is associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes and is a better predictor of in-hospital mortality compared with existing LVAD risk models. Whether early hemodynamic stabilization using RVAD may benefit patients with a high VIS remains to be investigated.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Mice studies show gut barrier disruption and diet-induced insulin resistance can be alleviated by cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22). However, little is known about IL-22 in humans and its association with gut-beneficial nutrients like fibre. We investigated whether fibre intake was associated with circulating levels of IL-22 in 48 participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Bivariate analysis was used to explore associations between circulating IL-22, fibre intake, MetS factors, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake, V ˙ O). Hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) was used to test the independent association of fibre intake with circulating IL-22, adjusting for variables correlated with IL-22. Circulating IL-22 was positively associated with fibre intake (r = 0.393,  < 0.006). The HMR-adjusted model explained 40% of circulating IL-22 variability, and fibre intake significantly improved the prediction model by 8.4% ( < 0.022). Participants with fibre intake above median intake of 21.5 g/day had a significantly higher circulating IL-22 than the lower intake group (308.3 ± 454.4 vs. 69.0 ± 106.4 pg/mL,  < 0.019). Fibre intake is independently associated with increased circulating IL-22 in individuals with MetS. Findings warrant further investigations to evaluate whether changes in dietary fibre intake alter circulating IL-22, and its effects on health outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189495>Resveratrol attenuates high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by maintaining gut barrier integrity and inhibiting gut inflammation through regulation of the endocannabinoid system.</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate the ameliorative effects of resveratrol (RSV) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) rat model, focusing on the gut endocannabinoid system (ECS), regulated by RSV, in the maintenance of gut barrier integrity and inhibition of gut inflammation.Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed HFD with or without RSV for 6 weeks. The HFD caused increase in body weight, liver index, hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammation, which was inhibited by RSV. RSV also attenuated gut microbial dysbiosis, with an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and a decrease in Desulfovibrio. Moreover, RSV led to a reduction of metabolic  and colon inflammation in HFD-fed rats. This was indicated by a decrease in bacterial invasion and translocation along with up-regulation of the mRNA levels of occludin, ZO1, claudin1, and down-regulation of FAK, MyD88, and IRAK4 in the distal colon. Furthermore, RSV inhibited HFD-induced elevation in the expression of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) mRNA and suppressed CB2 mRNA levels in the colon. The RSV-induced benefits regarding enhanced gut barrier integrity and reduced intestinal permeability were abrogated with a CB1 agonist, ACEA, whereas the inhibitory effect of RSV on the intestinal inflammation was abolished by a CB2 antagonist, AM630. Moreover, microbiota depletion using a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block RSV-induced reduction in intestinal permeability and gut inflammation, as well as the altered mRNA expressions of CB1 and CB2 in the distal colon.These data indicate that the ECS, particularly the expressions of CB1 and CB2, appears to play a crucial role in the RSV induced anti-NASH effect by maintaining the gut barrier integrity and inhibiting gut inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The cycling task comprised of alternating 3 min intervals at a moderate-vigorous intensity (50% and 70% of maximum power output; P) for 30 min, followed by 30 min at moderate intensity (40-50% P). Neuromuscular function was assessed at pre-, post-exercise and 60 min post-exercise. Circulating levels of endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines and markers of gut permeability and damage were also collected at these time points. Heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, perceived exertion, thermal sensation and comfort were also measured.Post-exercise voluntary activation of HOT (87.9% [85.2, 90.8]) was statistically lower (mean difference - 2.5% [- 4.5, - 0.5], d = 2.50) than that of CON (90.5% [87.8, 93.2]). The HOT trial resulted in statistically elevated (+ 69%) markers of gastrointestinal damage compared to CON (mean difference 0.424 ng mL [0.163, 0.684, d = - 3.26]), although this was not observed for endotoxin, other inflammatory markers, or gastrointestinal permeability.This research provides evidence that short-duration cycling in the heat results in sub-optimal neuromuscular activation and increased expression of gastrointestinal damage markers, without a simultaneous elevation in circulating endotoxins or pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077206>Apolipoprotein A5 alleviates LPS/D-GalN-induced fulminant liver failure in mice by inhibiting TLR4-mediated NF-κB pathway.</a></h2><p>Fulminant liver failure (FHF) is a serious clinical problem and liver transplantation is the major intervention. But the overall survival rate of FHF is low owing to the donated organ shortage. Apolipoprotein A-V (ApoA5) is a regulator of triglyceride metabolism and has been reported to act as a predictor for remnant liver growth after preoperative portal vein embolization and liver surgery. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of ApoA5 on lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN)-induced fulminant liver failure in mice.FHF mouse model was established using LPS/D-GalN and ApoA5 plasmid was injected by tail vein prior to LPS/D-GalN treatment. The expressions of ApoA5, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κBp65) were assessed by real-time PCR and western blotting. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were measured using automatic biochemical analyzer. Histological assessment and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were conducted. Survival rate after LPS/D-GalN administration was also determined with Kaplan-Meier curve. Meanwhile, the expression of ApoA5 in injured huh7 cells was tested. Cell apoptosis analysis was performed after huh7 cells were transfected with ApoA5 plasmid and stimulated with LPS.The expressions of ApoA5 decreased both in injured huh7 cells and FHF mice. ApoA5 overexpression reduced cell death rate using flow cytometry. ApoA5 not only decreased the serum ALT and TNF-α levels but also attenuated hepatic damage in hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained liver section. The protein expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-κBp65 were inhibited when ApoA5 overexpressed. But the inhibitory effect would weaken with the increasing concentration of LPS in spite of ApoA5 overexpression. Besides, ApoA5 improved liver injury in a dose-dependent manner and the survival rate in FHF mice increased with increasing concentration of ApoA5.ApoA5 had a protective effect against LPS/D-GalN-induced fulminant liver failure in mice within a certain range by inhibiting TLR4-mediated NF-κB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367250>Absence of Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 Protects Against Atherosclerosis in Apolipoprotein E-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Deciphering the molecular and cellular processes involved in foam cell formation is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was first identified as a transcriptional regulator of type-I interferons (IFNs) and IFN inducible genes. Our study aims to explore the role of IRF1 in atherosclerotic foam cell formation and understand the functional diversity of IRF1 in various cell types contributing to atherosclerosis. : We induced experimental atherosclerosis in ApoEIRF1 mice and evaluated the effect of IRF1 on disease progression and foam cell formation. : IRF1 expression was increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. IRF1 deficiency inhibited modified lipoprotein uptake and promoted cholesterol efflux, along with altered expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism. Gene expression analysis identified scavenger receptor (SR)-AI as a regulated target of IRF1, and SR-AI silencing completely abrogated the increased uptake of modified lipoprotein induced by IRF1. Our data also explain a mechanism underlying -complicated atherogenesis as follows: two likely pro-inflammatory agents, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exert cooperative effects on foam cell formation, which is partly attributable to a shift of IRF1-Ubc9 complex to IRF1- myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (Myd88) complex and subsequent IRF1 nuclear translocation. Additionally, it seems that improved function of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) also accounts for the diminished and more stable atherosclerotic plaques observed in ApoEIRF1 mice. : Our findings demonstrate an unanticipated role of IRF1 in the regulation of gene expression implicated in foam cell formation and identify IRF1 activation as a new risk factor in the development, progression and instability of atherosclerotic lesions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946956>Mitochondrial ALDH2 protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction by suppression of ER stress and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an essential component of outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria, plays a pivotal role in myocardial anomalies in sepsis. Recent evidence depicted an essential role for mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in cardiac homeostasis. This study examined the effect of ALDH2 on -induced cardiac anomalies. Echocardiographic, cardiac contractile and intracellular Ca properties were examined. Our results indicated that LPS impaired cardiac contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, LV end systolic diameter, peak shortening, maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening, prolonged relengthening duration, oxidation of SERCA, and intracellular Ca mishandling), associated with ER stress, inflammation, O production, increased autophagy, CAMKKβ, phosphorylated AMPK and suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR, the effects of which were significantly attenuated or negated by ALDH2. LPS promoted early endosomal formation (as evidenced by RAB4 and RAB5a), apoptosis and necrosis (MTT and LDH) while decreasing late endosomal formation (RAB7 and RAB 9), the effects were reversed by ALDH2. In vitro study revealed that LPS-induced SERCA oxidation, autophagy and cardiac dysfunction were abrogated by ALDH2 activator Alda-1, the ER chaperone TUDCA, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, or the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. The beneficial effect of Alda-1 against LPS was nullified by AMPK activator AICAR or rapamycin. CAMKKβ inhibition failed to rescue LPS-induced ER stress. Tunicamycin-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was ameliorated by Alda-1 and autophagy inhibition, the effect of which was abolished by rapamycin. These data suggested that ALDH2 protected against LPS-induced cardiac anomalies via suppression of ER stress, autophagy in a CAMKKβ/AMPK/mTOR-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is often difficult to discriminate between cause and consequence of phenotypic effects, such as the indirect influence of heat stress via reduced food intake. Lactating dairy cows are a particularly sensitive model to examine the effects of heat stress due to their intensive metabolic heat production and small surface:volume ratio. Results from this model show heat stress directly induced a so-far unknown infiltration of yet uncategorized cells into the mucosa and submucosa of the jejunum. Due to a pair-feeding design, we can exclude this effect being a consequence of the concurrent heat-induced reduction in feed intake. Isolation and characterization of the infiltrating cells using laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing indicated a myeloic origin and macrophage-like phenotype. Furthermore, targeted transcriptome analyses provided evidence of activated immune- and phagocytosis-related pathways with LPS and cytokines as upstream regulators directly associated with heat stress. Finally, we obtained indication that heat stress may directly alter jejunal tight junction proteins suggesting an impaired intestinal barrier. The penetration of toxic and bacterial compounds during heat stress may have triggered a modulated immune repertoire and induced an antioxidative defense mechanism to maintain homeostasis between commensal bacteria and the jejunal immune system. Our bovine model indicates direct effects of heat stress on the jejunum of mammals already at moderately elevated ambient temperature. These results need to be considered when developing concepts to combat the negative consequences of heat stress.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

We hypothesised that RIPC may be beneficial by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response. We investigated whether RIPC affects the response in humans to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) by measuring plasma cytokines and renal cell-cycle arrest mediators, which reflect renal tubular stress.Healthy male volunteers were randomised to receive either daily RIPC for 6 consecutive days (RIPC, n=10) plus RIPC during the 40 min preceding i.v.

Data are presented as median (inter-quartile range).In both RIPC groups, RIPC alone increased [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]. LPS administration resulted in fever, flu-like symptoms, and haemodynamic alterations.

This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise-induced hypohydration on gastrointestinal integrity, function, symptoms, and systemic endotoxin and inflammatory profiles. In a randomized crossover design, male endurance runners ( = 11) performed 2 h of running at 70% of maximum oxygen uptake in 25°C ambient temperature with water provision [euhydration (EuH)] and total water restriction [hypohydration (HypoH)] during running, which accounted for 0.6 ± 0.6% and 3.1 ± 0.7% body mass loss, respectively. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after exercise. Breath samples (H determination) were collected and gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) recorded before, during, and after exercise. HypoH resulted in a higher, yet insignificant, ∆ preexercise to postexercise plasma cortisol concentration (+286 nmol/l vs. +176 nmol/l;  = 0.098) but significantly higher intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (+539 pg/ml vs. +371 pg/ml;  = 0.047) concentration compared with EuH. A greater breath H response ( = 0.026) was observed on HypoH (1,188 ppm/3 h, peak +12 ppm) vs. EuH (579 ppm/3 h, peak +6 ppm). Despite greater GIS incidence on HypoH (82%) vs. EuH (64%), GIS severity scores were not significant between trials. Exercise-induced leukocytosis (overall pre- to postexercise: 5.9 × 10/l to 12.1 × 10/l) was similar on both trials. Depressed in vitro neutrophil function was observed during recovery on HypoH (-36%) but not on EUH (+6%). A pre- to postexercise increase ( < 0.05) was observed for circulating cytokine concentrations but not endotoxin values. Hypohydration during 2 h of running modestly perturbs gastrointestinal integrity and function and increases GIS incidence but does not affect systemic  and cytokinemia.  Despite anecdotal beliefs that exercise-induced hypohydration exacerbates perturbations to gastrointestinal status, the present study reports only modest perturbations in gastrointestinal integrity, function, and symptoms compared with euhydration maintenance. Exercise-induced hypohydration does not exacerbate systemic  and cytokinemia compared with euhydration maintenance. Programmed water intake to maintain euhydration results in gastrointestinal symptom severity similar to exercise-induced hypohydration. Maintaining euhydration during exertional stress prevents the exercise-associated depression in bacterially stimulated neutrophil function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897706>Kinetics of Physiological and Behavioural Responses in Endotoxemic Pigs with or without Dexamethasone Treatment.</a></h2><p>Although dexamethasone (DEX) is a widely used immunoregulatory agent, knowledge about its pharmacological properties in farm animals, especially pigs, is insufficient. Previous studies suggest that compared to other species, pigs are less sensitive to the immunosuppression conferred by DEX and more sensitive to the threat of bacterial endotoxins. However, there is a paucity of studies examining DEX immunomodulation in  in this species. In this study, a porcine  model was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the effect of DEX-pretreatment on the magnitude and kinetics of neuroendocrine, metabolic, hematologic, inflammatory, and behavioural responses were examined. DEX decreased cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lymphocyte whereas glucose concentration was increased under both normal and endotoxemic conditions. By contrast, DEX decreased triglyceride, lactate, and IL-6 concentrations and increased platelet count only under an endotoxemic condition. DEX also reduced the frequency of sickness behaviour following LPS challenge. PCA showed that glucose and triglyceride metabolism together with red blood cell count mainly contributed to the separation of clusters during DEX treatment. Our study demonstrates that DEX protects pigs from inflammation and morbidity in , in spite of their less sensitivity to DEX. Moreover, its considerable role in the regulation of the metabolic and hematologic responses in endotoxemic pigs is revealed for the first time.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121134>Endothelial Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α Is Required for Vascular Repair and Resolution of Inflammatory Lung Injury through Forkhead Box Protein M1.</a></h2><p>Endothelial barrier dysfunction is a central factor in the pathogenesis of persistent lung inflammation and protein-rich edema formation, the hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for vascular repair and resolution of inflammatory injury after sepsis challenge. Herein, we show that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), is the critical transcriptional factor mediating vascular repair and resolution of inflammatory lung injury. After sepsis challenge, HIF-1α but not HIF-2α expression was rapidly induced in lung vascular ECs, and mice with EC-restricted disruption of Hif1α (Hif1a/Tie2Cre) exhibited defective vascular repair, persistent inflammation, and increased mortality in contrast with the wild-type littermates after polymicrobial sepsis or  challenge. Hif1a/Tie2Cre lungs exhibited marked decrease of EC proliferation during recovery after sepsis challenge, which was associated with inhibited expression of forkhead box protein M1 (Foxm1), a reparative transcription factor. Therapeutic restoration of endothelial Foxm1 expression, via liposomal delivery of Foxm1 plasmid DNA to Hif1a/Tie2Cre mice, resulted in reactivation of the vascular repair program and improved survival. Together, our studies, for the first time, delineate the essential role of endothelial HIF-1α in driving the vascular repair program. Thus, therapeutic activation of HIF-1α-dependent vascular repair may represent a novel and effective therapy to treat inflammatory vascular diseases, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Understanding these immune evasion pathways would be an important step for the development of novel anti-microbial therapeutics. Here, we report a hitherto unknown mechanism by which Salmonella exploits an anti-inflammatory pathway in human immune cells to obtain survival advantage. We show that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 4/74 significantly (P < 0·05) increased expression of mRNA and surface protein of the type 1 receptor (VPAC1) for anti-inflammatory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in human monocytes. However, we also show that S. Typhimurium induced retrograde recycling of VPAC1 from early endosomes to Rab11a-containing sorting endosomes, associated with the Golgi apparatus, and anterograde trafficking via Rab3a and calmodulin 1. Expression of Rab3a and calmodulin 1 were significantly increased by S. Typhimurium infection and W-7 (calmodulin antagonist) decreased VPAC1 expression on the cell membrane while CALP-1 (calmodulin agonist) increased VPAC1 expression (P < 0·05). When infected monocytes were co-cultured with VIP, a significantly higher number of S. Typhimurium were recovered from these monocytes, compared with S. Typhimurium recovered from monocytes cultured only in cell media. We conclude that S. Typhimurium infection exploits host VPAC1/VIP to gain survival advantage in human monocytes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772848>PROFIT, a PROspective, randomised placebo controlled feasibility trial of Faecal mIcrobiota Transplantation in cirrhosis: study protocol for a single-blinded trial.</a></h2><p>Patients with advanced cirrhosis have enteric bacterial dysbiosis and translocation of bacteria and their products across the gut epithelial barrier.

Nocebo effects, induced by negative treatment expectancies, can contribute to negative patient-reported outcomes but have rarely been studied in the context of inflammatory or immune-related conditions. Based on perceived treatment allocation, we herein analyzed nocebo responders in the placebo arms of randomized controlled double-blind experimental  studies. We hypothesized that nocebo responders would report more bodily sickness symptoms and greater mood impairment. Out of  = 106 participants who had all received placebo injection,  = 20 (18.9%) wrongly believed they had received endotoxin and were thus considered as nocebo responders. Nocebo responders reported significantly more bodily sickness symptoms, suggesting that the perception of bodily symptoms affected perceived treatment allocation. Against our expectations, we did not find differences between nocebo responders and controls in psychological or physiological parameters. However, exploratory correlational analysis within nocebo responders revealed that more pronounced bodily sickness symptoms in response to placebo were associated with greater state anxiety and negative mood, as well as with the psychological traits catastrophizing and neuroticism. Our findings support that negative affectivity and personality-related factors may contribute to the reporting of sickness symptoms. Nonspecific symptoms experienced by patients undergoing pharmacological treatments or in randomized controlled trials can be misinterpreted and/or misattributed as unwanted side effects affecting perceived treatment allocation and presumably treatment satisfaction or its perceived efficacy.

Data were compared using Pearson correlation testing and analysis of variance, with P < 0.05 considered significant.TNF-α, claudin-3, and endotoxin levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the plasma of all patients with liver disease compared with that of controls, particularly in patients with decompensated LC, SBP, ACLF, or HCC (P < 0.01). IFN-γ was significantly higher in HCC than in other liver diseases (P < 0.01). Plasma D-lactate was significantly decreased in all liver diseases, except SBP (P < 0.01). TNF-α, endotoxin, and claudin-3 levels were positively correlated (P < 0.01), but correlations of IFN-γ with endotoxin or claudin-3 were not significant. The plasma D-lactate level did not significantly correlate with either TNF-α, endotoxin, or claudin-3 levels.Plasma claudin-3, but not D-lactate, was found to be a marker of IP in patients with liver diseases. Elevated plasma TNF-α in such patients was likely to have injured the intestinal barrier, leading to IETM, especially in end-stage LC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among the various causes, infection is the leading etiology of mortality associated with cirrhosis. Bacterial infection frequently precipitates renal failure in patients with cirrhosis with the reported prevalence around 34%. Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of infections due to impaired immunity and increased gut permeability leading to bacterial translocation in the setting of portal hypertension. One of the most feared complications of severely decompensated liver and renal failure is hepatorenal syndrome, of which liver transplant may be the only available treatment. Furthermore, in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and urinary tract infection, progressive renal failure occurs despite resolution of infection. Thus, the effects of  on renal function in cirrhosis have become a major focus of research. The mechanisms of the damaging effects of endotoxin on renal function are complex but, in essence, involve dysregulated inflammation, circulatory dysfunction, poor clearance of endotoxin burden, as well as vasomotor nephropathy. In this article, we will review the mechanisms of -induced renal dysfunction in the setting of cirrhosis through the effects on renal blood flow, renal vascular endothelium, glomerular filtration rate, and tubular function.© American Federation for Medical Research 2019.

The majority of patients receiving these MSC therapies are on concurrent medication or have ongoing infection. In the present study, we examined the effect of immunosuppressive drugs and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/endotoxins on the secretory profile, migration towards site of injury, and suppression of lymphocyte proliferation of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). Generally, LPS coculture augmented the secretory capacity of BMSCs while exposure to immunosuppressive drugs resulted primarily in no change or attenuated secretion, with some cases of increased secretion, dependent on the cytokine assayed. Among the immunosuppressants evaluated, Hydrocortisone had the most widespread inhibitory effect, while LPS from  O111:B4 had the most potent stimulatory effect. In addition, we also showed that Hydrocortisone or LPS from  O111:B4 affected the migratory and immunosuppressive capacity of BMSCs. Following simulation with Hydrocortisone, BMSC migration was attenuated, and immunosuppressive capacity against T cell proliferation was enhanced, however, the opposite effects were seen with LPS from  O111:B4. Our data suggests that the clinical outcomes of MSC-based therapy are affected by the use of immunosuppressive medication or the presence of  in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31182997>HIF1-Induced Glycolysis in Macrophage Is Essential for the Protective Effect of Ouabain during .</a></h2><p>Ouabain, a steroid binding to the Na/K-ATPase, has several pharmacological effects. In addition to the recognized effects of blood pressure, there is more convincing evidence suggesting that ouabain is involved in immunologic functions and inflammation. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a metabolic regulator which plays a considerable role in immune responses. Previous studies had shown that HIF-1-induced glycolysis results in functional reshaping in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the role of glycolytic pathway activation in the anti-inflammatory effect of ouabain. We found that ouabain is involved in anti-inflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, ouabain can inhibit LPS-induced upregulation of GLUT1 and HK2 at the transcriptional level. GM-CSF pretreatment almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of ouabain on LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines. Alterations in glycolytic pathway activation were required for the anti-inflammatory effect of ouabain. Ouabain can significantly inhibit the upregulation of HIF-1 at the protein level. Our results also revealed that the overexpression of HIF-1 can reverse the anti-inflammatory effect of ouabain. Thus, we conclude that the HIF-1-dependent glycolytic pathway is essential for the anti-inflammatory effect of ouabain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792349>Role for nuclear interleukin-37 in the suppression of innate immunity.</a></h2><p>The IL-1 family member IL-37 broadly suppresses innate inflammation and acquired immunity. Similar to IL-1α and IL-33, IL-37 is a dual-function cytokine in that IL-37 translocates to the nucleus but also transmits a signal via surface membrane receptors. The role of nuclear IL-37 remains unknown on the ability of this cytokine to inhibit innate inflammation. Here, we compared suppression of innate inflammation in transgenic mice expressing native human IL-37 (IL-37Tg) with those of transgenic mice carrying the mutation of aspartic acid (D) to alanine (A) at amino acid 20 (IL-37D20ATg). The mutation D20A prevents cleavage of caspase-1, a step required for IL-37 nuclear translocation. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages from IL-37Tg mice reduced LPS-induced IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ by 40-50% whereas in macrophages from IL-37D20ATg mice this suppression was not observed, consistent with loss of nuclear function. Compared with macrophages from IL-37Tg mice, significantly less or no suppression of LPS-induced MAP kinase and NFκB activation was also observed in macrophages from IL-37D20ATg mice. In vivo, levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in the lungs and liver were markedly reduced during  in IL-37Tg mice but not observed in IL-37D20ATg mice. However, suppression of innate inflammation remains intact in the IL-37D20A mice once the cytokine is released from the cell and binds to its receptor. These studies reveal a nuclear function for suppression of innate inflammation and are consistent with the dual function of IL-37 and a role for caspase-1 in limiting inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239174>Acute phase protein, α - 1- acid glycoprotein (AGP-1), has differential effects on TLR-2 and TLR-4 mediated responses.</a></h2><p>Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP-1) is a major positive acute phase glycoprotein with unknown functions that likely play a role in inflammation. We tested its involvement in a variety of inflammatory responses using human AGP-1 purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. AGP-1 alone upregulated MAPK signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages. However, when given in combination with TLR ligands, AGP-1 selectively augmented MAPK activation induced by ligands of TLR-2 (Braun lipoprotein) but not TLR-4 (lipopolysaccharide). In vivo treatment of AGP-1 in a murine model of sepsis with or without TLR-2 or TLR-4 ligands, selectively potentiated TLR-2-mediated mortality, but was without significant effect on TLR-4-mediated mortality. Furthermore, in vitro, AGP-1 selectively potentiated TLR-2 mediated adhesion of human primary immune cell, neutrophils. Hence, our studies highlight a new role for the acute phase protein AGP-1 in sepsis via its interaction with TLR-2 signaling mechanisms to selectively promote responsiveness to one of the two major gram-negative endotoxins, contributing to the complicated pathobiology of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Group E was intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to create an animal model of intestinal injury. Group T was intragastrically administered  suspension 7 d before LPS. Group C was intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. The rats were killed at 2, 6 or 12 h after LPS or physiological saline injection to collect ileal tissue samples. The expression of ileal CINC mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and expression of ileal IGF-1 protein and mRNA was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, respectively.The ileum of rats in Group C did not express CINC mRNA, ileums from Group E expressed high levels, which was then significantly decreased in Group T ( = 23.947,  < 0.05). There was no significant difference in CINC mRNA expression at different times ( = 0.665,  > 0.05). There was a high level of IGF-1 brown granules in ileal crypts and epithelial cells in Group C, sparse staining in Group E, and dark, dense brown staining in Group T. There was a significant difference between Groups C and E and Groups E and T ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in IGF-1 protein expression at different times ( = 1.269,  > 0.05). IGF-1 mRNA expression was significantly different among the three groups ( < 0.05), though not at different times ( = 0.086,  > 0.05).Expression of CINC mRNA increased in the ileum of preweaning rats with endotoxin injury, and exogenous administration of  reduced CINC mRNA expression.

The positively charged poly-imine ethylene layer on the oXiris membrane is capable of adsorbing negatively charged endotoxin molecules and removing them from the blood compartment. Endotoxin is detrimental and should be removed from blood.The adsorbable endotoxin fraction in blood arises from a tight balance between seeding from an infectious focus and removal by an overwhelmed immune system. The net sum of remaining endotoxin in blood is available for an adsorption process in the oXiris filter. Endotoxin data from 2 patients with severe Gram-negative septic shock and  in this case series, speaks for a considerable share of the adsorption of the oXiris filter in the endotoxin net removal over time.

Our study hypothesis was that DEX can ensure hemodynamic stability during the course of . Thirty-two male pigs (25-27 kg) were assigned into four groups: (1) no intervention (group A), (2) DEX 0.8 μg/kg was administered in non-septic animals (group B), (3) sepsis induced by intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin (group C) and (4) DEX 0.8 μg/kg was administered in septic animals (group D). Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, mean blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output were continuously recorded. Central venous oxygen saturation was also measured in order to obtain a complete evaluation of cardiovascular response to sepsis. Heart rate was decreased, whilst mean arterial pressure decrease was alleviated after DEX administration in septic animals. In addition, central venous pressure was stable in animals with sepsis after DEX infusion. Sepsis dramatically elevated pulmonary function indicators but DEX succeeded in ameliorating this effect. The important decrease measured in central venous oxygen saturation in both sepsis groups reflected the decreased perfusion of tissues that takes place at the end of early sepsis. Our findings support the hypothesis that DEX has beneficial effects on heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure, whilst reduction in systemic blood pressure occurs at acceptable levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31031625>Connecting Metainflammation and Neuroinflammation Through the PTN-MK-RPTPβ/ζ Axis: Relevance in Therapeutic Development.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a common factor of pathologies such as obesity, type 2 diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered part of the pathogenic mechanisms of different disorders associated with aging. Interestingly, peripheral inflammation and the associated metabolic alterations not only facilitate insulin resistance and diabetes but also neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the identification of novel pathways, common to the development of these diseases, which modulate the immune response and signaling is key. It will provide highly relevant information to advance our knowledge of the multifactorial process of aging, and to establish new biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to counteract the underlying chronic inflammatory processes. One novel pathway that regulates peripheral and central immune responses is triggered by the cytokines pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MK), which bind its receptor, Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (RPTP) β/ζ, and inactivate its phosphatase activity. In this review, we compile a growing body of knowledge suggesting that PTN and MK modulate the immune response and/or inflammation in different pathologies characterized by peripheral inflammation associated with insulin resistance, such as aging, and in central disorders characterized by overt neuroinflammation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and . Evidence strongly suggests that regulation of the PTN and MK signaling pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities particularly in those neurological disorders characterized by increased PTN and/or MK cerebral levels and neuroinflammation. Importantly, we discuss existing therapeutics, and others being developed, that modulate these signaling pathways, and their potential use in pathologies characterized by overt neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449541>A novel organic mineral complex prevented high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia, , liver injury and endothelial dysfunction in young male Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) has risen 35% since 2012 and over two-thirds of Americans exhibit features characterizing this condition (obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and/or endothelial dysfunction). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a novel dietary supplemental organic mineral complex (OMC) on these risk factors in a rodent model of MetSyn. Six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) composed of 60% kcal from fat for 10 weeks. Rats were also treated with OMC in their drinking water at either 0 mg/mL (control), 0.6 mg/mL, or 3.0 mg/mL. The HFD-treated rats exhibited significantly increased body mass (p<0.05), epididymal fat pad mass (p<0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.010), in addition to elevations in plasma endotoxins (p<0.001), ALT activity (p<0.001), fasting serum glucose (p = 0.025) and insulin concentrations (p = 0.009). OMC did not affect body weight or adiposity induced by the HFD. At the higher dose OMC significantly blunted HFD-induced hyperglycemia (p = 0.021), whereas both low and high doses of OMC prevented HFD-induced  (p = 0.002 and <0.001, respectively) and hepatocyte injury (ALT activity, p<0.01). Despite evidence of oxidative stress (elevated urinary H2O2 p = 0.032) in HFD-fed rats, OMC exhibited no demonstrable antioxidative effect. Consistent with prior studies, mesenteric arteries from HFD rats had more uncoupled eNOS (p = 0.006) and iNOS protein expression (p = 0.027) in addition to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation that was abrogated by the high dose of OMC (p<0.05). This effect of OMC may be attributed to the high nitrate content of the supplement. These findings suggest that the OMC supplement, particularly at the higher dose, ameliorated several risk factors associated with MetSyn via a non-antioxidant-dependent mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774009>The hepatic innate immune response is lobe-specific in a murine model .</a></h2><p>The liver plays a central role in the innate immune response to .

The expression of all innate immune response genes increased following i.p. LPS challenge. When tested at the early time points (30 and 60 min), the left medial lobe and caudate process consistently demonstrated the highest induction of gene expression.

Sepsis can involve activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which activates numerous inflammatory pathways. The breadth of this inflammation has limited the efficacy of pharmacological interventions that target a single molecular pathway. Here, we developed cargo-less particles as a single-agent, multi-target platform to elicit broad anti-inflammatory action against innate immune cells challenged by multiple TLR agonists. The particles, prepared from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), displayed potent molecular weight-, polymer composition-, and charge-dependent immunomodulatory properties, including downregulation of TLR-induced costimulatory molecule expression and cytokine secretion. Particles prepared using the anionic surfactant poly(ethylene-alt-maleic acid) (PEMA) significantly blunted the responses of antigen presenting cells to TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide) and TLR9 (CpG-ODN) agonists, demonstrating broad inhibitory activity to both extracellular and intracellular TLR ligands. Interestingly, particles prepared using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a neutrally-charged surfactant, only marginally inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretions. The biochemical pathways modulated by particles were investigated using TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRrays (TRACER), which implicated IRF1, STAT1, and AP-1 in the mechanism of action for PLA-PEMA particles. Using an LPS-induced  mouse model, administration of PLA-PEMA particles prior to or following a lethal challenge resulted in significantly improved mean survival. Cargo-less particles affect multiple biological pathways involved in the development of inflammatory responses by innate immune cells and represent a potentially promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Endothelial inflammation and dysfunction play a prominent role in development of ALI. Glycolysis is the predominant bioenergetic pathway for endothelial cells (ECs). However, the role of EC glycolysis in ALI of sepsis remains unclear. Here we show that both the expression and activity of PFKFB3, a key glycolytic activator, were markedly increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human pulmonary arterial ECs (HPAECs) in vitro and in lung ECs of mice challenged with LPS in vivo. PFKFB3 knockdown significantly reduced LPS-enhanced glycolysis in HPAECs. Compared with LPS-challenged wild-type mice, endothelial-specific Pfkfb3 knockout (Pfkfb3) mice exhibited reduced endothelium permeability, lower pulmonary edema, and higher survival rate. This was accompanied by decreased expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (Icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam-1), as well as decreased neutrophil and macrophage infiltration to the lung. Consistently, PFKFB3 silencing or PFKFB3 inhibition in HPAECs and human pulmonary microvascular ECs (HPMVECs) significantly downregulated LPS-induced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and monocyte adhesion to human pulmonary ECs. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated PFKFB3 overexpression upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in HPAECs. Mechanistically, PFKFB3 silencing suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-p65, and NF-κB inhibitors abrogated PFKFB3-induced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Finally, administration of the PFKFB3 inhibitor 3PO also reduced the inflammatory response of vascular endothelium and protected mice from LPS-induced ALI. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that targeting PFKFB3-mediated EC glycolysis is an efﬁcient therapeutic strategy for ALI in sepsis.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073164>Sox17 is required for endothelial regeneration following inflammation-induced vascular injury.</a></h2><p>Repair of the endothelial cell barrier after inflammatory injury is essential for tissue fluid homeostasis and normalizing leukocyte transmigration.

We identify Sox17 as a key regulator of endothelial cell regeneration using endothelial-specific deletion and overexpression of Sox17.  upregulates Hypoxia inducible factor 1α, which in turn transcriptionally activates Sox17 expression. We observe that Sox17 increases endothelial cell proliferation via upregulation of Cyclin E1. Furthermore, endothelial-specific upregulation of Sox17 in vivo enhances lung endothelial regeneration.

Most approaches rely on incubating excised sections or homogenates with reagents, typically at supraphysiologic oxygen tensions, to finally detect surrogate, nonspecific end products. In the present work, we explored the potential of using intravenously (i.v.) injected dihydroethidine (DHE) to detect superoxide radical (O ) abundance  by quantification of the superoxide-specific DHE oxidation product, 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E), as well as ethidium (E) and DHE in multiple tissues in a murine model of  induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), while DHE was delivered via the tail vein one hour before sacrifice. Tissues (kidney, lung, liver, and brain) were harvested and subjected to HPLC/fluorescent analysis of DHE and its monomeric oxidation products. In parallel, electron spin resonance (EPR) spin trapping was used to measure nitric oxide (NO) production in the aorta, lung, and liver isolated from the same mice. Endotoxemic inflammation was validated by analysis of plasma biomarkers. The concentration of 2-OH-E varied in the liver, lung, and kidney; however, the ratios of 2-OH-E/E and 2-OH-E/DHE were increased in the liver and kidney but not in the lung or the brain. An LPS-induced robust level of NO burst was observed in the liver, whereas the lung demonstrated a moderate yet progressive increase in the rate of NO production. Interestingly, endothelial dysfunction was observed in the aorta, as evidenced by decreased NO production 6 hours post-LPS injection that coincided with the inflammatory burden of  (e.g. elevated serum amyloid A and prostaglandin E). Combined, these data demonstrate that systemic delivery of DHE affords the capacity to specifically detect O  production . Furthermore, the ratio of 2-OH-E/E oxidation products in tissues provides a tool for comparative insight into the oxidative environments in various organs. Based on our findings, we demonstrate that the endotoxemic liver is susceptible to both O -mediated and nonspecific oxidant stress as well as nitrosative stress. Oxidant stress in the lung was detected to a lesser extent, thus underscoring a differential response of liver and lung to endotoxemic injury induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240112>Molecular markers relevant to myocardial injury following dental extraction in patients with or without coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to characterize biological changes following dental extractions in patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD).Forty-five patients (36 males and 9 females) referred for dental extraction underwent treatment and provided blood samples before, immediately after, and 24 h after the procedure. A broad array of biomarkers was employed to assess myocardial injury (highly sensitive troponin T, hs-TnT), bacterial burden (LPS endotoxin activity), and systemic inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α).Dental extraction in patients with or without CAD was associated with rises in hs-TnT ( = 0.013), hs-CRP ( < 0.001), fibrinogen ( = 0.005), endotoxin activity ( < 0.001), IFN-γ ( < 0.001), IL-6 ( < 0.001), IL-8 ( = 0.011), and IL-12 ( < 0.001) at 24 h compared with immediately post procedure. Changes in systemic inflammation and endotoxin activity were more evident in those with hs-TnT rise.Simple dental extractions may cause mild increase in hs-TnT, indicating minor myocardial injury in both patients with or without CAD.

We demonstrated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) elevation in patients with IBD and endoscopic moderate colitis in clinical remission, supporting the possible influence of gut fungi toward IBD in human. Then, in mouse model,  gavage was found to worsen the DSS model indicated by higher mortality rate, more severe colon histology and enhanced gut-leakage (FITC-dextran assay, , serum BG and blood bacterial burdens) but did not affect weight loss and diarrhea. DSS+ induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines both in blood and in intestinal tissue. Worsened systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in DSS+ compared with DSS alone was possibly due to the more severe translocation of LPS, BG and bacteria (not fungemia) from gut into systemic circulation. Interestingly, bacteremia from  was more frequently isolated from DSS+ than DSS alone. In parallel,  was also isolated from fecal culture in most of the mice in DSS+ group supported by prominent  in fecal microbioata analysis. However,  L34 attenuated both DSS+ and DSS model through the attenuation of gut local inflammation (cytokines and histology), gut-leakage severity, fecal dysbiosis (culture method and microbiome analysis) and systemic inflammation (serum cytokines).

No clinical factors were significantly correlated with the detection of bacteremia. On the other hand, plasma LBP level was significantly correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.312), fasting blood glucose (r = 0.279), fasting C-peptide (r = 0.265), body mass index (r = 0.371), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.241), and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, r = 0.543; and interleukin-6, r = 0.456). Multiple regression analysis identified body mass index, HbA1c, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 as independent determinants of plasma LBP level.The plasma LBP level was similar in patients with and without bacteremia. While both bacteremia and LBP are theoretically associated with bacterial translocation, the detection of bacteremia was not associated with LBP level in T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480421>Plasma Disappearance Rate of Indocyanine Green for Determination of Liver Function in Three Different Models of Shock.</a></h2><p>The measurement of the liver function via the plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDR) is a sensitive bed-side tool in critical care. Yet, recent evidence has questioned the value of this method for hyperdynamic conditions. To evaluate this technique in different hemodynamic settings, we analyzed the PDR and corresponding pharmacokinetic models after  or hemorrhagic shock in rats. Male anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure 35 ± 5 mmHg, 90 min) and 2 h of reperfusion, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced moderate or severe (1.0 vs. 10 mg/kg)  for 6 h (each  = 6). Afterwards, PDR was measured, and pharmacokinetic models were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM). Hemorrhagic shock resulted in a significant decrease of PDR, compared with sham controls, and a corresponding attenuation of the calculated ICG clearance in 1- and 2-compartment models, with the same log-likelihood. The induction of severe, but not moderate , led to a significant reduction of PDR. The calculated ICG blood clearance was reduced in 1-compartment models for both septic conditions. 2-compartment models performed with a significantly better log likelihood, and the calculated clearance of ICG did not correspond well with PDR in both LPS groups. 3-compartment models did not improve the log likelihood in any experiment. These results demonstrate that PDR correlates well with ICG clearance in 1- and 2-compartment models after hemorrhage. In , best described by a 2-compartment model, PDR may not truly reflect the ICG clearance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982555>Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and Bifidobacterium longum LC67 simultaneously alleviate high-fat diet-induced colitis, , liver steatosis, and obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Long-term feeding of a high-fat diet (HFD) induces  and gastrointestinal inflammation by disturbing gut microbiota composition and membrane permeability, resulting in the acceleration of obesity. Some probiotics exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory probiotics could lead to the simultaneous attenuation of , liver steatosis, obesity, and colitis in mice with HFD-induced obesity. Herein, we examined whether Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and/or Bifidobacterium longum LC, which significantly suppressed NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide- or fecal lysate-stimulated Caco-2 cells, could simultaneously alleviate liver steatosis and colitis in mice with HFD-induced obesity. Oral administration of LC27, LC67, or their (3:1) mixture (LM) reduced HFD-induced aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and lipopolysaccharide levels in the blood and liver. Their treatments also suppressed HFD-induced NF-κB activation and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and claudin-1 and occludin expression in the liver and colon. Moreover, LC27, LC67, or LM treatment reduced HFD-induced Firmicutes and Proteobacteria populations in gut microbiota and fecal lipopolysaccharide production. The hypothesis was supported by the findings that anti-inflammatory LC27 and/or LC67 simultaneously alleviated liver steatosis, obesity, and colitis by regulating NF-κB and AMPK activation through the inhibition of gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular mechanisms causing immunoparalysis remain unclear; however, changes in cellular metabolism of leukocytes have been linked to immunoparalysis. We investigated the relation of metabolic changes to antimicrobial monocyte functions in endotoxin-induced immunotolerance, as a model for sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. In this study, immunotolerance was induced in healthy males by intravenous endotoxin (2 ng/kg, derived from Escherichia coli O:113) administration. Before and after induction of immunotolerance, circulating CD14 monocytes were isolated and assessed for antimicrobial functions, including cytokine production, oxidative burst, and microbial (Candida albicans) killing capacity, as well metabolic responses to ex vivo stimulation. Next, the effects of altered cellular metabolism on monocyte functions were validated in vitro. Ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation induced an extensive rewiring of metabolism in naive monocytes. In contrast, endotoxin-induced immunotolerant monocytes showed no metabolic plasticity, as they were unable to adapt their metabolism or mount cytokine and oxidative responses. Validation experiments showed that modulation of metabolic pathways, affected by immunotolerance, influenced monocyte cytokine production, oxidative burst, and microbial (C. albicans) killing in naive monocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that immunotolerant monocytes are characterized by a loss of metabolic plasticity and these metabolic defects impact antimicrobial monocyte immune functions. Further, these findings support that the changed cellular metabolism of immunotolerant monocytes might reveal novel therapeutic targets to reverse sepsis-induced immunoparalysis.©2019 The Authors.

These cage-like proteins are of immense importance in nanomedicine due to their propensity to self-assemble from simple identical building blocks to highly ordered architecture and the design flexibility afforded by protein engineering. However, delivery of protein nanocages to the renal tubules remains a major challenge because of the glomerular filtration barrier, which effectively excludes conventional size nanocages. Here, we show that DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) - the extremely small archaeal antioxidant nanocage - is able to cross the glomerular filtration barrier and is endocytosed by the renal proximal tubules. Using a model of , we present an example of the way in which proximal tubule-selective Dps nanocages can limit the degree of endotoxin-induced kidney injury. This was accomplished by amplifying the endogenous antioxidant property of Dps with addition of a dinuclear manganese cluster. Dps is the first-in-class protein cage nanoparticle that can be targeted to renal proximal tubules through glomerular filtration. In addition to its therapeutic potential, chemical and genetic engineering of Dps will offer a nanoplatform to advance our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of glomerular filtration and tubular endocytosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619520>Tumor susceptibility gene 101 ameliorates endotoxin-induced cardiac dysfunction by enhancing Parkin-mediated mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Cardiac mitochondrial damage and subsequent inflammation are hallmarks of endotoxin-induced myocardial depression. Activation of the Parkin/ PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) pathway has been shown to promote autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) and to protect from endotoxin-induced cardiac dysfunction. Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) is a key member of the endosomal recycling complexes required for transport, which may affect autophagic flux. In this study, we investigated whether TSG101 regulates mitophagy and influences the outcomes of endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction. TSG101-transgenic (TG) and -knockdown (KD) mice underwent endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (10 μg/g) and were assessed for survival, cardiac function, systemic/local inflammation, and activity of mitophagy mediators in the heart. Upon endotoxin challenge and compared with WT mice, TSG101-TG mice exhibited increased survival, preserved cardiac contractile function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced mitophagy activation in the heart. By contrast, TSG101-KD mice displayed opposite phenotypes during . Mechanistically, both co-immunoprecipitation assays and co-immunofluorescence staining revealed that TSG101 directly binds to Parkin in the cytosol of myocytes and facilitates translocation of Parkin from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Our results indicate that TSG101 elevation could protect against endotoxin-triggered myocardial injury by promoting Parkin-induced mitophagy.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541903>Serum interleukin-6 and endotoxin levels and their relationship with fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients on chronic haemodialysis.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the underlying aetiology of fatigue in haemodialysis (HD) patients apart from a significant association and overlapping symptomatology with depressive symptoms. Growing evidence exists for the involvement of the immune system, by pro-inflammatory cytokines, in the development of fatigue in other inflammatory diseases. In HD patients, increased exposure to bacterial endotoxins may contribute to an inflammatory response and may potentially lead to fatigue. We therefore aimed (i) to assess the interrelationship between serum endotoxin (EA) levels, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and fatigue in HD patients; (ii) to evaluate whether there is a relationship between depressive symptoms and inflammation as well and (iii) to what extent depressive symptoms and fatigue are related to each other.Fatigue and depressive symptoms in daily life were assessed in 59 individuals using the SF-36 vitality subscale and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Blood samples were collected on a mid-week dialysis session to determine EA levels, through the Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA™), and IL-6 concentrations, through the commercially available Abcam ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kit.EA, IL-6 levels and depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with fatigue. EA levels and depressive symptoms were significant predictors of fatigue, explaining 31% of its variance. However, EA and IL-6 were not significantly associated with depression.Fatigue in HD patients may be related to  and inflammation through IL-6. Furthermore, fatigue is significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Future research into the causal interrelationship of inflammation, fatigue and depression in HD patients might lead to potential targets for therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Elevated blood lactate and slow lactate clearance are associated with mortality; however, regulatory roles are unknown. We hypothesized that lactic acid (LA) contributes to the late phase and is not solely a consequence of bacterial infection. No studies have examined LA effects in sepsis models in vivo or a mechanism by which it suppresses LPS-induced activation in vitro. Because mast cells can be activated systemically and contribute to sepsis, we examined LA effects on the mast cell response to LPS. LA significantly suppressed LPS-induced cytokine production and NF-κB transcriptional activity in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and cytokine production in peritoneal mast cells. Suppression was MCT-1 dependent and reproducible with sodium lactate or formic acid. Further, LA significantly suppressed cytokine induction following LPS-induced  in mice. Because glycolysis is linked to inflammation and LA is a byproduct of this process, we examined changes in glucose metabolism. LA treatment reduced glucose uptake and lactate export during LPS stimulation. LA effects were mimicked by glycolytic inhibitors and reversed by increasing ATP availability. These results indicate that glycolytic suppression and ATP production are necessary and sufficient for LA effects. Our work suggests that enhancing glycolysis and ATP production could improve immune function, counteracting LA suppressive effects in the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490357>EP2 Receptor Blockade Attenuates COX-2 Upregulation During Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>High levels of PGE2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory disorders such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and peritonitis. However, PGE2 has a paradoxical effect: its low levels promote intestinal homeostasis, whereas high levels may contribute to pathology. These concentration-dependent effects are mediated by four receptors, EP1-EP4. In this study, we evaluate the effect of blockade of the low affinity pro-inflammatory receptors EP1 and EP2 on expression of COX-2, the rate limiting enzyme in PGE2 biosynthesis, and on gut barrier permeability using cultured enterocytes and three different models of intestinal injury. PGE2 upregulated COX-2 in IEC-6 enterocytes, and this response was blocked by the EP2 antagonist PF-04418948, but not by the EP1 antagonist ONO-8711 or EP4 antagonist E7046. In the neonatal rat model of NEC, EP2 antagonist and low dose of COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib, but not EP1 antagonist, reduced NEC pathology as well as COX-2 mRNA and protein expression. In the adult mouse  and cecal ligation/puncture models, EP2, but not EP1 genetic deficiency decreased COX-2 expression in the intestine. Our results indicate that the EP2 receptor plays a critical role in the positive feedback regulation of intestinal COX-2 by its end-product PGE2 during inflammation and may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of NEC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345057>Circulating levels of butyrate are inversely related to portal hypertension, , and systemic inflammation in patients with cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbiota-derived products that participate in maintaining the gut barrier integrity and host's immune response. We hypothesize that reduced SCFA levels are associated with systemic inflammation, , and more severe hemodynamic alterations in cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis referred for a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement ( = 62) or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement ( = 12) were included. SCFAs were measured in portal (when available), hepatic, and peripheral blood samples by GC-MS. Serum endotoxins, proinflammatory cytokines, and NO levels were quantified. SCFA levels were significantly higher in portal  hepatic and peripheral blood. There were inverse relationships between SCFAs and the severity of disease. SCFAs (mainly butyric acid) inversely correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score and were further reduced in patients with history of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There was an inverse relationship between butyric acid and HVPG values. SCFAs were directly related with systemic vascular resistance and inversely with cardiac index. Butyric acid inversely correlated with inflammatory markers and serum endotoxin.

We hypothesized that catechin-rich green tea extract (GTE) would protect against obesity-associated TLR4/NFκB inflammation by alleviating gut dysbiosis and limiting endotoxin translocation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet containing 0% or 2% GTE for 8 weeks. At Week 7, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was administered by oral gavage before assessing its serum concentrations as a gut permeability marker. HF-feeding increased (P<.05) adipose mass and adipose expression of genes involved in TLR4/NFκB-dependent inflammation and macrophage activation. GTE attenuated HF-induced obesity and pro-inflammatory gene expression. GTE in HF mice decreased serum FITC-dextran, and attenuated portal vein and circulating endotoxin concentrations. GTE in HF mice also prevented HF-induced decreases in the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (TJPs) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α while preventing increases in TLR4/NFκB-dependent inflammatory genes. Gut microbial diversity was increased, and the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio was decreased, in HF mice fed GTE compared with HF controls. GTE in LF mice did not attenuate adiposity but decreased endotoxin and favorably altered several gut bacterial populations. Serum FITC-dextran was correlated with portal vein endotoxin (P<.001; r=0.66) and inversely correlated with colonic mRNA levels of TJPs (P<.05; r=-0.38 to -0.48). Colonic TJPs mRNA were inversely correlated with portal endotoxin (P<.05; r=-0.33 to -0.39). These data suggest that GTE protects against diet-induced obesity consistent with a mechanism involving the gut-adipose axis that limits endotoxin translocation and consequent adipose TLR4/NFκB inflammation by improving gut barrier function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This review examines the following eight controversies: 1) reliance on core temperature for diagnosing and assessing severity of EHS; 2) hypothalamic damage induces heat stroke and this mediates "thermoregulatory failure" during the immediate recovery period; 3) EHS is a predictable condition primarily due to overwhelming heat stress; 4) heat-induced  mediates systemic inflammatory response syndrome in all EHS cases; 5) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for EHS prevention; 6) EHS shares similar mechanisms with malignant hyperthermia; 7) cooling to a specific body core temperature during treatment for EHS; and 8) return to physical activity based on physiological responses to a single exercise heat tolerance test.

It has been reported to reverse the progression of liver fibrosis and to improve liver function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of orally administered PC on intestinal barrier function (IBF) in rats with drug-induced liver injury.Rats with carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced liver injury were treated with 100 mg/kg PC once daily for 21 days. The effects of PC therapy on (i) liver function and portal pressure, (ii) intestinal and hepatic histology, and (iii) plasma endotoxin, diamine oxidase (DAO), and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)  levels were investigated.PC therapy reduced portal pressure and improved the liver function in CCl4-induced liver injury. In PC-treated liver injury rats, collagen fibres were gradually decreased, while the disordered arrangement of hepatocytes and disorganized hepatic lobules were partially repaired, and inflammatory cell infiltration was decreased in the fibrous tissue. Lower inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum improved intestinal histology, and reduced serum DAO levels were observed in PC-treated cirrhotic rats. These changes were associated with reduced inflammatory activity, as indicated by decreased serum TNF- levels and plasma endotoxin levels.These results suggest that PC therapy is hepatoprotective and is able to restore IBF and reduce  in rats with drug-induced liver injury.Copyright © 2019 Meijuan Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741300>Food-borne patulin toxicity is related to gut barrier disruption and can be prevented by docosahexaenoic acid and probiotic supplementation.</a></h2><p>Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin widely found in fruits and vegetables. Several reviews and studies have hypothesized that in vivo PAT toxicity is related to gut barrier dysfunction, but evidence for this is not substantial. The goal of the present study was to further demonstrate the role of the gut barrier in food-borne PAT toxicity. In vitro assays showed that PAT exposure induced significant cell death, inhibited the mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins and increased gut permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers. An acute PAT exposure animal trial reported for the first time an association between PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and  in mice. Sub-chronic PAT exposure also inhibited the expression of ZO-1 in the gut and induced both intestinal and systematic inflammation in mice. Dietary supplements with previously reported protective effects on the gut barrier, such as docosahexaenoic acid and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, were able to recover the PAT-induced gut barrier dysfunction and significantly alleviate PAT toxicity in vivo. Another L. plantarum strain, CCFM11, with poor gut barrier modulation ability, failed to exhibit identical protective effects against PAT toxicity to L. plantarum CCFM8610. Our results indicated that PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and bacterial translocation may be another toxic mechanism of PAT besides its inherent cytotoxicity.

However, the role of NETs in pediatric sepsis is unknown.Infant (2 weeks old) and adult (6 weeks old) mice were submitted to sepsis by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bacteria suspension or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neutrophil infiltration, bacteremia, organ injury, and concentrations of cytokine, NETs, and DNase in the plasma were measured. Production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and release of NETs by neutrophils were also evaluated. To investigate the functional role of NETs, mice undergoing sepsis were treated with antibiotic plus rhDNase and the survival, organ injury, and levels of inflammatory markers and NETs were determined. Blood samples from pediatric and adult sepsis patients were collected and the concentrations of NETs measured.Infant C57BL/6 mice subjected to sepsis or LPS-induced  produced significantly higher levels of NETs than the adult mice. Moreover, compared to that of the adult mice, this outcome was accompanied by increased organ injury and production of inflammatory cytokines. The increased NETs were associated with elevated expression of Padi4 and histone H3 citrullination in the neutrophils. Furthermore, treatment of infant septic mice with rhDNase or a PAD-4 inhibitor markedly attenuated sepsis. Importantly, pediatric septic patients had high levels of NETs, and the severity of pediatric sepsis was positively correlated with the level of NETs.This study reveals a hitherto unrecognized mechanism of pediatric sepsis susceptibility and suggests that NETs represents a potential target to improve clinical outcomes of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471378>Soluble CD14 and  Variants, Other Inflammatory Markers, and Glucose Dysregulation in Older Adults: The Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies have implicated soluble (s)CD14, an effector of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, in insulin resistance, but its role in human metabolic  has not been studied. We evaluated sCD14 in relation to dysglycemia in older adults and how this compares to other markers of inflammation.We investigated associations of sCD14, interleukin-6 (IL-6), CRP, and white blood cell (WBC) count with insulin resistance (quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index and HOMA 2 of insulin resistance) and incident type 2 diabetes in a population-based cohort of older adults. We also assessed the causal role of sCD14 in insulin resistance using an instrumental variable approach by Mendelian randomization.After adjustment for conventional risk factors, each of the four biomarkers showed positive cross-sectional associations with both insulin resistance measures. These associations persisted after mutual adjustment for all markers except sCD14. Over a median follow-up of 11.6 years, 466 cases of diabetes occurred. All biomarkers except sCD14 were positively associated with diabetes, although only WBC count remained associated (hazard ratio 1.43 per doubling [95% CI 1.07, 1.90]) after mutual adjustment. Instrumental variable analysis did not support a causal role for sCD14 in insulin resistance.Among older adults, sCD14 was associated with insulin resistance, but this disappeared after adjustment for other biomarkers, showed no evidence of a causal basis, and was not accompanied by a similar association with diabetes. IL-6, CRP, and WBC count were each associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, WBC count most robustly. These findings do not support a central role for sCD14, but they highlight the preeminence of WBC count as an inflammatory measure of diabetes risk in this population.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514913>The Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Derivate EA-230 Modulates the Immune Response and Exerts Renal Protective Properties: Therapeutic Potential in Humans.</a></h2><p>The extent of the systemic inflammatory response following infectious or noninfectious insults is related to impaired patient outcome.

Under septic conditions, the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx covering on the healthy endothelium surface is injured, but the contribution of NE to this injury remains unknown. Our aim was to examine whether NE-induced pulmonary endothelial injury is associated with . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 9- to 12-week-old granulocyte colony-stimulating factor knockout (G-CSFKO) mice, which harbor few neutrophils, and littermate control mice; in a second assay, mice were injected with the NE-inhibitor sivelestat (0.2 mg/kg) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after LPS administration. Subsequently, vascular endothelial injury was evaluated through ultrastructural analysis. At 48 hours after LPS injection, survival rate was more than threefold higher among G-CSFKO than control mice, and degradation of both thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 was markedly attenuated in G-CSFKO compared with control mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed attenuated vascular endothelial injury and clear preservation of the endothelial glycocalyx in G-CSFKO mice. Moreover, after LPS exposure, survival rate was approximately ninefold higher among sivelestat-injected mice than control mice, and sivelestat treatment potently preserved vascular endothelial structures and the endothelial glycocalyx.

And FXR has been well investigated in liver diseases.  The objective of this study was to identify the role of farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid via targeting gut microbiota in NAFLD.  Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD). Obeticholic acid(30mg/(kg·d)) and/or a combination of antibiotics were administered orally by gavage to mice for 12 weeks. Gut microbiota profiles were established through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The effects of obeticholic acid on liver inflammation, the gut barrier, , gut microbiome and composition of the bile acid were also investigated.  Obeticholic acid treatment can significantly improve obesity, circulation metabolism disorders, liver inflammation and fibrosis, and intestinal barrier damage caused by HFD. Removal of normal commensal bacteria can weaken the effect of obeticholic acid. The gut microbial structure was changed, and abundance of Blautia was increased significantly after treated with obeticholic acid. After obeticholic acid treatment, the concentration of taurine-bound bile acid caused by HFD was reduced in the liver.  Taken together, these data suggest that obeticholic acid has aprotective effect on NAFLD via changing the components of gut microbiota, specifically increasing the abundance of Blautia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810621>Protective effect of dexmedetomidine against organ dysfunction in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation and  in rats.</a></h2><p>Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective agonist of α2-adrenergic receptors, has anti-inflammation properties and potential beneficial effects against trauma, shock, or infection. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether DEX might protect against multiple-organ dysfunction in a two-hit model of hemorrhage/resuscitation (HS) and subsequent . Eighty Wistar rats were randomized into four groups: NS (normal saline), HS/L (HS plus lipopolysaccharide), HS/L+D (HS/L plus dexmedetomidine), and HS/L+D+Y (HS/L+D plus yohimbine). Six hours after resuscitation, blood gas (PaO2) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urine nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and nitric oxide (NO) were measured. The histopathology was assayed by staining. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were assayed. The PaO2 levels in HS/L rats were lower whereas the ALT, AST, BUN, Cr, TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and NO levels were higher compared to the control group. The HS/L+D increased PaO2 and further increased IL-10 and decreased ALT, AST, BUN, Cr, TNF-α, IL-β, IL-6, IL-8, and NO levels of the HS/L groups. In addition, the MDA in the HS/L groups increased whereas SOD activity decreased compared to the control group. Moreover, the HO-1 expression levels were increased by DEX administration in lung, liver, and kidney tissues. Lungs, livers, and kidneys of the HS/L group displayed significant damage, but such damage was attenuated in the HS/L+D group. All of the above-mentioned effects of DEX were partly reversed by yohimbine. DEX reduced multiple organ injury caused by HS/L in rats, which may be mediated, at least in part, by α2-adrenergic receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814309>TLR4 Receptor Induces 2-AG-Dependent Tolerance to Lipopolysaccharide and Trafficking of CB2 Receptor in Mast Cells.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MCs) contribute to the control of local inflammatory reactions and become hyporesponsive after prolonged TLR4 activation by bacterial LPS. The molecular mechanisms involved in endotoxin tolerance (ET) induction in MCs are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and its receptor, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), play a role in the establishment of ET in bone marrow-derived MCs from C57BL/6J mice. We found that CB2 antagonism prevented the development of ET and that bone marrow-derived MCs produce 2-AG in a TLR4-dependent fashion. Exogenous 2-AG induced ET similarly to LPS, blocking the phosphorylation of IKK and the p65 subunit of NF-κB and inducing the synthesis of molecular markers of ET. LPS caused CB2 receptor trafficking in Rab11-, Rab7-, and Lamp2-positive vesicles, indicating recycling and degradation of the receptor. 2-AG also prevented LPS-induced TNF secretion in vivo, in a MC-dependent model of , demonstrating that TLR4 engagement leads to 2-AG secretion, which contributes to the negative control of MCs activation. Our study uncovers a functional role for the endocannabinoid system in the inhibition of MC-dependent innate immune responses in vivo.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235831>Healthy adiposity and extended lifespan in obese mice fed a diet supplemented with a polyphenol-rich plant extract.</a></h2><p>Obesity may not be consistently associated with metabolic disorders and mortality later in life, prompting exploration of the challenging concept of healthy obesity. Here, the consumption of a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet produces hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, increases oxidative stress, increases , expands adipose tissue (with enlarged adipocytes, enhanced macrophage infiltration and the accumulation of cholesterol and oxysterols), and reduces the median lifespan of obese mice. Despite the persistence of obesity, supplementation with a polyphenol-rich plant extract (PRPE) improves plasma lipid levels and , prevents macrophage recruitment to adipose tissues, reduces adipose accumulation of cholesterol and cholesterol oxides, and extends the median lifespan. PRPE drives the normalization of the HF/HS-mediated functional enrichment of genes associated with immunity and inflammation (in particular the response to lipopolysaccharides). The long-term limitation of immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue by PRPE increases the lifespan through a mechanism independent of body weight and fat storage and constitutes the hallmark of a healthy adiposity trait.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657258>Serum Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein Levels and the Incidence of Cardiovascular Disease in a General Japanese Population: The Hisayama Study.</a></h2><p>Background Epidemiological studies have reported a link between serum LBP (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) levels and lifestyle-related diseases. However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: 2.20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile 2: 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile 2: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-2.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population.

Although the incidence of retained fetal membranes is low, the consequences for the health of the mare can be severe (metritis, , laminitis, death). Oxytocin administration is often the first line of therapy for management of retained fetal membranes. Removal of fetal membranes using umbilical vessel infusion and manual membrane removal are effective tools for reducing risks associated with abnormally heavy membranes, retained membranes, or for mares that are geographically limited for veterinary care.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Responses to intravenous bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or normal saline were studied on three consecutive days in fetal sheep (LPS 1 μg/kg, n = 5; normal saline n = 5) and newborn lambs (LPS 2 μg/kg, n = 10; normal saline n = 5). Cerebro-vascular function was assessed by monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) over 12 h each day, and inflammatory responses were assessed by plasma TNF alpha (TNF-α), nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Brain injury was quantified by counting both resting and active macrophages in the caudate nucleus and periventricular white matter (PVWM). An acute cerebral vasoconstriction (within 1 h of LPS injection) occurred in both the fetus (ΔCVR +53%) and newborn (ΔCVR +63%); subsequently prolonged cerebral vasodilatation occurred in the fetus (ΔCVR -33%) in association with double plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations, but not in the newborn. Abundant infiltration of activated macrophages was observed in both CN and PVWM at each age, with the extent being 2-3 times greater in the fetus (P < 0.001). In conclusion, while the fetus and newborn experience a similar acute disruption of the cerebral circulation after LPS, the fetus suffers a more prolonged circulatory disruption, a greater infiltration of activated macrophages, and an exaggerated susceptibility to brain injury.© 2019 The Authors.

The magnitude of the immune response is dependent on the strength of the external stimulus. Knowledge on leukocyte transcriptional responses altered in response to different stimulus dosages in man is lacking. Here, we sought to identify leukocyte transcriptional signatures dependent on LPS dose in humans. Healthy human volunteers were administered 1 ng/kg (n = 7), 2 ng/kg (n = 6), or 4 ng/kg (n = 7) LPS intravenously. Blood was collected before (pre-LPS) and 4 h after LPS administration. Total RNA was analyzed by microarrays and generalized linear models. Pathway analysis was performed by using Ingenuity pathway analysis. Leukocyte transcriptomes altered per LPS dosage were predominantly shared, with 47% common signatures relative to pre-LPS. A univariate linear model identified a set of 3736 genes that exhibited a dependency on differing LPS dosages. Neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts explained 38.9% of the variance in the LPS dose-dependent gene set. A multivariate linear model including leukocyte composition delineated a set of 295 genes with a dependency on LPS dose. Evaluation of the 295 gene signature in patients with sepsis due to abdominal infections showed significant correlations. Promoter regions of the LPS dose gene set were enriched for YY1, EGR1, ELK1, GABPA, KLF4, and REL transcription factor binding sites. Intravenous injection of 1, 2, or 4 ng/kg LPS was accompanied by both shared and distinct leukocyte transcriptional alterations. These data may assist in assessing the severity of the insult in patients with abdominal sepsis.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated the effects of myeloid ferritin heavy chain (FtH) in regulating the pathogenic sequelae of sepsis. We demonstrate that deletion of myeloid FtH leads to protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced  and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced model of sepsis as evidenced by reduced cytokine levels, multi-organ dysfunction and mortality. We identified that such protection is predominantly mediated by the compensatory increase in circulating ferritin (ferritin light chain; FtL) in the absence of myeloid FtH. Our  and  studies indicate that prior exposure to ferritin light chain restrains an otherwise dysregulated response to infection. These findings are mediated by an inhibitory action of FtL on NF-κB activation, a key signaling pathway that is implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. We further identified that LPS mediated activation of MAPK pathways, specifically, JNK, and ERK were also reduced with FtL pre-treatment. Taken together, our findings elucidate a crucial immunomodulatory function for circulating ferritin that challenges the traditional view of this protein as a mere marker of body iron stores. Accordingly, these findings will stimulate investigations to the adaptive nature of this protein in diverse clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099356>Bovine α-lactalbumin hydrolysates ameliorate obesity-associated  and inflammation in high-fat diet-fed mice through modulation of gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota has been identified as an important factor in the link between nutrient excess and obesity. The aim of this study was to confirm whether bovine α-lactalbumin hydrolysates (LAH) can ameliorate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced  and systematic inflammation by modulating the structure of gut microbiota in mice. The results showed that LAH changed the overall structure of gut microbiota in HFD-induced obese mice. LAH increased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratios and the relative abundance of S24-7, Lachnospiraceae and Blautia. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the alteration of gut microbiota and obesity-related indexes. LAH decreased the HFD-induced protein expression of G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and 41 (GPR41) in the colon tissue. Besides, LAH inhibited the destruction of the gut barrier through the up-regulation of tight junction protein (zonulin/zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and occludin) expression and the decrease of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein expression in the colon tissue. LAH also significantly reduced the concentration of tumour cell necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in both serum and colon and decreased the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in serum and feces, leading to reduced systematic inflammation and metabolic . In summary, LAH partly modulated the gut microbial composition and structure, and alleviated the obesity-associated inflammation. These findings shed light on bovine α-lactalbumin hydrolysate as a potential functional food ingredient to prevent obesity-related inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201798>Impaired SIRT3 activity mediates cardiac dysfunction in  by calpain-dependent disruption of ATP synthesis.</a></h2><p>Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy contributes to the high mortality of septic shock in critically ill patients. Since the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, we hypothesized that sepsis-induced impairment of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) activity contributes to the development of septic cardiomyopathy.Treatment of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 h resulted in myocardial NAD depletion and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation, indicating impaired myocardial SIRT3 activity due to NAD depletion. LPS treatment also resulted in impaired cardiac output in isolated working hearts, indicating -induced cardiomyopathy. Maintaining normal myocardial NAD levels in LPS-treated mice by Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1) deletion prevented cardiac dysfunction, whereas additional SIRT3 deficiency blunted this beneficial effect, indicating that impaired SIRT3 activity contributes to cardiac dysfunction in . Measurements of mitochondrial ATP synthesis suggest that LPS-induced contractile dysfunction may result from cardiac energy depletion due to impaired SIRT3 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial calpains using MDL28170 normalized LPS-induced cleavage of the ATP5A1 subunit of ATP synthase and normalized contractile dysfunction, suggesting that cardiac energy depletion may result from calpain-mediated cleavage of ATP5A1. These beneficial effects were completely blunted by SIRT3 deficiency. Finally, a gene set enrichment analysis of hearts of patients with septic, ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy revealed a sepsis-specific suppression of SIRT3 deacetylation targets, including ATP5A1, indicating a functional relevance of SIRT3-dependent pathways in human sepsis.Impaired SIRT3 activity may mediate cardiac dysfunction in  by facilitating calpain-mediated disruption of ATP synthesis, suggesting SIRT3 activation as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat septic cardiomyopathy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Blood and liver samples were collected 2 h, 6 h and 12 h after LPS administration for analysis.Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 from both blood and liver were determined by ELISA assay. Serum nitrate was determined by chemiluminescense. Growth hormone receptor (GHR) and growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) were determined by western blotting. GHR mRNA and IGF-1 mRNA were determined by RT-PCR.LPS administration induced a decrease in IGF-1 and GH serum levels, characterizing GH/IGF-1 axis disruption. Ghrelin treatment attenuated the decrease of serum levels of IGF-1 as well as the increase of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and nitrate induced by LPS. The increase of induced GHSR-1a protein expression seen in the LPS group after 2 h remained until 6 h after ghrelin treatment. However, attenuation of the circulating IGF-1 decrease by ghrelin treatment was not accompanied by changes in GHR protein expression nor GHR and IGF-1 gene expression.Ghrelin was able to attenuate changes in the GH/IGF-1 axis observed during systemic inflammation, which may be due to the modulation of pro-inflammatory mediators release.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
