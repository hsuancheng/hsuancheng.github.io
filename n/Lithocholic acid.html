To examine this possibility, total bile  concentrations (sulphated and non-sulphated) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in inferior mesentric vein serum of 19 patients undergoing colectomy for severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Similar determinations were obtained on a control group of eight patients requiring colectomy for other non-inflammatory conditions. Mean values for mesenteric vein serum bile  concentrations (muM/1) were 19.6+/-1.8 in controls and 16.3+/-2.0 in IBD. The mean sulphated bile  fraction did not exceed 10% of total, although there was considerable variability (up to 40% of total).  levels (entirely sulphated in all patients) were low. Although the IBD group showed a more than two-fold increase in mean lithocholate concentration (0.54+/-0.15 muM/1) over controls (0.21 +/- muM/1), this difference was not statistically significant. No significant intra-group difference was noted in the non-sulphated and sulphated fractions for cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic  species, respectively. No unidentified or unusual bile acids were observed. There was no correlation between bile  measurements and liver histology. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that liver disease often found in association with severe inflammatory bowel disease represents a form of bile  toxicity. The invariable finding of total sulphation of the  fraction even in the presence of severe mucosal disease was unexpected.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27915991>Control of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer by Synthetic Vitamin D Receptor Ligands.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated with an increased risk of cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammation, infection, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disease, as well as bone and mineral disorders. The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575493>Serum bile  profiling reflects enterohepatic detoxification state and intestinal barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>To determine free and conjugated serum bile  (BA) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic , the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA  (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384531>Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates -induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance by modulating bile  metabolism in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for studies of -related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for body mass index and weight-adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively). C. leptum was positively correlated with fecal unconjugated  (LCA) (r = 0.526, p = 0.003) and inversely with unconjugated CA (r = -0.669, p<0.0001) and unconjugated CDCA (r = - 0.630, p<0.0001).

Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h"<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20494122>Battle and balance at mucosal surfaces--the story of Shigella and antimicrobial peptides.</a></h2><p>Shigella is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for children in many developing countries. Emergence of antibiotic-resistance among Shigella demands the development of effective medicines. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are expressed in phagocytes and at epithelial surfaces and are important effector molecules of innate immunity. We have found that pathogens are able to turn off the endogenous expression of AMPs, resulting in serious infections such as shigellosis. A therapeutic rationale to prevent microbial invasion would be to strengthen the epithelial line of defence through enhancing AMP expression. We have identified several inducers of AMP-production, including butyrate, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, which have been investigated in animal models of shigellosis as well as in clinical trials. We believe that the conceptual framework presented here can be applied to additional clinical entities and that this novel approach can be an alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics in the future.2010.

In previous studies, fermentation of starch has been shown to inhibit the degradation of primary to secondary BA by the colonic microflora. This study was designed to investigate BA metabolism in continuous cultures of mixed fecal bacteria to get further insights into the mechanisms of this inhibition. Fermentation vessels were fed with media containing cholic (0.6 g/l) and chenodeoxycholic  (0.4 g/l). Cultures were either starch-free or enriched with starch (10 g/l). pH was controlled and adjusted to 7.0 or 6.0. Total culture duration was 28 days and concentrations of BA, short-chain   (), and starch were measured periodically. At pH 6, significantly more primary BA remained in the media and less secondary BA were produced. Total BA concentrations were lower at pH7.  concentrations were higher in the vessels supplemented with starch. Starch was completely fermented and not present in significant amounts in any fermentation vial after the first week. These data indicate that bacterial breakdown of primary to secondary BA is inhibited when starch is simultaneously fermented. This effect can be explained by the reduction of pH resulting from  production. Considering these findings, resistant starch which escapes assimilation in the small bowel may be a protective factor against colorectal cancer.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573377>Effects of a 3-mo consumption of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides on parameters of colorectal carcinogenesis in patients with or without small or large colorectal adenomas.</a></h2><p>Intervention studies of colorectal adenoma recurrence have demonstrated the need for surrogate markers of the cancer risk.

We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D.

Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

The study was designed as a single stage crossover. Both cultures were inoculated and treated in an identical manner except that whilst one fermenter was subject to pH control the other was not and vice versa. Complex bacterial populations were maintained for 23 days and many of the metabolic functions carried out by the micro-organisms in vivo were demonstrated in vitro. The predominant organisms belonged to the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium with abundant levels of anaerobic Gram-positive rods. The redox potential in each fermenter showed considerable variation with maximum values of below -300 eV being attained. An indication of the stability of the bacterial communities was the production of short-chain ; during steady-state conditions the mean ratio of the major  acetic, propionic and butyric being 3.90:0.69:1.00 and 3.65:0.76:1.00 in each fermenter, respectively. During steady-state conditions, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  was maintained at a constant rate with  representing over 85% of total steroid. Addition of the soluble fibre lactulose to the cultures had a profound effect on many of the parameters tested. Without pH control the culture pH dropped to below 5.0 and this coincided with a substantial decrease in total anaerobes, especially Bacteroides spp., an increase in Lactobacillus spp. (concomitant with an increase in lactic ), a decrease in the concentration of short-chain  and a substantial decrease in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic . These results show that it is possible to maintain viable intestinal bacteria in vitro using a continuous culture chemostat and that the cultures respond to changing conditions as evinced by the inhibition of 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  on addition of lactulose.

However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan.

Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and  activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile acids, intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% water extract from either the reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lingzhi) (WGL) or the auto-digested reishi G. lingzhi (AWGL) for three\xa0weeks. Both extracts markedly reduced fecal secondary bile acids, such as  and deoxycholic  (colon carcinogens). These extracts reduced the numbers of Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum (secondary bile acids-producing bacteria) in a per g of cecal digesta. Fecal mucins and cecal propionate were significantly elevated by both extracts, and fecal IgA was significantly elevated by WGL, but not by AWGL. These results suggest that the reishi extracts have an impact on colon luminal health by modulating secondary bile acids, microflora, mucins, and propionate that related to colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208006>Effects of konjac glucomannan on putative risk factors for colon carcinogenesis in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine effects of konjac glucomannan (KGM) in a high fat corn oil diet on risk factors of colon carcinogenesis, that is, fecal β-glucuronidase, mucinase, and bile acids, and on preventive factors, that is, fecal microflora and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8 animals per group) were fed a normal-fat fiber-free (5% corn oil, w/w) or high-fat (25% corn oil, w/w) diet containing no fiber, KGM (5%, w/w), or inulin (5%, w/w, as a prebiotic control) for 4 weeks. Results indicated that the high-fat fiber-free diet significantly elevated the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and total bile  concentration and decreased cecal SCFA contents, as compared with its normal-fat counterpart. The incorporation of KGM, as well as inulin, into the high-fat fiber-free diet beneficially reduced the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and  (secondary bile ) concentration. Although KGM elevated the daily fecal total bile  excretion, the change was due to the primary, instead of the secondary, bile acids. In addition, KGM beneficially promoted the daily fecal excretion of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and cecal SCFA contents, as compared with the high-fat fiber-free diet. Therefore, the present study suggests that KGM potentially attenuated the high fat-induced risk in colon carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727078>Flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation modulates growth performance, blood lipids, intestinal fermentation, bile , and neutral sterols in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to determine the effect of flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of fat, serum lipids, and concentrations of VFA, bile  (BA), and neutral sterols (NS) in digesta and feces in growing pigs. Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of fat, serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of fat in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal deoxycholic  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile acids and decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic acids. No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines.

To investigate how dietary fat influences risk, we compared the colonic contents of 12 adult high-risk African Americans (AAs) and 10 Caucasian Americans (CAs) who consumed a high-fat diet (123 ± 11 g/d and 129 ± 17 g/d, respectively) to 13 native Africans (NAs) who subsisted on a low-fat (38 ± 3.0 g/d) diet, all aged 50-60 yr. The colonic bile acids were measured by LC-MS and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by GC. The chief secondary colonic bile acids, deoxycholic  and , were correlated with fat intake and similar between AAs and CAs, but 3-4 times higher than in AAs (p < 0.05). The major SCFAs were lower in AAs (p < 0.001) and CAs (p < 0.001) compared to AAs, but conversely, the branched chain fatty acids (BFCA) were higher. Our results suggest that the higher risk of colon cancer in Americans may be partly explained by their high-fat and high-protein, low complex carbohydrate diet, which produces colonic residues that promote microbes to produce potentially carcinogenic secondary bile acids and less antineoplastic SCFAs.

Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased  production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472180>The protective effect of  on the intestinal epithelial  is mediated by the vitamin D receptor via a SIRT1/Nrf2 and NF-κB dependent mechanism in Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p> (LCA) is both a secondary bile  and a vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand.

Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100\u202fng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

This study focuses on the promoter of the human CAMP gene, encoding the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and induction of the gene in the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29. CAMP promoter segments were inserted in front of a luciferase reporter in order to identify regulatory regions. A transcription promoting region was identified and the transcription factor PU.1 of the Ets family was recruited to this region as shown by ChIP analysis. This ties PU.1 to the regulation of human innate epithelial defences for the first time. In addition, the conserved second intron was found to exert a transcription enhancing effect in cooperation with the 3' end of the proximal promoter, and the importance of two upstream AUG codons was examined. Moreover, we here demonstrate that  enhances CAMP transcription, and does so additively with butyrate. Thus, a crosstalk between bacteria and host epithelia of the gut could be partially mediated via these two bacterial products to obtain gut homeostasis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360029>Ursodeoxycholic  and  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.</a></h2><p> Ursodeoxycholic  and  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.  312: G550-G558, 2017. First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291748>Burdock fermented by Aspergillus awamori elevates cecal Bifidobacterium, and reduces fecal deoxycholic  and adipose tissue weight in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with burdock powder and Aspergillus awamori-fermented burdock powder at 5% on the intestinal luminal environment and body fat in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet.

TJs are responsible for paracellular permeability and integrity of the barrier function. Occludin is one of the main proteins responsible for TJ structure. This study tested the effects of physiological levels of phenol, ammonia, primary bile acids (cholic , CA, and chenodeoxycholic , CDCA), and secondary bile acids (, LCA, and deoxycholic , DCA) on paracellular permeability using a Caco-2 cell model. Paracellular permeability of Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the apical to basolateral flux of [14C]-mannitol. Secondary, but not primary, bile acids increased permeability as reflected by significantly decreased TER and increased mannitol flux. Both phenol and ammonia also increased permeability. The primary bile  CA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas CDCA had no significant effect on occludin expression as compared to the negative control. The secondary bile acids DCA and LCA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas phenol had no significant effect on the protein expression as compared to the negative control. This suggests that the increased permeability observed with LCA, DCA, phenol, and ammonia was not related to an effect on occludin expression. In conclusion, phenol, ammonia, and secondary bile acids were shown to increase paracellular permeability and reduce epithelial barrier function at doses typical of levels found in fecal samples. The results contribute to the evidence these gut microflora-generated products have tumor-promoting activity.</p><p>Keyword: barrier intergrity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554966>The Yin and Yang of bile  action on tight junctions in a model  epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial barrier loss due to tight junction (TJ) dysfunction and bile -induced diarrhea are common in patients with inflammatory diseases. Although excess  bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human  T84 cells.\xa0CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10\xa0kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10]\xa0+\xa0IL-1[10]\xa0+\xa0IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA\xa0±\xa0PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA\xa0±\xa0CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC\xa0±\xa0CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+\xa0IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100\u202fng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and hepatic . In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut microbiome, bile  , and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides. Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced metabolic phenotypes and inhibited taurolithocholic  synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile  synthesis gene expression but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX treatment effectively improved  profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion, improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning, while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial metabolic effects of FEX in obese and diabetic mice.This study uncovered a mechanism in which activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut microbiota to activate TGR5/GLP-1 signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose tissue browning; the gut microbiota plays a critical role in bile   and signaling to regulate metabolic homeostasis in health and disease.

To examine this possibility, total bile  concentrations (sulphated and non-sulphated) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in inferior mesentric vein serum of 19 patients undergoing colectomy for severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Similar determinations were obtained on a control group of eight patients requiring colectomy for other non-inflammatory conditions. Mean values for mesenteric vein serum bile  concentrations (muM/1) were 19.6+/-1.8 in controls and 16.3+/-2.0 in IBD. The mean sulphated bile  fraction did not exceed 10% of total, although there was considerable variability (up to 40% of total).  levels (entirely sulphated in all patients) were low. Although the IBD group showed a more than two-fold increase in mean lithocholate concentration (0.54+/-0.15 muM/1) over controls (0.21 +/- muM/1), this difference was not statistically significant. No significant intra-group difference was noted in the non-sulphated and sulphated fractions for cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic  species, respectively. No unidentified or unusual bile acids were observed. There was no correlation between bile  measurements and liver histology. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that liver disease often found in association with severe inflammatory bowel disease represents a form of bile  toxicity.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460897>New insights into autoimmune cholangitis through animal models.</a></h2><p>Improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools for these disorders critically depends on easily reproducible animal models.

Mice with targeted disruption of the Mdr2 (Abcb4) gene encoding a canalicular phospholipid flippase (Mdr2(-/-) mice) spontaneously develop sclerosing cholangitis with macroscopic and microscopic features of human PSC. Another example for a transporter involved in the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR/ABCC7).

The steps involved include phase I metabolism which makes molecules more reactive and phase II reactions which generally enhance solubility in bile or urine. Recent discoveries have shown how regulation of these reactions is also closely allied to expression of membrane transporters which excrete the products of biotransformation into bile and prevent their reabsorption via the intestine. The coordinated activity of these various functions is orchestrated by orphan nuclear receptors which, in response to an encounter with a potential toxin, are able to induce expression of the genes involved in its biotransformation and excretion.  (LCA) is routinely produced in our intestine by bacterial deconjugation of chenodeoxycholic  a major bile  in humans. In human liver the presence of LCA is sensed by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) which has the potential to switch on all the genes required for safe metabolism and elimination of LCA from the body. These include cytochrome P450 3A which hydroxylates LCA to more soluble forms and sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) which by sulphation of LCA makes it more readily solublein bile and enhances its faecal excretion. Similarly, PXR exposure to LCA produces up-regulated expression of the membrane transporters MDR1 and MRP2 which excrete metabolites of LCA.

The absence of the colon and the coexistence of bile  malabsorption may increase bile lithogenicity, but data on biliary lipid composition in patients with this operation is lacking. Our aim was to assess bile lithogenicity, bile composition and mass of biliary lipids within the gallbladder. We studied 11 patients with total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis and 16 healthy controls. We measured the percentage composition of conjugated bile acids and the masses within the gallbladder of the three main biliary lipids. This method, in contrast with measurement of cholesterol saturation index, can determine the cause of bile lithogenicity in terms of absolute modifications of the biliary lipids. There was no difference in the cholesterol saturation index between patients and controls. Colectomy patients had reduced masses of all three biliary lipids (medians and ranges, mmol): cholesterol 0.11 (0.03-0.24) vs. 0.36 (0.02-0.96), P < 0.02; bile  1.62 (0.75-5.21) vs. 3.95 (1.27-8.70), P < 0.01; phospholipids 0.35 (0.07-0.69) vs. 1.14 (0.14-3.00), P < 0.002. They also had reduced per cent deoxycholic : 3.8 (0.0-27.6) vs. 17.4 (6.4-44.7), P < 0.005, and increased percent cholic : 44.9 (23.3-71.4) vs. 34.3 (19.2-57.9), P < 0.05. We conclude that, despite having bile  malabsorption, patients with colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis have a normal cholesterol saturation index, caused by a concomitant reduction in the masses of all three biliary lipids. The reduced per cent biliary deoxycholic  may help explain the reduced cholesterol and phospholipid masses in these patients.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

Little is known about the roles of microbiota in C jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation. We investigated interactions between microbiota and intestinal cells during C jejuni infection of mice.Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10 mice were colonized with conventional microbiota and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10 colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional microbiota were cultured under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into germ-free Il10 mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal microbiota and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively.Introduction of conventional microbiota reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously germ-free Il10 mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Microbiota transplantation and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice colonized with microbiota cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis) compared with mice fed microbiota cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible to colitis). Oral administration to mice of microbiota-derived secondary bile  sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic  or , reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile -producing bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C\xa0jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10 mice compared with the nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic ; colitis induction by antibiotics was associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate.We identified a mechanism by which the microbiota controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465107>Secondary bile acids effects in colon pathology.

Bile  has been reported to be associated with induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene. Because the human liver-specific organic anion transporter-2 (LST-2/OATP8/OATP1B3) is expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and might transport bile acids to the intracellular space, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which bile acids induce the transcription of COX-2, and the role of LST-2 in  cell lines.Transcriptional activity of COX-2 was measured using a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase assay under various concentrations of bile acids. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) for peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE) were performed.The COX-2 promoter was induced by  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). Deletion and site-directed mutation analyses showed that CRE is the responsive element for LCA. An adenovirus expression system revealed that LST-2 is responsible for induction of COX-2. By EMSA using oligonucleotides of CRE, we observed formation of a specific protein-DNA complex, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against PPARalpha and CRE. A PPARalpha-specific agonist induced transcription of COX-2.These results indicate that COX-2 is transcriptionally activated by the addition of LCA, CDCA, and DCA and that LST-2 plays an important role by transporting bile  to the intracellular space. Moreover, LCA-dependent COX-2 gene activation consists of a transcriptional complex including PPARalpha and CRE-binding protein.

In previous studies, fermentation of starch has been shown to inhibit the degradation of primary to secondary BA by the  microflora. This study was designed to investigate BA metabolism in continuous cultures of mixed fecal bacteria to get further insights into the mechanisms of this inhibition. Fermentation vessels were fed with media containing cholic (0.6 g/l) and chenodeoxycholic  (0.4 g/l). Cultures were either starch-free or enriched with starch (10 g/l). pH was controlled and adjusted to 7.0 or 6.0. Total culture duration was 28 days and concentrations of BA, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and starch were measured periodically. At pH 6, significantly more primary BA remained in the media and less secondary BA were produced. Total BA concentrations were lower at pH7. SCFA concentrations were higher in the vessels supplemented with starch. Starch was completely fermented and not present in significant amounts in any fermentation vial after the first week. These data indicate that bacterial breakdown of primary to secondary BA is inhibited when starch is simultaneously fermented. This effect can be explained by the reduction of pH resulting from SCFA production.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464459>Combination of soya pulp and Bacillus coagulans lilac-01 improves intestinal bile  metabolism without impairing the effects of prebiotics in rats fed a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria are involved in bile  (BA) deconjugation and/or dehydroxylation and are responsible for the production of secondary BA. However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/872053>Metabolic epidemiology of .

The orphan nuclear receptors PXR and CAR have been proposed to play an important role in the detoxification of xeno- and endo-biotics by regulating the expression of detoxifying enzymes and transporters. In this report, we showed that the combined loss of PXR and CAR resulted in a significantly heightened sensitivity to bile  toxicity in a sex-sensitive manner. A regimen of  treatment, which was tolerated by wild-type and PXR null mice, caused a marked accumulation of serum bile acids and histological liver damage as well as an increased hepatic lipid deposition in double knockout males. The increased sensitivity in males was associated with genotype-specific suppression of bile  transporters and loss of bile -mediated downregulation of small heterodimer partner, whereas the transporter suppression was modest or absent in females. The double knockout mice also exhibited gene- and tissue-specific dysregulation of PXR and CAR target genes in response to PXR and CAR agonists.

Animal model studies have shown that diets which are high in omega-6 fatty acids increase  tumor promotion, whereas diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids have no such enhancing effect. The mechanisms by which the high fat content of the diet promotes  carcinogenesis may include the production of secondary bile acids in the  and the modulation of  luminal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase that is involved in generating secondary bile acids, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and mucosal PI-PLC, as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase and protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diets that are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on cecal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC, fecal secondary bile acids, and  mucosal DAG kinase and PKC activities during different stages of  carcinogenesis in male F344 rats. At 5 weeks of age, groups of animals were fed a low-fat diet containing 5% corn oil (LFCO). Beginning at 7 weeks of age, all animals, except those intended as vehicle controls, received azoxymethane (AOM) s.c. once weekly for 2 weeks at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg body weight. Vehicle-treated groups received s.c. injections of normal saline. One day after the second AOM or saline treatment, the experimental groups of animals were transferred to a high-fat diet containing 23.5% corn oil (HFCO) or 20.5% fish oil + 3% corn oil (HFFO). One group continued on the LFCO diet. Animals were sacrificed at weeks 1, 12, and 36 after the AOM or saline treatment.  mucosa were harvested at weeks 1, 12, or 36, and the  tumor tissues were examined for PKC and DAG kinase activities. Contents of the cecum were analyzed for bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC activities. Stool samples collected at week 12 were analyzed for bile acids. High corn oil content of the diet significantly increased the cecal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC activities as compared to the diets with high fish oil or low corn oil content. Animals fed the HFCO diet excreted higher levels of secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic  and , than those fed the LFCO or HFFO diets. Carcinogen treatment significantly enhanced the activities of DAG kinase and total membrane PKC activities in  mucosa compared to saline treatment in all dietary groups. Animals treated with saline or AOM and fed HFCO showed increased levels of DAG kinase and membrane PKC activities in the  mucosa when compared to LFCO and HFFO groups. DAG kinase and membrane PKC activities were higher in  tumors than in the surrounding  mucosa, and also increased levels of these enzyme activities were found in the HFCO diet group. These results indicate that the modifying effect of dietary fat on  bacterial enzymes, secondary bile acids,  mucosal and tumor DAG kinase, and PKC that may play a role in  carcinogenesis depends on the types and amount of fat given. The  tumor-enhancing effect of a HFCO diet in contrast to the high dietary fish oil may be, in part, explained on the basis of its modulating effect on these bacterial and  mucosal enzymes and  secondary bile acids relevant to  tumor promotion.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1314747>Effect of dietary fiber on  bacterial enzymes and bile acids in relation to .</a></h2><p>Because of the potential significance of  bacteria and secondary bile acids in the pathogenesis of , the present study investigated the effect of different types of dietary fiber on fecal bacterial enzymes, namely, beta-glucuronidase, 7 alpha-dehydroxylase, nitroreductase, and azoreductase, and on bile acids and neutral sterols in premenopausal women.

LCA-TMA1 is most hydrophobic with a hard charge causing efficient dehydration and maximum perturbations of membranes thereby facilitating translocation and high cytotoxicity against  cells.

Furthermore, the influence of a major regulatory protein of beta-catenin, the APC tumor suppressor gene, on VDR-dependent inhibition of beta-catenin activity was examined. We report herein that beta-catenin-mediated transcription is most effectively suppressed by the VDR FokI variant F/M4 when 1,25D is limiting. Using Caco-2 colorectal  (CRC) cells, it was observed that VDR ligands, 1,25D and LCA, both suppress beta-catenin transcriptional activity, though 1,25D exhibited significantly greater inhibition. Moreover, 1,25D, but not LCA, suppressed endogenous expression of the beta-catenin target gene DKK-4 independent of VDR DNA-binding activity. These results support beta-catenin sequestration away from endogenous gene targets by 1,25D-VDR. This activity is most efficiently mediated by the FokI gene variant F/M4, a VDR allele previously associated with protection against CRC. Interestingly, we found the inhibition of beta-catenin activity by 1,25D-VDR was significantly enhanced by wild-type APC. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for 1,25D-VDR in APC/beta-catenin cross talk.

Here, we have investigated the involvement of another NR1I member, vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1I1), in ABCB1 expression. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, which abundantly expresses VDR, both 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD3) and  (LCA) increased ABCB1 mRNA levels. Reporter gene assays in LS174T cells with constructs containing various lengths of the ABCB1 regulatory region revealed that the region containing multiple nuclear receptor binding motifs located at -7.8 kilobases [termed nuclear receptor-responsive module (NURREM)], to which PXR and CAR also bind, is essential for the VDR-mediated ABCB1 transactivation. Further reporter assays with constructs containing truncated NURREM and gel shift assays suggested simultaneous binding of multiple VDR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to NURREM. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR expression in LS174T cells blocked the LCA- and the 1,25-VD3-induced transcription of ABCB1 reporter genes.

These results suggest that the NR1I subfamily members regulate the ABCB1 expression sharing the binding sites within NURREM and that the physiologically produced LCA and 1,25-VD3 may modulate the ABCB1 expression in human intestines, possibly associated with interindividual variations of ABCB1 expression.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27908290>Bile : a potential inducer of colon cancer stem cells.</a></h2><p>Although the unconjugated secondary bile acids, specifically deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), are considered to be risk factors for colorectal cancer, the precise mechanism(s) by which they regulate carcinogenesis is poorly understood. We hypothesize that the cytotoxic bile acids may promote stemness in colonic epithelial cells leading to generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that play a role in the development and progression of colon cancer.Normal human colonic epithelial cells (HCoEpiC) were used to study bile  DCA/LCA-mediated induction of CSCs. The expression of CSC markers was measured by real-time qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to isolate CSCs. T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) luciferase assay was employed to examine the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Downregulation of muscarinic 3 receptor (M3R) was achieved through transfection of corresponding siRNA.We found DCA/LCA to induce CSCs in normal human colonic epithelial cells, as evidenced by the increased proportion of CSCs, elevated levels of several CSC markers, as well as a number of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers together with increased colonosphere formation, drug exclusion, ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression, and induction of M3R, p-EGFR, matrix metallopeptidases, and c-Myc. Inhibition of M3R signaling greatly suppressed DCA/LCA induction of the CSC marker ALDHA1 and also c-Myc mRNA expression as well as transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF.Our results suggest that bile acids, specifically DCA and LCA, induce cancer stemness in colonic epithelial cells by modulating M3R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and thus could be considered promoters of colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3920099>Fecal bile  profiles of Japanese patients with adenomatous polyps of the large bowel: special reference to distribution, multiplicity, size and degree of dysplasia of the polyps.</a></h2><p>Bile acids have been implicated in carcinogenesis of the large bowel, and since epidemiological, clinical and histopathological studies suggest a link between adenomatous polyps and  of the large bowel, fecal bile  profiles were studied in 33 patients with adenomatous polyps of the large bowel and these data were analyzed with particular reference to the distribution, multiplicity, size and degree of dysplasia of the polyps. The more polyps and the greater the severity of dysplasia, the higher was the excretion of total bile acids (mean mumol/day: single vs multiple polyps, 344.8 vs 369.1; mild vs moderate vs severe dysplasia, 347.5 vs 370.0 vs 399.3). However, in patients with larger polyps, total fecal bile  excretion tended to be lower (mean mumol/day: large vs small polyps, 267.7 vs 389.5). These differences were not statistically significant. When fecal bile  profiles were analyzed with respect to the extent of bacterial metabolism determined from the degree of dehydroxylation and oxidoreduction, there was a large variation with no consistency in relation to the factors studied among the polyp patients.

Seventy-two healthy individuals consuming high-fat/moderately low-fiber diets were screened for fecal mutagenic activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium/microsomal assay system. Twenty-one of them were found to excrete high levels of mutagens, and 19 of them were recruited for the diet intervention study. All participants provided two 24-h stool specimens and a 4-day food record while consuming their normal (control) diet. They were then asked to consume the control diet plus 10 g of dietary fiber from wheat bran, oat fiber, or cellulose for 5 wk. After each fiber period, they were asked to consume their control diet. At the end of each fiber and control diet period, each subject provided two 24-h stool specimens. Stool samples were analyzed for bile acids and mutagens using the Ames strains TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 (microsomal) activation. The concentrations of fecal secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and 12-ketolithocholic ) and of fecal mutagenic activity in TA98 and TA100 with and without S9 activation were significantly lower during the wheat bran and cellulose supplementation periods. Oat fiber supplementation had no such effect on these fecal constituents. Thus, the increased fiber intake in the form of wheat bran or cellulose may reduce the production and/or excretion of mutagens in the stools and decrease the concentration of fecal secondary bile acids in humans.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1463973>Faecal steroids and colorectal : the effect of lactulose on faecal bacterial metabolism in a continuous culture model of the large intestine.</a></h2><p>The effect of lactulose on intestinal bacterial metabolism in two identical single-stage chemostats has been studied. The study was designed as a single stage crossover. Both cultures were inoculated and treated in an identical manner except that whilst one fermenter was subject to pH control the other was not and vice versa. Complex bacterial populations were maintained for 23 days and many of the metabolic functions carried out by the micro-organisms in vivo were demonstrated in vitro. The predominant organisms belonged to the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium with abundant levels of anaerobic Gram-positive rods. The redox potential in each fermenter showed considerable variation with maximum values of below -300 eV being attained. An indication of the stability of the bacterial communities was the production of short-chain volatile fatty acids; during steady-state conditions the mean ratio of the major acids acetic, propionic and butyric being 3.90:0.69:1.00 and 3.65:0.76:1.00 in each fermenter, respectively. During steady-state conditions, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  was maintained at a constant rate with  representing over 85% of total steroid. Addition of the soluble fibre lactulose to the cultures had a profound effect on many of the parameters tested. Without pH control the culture pH dropped to below 5.0 and this coincided with a substantial decrease in total anaerobes, especially Bacteroides spp., an increase in Lactobacillus spp. (concomitant with an increase in lactic ), a decrease in the concentration of short-chain volatile fatty acids and a substantial decrease in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic . These results show that it is possible to maintain viable intestinal bacteria in vitro using a continuous culture chemostat and that the cultures respond to changing conditions as evinced by the inhibition of 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  on addition of lactulose. This indicates that the model may be of further use in studying the modulation of secondary bile  formation, a possible risk factor in colorectal carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/861940>Effect of type and amount of dietary fat and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine on biliary bile acids, fecal bile acids, and neutral sterols in rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of type (corn oil or lard) and quantity (5 or 20%) of dietary fat and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) on the composition of biliary bile acids, fecal bile acids, and neutral sterols was studied in rats exposed to a given regimen for two generations prior to s.c. treatment with DMH for 20 weeks.

Rats were fed one of four diets: a basal diet (a modified AIN-93G diet), a low-concentration dried plum diet (LCDP, 4.75% dried plum powder), a high-concentration dried plum diet (HCDP, 9.5% dried plum powder), or a diet matched to the carbohydrate content of the HCDP diet (CH-M) for 10 days.

CPC;Apc mice that spontaneously develop colonic adenomas were treated with free rapamycin, plain rapamycin micelles, and peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles via intraperitoneal injection for 35days. Endoscopy was performed to monitor adenoma regression in vivo. We observed complete adenoma regression at the end of therapy. The mean regression rate for peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles was significantly greater than that for plain rapamycin micelles, P<0.01. On immunohistochemistry, we observed a significant reduction in phospho-S6 but not β-catenin expression and reduced tumor cell proliferation, suggesting greater inhibition of downstream mTOR signaling. We observed significantly reduced renal toxicity for peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles compared to that of free drug, and no other toxicities were found on chemistries. Together, this unique targeted micelle represents a potential therapeutic for colorectal neoplasia with comparable therapeutic efficacy to rapamycin free drug and significantly less systemic toxicity.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The major bile acids detected in fecal extracts were  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA). The major sterol of animal origin was cholesterol and its bacterial metabolite coprostanol, whereas the major plant sterols were beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, and their corresponding bacterial metabolites. CRC patients excreted higher amounts of total major bile acids (LCA and DCA) than did the control group, but this difference was not significant. However, the LCA-to-DCA ratio was much higher in the CRC group [(1.43, p less than 0.01) compared with the control group (0.72)]. The control group excreted significantly higher amounts of total neutral sterols (p less than 0.001), sterols of animal origin (p less than 0.001), and plant sterols (p less than 0.001) compared with the CRC group; the plant sterols represented a much lower proportion of excreted total neutral sterols in the CRC group (p greater than 0.001) compared with the control group. We propose the following hypotheses. The LCA-to-DCA ratio may be an important discriminant market for CRC susceptibility. The fecal LCA-to-DCA ratio may depend on the differential hepatic synthesis of their respective precursors chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and cholic .

This study tested the effects of physiological levels of phenol, ammonia, primary bile acids (cholic , CA, and chenodeoxycholic , CDCA), and secondary bile acids (, LCA, and deoxycholic , DCA) on paracellular permeability using a Caco-2 cell model. Paracellular permeability of Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the apical to basolateral flux of [14C]-mannitol. Secondary, but not primary, bile acids increased permeability as reflected by significantly decreased TER and increased mannitol flux. Both phenol and ammonia also increased permeability. The primary bile  CA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas CDCA had no significant effect on occludin expression as compared to the negative control. The secondary bile acids DCA and LCA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas phenol had no significant effect on the protein expression as compared to the negative control. This suggests that the increased permeability observed with LCA, DCA, phenol, and ammonia was not related to an effect on occludin expression.

During consumption of rye bread, the total mean concentration of fecal free bile acids was 4.77 +/- 0.90 mumol/g of dry feces (mean +/- SEM), which was much lower than with the normal omnivorous diet (8.05 +/- 1.56 mumol/g) or during administration of the low-fiber wheat bread (8.83 +/- 1.56 mumol/g) or the whole-meal wheat bread (7.88 +/- 1.34 mumol/g) (P less than 0.05). This decrease was mainly caused by increased proportions of saponifiable bile acids (P less than 0.01). During intake of the whole-grain rye bread, 46% +/- 3% of the fecal bile acids were in their saponifiable forms; this percentage was 30% +/- 3% during the control period, 30% +/- 4% during the low-fiber wheat bread period, and 27% +/- 4% during the whole-meal wheat bread period. It is concluded that the type of bread significantly effects concentrations of cocarcinogenic and comutagenic free  and deoxycholic acids by changing modes of conjugation in the gut.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4427390>Promoting effect of bile acids on  carcinogenesis after intrarectal instillation of N-methyl-N\'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in rats.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9145454>Faecal steroids and colorectal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  is a major disease of Western civilizations and diet may account for approximately 35% of cases. Epidemiologic studies reveal that the major dietary constituents implicated in the disease process are fat/red meat (causative) and fibre (protective). From this standpoint, toxicologists have evaluated a plethora of dietary and intestinal biochemical characteristics and steroids; the bile acids especially have received a great deal of attention. Formerly, bile acids and their bacterial metabolites were implicated, as either mutagens and/or carcinogens, but this was not proven. In recent times, based mainly on animal model systems, opinion favours that if bile acids and their metabolites have a role to play in  carcinogenesis, they act at the promotion stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence-the secondary bile acids deoxycholic and  acids being of major importance here. From this standpoint, studies have been designed either to lower total bile  concentration or at least to reduce dehydroxylation of the primary bile acids via high fibre dietary regimes.The prebiotics lactulose and lactitol (non-digestible dietary fibres) appear to have potential here, and so the effect of lactulose on fermentation by intestinal bacteria in a continuous culture model of the human  was studied. Lactulose reduced dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  to the potentially toxic secondary bile   by over 90%. By contrast, lactitol, a reduced equivalent of lactulose, had little effect on 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids in the rectosigmoid  of the miniature pig and in human faeces, but caused a significant decrease in steroid concentration, especially bile acids in human faeces.If secondary steroid metabolites have a role to play in colorectal carcinogenesis, then dietary supplementation with prebiotics may be ameliorative in high-risk groups.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3197978>Effect of high fat consumption on cell proliferation activity of colorectal mucosa and on soluble faecal bile acids.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of fat consumption on the proliferation of the rectal mucosa, 30 normal volunteers (22 to 71 years) were randomly allocated to three groups: (a) basal low fat diet containing 30 g of fat per day; (b) the basal diet with doses of 30 g corn oil taken with each of the three meals: 120 g fat/day; (c) the basal diet with one dose of 90 g corn oil after the last meal: 120 g fat/day.

The accumulation of the primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ) in the gallbladder reduces the formation of the secondary bile acids (deoxycholic  and ), thus diminishing their concentration in the so-called gallbladder-independent enterohepatic circulation and protecting the liver, the stomach mucosa, the gallbladder, and the  from their toxic hydrophobic effects. The presence or absence of the gallbladder in mammals is a determining factor in the synthesis of hydrophobic or hydrophilic bile acids. Because the gallbladder contracts 5-20 min after food is in the stomach and the "gastric chyme" moves from the stomach to the duodenum 1-3 h later, the function of the gallbladder bile in digestion may be insignificant.

PC/AA/C1, PCmsrc, and HCT-8/E11 cells and kidney MDCKT23 cells were seeded on top of collagen type I gels and invasive cells were counted after 24 h incubation. Activation of the Rac1 and RhoA small GTPases was investigated by pull-down assays. Haptotaxis was analysed with modified Boyden chambers. , chenodeoxycholic , cholic  and deoxycholic  stimulated cellular invasion of SRC- and RhoA-transformed PCmsrc and MDCKT23-RhoAV14 cells, and of HCT-8/E11 cells originating from a sporadic tumor, but were ineffective in premalignant PC/AA/C1 and MDCKT23 cells. Bile -stimulated invasion occurred through stimulation of haptotaxis and was dependent on the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway and signaling cascades using protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and cyclooxygenase-2. Accordingly, BA-induced invasion was associated with activation of the Rac1 and RhoA GTPases and expression of the farnesoid X receptor.

We examined the fecal bile acids in rats with polyps and compared them with fecal bile acids in control rats and also determined the bile  composition in fecal aqueous phase, which is in direct contact with the  epithelium and may be physiologically more active. Treatment with azoxymethane did not significantly alter fecal bile  composition in the rats. Cholic  feeding resulted in greatly increased proportions of DCA (82% of total bile acids versus 18% in control rats). On the other hand, UDCA feeding significantly reduced the proportion of fecal DCA (2% in control rats fed UDCA and 3% in rats also treated with azoxymethane). In control rats, 96% of the bile acids were present in the water-insoluble fraction and 4% in the water-soluble fraction. The major insoluble bile acids included DCA and hyodeoxycholic  (73% of total bile acids). In contrast, the muricholic acids were concentrated in the soluble fraction (37%). When 0.4% UDCA was added to the diet,  increased in the insoluble fraction (40 versus 1%), but the hydrophilic UDCA and muricholic acids were enriched in the water-soluble fraction (37 and 43%, respectively). Thus, the hydrophobic bile acids were distributed predominantly in the water-insoluble fraction, whereas the hydrophilic bile acids were distributed preferentially in the water-soluble fraction.

After termination of the incubation with LCA, the DNA alteration observed with DNA elution disappeared very rapidly both in intact cells and nuclei, even when the incubation buffer was totally unsuitable for the repair of the type of DNA damage induced by typical genotoxic agents. The effect of LCA on DNA was apparently not mediated through an inhibition of topoisomerase II.

In each 1-week period, the habitual diet was recorded, and urine and feces were collected for 1 and 3 days, respectively. Milk calcium significantly increased fecal pH and fecal excretion of phosphate (132%), total fat (139%), free fatty acids (195%), and bile acids (141%), indicating intestinal complexation. In fecal water, the concentrations of long-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids (deoxycholic and ), neutral sterols, and phospholipids were about halved (P <0.05). Consistent with these changes in soluble hydrophobic surfactants, calcium decreased the cytotoxicity of fecal water from 68 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 12% (P < 0.005). Calcium in milk products precipitates luminal cytotoxic surfactants and thus inhibits  cytotoxicity. Therefore, habitual dietary calcium may contribute to a nutritional modulation of  risk.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9770718>Comparative effects of secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and  acids, on aberrant crypt foci growth in the postinitiation phases of  carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of deoxycholic (DCA) and  (LCA) acids on the postinitiation phases of .

Two weeks after the second azoxymethane injection, 10 animals were killed and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were enumerated. The remaining animals were randomly assigned to four diet groups: 1) CON, 2) DCA, 3) LCA, and 4) high fat (HF, a positive control group). Bile  diets consisted of 0.2% by weight DCA or LCA; HF diets consisted of 20% fat (5% soybean oil + 15% beef tallow by weight). Animals were killed at Weeks 3, 12, and 20 (from 1st carcinogen injection), and number and growth features of ACF and adenomatous lesions were enumerated in the . At Week 12, ACF number and small, medium, and large (1-3, 4-6, and > or = 7 crypts/focus, respectively) ACF were higher in the HF group than in the DCA, LCA, and CON groups (p < or = 0.05). By Week 20, ACF number and small, medium, and large ACF were similar in the LCA and HF groups, whereas the response was similar in the DCA and CON groups. Average crypt multiplicity was higher in the HF and LCA groups than in the DCA and CON groups (p < or = 0.05). Microadenoma (MA) incidence was higher in the HF group than in the CON and LCA groups (p < or = 0.05). Regional distribution patterns for ACF number were similar to MA and tumor distribution patterns within the CON, DCA, and HF groups. In the LCA group, ACF number and MA showed a proximal predominance in regional distribution, whereas tumors showed a distal predominance.

Dietary factors have been shown to influence colorectal  risk and to modulate both fecal mutagenicity and fecapentaene concentrations. Therefore, in this study, excretion of fecapentaenes is determined in humans consuming either vegetarian or omnivorous diets. The results show that the most predominant fecapentaene forms are excreted in higher concentrations by vegetarians. Consumption of cereal fiber, calcium and carotene as well as fecal concentrations of iso- were found to correlate positively with excreted concentrations of one or more fecapentaene analogues. On average, 22% of excreted fecapentaene concentrations was found to be related to nutrient intake in stepwise regression models. Dietary calcium intake was found to be the most significant factor positively correlating with excreted fecapentaene concentrations. Intake of mono-unsaturated fatty acids or fiber from vegetables and fruit could be shown to correlate with fecapentaene excretion to a lesser degree. Despite high fecapentaene concentrations in fecal dichloromethane extracts, only 1 out of 20 samples revealed significant mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100. Further, aqueous extracts of feces from omnivores appeared to be equally mutagenic as feces from vegetarians and contained non-detectable concentrations of fecapentaenes. It is concluded that dietary factors do affect excreted fecapentaene levels, but only to a relatively minor extent. Since vegetarians at low risk for colorectal  excrete higher concentrations of fecapentaenes, it could be hypothesized that relatively increased fecapentaene excretion in combination with antimutagenic compounds in feces represents  prevention.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16139803>Bile -induced proliferation of a human  cell line is mediated by transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors.</a></h2><p>Although epidemiological studies indicate an association between elevations in fecal bile acids and the development of colorectal , the cellular mechanism for the proliferative actions of bile acids is not clear. Studies from other laboratories indicate a paradoxical pro-apoptotic action of bile acids on cell culture lines. Our previous studies indicate that cholinergic agonist-induced proliferation of  cells that express M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R) is mediated by transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and that bile acids stimulate proliferation of  cells that express M3R. In the present study, we investigated the effects of bile acids on cell signaling and proliferation of a human  cell line (H508 cells) that abundantly expresses M3R and EGFR. Treatment with taurine and glycine conjugates of  and deoxycholic acids stimulated reversible activation of the p44/42 MAP kinase signaling cascade and proliferation of H508 cells. Bile acids did not stimulate proliferation of SNU-C4  cells that express EGFR but not muscarinic receptors. Atropine, a muscarinic receptor inverse agonist, blocked bile -induced H508 cell proliferation. At concentrations that stimulate cell proliferation, conjugated bile acids did not activate caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis. Conjugated bile acids stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992, thereby implicating EGFR transactivation in the cellular mechanism underlying their proliferative actions. This was confirmed by observing that inhibitors of EGFR activation and antibodies to the ligand-binding domain of EGFR blocked both the signaling and proliferative actions of bile acids. Collectively, these results suggest that in this  cell line, bile -induced  cell proliferation is M3R-dependent and is mediated by transactivation of EGFR.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6872797>Role of bile acids and neutral sterols in familial  syndromes of the .</a></h2><p>Cholesterol is quantitatively the most significant sterol in mammalian tissues.

Total fecal bile acids in the rats given bile salts showed about 2-fold increase compared with those without bile salts. Fecal bile  profiles between the LCNa and SLCNa groups were indistinguishable except for a slight increase of sulfolithocholic  in the SLCNa groups. These results indicated that p.o. administration of SLCNa but not LCNa promoted MNU-induced  tumorigenesis in conventional rats.

Therefore, we hypothesize that LCA acts like 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) to drive anti-inflammatory signals. In present study, we used human   cells to assess the role of LCA in regulation of the pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB pathway. We found that LCA treatment increased VDR levels, mimicking the effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). LCA pretreatment inhibited the IL-1beta-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and decreased the NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation. We also measured the production of IL-8, a well-known NF-kappaB target gene, as a read-out of the biological effect of LCA expression on NF-kappaB pathway. LCA significantly decreased IL-8 secretion induced by IL-1beta. These LCA-induced effects were very similar to those of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3.) Thus, LCA recapitulated the effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-1beta stimulated cells. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lacking VDR have intrinsically high NF-kappaB activity. LCA pretreatment was not able to prevent TNFalpha-induced IkappaBalpha degradation in MEF VDR (-/-), whereas LCA stabilized IkappaBalpha in MEF VDR (+/-) cells.

Recently, the secondary bile , lithocholate (LCA), was recognized as a novel VDR ligand. Using reporter gene and mammalian two-hybrid systems, immunoblotting, competitive ligand displacement and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified curcumin (CM), a turmeric-derived bioactive polyphenol, as a likely additional novel ligand for VDR. CM (10(-5) M) activated transcription of a luciferase plasmid containing the distal vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) from the human CYP3A4 gene at levels comparable to 1,25D (10(-8) M) in transfected human  cells (Caco-2). While CM also activated transcription via a retinoid X receptor (RXR) responsive element, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by CM was negligible. Competition binding assays with radiolabeled 1,25D confirmed that CM binds directly to VDR. In mammalian two-hybrid assays employing transfected Caco-2 cells, CM (10(-5) M) increased the ability of VDR to recruit its heterodimeric partner, RXR, and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). Real-time PCR studies revealed that CM-bound VDR can activate VDR target genes CYP3A4, CYP24, p21 and TRPV6 in Caco-2 cells. Numerous studies have shown chemoprotection by CM against intestinal cancers via a variety of mechanisms. Small intestine and  are important VDR-expressing tissues where 1,25D has known anticancer properties that may, in part, be elicited by activation of CYP-mediated xenobiotic detoxification and/or up-regulation of the tumor suppressor p21.

To study the biological implications of this modification, CaCo-2 cells were incubated with either LA or sulphated  (3-sulpholithocholic , SLA), and in some experiments with taurine-conjugated . Increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) correlates with transformation of  epithelial cells. When CaCo-2 cells were incubated with LA, the secretion of MMP-2 was found to increase approx. 60% when analysed by gelatin zymography, and 80% when analysed by Western blotting. SLA, in contrast, did not affect the level of MMP-2 secretion, and after zymography the level of enzyme activity was 78% of control values after 18 h incubation. The secretion of MMPs is linked to increased cellular invasion and, in tumours, to increased capacity for metastasis. The ability of CaCo-2 cells to invade in a chamber assay was stimulated after exposure to LA, whereas SLA-treated cells did not differ from control cells.

Understanding the mechanisms of bile  toxicity and apoptosis, which could include nonspecific detergent effects and/or specific receptor activation, has potential therapeutic significance. In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of  (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic  (ent-CDCA), and deoxycholic  (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile -induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive oxygen species compared with ent-LCA. This suggests that LCA/ent-LCA induce apoptosis enantioselectively through CD95 activation, likely because of increased reactive oxygen species generation, with resulting procaspase-8 cleavage.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10527930>Sulphation of  in the -carcinoma cell line CaCo-2.</a></h2><p>High levels of bile acids in the  may correlate with an increased risk of , but the underlying mechanisms are not known.

For example, murine knock-out approaches have revealed a role for the VDR in controlling mammary gland growth and function. These actions appear widespread, as the enzymes responsible for 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol generation and degradation, and the VDR itself, are all functionally present in a wide range of epithelial and haematopoietic cell types.

Furthermore, the recent identification of bile   as a VDR ligand underscores the environmental sensing role for the VDR. In vitro and in vivo dissection of VDR signalling in cancers (e.g. breast, prostate and ) supports a role for targeting the VDR in either chemoprevention or chemotherapy settings.

A newly recognized VDR ligand is the carcinogenic bile ,  (LCA).

We also show that LCA-VDR stimulates transcription of gene reporter constructs containing DR3 and ER6 vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) from the human CYP3A4 gene. Utilizing gel mobility shift, pulldown, and mammalian two-hybrid assays, we observe that: (i) 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhances retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimerization with VDR more effectively than LCA, (ii) the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-liganded VDR-RXR heterodimer recruits full-length SRC-1 coactivator, whereas this interaction is minimal with LCA unless LXXLL-containing fragments of SRC-1 are employed, and (iii) both 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and LCA enhance the binding of VDR to DRIP205/mediator, but unlike 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-VDR, LCA-VDR does not interact detectably with NCoA-62 or TRIP1/SUG1, suggesting a different pattern of LCA-VDR comodulator association.

Thi was achieved by fitting simple gut cannulas in the terminal ileum, caecum and mid- of three Landrace x large white boars, which enabled convenient collection of digesta and faecal samples at defined time points. Biochemical analyses showed that the neutral steroid profile of the pig is similar to that of man, dominated by cholesterol and its bacterial metabolite coprostanol. In contrast, pigs consuming a normal diet excrete appreciably lower quantities of neutral sterols in faeces. The major primary bile acids detected were the glycine and taurine amidates of hyocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which were rapidly converted to the free bile acids and subsequently dehydroxylated to hyodeoxycholic and  acids respectively, in the terminal ileum and caecum. Bacterial deconjugation and 7 alpha-dehyrdoxylation are virtually complete in the caecum with negligible further metabolism in the  and faeces. On a wet weight basis the concentration of both neutral and  steroids was shown to increase aborally. Inclusion of dietary fibre in the form of cellulose (Solka floc) and guar gum reduced steroid concentration considerably at all sites of the large intestine, which is consistent with their stool bulking effects. In conclusion, this study shows that intestinal steroid metabolism in the pig is similar to that in man despite slightly different bile  profiles and, therefore, the multicannulated pig may serve as a useful model of man in chemoprevention studies of colorectal .</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9914784>, a putative tumor promoter, inhibits mammalian DNA polymerase beta.</a></h2><p> (LCA), one of the major components in secondary bile acids, promotes carcinogenesis in rat  epithelial cells induced by N-methyl-N\'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which methylates DNA. Base-excision repair of DNA lesions caused by the DNA methylating agents requires DNA polymerase beta (pol beta). In the present study, we examined 17 kinds of bile acids with respect to inhibition of mammalian DNA polymerases in vitro. Among them, only LCA and its derivatives inhibited DNA polymerases, while other bile acids were not inhibitory. Among eukaryotic DNA polymerases alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and gamma, pol beta was the most sensitive to inhibition by LCA. The inhibition mode of pol beta was non-competitive with respect to the DNA template-primer and was competitive with the substrate, dTTP, with the Ki value of 10 microM. Chemical structures at the C-7 and C-12 positions in the sterol skeleton are important for the inhibitory activity of LCA.

To uncover the mechanism by which BAs exert carcinogenic effects, both human liver and  cells as well as mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with BAs and assayed for viability, genotoxic stress, and transcriptional response. BAs induced both Nur77 (NR4A1) and proinflammatory gene expression. The intracellular location of BA-induced Nur77 was time dependent; short-term (1-3 hours) exposure induced nuclear Nur77, whereas longer (1-2 days) exposure also increased cytosolic Nur77 expression and apoptosis. Inhibiting Nur77 nuclear export with leptomycin B decreased  (LCA)-induced apoptosis. Extended (7 days) treatment with BA generated resistance to BA with increased nuclear Nur77, viability, and mobility. While, knockdown of Nur77 in BA-resistant cells increased cellular susceptibility to LCA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo mouse xenograft experiments demonstrated that BA-resistant cells form larger tumors with elevated Nur77 expression compared with parental controls. DNA-binding and gene expression assays identified multiple survival genes (CDK4, CCND2, MAP4K5, STAT5A, and RBBP8) and a proapoptosis gene (BID) as Nur77 targets.

This hypothesis was tested using stool samples of a subset of participants enrolled in a Phase III colorectal adenomatous polyp prevention trial, which documented the inability of a 13.5 g/day wheat bran fiber (WBF) supplement to reduce polyp recurrence. Stool was collected from 68 consecutively consented participants who were enrolled in a Phase III clinical trial of WBF for the prevention of adenomatous polyp recurrence. Nineteen (27.9%) of these fecal bile  substudy participants were on the low fiber (2.0 g/day) intervention group, whereas 49 (72.7%) were on the high fiber (13.5 g/day) intervention group for approximately 3 years. Sixty-four participants had both the aqueous and solid phases of stool samples analyzed for bile  content. Bile  concentrations, measured in microg/ml for fecal water and microg/mg for dry feces, were determined for lithochilic, deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, cholic, ursodeoxycholic, isodeoxycholic, isoursodeoxycholic, ursocholic, 7-ketolithocholic, and 12-ketolithocholic acids. There were no significant differences between the low and high fiber groups concerning mean or median aqueous phase concentrations of  or deoxycholic bile acids.

These results document that a high WBF intervention, taken for a median of 2.4 years, does not significantly reduce aqueous-phase concentrations of secondary bile acids in stool, although their concentrations in solid-phase stool were suppressed. Thus, the inability of the high WBF intervention to reduce colorectal adenoma recurrence may be a consequence of its lack of effect on fecal aqueous-phase secondary bile  concentrations.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8461867>Sulphated bile  per se inhibits  carcinogenesis in mice.</a></h2><p>Peroral sulpholithocholic  (SLC) promoted  tumorigenesis in conventional rats.

Among the dietary components found to reduce  risk are high intakes of dietary fiber and calcium.We designed and conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving supplementation of the customary dietary intake with fiber and calcium and measurements of fecal bile acids to examine the potential mechanisms by which added dietary interventions might reduce colorectal  risk.In a randomized, double-blinded, phase II study, we used a factorial design to measure the effects of dietary wheat bran fiber (2.0 or 13.5 g/day) in the form of cereal and supplemental calcium carbonate (250 or 1500 mg/day elemental calcium) taken as a tablet on fecal bile  concentrations and excretion rates. Measurements were made at base-line randomization (i.e., after a 3-month placebo run-in period using 2.0 g wheat bran fiber plus 250 mg calcium carbonate) and after 3 and 9 months on treatment in a randomly selected 52-patient subsample of the 95 fully assessable study participants who had a history of  adenoma resection. Concentrations of fecal bile acids, total, primary (i.e., chenodeoxycholic and cholic), and secondary (i.e., deoxycholic, , and ursodeoxycholic), were measured in 72-hour stool samples by gas-liquid chromatography. All P values resulted from two-sided tests.All geometric mean fecal bile  concentrations and excretion rates were lower at 9 months than at 0 months or 3 months on treatment in the high-dose fiber, high-dose calcium, and high-dose fiber/high-dose calcium treatment groups. The high-dose fiber effect at 9 months of supplementation was statistically significant with respect to virtually all geometric mean fecal bile  concentrations and excretion rates. For example at 9 months versus 0 months, high-dose fiber supplementation caused a reduction in fecal concentrations of total bile acids (52% reduction; P = .001) and deoxycholic  (48% reduction; P = .003). High-dose calcium supplementation also had a significant, but lower, effect at 9 months versus 0 months on the geometric mean total bile  (35% reduction; P = .044) and deoxycholic fecal bile  (36% reduction; P = .052) concentrations.High-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplements given for 9 months are associated with statistically significant reductions in both total and secondary fecal bile  concentrations and excretion rates in patients with resected  adenomas.

The principal agents are the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic acids, the vitamin K group and ferrous iron complexes. These metabolites may interact to subvert the normal free radical generating mechanisms involved in mucosal defence. Diets high in fat and red meat and low in fibre support a Bacteroides-dominated  microflora, which both synthesis and utilises vitamin K2 isoprenalogues or menaquinones as enzyme co-factors. Iron(II) complexes such as haemin from the breakdown of dietary haemoglobin and myoglobin also serve as growth factors for these bacteria and provide a rich source of haem-iron for intestinal uptake. Biliary secretion is stimulated by dietary fat and bile acids are essential for the intestinal uptake of vitamin K and possibly of iron complexes such as haemin. In the mature colonocyte, vitamin K and haemin may initiate redox cycling reactions which liberate superoxide (O2-.). Bile acids can activate the membrane bound phospholipase to liberate arachidonate and diacylglycerol. This leads in turn to the production of more O2-. which can enter the microcirculation and acts as a potent chemoattractant for the neutrophils that line the lamina propria. The released diacylglycerol can activate protein kinase C in the neutrophil membrane to switch on the respiratory burst oxidase system generating yet more O2-. and may stimulate the proliferation of transformed stem cells by a similar protein kinase C mediated mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24343899>Intestinal CYP3A4 protects against -induced hepatotoxicity in intestine-specific VDR-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates vitamin D signaling involved in bone metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, cardiovascular function, and bile  regulation. Mice with an intestine-specific disruption of VDR (Vdr(ΔIEpC)) have abnormal body size,  structure, and imbalance of bile  metabolism.  (LCA), a secondary bile  that activates VDR, is among the most toxic of the bile acids that when overaccumulated in the liver causes hepatotoxicity.

The CYP3A4 gene was inserted into Vdr(ΔIEpC) mice to produce the Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 line. LCA was administered to control, transgenic-CYP3A4, Vdr(ΔIEpC), and Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 mice, and hepatic toxicity and bile  levels in the liver, intestine, bile, and urine were measured. VDR deficiency in the intestine of the Vdr(ΔIEpC) mice exacerbates LCA-induced hepatotoxicity manifested by increased necrosis and inflammation, due in part to over-accumulation of hepatic bile acids including taurocholic  and taurodeoxycholic . Intestinal expression of CYP3A4 in the Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 mouse line reduces LCA-induced hepatotoxicity through elevation of LCA metabolism and detoxification, and suppression of bile  transporter expression in the small intestine.

The induction of beta-galactosidase activity, when the organism is exposed to genotoxic agents, is an indirect measure of the genotoxic activity of the test compound. Incubation of E. coli PQ37 with either 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO) or one of the fecal mutagens, fecapentaene-12 or -14 (F-12 or F-14) in the presence of sodium taurocholate or sodium deoxycholate resulted in a significant enhancement of induction of beta-galactosidase activity. The molecular mechanisms of 4-NQO-induced mutagenesis in E. coli are similar to those of the effects of UV light in which both replication-dependent and repair-dependent pathways of mutagenesis exist. Since E. coli PQ37 is excision-repair-deficient, alternate pathways are involved in this system.

The results suggest that the deconjugated bile salts deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate (which are formed following bacterial colonization of the upper gastrointestinal tract in the absence of gastric ), the conjugated bile salt taurodeoxycholate, and the proteolytic enzyme trypsin may have significant roles in the pathogenesis of alkaline reflux esophagitis.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589376> and  characterization of  bile  transformations.</a></h2><p>The human gut hosts trillions of microorganisms that exert a profound influence on human biology. Gut bacteria communicate with their host by secreting small molecules that can signal to distant organs in the body. Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut . Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids. The latter represents a major fraction of the secondary bile  pool. The microbiology of this group of gut microorganisms is understudied and warrants more attention. Here, we detail the bile  transformations carried out by the 7-dehydroxylating bacterium  and  exhibits not only 7α-dehydroxylating capabilities but also, the ability to oxidize other hydroxyl groups and reduce ketone groups in primary and secondary bile acids. This study revealed 12-oxolithocholic  as a major transient product in the 7α-dehydroxylation of cholic . Furthermore, the  study included complementing a gnotobiotic mouse line (devoid of the ability to 7-dehydroxylate bile acids) with  and investigating its colonization dynamics and bile  transformations. Using NanoSIMS (Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), we demonstrate that the large intestine constitutes a niche for , where it efficiently 7-dehydroxylates cholic  to deoxycholic . Overall, this work reveals a novel transient species during 7-dehydroxylation as well as provides direct evidence for the colonization and growth of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria in the large intestine.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis.

However, the factors involved in C. albicans gastrointestinal (GI)  remain unclear. We hypothesize that secondary bile acids have direct antifungal activity against C. albicans and may play a critical role in maintaining GI  resistance against C. albicans. In this study, we investigated the effect of secondary bile acids including  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) on C. albicans growth and morphogenesis. Results indicate that LCA and DCA at in vivo cecal micelle concentrations inhibit C. albicans growth in vitro. Interestingly, LCA and DCA also significantly inhibited the germ tube, hyphae and biofilm formation in C. albicans. In addition, pre-treatment of C. albicans with LCA and DCA significantly reduced the percentage of C. albicans cells attached to a colon cancer cell line.

The aim of this study was to use microbial metabolic product bile acids to reduce C. jejuni chicken colonization. Broiler chicks were fed with deoxycholic  (DCA),  (LCA), or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). The birds were also transplanted with DCA modulated anaerobes (DCA-Anaero) or aerobes (DCA-Aero). The birds were infected with human clinical isolate C. jejuni 81-176 or chicken isolate C. jejuni AR101. Notably, C. jejuni 81-176 was readily colonized intestinal tract at d16 and reached an almost plateau at d21. Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal colonization below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28.

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants.

The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM.

We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

(LCA), one of the four main bile acids in the human body, possesses a high albumin binding rate. We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, body weight, blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice.

In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5.

In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by  (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic characteristics were dramatically enhanced, that is, absorption was delayed and elimination half-life was increased (1.6+/-0.4 and 9.7+/-1.4h by exendin-4 and LCA-M1, respectively). The enhanced long-acting characteristics of the derivative was found to be due to albumin binding and nanoparticle formation, and these were verified by the restoration of normoglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice after single injection (>24h, >10 nmol/kg, s.c.) and daily injections (15 nmol/kg/day) maintained normoglycemia for the 4-week administration period. Furthermore, antidiabetic potentials, such as, glucose clearance kinetics and percentage areas occupied by pancreatic beta-cells were also enhanced by long-term LCA-M1 administration. The present study demonstrates that the derivatization of exendin-4 with LCA offers a possible means of producing a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TGR5 is shown to express in hearts, but its functional role in diabetes-induced cardiac hypertrophy remained unclear. The current study investigated the role of TGR5 on high glucose-induced hypertrophy of H9C2 cells. After incubation with a high level of glucose, H9C2 cells showed hypertrophic responses. Activation of TGR5 by  (LCA) ameliorated cell hypertrophy and enhanced SERCA2a and phosphorylated phospholamban (PLN) expression in H9C2 cells. Triamterene inhibited these effects at an effective dose to block TGR5. However, LCA failed to modify the free radical elevation induced by high-glucose in the H9c2 cells. Moreover, PKA inhibitors, but not an Epac blocker, markedly improved hyperglycemia-induced hypertrophy and attenuated the increased SERCA2a expression by LCA; it also attenuated the phosphorylated PLN and SERCA2a protein expression levels in high glucose-treated H9C2 cells. In conclusion, TGR5 activation stimulated protein kinase A (PKA) to enhance PLN phosphorylation, which activated SERCA2a to remove Ca from cytosol to sarcoplasmic reticulum in addition to the reduction of calcineurin/NFAT pathway signaling to ameliorate the hyperglycemia-induced cardiac hypertrophy shown in cardiomyocytes.

This study tested whether increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression prevents dedifferentiation of β cells in a high-glucose state in vitro. Culturing a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) in a high-glucose environment decreased VDR expression. However, increased VDR following vitamin D3 (VD3) treatment improved insulin release of early-passage MIN6 and insulin index of db/- (heterozygous) islets to levels seen in normal functional islets. Treatment with VD3, its analogues and derivatives also increased the expression of essential transcription factors, such as Pdx1, MafA and VDR itself, ultimately increasing expression of Ins1 and Ins2, which might protect β cells against dedifferentiation. VD3 agonist  (LCA) propionate was the most potent candidate molecule for protecting against dedifferentiation, and an e-pharmacophore mapping model confirmed that LCA propionate exhibits a stabilizing conformation within the VDR binding site.

When occupied by 1,25D, VDR interacts with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimer that binds to vitamin D responsive elements in the region of genes directly controlled by 1,25D. By recruiting complexes of either coactivators or corepressors, ligand-activated VDR-RXR modulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins that promulgate the traditional functions of vitamin D, including signaling intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption to effect skeletal and calcium homeostasis. Thus, vitamin D action in a particular cell depends upon the metabolic production or delivery of sufficient concentrations of the 1,25D ligand, expression of adequate VDR and RXR coreceptor proteins, and cell-specific programming of transcriptional responses to regulate select genes that encode proteins that function in mediating the effects of vitamin D. For example, 1,25D induces RANKL, SPP1 (osteopontin), and BGP (osteocalcin) to govern bone mineral remodeling; TRPV6, CaBP(9k), and claudin 2 to promote intestinal calcium absorption; and TRPV5, klotho, and Npt2c to regulate renal calcium and phosphate reabsorption.

The steroidal core of BAs constitutes a saturated cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene skeleton, consisting of three six-membered (A, B, and C) and one five-membered ring (D).

After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM). In conclusion, extracts of clove, allspice, and aromatic ginger activate TGR5, which might play a pivotal role in their therapeutic use for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Moreover, the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to TTAs.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013964> Workflow for the Discovery of Natural Products Activating the G Protein-Coupled Bile  Receptor 1.</a></h2><p>The G protein-coupled bile  receptor (GPBAR1) has been recognized as a promising new target for the treatment of diverse diseases, including , type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. The identification of novel and potent GPBAR1 agonists is highly relevant, as these diseases are on the rise and pharmacological unmet therapeutic needs are pervasive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a proficient workflow for the  prediction of GPBAR1 activating compounds, primarily from natural sources. A protocol was set up, starting with a comprehensive collection of structural information of known ligands. This information was used to generate ligand-based pharmacophore models in LigandScout 4.08 Advanced. After theoretical validation, the two most promising models, namely BAMS22 and TTM8, were employed as queries for the virtual screening of natural product and synthetic small molecule databases. Virtual hits were progressed to shape matching experiments and physicochemical clustering. Out of 33 diverse virtual hits subjected to experimental testing using a reporter gene-based assay, two natural products, farnesiferol B () and microlobidene (), were confirmed as GPBAR1 activators reaching more than 50% receptor activation at 20 μM with ECs of 13.53 μM and 13.88 μM, respectively. This activity is comparable to that of the endogenous ligand  (). Seven further virtual hits showed activity reaching at least 15% receptor activation either at 5 or 20 μM, including new scaffolds from natural and synthetic origin.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29352187>Reduction in hepatic secondary bile acids caused by short-term antibiotic-induced dysbiosis decreases mouse serum glucose and triglyceride levels.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic-caused changes in intestinal flora (dysbiosis) can have various effects on the host. Secondary bile acids produced by intestinal bacteria are ligands for specific nuclear receptors, which regulate glucose, lipid, and drug metabolism in the liver. The present study aimed to clarify the effect of changes in secondary bile acids caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the host physiology, especially glucose, lipid, and drug metabolism. After oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics for 5 days, decreased amounts of secondary bile -producing bacteria in faeces and a reduction in secondary bile  [ (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA)] levels in the liver were observed. Serum glucose and triglyceride levels were also decreased, and these decreases were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation. Quantitative proteomics demonstrated that the expression levels of proteins involved in glycogen metabolism, cholesterol, bile  biosynthesis, and drug metabolism (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a25, and Cyp51a1) were altered in the liver in dysbiosis, and these changes were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation. These results suggested that secondary bile -producing bacteria contribute to the homeostasis of glucose and triglyceride levels and drug metabolism in the host, and have potential as therapeutic targets for treating metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316997>Microbiota-Related Changes in Unconjugated Fecal Bile Acids Are Associated With Naturally Occurring, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in Dogs.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans has recently been associated with altered intestinal microbiota. The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile acids.</a></h2><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn\'s disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn\'s disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn\'s disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957301>Longitudinal assessment of microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile  concentrations, and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive chronic inflammatory enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence from human studies suggests that bile  dysmetabolism might play a role in various human chronic gastrointestinal diseases. It is unknown whether fecal bile  dysmetabolism occurs in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CE).To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.Twenty-four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid-responsive CE.In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal microbiota were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P\u2009=\u2009.002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P\u2009=\u2009.049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3\u2009months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P\u2009=\u20090.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE. Additionally, resolution of clinical activity index in dogs with therapeutically managed CE and bile  dysmetabolism are likely correlated. However, subclinical disease (i.e., microbial dysbiosis) can persist in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.© 2019 The Authors.

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients\' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and  activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism.

The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for body mass index and weight-adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively). C. leptum was positively correlated with fecal unconjugated  (LCA) (r = 0.526, p = 0.003) and inversely with unconjugated CA (r = -0.669, p<0.0001) and unconjugated CDCA (r = - 0.630, p<0.0001).

The role of the breast  in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut  does have a role in the pathology of the disease.

This study investigated the alterations of hepatocellular transport in a rat sepsis model (LPS i.p.) as well as in a model inducing SIRS by sterile abscess formation (turpentine i.m.). Two bile acids (Cholyltaurine and Chemodeoxycholyltaurine) and one organic anion (Sulfolithocholyltaurine) were used as marker substrates to investigate the time course of hepatocellular transport function. Experiments were performed in isolated perfused rat livers and plasma membrane vesicles. During sepsis, both, the transport of bile acids and that of the organic anion was markedly reduced. In contrast no alteration of transport was detected during SIRS. However, biliary secretion of glutathione (+90%) and bile  independent bile flow (%) were increased. mRNA levels of bile  and organic anion transport proteins were reduced. The lowest values were noted 12 h after injection of LPS or turpentine. Almost unchanged kinetic parameters during SIRS pointed to a normal population of transporters with regard to quantity and substrate affinity. Therefore it seems that transcriptional regulation plays an important role for the expression of transport proteins during sepsis, whereas posttranscriptional regulation may be of importance during SIRS.

To study the relationship between the molecular structures of those amphiphilic molecules, particularly the extended hydrophobic appendant (anchor) at the 3-hydroxyl group, and transfection efficiency, we synthesized several  and isolithocholic  derivatives, and examined their transfection efficiency. We also compared the physico-chemical properties of cationic liposomes prepared from these derivatives. We found that isolithocholic  derivatives exhibit higher transfection efficiency than the corresponding  derivatives. This result indicates that the orientation and extension of hydrophobic regions influence the gene transfection process. Isolithocholic  derivatives showed a high ability to encapsulate DNA in a compact liposome-DNA complex and to protect it from enzymatic degradation. Isolithocholic  derivatives also facilitated the release of DNA from the liposome-DNA complex, which is a crucial step for DNA entry into the nucleus. Our results show that the transfection efficiency is directly influenced by the ability of the liposome complex to release DNA, rather than by the DNA-encapsulating ability. Molecular modeling revealed that isolithocholic  derivatives take relatively extended conformations, while the  derivatives take folded structures. Thus, the efficiency of release of DNA from cationic liposomes in the cytoplasm, which contributes to high transfection efficiency, appears to be dependent upon the molecular shape of the cationic amphiphiles.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24296272>Tandem mass spectrometric characterization of bile acids and steroid conjugates based on low- collision-induced dissociation.</a></h2><p>We examined the characteristics of several bile acids and some steroid conjugates under low--collision-induced dissociation conditions using a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. According to conjugation types, we observed characteristic product ions and/or neutral losses in the product ion spectra. Amino  conjugates afforded specific product ions. For example, glycine-conjugated metabolites routinely produced a product ion at m/z 74, and taurine-conjugated metabolites produced product ions at m/z 124, 107, and 80. When a strong peak appeared at m/z 97, the molecule contained a sulfate group. In contrast to amino  conjugates, carbohydrate conjugates required a combination of product ions and neutral losses for identification. We could discriminate a glucoside from an acyl galactoside according to the presence or absence of a product ion at m/z 161 and a neutral loss of 180 Da. Discrimination among esters, aliphatic ethers, and phenolic ether types of glucuronides was based upon differences in the intensities of a product ion at m/z 175 and a neutral loss of 176 Da. Furthermore, N-acetylglucosamine conjugates showed a characteristic product ion at m/z 202 and a neutral loss of 203 Da, and the appearance of a product ion at m/z 202 revealed the existence of N-acetylglucosamine conjugated to an aliphatic hydroxyl group without a double bond in the immediate vicinity.

We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed LPD (8% casein) soon after weaning for 4 or 12 wk, and then were injected intravenously with a single dose of LCA (4 mumol/100 g body wt). Bile was collected for 30-min periods, and bile flow as well as biliary lipid secretory rates were measured. Bile  metabolism was also studied and the results were compared with those obtained in rats fed an adequate protein diet (26% casein). The LPD produced significantly lower bile flow and bile  secretion, which were attributed to a reduced bile  pool and a reduction in synthesis. They also enhanced the LCA-induced decline in bile flow, and rate of biliary output of total bile acids, phospholipids and cholesterol. The LPD were also associated with impaired LCA secretion in bile and increased retention in plasma and liver. Studies of LCA metabolism in rats fed a LPD indicated lower hepatic LCA hydroxylation, a greater percent contribution of glyco conjugates and lower levels of tauro conjugates.

Bile  induced activation of TGR5 in the enteroendocrine cells promotes glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release, which has insulinotropic effect in the pancreatic β cells. In the present study, we have identified the expression of TGR5 in pancreatic β cell line MIN6 and also in mouse and human pancreatic islets. TGR5 selective ligands, oleanolic  (OA) and INT-777 selectively activated Gα(s) and caused an increase in intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+).

OA, INT-777 and  increased insulin release in MIN6 and human islets and the increase was inhibited by treatment with NF449, U73122 or BAPTA-AM (chelator of calcium), but not with myristoylated PKI (PKA inhibitor), suggesting that the release is dependent on G(s)/cAMP/Ca(2+) pathway. 8-pCPT-2\'-O-Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog, which activates Epac, but not PKA also stimulated PI hydrolysis.

Addition of albumin (1 g-%) increased the threshold dose of CDCA; this occurred for TLCA only 8 g-%. Electron-microscopical alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum and submembranous areas were found with concentrations below these threshold doses even in the presence of albumin. These alterations are interpreted as disturbance of cellular transport and  metabolism. TLCA inhibited glucagon response of cells in concentrations below 100 micrometers. These results demonstrate an influence of the bile acids studied on structure and function of liver cell membranes, which may be of importance in the pathogenesis of cholestasis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum could be another cellular structure which is affected by these bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21454404>The G protein-coupled bile  receptor, TGR5, stimulates gallbladder filling.</a></h2><p>TGR5 is a G protein-coupled bile  receptor present in brown adipose tissue and intestine, where its agonism increases  expenditure and lowers blood glucose. Thus, it is an attractive drug target for treating human metabolic disease. However, TGR5 is also highly expressed in gallbladder, where its functions are less well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that TGR5 stimulates the filling of the gallbladder with bile. Gallbladder volume was increased in wild-type but not Tgr5(-/-) mice by administration of either the naturally occurring TGR5 agonist, , or the synthetic TGR5 agonist, INT-777. These effects were independent of fibroblast growth factor 15, an enteric hormone previously shown to stimulate gallbladder filling. Ex vivo analyses using gallbladder tissue showed that TGR5 activation increased cAMP concentrations and caused smooth muscle relaxation in a TGR5-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel, gallbladder-intrinsic mechanism for regulating gallbladder contractility. They further suggest that TGR5 agonists should be assessed for effects on human gallbladder as they are developed for treating metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751815>Changes in the faecal bile  profile in dogs fed dry food vs high content of beef: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Dogs are fed various diets, which also include components of animal origin. In humans, a high-fat/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in fat and low in fibre influences the faecal bile  levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile  profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n\u2009=\u20098) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3\xa0weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog\'s total  requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5. Dogs were subsequently reintroduced to the dry food for the last 2\xa0weeks of the study. The total taurine and glycine-conjugated bile acids, the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic  and cholic , and the secondary bile acids , deoxycholic  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were analysed, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The faecal quantities of DCA were significantly higher in dogs fed the high minced beef diet. These levels reversed when dogs were reintroduced to the dry food diet. The faecal levels of UDCA and taurine-conjugated bile acids had also increased in response to the beef diet, but this was only significant when compared to the last dry food period.These results suggest that an animal-based diet with high-fat/low-fibre content can influence the faecal bile acids levels. The consequences of this for canine colonic health will require further investigation.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004574>Impact of confinement on proteins concentrated in  based organic nanotubes.</a></h2><p>Organic nanotubes form in aqueous solution near physiological pH by self-assembly of  (LCA) with inner diameters of 20-40nm. The encapsulation of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and resultant confinement effect for eGFP within these nanotubes is studied via confocal microscopy. Timed release rate studies of eGFP encapsulated in LCA nanotubes and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) indicate that the diffusive transport of eGFP out of and/or within the nanotubes is very slow, in contrast to the rapid introduction of eGFP into the nanotubes. By encapsulating two fluorescent proteins in LCA nanotubes, eGFP and mCherry, as a fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) pair, the FRET efficiencies are determined using FRET imaging microscopy at three different protein concentrations with a fixed donor-to-acceptor ratio of 1:1. Förster theory reveals that the proteins are spatially separated by 4.8-7.2nm in distance inside these nanotubes. The biomimetic nanochannels of LCA nanotubes not only afford a confining effect on eGFP that results in enhanced chemical and thermal stability under conditions of high denaturant concentration and temperature, but also function as protein concentrators for enriching protein in the nanochannels from a diluted protein solution by up to two orders of magnitude.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29997324>Theoretical Model of EphA2-Ephrin A1 Inhibition.</a></h2><p>This work aims at the theoretical description of EphA2-ephrin A1 inhibition by small molecules.

Secondary bile acids are formed by the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by intestinal anaerobic bacteria. We have previously described a multistep biochemical pathway in Clostridium scindens that is responsible for bile  7α-dehydroxylation. We have identified a large (12 kb) bile  inducible (bai) operon in this bacterium that encodes eight genes involved in bile  7α-dehydroxylation. However, the function of the baiF gene product in this operon has not been elucidated. In the current study, we cloned and expressed the baiF gene in E. coli and discovered it has bile  CoA transferase activity. In addition, we discovered a second bai operon encoding three genes. The baiK gene in this operon was expressed in E. coli and found to encode a second bile  CoA transferase. Both bile  CoA transferases were determined to be members of the type III family by amino  sequence comparisons. Both bile  CoA transferases had broad substrate specificity, except the baiK gene product, which failed to use lithocholyl-CoA as a CoA donor. Primary bile acids are ligated to CoA via an ATP-dependent mechanism during the initial steps of 7α-dehydroxylation. The bile  CoA transferases conserve the thioester bond , saving the cell ATP molecules during bile  7α-dehydroxylation. ATP-dependent CoA ligation is likely quickly supplanted by ATP-independent CoA transfer.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172112>Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary pomegranate extract and inulin in mice fed an obesogenic diet.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated in animal studies that both polyphenol-rich pomegranate extract (PomX) and the polysaccharide inulin, ameliorate metabolic changes induced by a high-fat diet, but little is known about the specific mechanisms.This study evaluated the effect of PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination on cholesterol and lipid metabolism in mice.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat/high-sucrose [HF/HS (32%  from fat, 25%  from sucrose)] diets supplemented with PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination for 4 weeks. At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Bile acids are hormones that regulate their own synthesis, transport, in addition to glucose and lipid homeostasis, and  balance. The gut microbial community through their capacity to produce bile  metabolites distinct from the liver can be thought of as an "endocrine organ" with potential to alter host physiology, perhaps to their own favor. We propose the term "sterolbiome" to describe the genetic potential of the gut microbiome to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous and exogenous steroids in the mammalian gut.

TLCS induced a rapid serine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). Inhibitors of p47phox phosphorylation and p47phox protein knockdown abolished the TLCS-induced oxidative stress response and blunted subsequent CD95 activation. Consequences of TLCS-induced oxidative stress were c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation and Yes-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by EGFR-catalyzed CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and execution of apoptosis. As shown by fluorescence resonance  transfer experiments in Huh7 cells, TLCS induced a c-Jun-N-terminal kinase-dependent EGFR/CD95 association in the cytosol and trafficking of this protein complex to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 allowed for cytosolic EGFR/CD95 association, but prevented targeting of the EGFR/CD95 complex to the plasma membrane.

Although transcriptional regulation by VDR has been investigated intensively, an understanding of ligand-selective dynamic VDR conformations remains elusive. Here, we examined ligand-dependent dynamic interactions of VDR with retinoid X receptor (RXR), steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), and silencing mediator of retinoic  and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) in cells using fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.

In the absence of ligand, VDR homodimers were preferred to RXR heterodimers and were associated with SMRT. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced heterodimerization with RXR, dissociation of SMRT, and association of SRC-1. LCA and ADTT induced those effects to a lesser extent at concentrations that did not induce expression of the VDR target gene CYP24A1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Unlike in HEK293 cells, ADTT increased CYP24A1 expression in HCT116 cells and increased the association of VDR and SMRT on the CYP24A1 promoter. The results indicate that ligand-selective conformation may lead to unique cofactor complex formation in a cell context-dependent manner.

The inflection point at around 50-70 μM pointed to the formation of unprecedented assemblies at such low concentrations.

Approximately one-third of the world\'s population is overweight or obese, and in the United States alone, obesity affects one in six children. Meta-analysis studies suggest that obesity increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer, and with poorer outcomes, especially in children. The contribution of obesity to cancer risk requires a better understanding of the association between obesity-induced metabolic changes and its impact on genomic instability, which is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss how molecular changes during adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage. This represents one of the many critical steps connecting obesity and cancer since oxidative DNA lesions can result in cancer-associated genetic instability. In addition, the by-products of the oxidative degradation of lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acrolein), and gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile  metabolites (e.g., deoxycholic  and ), can function as genotoxic agents and tumor promoters. We also discuss how obesity can impact DNA repair efficiency, potentially contributing to cancer initiation and progression.

Bile travels through the liver in a series of ducts, eventually exiting through the common hepatic duct. Bile flows through this duct into the gallbladder where it is concentrated and stored. When stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), the gallbladder contracts, pushing bile through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct. \xa0Simultaneously, the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, permitting bile to enter the duodenal lumen. The hormone secretin also plays an important role in the flow of bile into the small intestine. By stimulating biliary and pancreatic ductular cells to secrete bicarbonate and water in response to the presence of  in the duodenum, secretin effectively expands the volume of bile entering the duodenum. In the small intestine, bile acids facilitate lipid digestion and absorption. Only approximately 5% of these bile acids are eventually excreted. The majority of bile acids are efficiently reabsorbed from the ileum, secreted into the portal venous system, and returned to the liver in a process known as enterohepatic recirculation.[1][2][3]   Bile is produced by hepatocytes, which is then modified by the cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts. The production and secretion of bile require active transport systems within hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in addition to a structurally and functionally intact biliary tree. Initially, hepatocytes produce bile by secreting conjugated bilirubin, bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, ions, and water into their canaliculi (thin tubules between adjacent hepatocytes that eventually join to form bile ducts). The canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is the main bile secretory apparatus which contains the intracellular organelles, the cytoskeleton of the hepatocyte and carrier proteins. The carrier proteins in the canalicular membrane transport bile  and ions. Transporter proteins found within the canalicular membrane use  to secrete molecules into bile against concentration gradients. Through this active transport, osmotic and electrochemical gradients are formed. When conjugated bile salts enter the canaliculus, water follows by osmosis. The electrochemical gradient allows for the passive diffusion of inorganic ions such as sodium. The most significant promoter of bile formation is the passage of conjugated bile salts into the biliary canaliculus. The total bile flow in a day is approximately 600 ml, of which 75% is derived from the hepatocyte, and 25% is from the cholangiocytes. Approximately half of the hepatocyte component of bile flow (about 225 ml per day) is bile salt-dependent and the remaining half bile salt independent. Osmotically active solutes such as glutathione and bicarbonate promote bile salt independent bile flow.[4][5] Canaliculi empty bile into ductules or cholangioles or canals of Hering. The ductules connect with interlobular bile ducts, which are accompanied by branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery forming portal triads. Bile is subsequently modified by ductular epithelial cells as it passes through the biliary tree. These cells, known as cholangiocytes, dilute and alkalinize the bile through hormone-regulated absorptive and secretory processes. The cholangiocytes have receptors which modulate the bicarbonate-rich ductular bile flow, which is regulated by hormones. These receptors include receptors for secretin, somatostatin, cystic\xa0fibrosis transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger.\xa0 For example, when secretin stimulates receptors in the cholangiocyte, a cascade is initiated which activates the CFTR chloride channel and allows the exchange of bicarbonate for chloride. In contrast, somatostatin inhibits the cAMP synthesis within the cholangiocytes causing the opposite effect. While bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, acetylcholine, and secretin enhances bile flow, somatostatin, gastrin, insulin, and endothelin inhibit the flow.[6]  Cholesterol catabolism by hepatocytes results in the synthesis of the 2 major primary bile acids, cholic , and chenodeoxycholic . This process involves multiple steps, with cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Primary bile acids undergo dehydroxylation by bacteria in the small intestine, forming the secondary bile acids deoxycholic  and , respectively. \xa0Both primary and secondary bile acids are conjugated by the liver with an amino , either glycine or taurine. Conjugated bile acids are known as bile salts. Bile salts inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, decreasing the synthesis of bile acids. Despite the increased water solubility of bile salts, they are amphipathic molecules overall. This critical property allows them to effectively emulsify lipids and form micelles with the products of lipid digestion. The bile  pool is maintained via mainly the enterohepatic circulation and to a small extent (about 5%) by hepatic synthesis of bile acids, as long as the daily fecal loss of bile acids do not exceed 20% of the pool.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21797258>Dansyl labeling to modulate the relative affinity of bile acids for the binding sites of human serum albumin.</a></h2><p>Binding of natural bile acids to human serum albumin (HSA) is an important step in enterohepatic circulation and provides a measure of liver function.

Furthermore, the C-3-labeled compounds are displaced by , whereas they are insensitive to ChA, confirming the assumption that the former binds to HSA at site 2. Thus, Dns labeling provides a useful tool to modulate the relative affinity of ChA to the major binding sites of HSA and, in combination with other fluorescent ChA analogs, to mimic the binding behavior of natural bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3593707>The passive permeability properties of in vivo perfused rat jejunum.</a></h2><p>The polarity of the microvillus membrane of rat and rabbit jejunum, determined in vitro by the incremental free  changes associated with the addition of -CH2 groups to fatty acids or -OH groups to bile acids, has been found to be more polar than other biological membranes. The reason for the difference in polarity is unexplained but could be due to artifacts caused by the in vitro conditions. In the current studies the apparent permeability coefficients were determined for a homologous series of fatty acids and bile acids in in vivo perfused rat jejunum. The true permeability coefficients were derived by correction for diffusion barrier resistance. The incremental free  changes associated with the addition of a -CH2 group to a fatty  and a -OH group to a bile  were -619 and +2069 cal/mol, respectively. These values correspond to values determined in other biological membranes such as erythrocytes and adipocytes. Thus, the rat microvillus membrane is more nonpolar than previously observed in vitro. The reason for the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results is most likely due to an underestimation of the permeability coefficients in the in vitro studies.</p><p>Keyword: energy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179489>Comparison of diets enriched in stearic, oleic, and palmitic acids on , immune response, cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women-randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Direct comparisons between SFAs varying in chain length, specifically palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0), relative to the latter\'s metabolic product, oleic  (18:1), on cardiometabolic risk factors are limited.The aim of this study was to determine the relative comparability of diets enriched in palmitic , stearic , and oleic  on  and coagulation markers, T lymphocyte proliferation/ex-vivo cytokine secretion, plasma cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations.Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (n\xa0=\xa020, mean\xa0±\xa0SD age 64\xa0±\xa07 y, BMI 26.4\xa0±\xa03.4 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol\xa0≥\xa02.8 mmol/L) were provided with each of 3 diets [55% energy (%E) carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, with ∼50% fat contributed by palmitic , stearic , or oleic  in each diet; 5 wk/diet phase] using a randomized crossover design with 2-wk washouts between phases.

Caloric restriction decreased plasma triglycerides by 41 +/- 12%, plasma cholesterol by 11 +/- 9%, and the ratio of esterified to free cholesterol by 12 +/- 7+. Immediately on institution of caloric restriction there appeared to be an influx of tissue cholesterol into plasma and a reduction in endogenous synthesis of cholesterol. The cholesterol balance decreased from 1,469 +/- 441 to 1,212 +/- 349 mg/day and the rate of decay of plasma cholesterol specific activity decreased 62 +/- 3%. The effect of caloric restriction on hepatic synthesis of bile acids was also very prompt. The total fecal bile acids were reduced immediately by 36 +/- 7%. Because the effect on fecal excretion of deoxycholic  was greater than that on fecal , it was suggested that hepatic synthesis of cholic  was reduced more than the synthesis of chenodeoxycholic . Caloric restriction did not cause any change in the percentage of absorption of dietary cholesterol (40 +/- 2% versus 42 +/- 3%).

Therefore, the development of a TGR5-specific agonist could lead to the prevention and treatment of various metabolic disorders related to obesity. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of bile alcohols, which are structurally and physiologically similar to bile acids and are produced as the end products of cholesterol catabolism in evolutionarily primitive vertebrates, to act as TGR5 agonists. In a cell-based reporter assay and a cAMP production assay performed in vitro, most bile alcohols with a side chain containing hydroxyl group(s) were highly efficacious agonists for TGR5 comparable to its most potent ligand in the naturally occurring bile , . However, the abilities of the bile alcohols to activate TGR5 varied with the position and number of the hydroxyl substituent in the side chain. Additionally, the conformation of the steroidal nucleus of bile alcohols is also important for its activity as a TGR5 agonist.

After 3 weeks, mice underwent live imaging (dual  x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography [2DE], electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), exercise treadmill testing, and histological and biochemical analyses of livers and hearts. Compared with chow-fed mice, DDC-fed mice fatigued earlier on the treadmill, with reduced VO(2).

We previously showed that nomilin, a citrus limonoid, activates TGR5 and confers anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic effects in mice. Information on the TGR5-nomilin interaction regarding molecular structure, however, has not been reported. In the present study, we found that human TGR5 (hTGR5) shows higher nomilin responsiveness than does mouse TGR5 (mTGR5). Using mouse-human chimeric TGR5, we also found that three amino  residues (Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29) are important in the hTGR5-nomilin interaction. Based on these results, an hTGR5-nomilin binding model was constructed using in silico docking simulation, demonstrating that four hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between nomilin and hTGR5. The binding mode of hTGR5-nomilin is vastly different from those of other TGR5 agonists previously reported, suggesting that TGR5 forms various binding patterns depending on the type of agonist.

E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to  (LCA).

We hypothesized that LCA can modulate oxidative stress to exert cytostatic effects in breast cancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with LCA decreased nuclear factor-2 (NRF2) expression and increased Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) expression via activation of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Altered NRF2 and KEAP1 expression subsequently led to decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), an antioxidant enzyme, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant enzymes increased cytostatic effects via increased levels of  and protein oxidation. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological induction of NRF2 with RA839, tBHQ, or by thiol antioxidants. The expression of key components of the LCA-elicited cytostatic pathway (iNOS and 4HNE) gradually decreased as the breast cancer stage advanced. The level of  peroxidation in tumors negatively correlated with the mitotic index. The overexpression of iNOS, nNOS, CAR, KEAP1, NOX4, and TGR5 or the downregulation of NRF2 correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients, except for triple negative cases. Taken together, LCA, a metabolite of the gut microbiome, elicits oxidative stress that slows down the proliferation of breast cancer cells.

The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced  malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

In this study, low molecular weight linear polyethyleneimine (2.5\u2009kDa) was modified by conjugation to a , , and complexed with a natural polysaccharide, dermatan sulfate (DS), to mask extra cationic charges of the modified polymer. In vitro examination revealed that these modifications improved complex stability with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transfection efficiency. This novel ternary polyplex (pDNA/3E/DS) was used to investigate if tumor-targeted radiotherapy led to enhanced accumulation and retention of gene therapy vectors in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Imaging of biodistribution revealed that tumor irradiation led to increased accumulation and retention as well as decreased off-target tissue buildup of pDNA in not only pDNA/3E/DS, but also in associated PEI-based polyplexes and commercial DNA delivery vehicles. The DS-containing complexes developed in this study displayed the greatest increase in tumor-specific pDNA delivery. These findings demonstrate a step forward in nucleic  vehicle design as well as a promising approach to overall cancer gene therapy through utilization of radiotherapy as a tool for enhanced delivery.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774887>Suppressed hepatic bile  signalling despite elevated production of primary and secondary bile acids in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are regulators of  and glucose , and modulate inflammation in the liver and other tissues. Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high- diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high- diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of  (LCA) on the lipogenesis of breast cancer cells. The putative cytotoxic effects of LCA on these cells were also examined.The effects of LCA on breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were studied using MTT viability assays, Annexin-FITC and Akt phosphorylation assays to evaluate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays to assess the expression of the bile  receptor TGR5 and the estrogen receptor ERα, and genes and proteins involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, p53) and lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, FASN, ACACA). Intracellular  droplets were visualized using Oil Red O staining.We found that LCA induces TGR5 expression and exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of  droplets compared to untreated control cells.

In humans, a high-/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in  and low in fibre influences the faecal bile  levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile  profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n\u2009=\u20098) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3\xa0weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog\'s total energy requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5. Dogs were subsequently reintroduced to the dry food for the last 2\xa0weeks of the study. The total taurine and glycine-conjugated bile acids, the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic  and cholic , and the secondary bile acids , deoxycholic  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were analysed, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The faecal quantities of DCA were significantly higher in dogs fed the high minced beef diet. These levels reversed when dogs were reintroduced to the dry food diet. The faecal levels of UDCA and taurine-conjugated bile acids had also increased in response to the beef diet, but this was only significant when compared to the last dry food period.These results suggest that an animal-based diet with high-/low-fibre content can influence the faecal bile acids levels. The consequences of this for canine colonic health will require further investigation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172112>Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary pomegranate extract and inulin in mice fed an obesogenic diet.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated in animal studies that both polyphenol-rich pomegranate extract (PomX) and the polysaccharide inulin, ameliorate metabolic changes induced by a high- diet, but little is known about the specific mechanisms.This study evaluated the effect of PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination on cholesterol and  in mice.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-/high-sucrose [HF/HS (32% energy from , 25% energy from sucrose)] diets supplemented with PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination for 4 weeks. At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and  as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and  weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high- diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high- diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low- diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low- diets than in groups fed high- diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of  and glucose . Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of , we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high--diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its -lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28863822>Regulation of Ca-Sensitive K Channels by Cholesterol and Bile Acids via Distinct Channel Subunits and Sites.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol (CLR) conversion into bile acids (BAs) in the liver constitutes the major pathway for CLR elimination from the body.

Among other lipids, CLR and BAs regulate ionic current mediated by the activity of voltage- and Ca-gated, K channels of large conductance (BK channels) and, thus, modulate cell physiology and participate in tissue pathophysiology. Initial work attributed modification of BK channel function by CLR or BAs to the capability of these steroids to directly interact with bilayer lipids and thus alter the physicochemical properties of the bilayer with eventual modification of BK channel function. Based on our own work and that of others, we now review evidence that supports direct interactions between CLR or BA and specific BK protein subunits, and the consequence of such interactions on channel activity and organ function, with a particular emphasis on arterial smooth muscle. For each steroid type, we will also briefly discuss several mechanisms that may underlie modification of channel steady-state activity.

The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of  absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules.

Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis. The delayed pathogenesis of  in -colonized mice was associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile  transformation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727078>Flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation modulates growth performance, blood lipids, intestinal fermentation, bile acids, and neutral sterols in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to determine the effect of flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of , serum lipids, and concentrations of VFA, bile acids (BA), and neutral sterols (NS) in digesta and feces in growing pigs. Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of , serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of  in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal deoxycholic  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol ,  digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High- diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high- diet-related colon cancer.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high- diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

Because activation of GPBA leads to increased cAMP levels and secretion of incretins and insulin, GPBA has been proposed as a promising drug target for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Previously, we have developed a ligand-screening system to identify novel agonists of GPBA by means of a fusion protein of GPBA with G protein stimulatory α subunit (Gsα) and by a [S]GTPγS-binding assay. To express the GPBA-Gsα fusion protein, transgenic silkworms were employed in this study, and cell membrane fractions were prepared from their  body or pupae. We applied them to the screening of a chemical library that contains 10,625 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository (NPDepo). Eventually, a unique partial agonist, GUM2, was successfully identified. Our results indicated that the GPCR-Gα fusion proteins were beneficial for ligand identification and that the transgenic silkworms were useful for large-scale production of GPCRs. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing GPBA, GUM2 showed 50% effective concentration (EC) of 3.5 ± 2.4μM and induced GPBA internalization as effectively as did an endogenous agonist, TLC. We also confirmed that GUM2 stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Moreover, a single 2mg/kg dose of GUM2 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in mice during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test even though GUM2 is only a partial agonist with a low intrinsic activity. We concluded that GUM2 is a good candidate for research on GPBA signaling under physiological conditions and for the development of GPBA-targeting therapeutic compounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the synthetic steroid N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) arised as a promising LXR ligand. This compound was able to dissociate certain beneficial LXRs effects from those undesirable ones involved in triglyceride . Here, we synthetized a series of DMHCA analogues with different modifications in the steroidal nucleus involving the A/B ring fusion, that generate changes in the overall conformation of the steroid. The LXRα and LXRβ activity of these analogues was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay in BHK21 cells. Compounds were tested in both the agonist and antagonist modes. Results indicated that the agonist/antagonist profile is dependent on the steroid configuration at the A/B ring junction. Notably, in contrast to DMHCA, the amide derived from  (2) with an A/B cis configuration and its 6,19-epoxy analogue 4 behaved as LXRα selective agonists, while the 2,19-epoxy analogues with an A/B trans configuration were antagonists of both isoforms. The binding mode of the analogues to both LXR isoforms was assessed by using 50\u202fns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed conformational differences between LXRα- and LXRβ-ligand complexes, mainly in the hydrogen bonding network that involves the C-3 hydroxyl.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Excessive alcohol consumption causes alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Ginger has been reported to exhibit antioxidant potential and hepatoprotective activity. In the present study, a mouse model for AFLD was developed by employing male C57BL/6 mice that were fed an alcohol-containing liquid diet (Lieber-DeCarli diet) ad libitum. In the treatment groups, ginger essential oil (GEO) and citral were orally administered every day for 4 weeks. Serum biochemical analysis, antioxidant enzyme activity analysis, and histopathological evaluation revealed that GEO and citral exhibited hepatoprotective activity against AFLD. Metabolites in serum samples were profiled by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). Metabolomic data indicated the amounts of metabolites such as d-glucurono-6,3-lactone, glycerol-3-phosphate, pyruvic , , 2-pyrocatechuic , and prostaglandin E1 were increased after alcohol administration, but the levels were recovered in treatment groups. The analysis indicated that ginger possesses hepatoprotective properties against AFLD.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced  and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585279>Serum bile  level and   composition in Chinese children with non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>To determine serum bile  (BA) and   (FA) profiles in Chinese children with non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).A total 76 children aged 4-17 years were categorized into three groups according to the presence and absence of as well as the severity of NAFLD, that is, non-NAFLD (control), mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups, respectively, based on their  ultrasonography findings.

Western blot analysis of positive colonies, using anti-rat  UGT antibodies, revealed the presence of an immunoreactive polypeptide of the expected molecular mass of 52 kDa. The substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme toward > 100 compounds was determined. Phenolic and alcoholic substrates included 4-methylumbelliferone, 4-hydroxybiphenyl, chloramphenicol, and testosterone, but a range of carboxylic acids of both endogenous (medium-chain saturated  acids, long-chain polyunsaturated  acids, and bile acids) and exogenous (profen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fibrate hypolipidemic agents, and sodium valproate) origin were also accepted, indicating that the enzyme was capable of forming both ether- and ester-type glucuronides from various structurally unrelated compounds. Determination of apparent kinetic constants for the glucuronidation by UGT2B1 of selected aglycones revealed a high maximal velocity toward the 3-position of morphine (49.3 +/- 2.2 nmol/min/mg of protein), compared with other known substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferone (2.67 +/- 0.11 nmol/min/mg of protein) or clofibric  (0.06 +/- 0.02 nmol/min/mg of protein). To gain a better insight into the mechanisms underlying the apparently wide substrate specificity of UGT2B1, series of structurally related compounds were tested as potential substrates. The rate of glucuronidation of unbranched saturated  acids and omega,omega,omega-triphenylalkanoic acids increased progressively with increasing alkyl chain length and then declined, with the best substrates in these two homologous series being decanoic  and 4,4,4-triphenylbutanoic , respectively. Glucuronidation of para-substituted phenols always proceeded at a higher rate than that of the corresponding para-substituted benzoic acids. This could mean that the aglycon hydroxyl group was better positioned in the enzyme active site in the case of phenols. Alternatively, if the initial interaction with the enzyme required the aglycon to be in the protonated uncharged form, then the observation could be explained by the difference in ionization between phenols and benzoic acids at the incubation pH used. The introduction of a bulky alkyl group into the para-position led to increases of up to 300-fold in the rate of glucuronidation, probably as a result of the increased aglycon lipophilicity. Finally, the enzyme showed a degree of stereo- and regiospecificity, preferring (S)-ibuprofen to the R-enantiomer (Vmax/Km, 3.06 and 1.10 microliters/min/mg of protein, respectively) and glucuronidating  but not hyodeoxycholic , which differs by only a single hydroxyl group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9862274>Studies of cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early atherogenesis in hamsters fed GT16-239, a novel bile  sequestrant (BAS).</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of GT16-239, an alkylated, cross-linked poly(allylamine) bile  sequestrant with cholestyramine on cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early aortic atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic male F1B Golden Syrian hamsters.

To this end, stable cell lines expressing   transporters as well as primary hepatocytes from mouse and human livers were incubated with primary and secondary bile acids to determine their effects on LCFA uptake rates. We identified ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) as the two most potent inhibitors of the -specific   transport protein 5 (FATP5). Both UDCA and DCA were able to inhibit LCFA uptake by primary hepatocytes in a FATP5-dependent manner. Subsequently, mice were treated with these secondary bile acids in vivo to assess their ability to inhibit diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Administration of DCA in vivo via injection or as part of a high-fat diet significantly inhibited hepatic   uptake and reduced  triglycerides by more than 50%.The data demonstrate a novel role for specific bile acids, and the secondary bile  DCA in particular, in the regulation of hepatic LCFA uptake. The results illuminate a previously unappreciated means by which specific bile acids, such as UDCA and DCA, can impact hepatic triglyceride metabolism and may lead to novel approaches to combat obesity-associated  disease.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1148165>Interactions of bilirubin and other ligands with ligandin.</a></h2><p>Circular dichroism methods were used to study the structure of rat ligandin and the binding of organic anions to the protein. Ligandin has a highly ordered secondary structure with about 40%alpha helix, 15% beta structure, and 45% random coil. Bilirubin binding occurred primarily at a single high affinity site on the protein. The binding constant for bilirubin (5 X 10-7 Mminus 1) was the highest among the ligands studied. The bilirubin-ligandin complex exhibited a well-defined circular dichroic spectrum with two major overlapping ellipticity bands of opposite sign in the bilirubin absorption region. This spectrum was virtually a mirror image of that of human or rat serum albumin-bilirubin complexes. Studies on the direct transfer of bilirubin from ligandin to rat serum albumin showed that sasociation constants of bilirubin-ligandin complexes were approximately tenfold less than those of the bilirubin-albumin system. Ligandin exhibited a broad specificity with respect to the typeof ligand bond. A series of organic anions inclucing dyes used clinically for  function tests,  acids, hormones, heme derivatives, bile acids, and other ligands that were considered likely to interact with ligandin, were examined. Most induced ellipticity changes consistent with competitive displacement of bilirubin from ligandin and relative affinities of these compounds for ligandin were determined based on their effectiveness in desplacing the bilirubin. Some substances such as glutathione, conjugated sulfobromophthaleins and  bound to ligandin but induced anomalous spectral shifts, when added to ligandin-bilirubin complexes.

Photoaffinity labeling of isolated hepatocytes with [3H]-7,7-ASLCT on the one hand and with [3H]-7,7-ACT and [3H]-7,7-ALCT on the other resulted in a different labeling pattern of cytosolic polypeptides, without a relevant incorporation of radioactivity into subunits of glutathione transferases. This suggests that glutathione transferases play no role in the transport of dianionic or of monoanionic bile salts.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression of CYP3A is affected by a high-fat diet. In addition, we examined whether the type of diet given to mice could produce changes in the expression level and activity of CYP3A. Mice were fed a purified diet containing 10 kcal% lard (control group) or 60 kcal% lard (HF group) or regular mouse chow containing 13 kcal% of fat (MF group) for 4 weeks. No significant differences were observed in the hepatic CYP3A protein expression level between the HF group and the control group. The CYP3A protein expression in the MF group was significantly higher than that observed in the control group. In the MF group, the area under the curve (AUC) of intraperitoneally administered triazolam was lower. Because  (LCA) is known to increase hepatic CYP3A expression, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA in the feces were measured. In the MF group, the levels of Clostridium sordellii and LCA were higher. It has been demonstrated that a high-fat diet does not cause any changes in hepatic CYP3A expression. In addition, the different diets caused alterations in the enteric environment, which triggered changes in CYP3A expression. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the type of feed while performing animal experiments to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drugs.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7367826>Urinary bile  excretion in correlation to  histopathology in cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Urinary bile  excretion and  morphology were compared in 25 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

We hypothesized that the complex interrelated impairments in cardiac structure and function secondary to progression of  diseases involve alterations in signaling pathways engaged in cardiac energy metabolism and hypertrophy, augmented by direct effects of high circulating levels of bile acids. Biliary fibrosis was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydroxychollidine (DDC) supplemented diet. After 3 weeks, mice underwent live imaging (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography [2DE], electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), exercise treadmill testing, and histological and biochemical analyses of livers and hearts. Compared with chow-fed mice, DDC-fed mice fatigued earlier on the treadmill, with reduced VO(2). Marked changes were identified electrophysiologically (bradycardia and prolonged QT interval) and functionally (hyperdynamic left ventricular [LV] contractility along with increased LV thickness). Hearts of DDC-fed mice showed hypertrophic signaling (activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene/protein kinase B [AKT], inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK3beta], a 20-fold up-regulation of beta myosin heavy chain RNA and elevated G(s)alpha/G(i)alpha ratio. Genes regulating cardiac   oxidation pathways were suppressed, along with a threefold increase in myocardial glycogen content. Treatment of mouse cardiomyocytes (which express the membrane bile  receptor TGR5) with potent natural TGR5 agonists, taurochenodeoxycholic  and , activated AKT and inhibited GSK3beta, similar to the changes seen in DDC-fed mouse hearts. This provides support for a novel mechanism whereby circulating natural bile acids can induce signaling pathways in heart associated with hypertrophy.Three weeks of DDC feeding-induced biliary fibrosis leads to multiple functional, metabolic, electrophysiological, and hypertrophic adaptations in the mouse heart, recapitulating some of the features of human cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273788>Dysregulated hepatic bile acids collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated bile acids (BAs) are closely associated with liver diseases and attributed to altered gut microbiota. Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/962892>The metabolism of steroids in the  induced by orotic  feeding.</a></h2><p>1.

However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or . The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Although pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)-mediated protection against LCA-induced hepatocyte injury may be explained by induction of drug metabolizing enzymes, the protection from the delayed cholestasis remains incompletely understood. Thus, the PCN-mediated protective mechanism has been studied from the point of modification of lipid metabolism. At an early stage of LCA feeding, an imbalance of biliary bile  and phospholipid excretion was observed. Co-treatment with PCN reversed the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and hepatic hydrophobic bile  levels. LCA feeding decreased hepatic mRNA levels of several  - and phospholipid-related genes before elevation of serum ALT and ALP activities. On the other hand, PCN co-treatment reversed the decrease in the mRNA levels and hepatic levels of phospholipids, triglycerides and free  acids. PCN co-treatment also reversed the decrease in biliary phospholipid output in LCA-fed mice. Treatment with PCN alone increased hepatic phospholipid, triglyceride and free   concentrations. Hepatic   and phosphatidylcholine synthetic activities increased in mice treated with PCN alone or PCN and LCA, compared to control mice, whereas these activities decreased in LCA-fed mice.

The identification of novel and potent GPBAR1 agonists is highly relevant, as these diseases are on the rise and pharmacological unmet therapeutic needs are pervasive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a proficient workflow for the  prediction of GPBAR1 activating compounds, primarily from natural sources. A protocol was set up, starting with a comprehensive collection of structural information of known ligands. This information was used to generate ligand-based pharmacophore models in LigandScout 4.08 Advanced. After theoretical validation, the two most promising models, namely BAMS22 and TTM8, were employed as queries for the virtual screening of natural product and synthetic small molecule databases. Virtual hits were progressed to shape matching experiments and physicochemical clustering. Out of 33 diverse virtual hits subjected to experimental testing using a reporter gene-based assay, two natural products, farnesiferol B () and microlobidene (), were confirmed as GPBAR1 activators reaching more than 50% receptor activation at 20 μM with ECs of 13.53 μM and 13.88 μM, respectively. This activity is comparable to that of the endogenous ligand  ().

The bile   (LCA) competes for the retinoid X receptor retinoid binding site. Hence, RA pathways may be implicated in Barrett's oesophagus.RA activity in tissues and cell lines treated with all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) with or without LCA was assessed using a reporter. Expression of p21 was determined by real-time PCR in Barrett's oesophagus cell lines with or without LCA. SE and Barrett's oesophagus biopsy specimens were exposed to 100 muM of ATRA or 20 mM of a RA inhibitor, citral, in organ culture for >72 h. Characteristics of treated specimens, compared with untreated controls, were analysed by immunohistochemical analysis (cytokeratins (CKs), vimentin) and RT-PCR (CKs). Confocal microscopy assessed temporal changes in co-localisation of CK8/18 and vimentin. Cell proliferation was assessed by bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation and immunohistochemical analysis for Ki67 and p21.RA biosynthesis was increased in Barrett's oesophagus compared with SE (p<0.001). LCA and ATRA caused a synergistic increase in RA signalling as shown by increased p21 (p<0.01). Morphological and molecular analysis of SE exposed to ATRA showed columnar differentiation independent of proliferation. Metaplasia could be induced from the stromal compartment alone and vimentin expression co-localised with CK8/18 at 24 h, which separated into CK8/18-positive glands and vimentin-positive stroma by 48 h. Citral-treated Barrett's oesophagus led to phenotypic and immunohistochemical characteristics of SE, which was independent of proliferation.RA activity is increased in Barrett's oesophagus and is induced by LCA.

This strain combination was then administered to hypercholesterolaemic pigs over a 3-week period, as two daily preprandial doses of either viable (six experimental pigs) or heat-inactivated bacteria (six controls). The main effects of treatment were on unconjugated bile acids (P=0.035) and UDCA (P<0.0001) absorbed into the portal vein, which increased 1.6-1.7- and 3.5-7.5-fold, respectively, under administration of living compared with inactivated bacteria.

However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular weight promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/842535>Cholestatic liver disease associated with diphenylhydantoin therapy.

The second phase of his illness was characterized by portal tract inflammation with bile ductular proliferation and chronic cholestasis gradually resolving over a period of 15 months. It is postulated that diphenylhydantoin sensitivity produced swollen hepatocytes with hypertrophy of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, reducing hepatic sinusoidal blood flow and the clearance of secondary bile salts. A fall in clearance of lipoproteins, including the cholesterol precursor of primary bile  synthesis, may have been responsible for a reduction in serum bile  concentration.

Three operated patients were taking cholestyramine. The relative amount of cholic  in the bile was decreased at the expense of chenodeoxycholic  in the operated subjects. Chenodeoxycholic  content of the bile correlated negatively with the fractional cholesterol absorption, suggesting that in compromised absorption chenodeoxycholic  is absorbed more efficiently than cholic . Despite a ninefold increase in total bile  synthesis the cholic/chenodeoxycholic  synthesis ratio was not significantly different in the operated and control subjects. However, the lower the chenodeoxycholic  synthesis the higher was the proportion of deoxycholic  in the bile and feces, suggesting regulation of chenodeoxycholic  synthesis by deoxycholic . Ileal exclusion had increased the proportion of primary bile acids in the feces from below 10 to over 50%.

However, the fecal concentration of the potentially cancer-promoting bile acids, deoxycholic  and , was not increased in the operated subjects. In the operated subjects, fecal water output was positively correlated with total bile  and chenodeoxycholic  synthesis. It is concluded that the severe bile  malabsorption caused by ileal exclusion activates the synthesis of both primary bile acids in similar amount.

The plasma cholesterol concentration of normal rabbits increases dramatically from about 30 mg/dl to > 300 mg/dl after they are fed a 0.1% cholesterol-enriched diet for 3-4 months. Cholesterol-fed CRT/mlo animals, however, maintain a cholesterol level of about 30 mg/dl during the entire cholesterol feeding period. In addition to the low plasma cholesterol level, measurements of cellular cholesterol indicate that the hepatic cholesterol content of the cholesterol-fed resistant rabbit remains markedly lower than it does in normal animals fed the same diet. The only mechanism for removal of significant quantities of cholesterol carbon from the body is via the fecal excretion of cholesterol, neutral sterol metabolites, and bile acids. In comparison to the basal, low-cholesterol diet, we observed that cholesterol-fed resistant rabbits had increased excretion of , while excretion of this bile  by cholesterol-fed normal rabbit remained similar to basal diet levels. Deoxycholic  excretion, the other main bile  excreted in the feces of rabbits, was decreased in response to cholesterol challenge in animals with either resistant or normal phenotypes, but the decrease was significantly less in the resistant rabbits. Thus, the resistant rabbits excreted relatively more  and deoxycholic  than did the cholesterol-fed normal rabbit. The difference in bile  excretion was also manifest by a higher than normal level of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA in the livers from resistant versus normal rabbits. As cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is the putative rate-limiting step of bile  synthesis, we believe that the increased excretion of bile acids by resistant animals is due, at least in part, to increased levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4745517>Hypercholesterolemic effect in the female rat of egg yolk versus crystalline cholesterol dissolved in lard.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4703225>The different effects on the serum lipids and fecal steroids of high carbohydrate diets given orally or intravenously.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis that diets high in carbohydrate produce  in man was tested in new experiments which provided all calories either by the intravenous route or orally. After a base-line general diet, eight healthy men were fed fat-free diets consisting of 80% of the calories from glucose and 20% from an amino  hydrolysate. The calories were adequate to maintain body weight. The solutions (1 cal/ml) were infused by constant drip over a 24 h period through either a superior vena cava catheter or a nasogastric tube. Each feeding was for 12 days in sequence but assigned in random order. The high CHO diet given orally, as expected, increased the mean base-line serum triglyceride level from 176+/-29 (SE) to 274+/-47. The identical diet given intravenously (i.v.) failed to produce hypertriglyceridemia; triglyceride levels were not significantly changed, 154+/-37, nor were blood glucose levels. Serum insulin levels were higher during the intravenous feeding. In contrast, both i.v. and oral feedings greatly lowered mean serum cholesterol concentration from the base-line value of 220+/-13 mg/100 ml to 135+/-11 and 151+/-13, respectively. However, the serum cholesterol level was significantly lower (P < 0.01) with the intravenous feeding than with the oral feeding. In addition, the fecal excretion of both neutral sterols and bile acids diminished greatly during the period of intravenous feeding. The fecal mass was likewise decreased. The bacterial conversion of cholesterol to conprostanol did not occur with either intravenous or oral feeding, but with both regimens secondary bile acids predominated, as usual, in the bile  fraction of the stool. These results emphasize the key role of the intestinal mucosa in the etiology of carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia and as a direct or indirect contributor to plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the absence of dietary lipids.

Bile acids are known to induce Ca signals and necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells but the effects of bile acids on stellate cells are unexplored. Here we show that cholate and taurocholate elicit more dramatic Ca signals and necrosis in stellate cells compared to the adjacent acinar cells in pancreatic lobules; whereas taurolithocholic  3-sulfate primarily affects acinar cells. Ca signals and necrosis are strongly dependent on extracellular Ca as well as Na ; and Na -dependent transport plays an important role in the overall bile  uptake in pancreatic stellate cells. Bile -mediated pancreatic damage can be further escalated by bradykinin-induced signals in stellate cells and thus killing of stellate cells by bile acids might have important implications in acute biliary pancreatitis.Acute biliary pancreatitis, caused by bile reflux into the pancreas, is a serious condition characterised by premature activation of digestive enzymes within acinar cells, followed by necrosis and inflammation. Bile acids are known to induce pathological Ca signals and necrosis in acinar cells. However, bile -elicited signalling events in stellate cells remain unexplored. This is the first study to demonstrate the pathophysiological effects of bile acids on stellate cells in two experimental models: ex vivo (mouse pancreatic lobules) and in vitro (human cells). Sodium cholate and taurocholate induced cytosolic Ca elevations in stellate cells, larger than those elicited simultaneously in the neighbouring acinar cells. In contrast, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S), known to induce Ca oscillations in acinar cells, had only minor effects on stellate cells in lobules. The dependence of the Ca signals on extracellular Na and the presence of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) indicate a Na -dependent bile  uptake mechanism in stellate cells. Bile  treatment caused necrosis predominantly in stellate cells, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca and significantly reduced in the absence of Na , showing that bile-dependent cell death was a downstream event of Ca signals. Finally, combined application of TLC-S and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin caused more extensive necrosis in both stellate and acinar cells than TLC-S alone. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism by which bile acids promote pancreatic pathology. This involves not only signalling in acinar cells but also in stellate cells.© 2016 The Authors The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30647128>Bile  analogues are activators of pyrin inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are critical metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract and contribute to maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis through cross-talk with the gut microbiota. The conversion of bile acids by the gut microbiome is now recognized as a factor affecting both host metabolism and immune responses, but its physiological roles remain unclear. We conducted a screen for microbiome metabolites that would function as inflammasome activators and herein report the identification of 12-oxo- (BAA485), a potential microbiome-derived bile  metabolite. We demonstrate that the more potent analogue 11-oxo-12-hydroxylithocholic  methyl ester (BAA473) can induce secretion of interleukin-18 (IL-18) through activation of the inflammasome in both myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen with compound induced pyroptosis in THP-1 cells, we identified that inflammasome activation by BAA473 is pyrin-dependent (). To our knowledge, the bile  analogues BAA485 and BAA473 are the first small molecule activators of the pyrin inflammasome. We surmise that pyrin inflammasome activation through microbiota-modified bile  metabolites such as BAA473 and BAA485 plays a role in gut microbiota regulated intestinal immune response.

We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota.

We hypothesized that LCA can modulate oxidative stress to exert cytostatic effects in breast cancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with LCA decreased nuclear factor-2 (NRF2) expression and increased Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) expression via activation of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Altered NRF2 and KEAP1 expression subsequently led to decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), an antioxidant enzyme, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant enzymes increased cytostatic effects via increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological induction of NRF2 with RA839, tBHQ, or by thiol antioxidants. The expression of key components of the LCA-elicited cytostatic pathway (iNOS and 4HNE) gradually decreased as the breast cancer stage advanced. The level of lipid peroxidation in tumors negatively correlated with the mitotic index. The overexpression of iNOS, nNOS, CAR, KEAP1, NOX4, and TGR5 or the downregulation of NRF2 correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients, except for triple negative cases. Taken together, LCA, a metabolite of the gut microbiome, elicits oxidative stress that slows down the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The LCA-oxidative stress protective pathway is lost as breast cancer progresses, and the loss correlates with poor prognosis.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108740>Deciphering the role of hydrophobic and hydrophilic bile acids in angiogenesis using  and  model systems.</a></h2><p>Bile acids have emerged as strong signaling molecules capable of influencing various biological processes like inflammation, apoptosis, cancer progression and atherosclerosis depending on their chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the effect of major hydrophobic bile acids  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) and hydrophilic bile acids cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on angiogenesis. We employed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and zebrafish embryos as model systems for studying the role of bile acids in angiogenesis. Our studies revealed that the hydrophilic CDCA enhanced ectopic vessel formation as observed by the increase in the number of sub-intestinal vessels (SIVs) in the zebrafish embryos. The pro-angiogenic role of CDCA was further corroborated by  vessel formation studies performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas the hydrophobic LCA reduced tubulogenesis and was toxic to the zebrafish embryos. We validated that CDCA enhances angiogenesis by increasing the expression of vascular growth factor receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9) and by decreasing the expression of adhesion protein vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin). Our work implicates that the nature of bile acids plays a critical role in dictating their biological functions and in regulating angiogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147381>Donor  characteristics drive effects of faecal microbiota transplantation on recipient insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and intestinal transit time.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism. Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

We have determined effects of caffeine and its xanthine metabolites on pancreatic acinar IPR-mediated Ca signalling and experimental AP.Isolated pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to secretagogues, uncaged IP or toxins that induce AP and effects of xanthines, non-xanthine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP/cGMP) determined. The intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]), mitochondrial depolarisation and necrosis were assessed by confocal microscopy. Effects of xanthines were evaluated in caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP), taurolithocholic  3-sulfate-induced AP (TLCS-AP) or palmitoleic  plus ethanol-induced AP (fatty  ethyl ester AP (FAEE-AP)). Serum xanthines were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Caffeine, dimethylxanthines and non-xanthine PDE inhibitors blocked IP-mediated Ca oscillations, while monomethylxanthines had little effect. Caffeine and dimethylxanthines inhibited uncaged IP-induced Ca rises, toxin-induced Ca release, mitochondrial depolarisation and necrotic cell death pathway activation; cAMP/cGMP did not inhibit toxin-induced Ca rises. Caffeine significantly ameliorated CER-AP with most effect at 25\u2005mg/kg (seven injections hourly); paraxanthine or theophylline did not. Caffeine at 25\u2005mg/kg significantly ameliorated TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP. Mean total serum levels of dimethylxanthines and trimethylxanthines peaked at >2\u2005mM with 25\u2005mg/kg caffeine but at <100\u2005µM with 25\u2005mg/kg paraxanthine or theophylline.Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites reduced pathological IPR-mediated pancreatic acinar Ca signals but only caffeine ameliorated experimental AP.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30647436>A pilot study of the effect of phospholipid curcumin on serum metabolomic profile in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Curcumin, a natural polyphenol compound in the spice turmeric, has been found to have potent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut . Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin, a product isolated from an edible botanical Kava against  (LCA)-induced cholestasis, and further to elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anticholestatic effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The cholestatic liver injury model was established by intraperitoneal injections of LCA in C57BL/6 mice. Serum biomarkers and H&E staining were used to identify the amelioration of cholestasis after yangonin treatment. Mice hepatocytes culture, gene silencing experiment, real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying yangonin hepatoprotection. The results indicated that yangonin promoted bile  efflux and reduced hepatic uptake via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 expression and an inhibition in Ntcp, all of which are responsible for bile  transport. Furthermore, yangonin reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile  metabolism through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1, which are involved in bile  synthesis and metabolism. In addition, yangonin suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro evidences showed that the changes in transporters and enzymes induced by yangonin were abrogated when FXR was silenced. In conclusions, yangonin produces protective effect against LCA-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis due to FXR-mediated regulation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications.

CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA\xa0±\xa0PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA\xa0±\xa0CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC\xa0±\xa0CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+\xa0IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity.

Importantly, AUR was found to significantly decrease the mortality of cholestatic mice. Dynamic change analysis of bile acids and gene analysis revealed that AUR promoted bile  efflux from liver into intestine via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep and Mrp2 expression, and reduced hepatic uptake through an inhibition in Ntcp. Furthermore, AUR reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile  metabolism through an induction in Sult2a1. In addition, AUR promoted liver repair through an induction in liver regeneration-related gene, and suppressed liver  through repressing -related gene NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. However, the changes in these genes and protein, as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro.

However, whether renalase reduces acute injury associated with pancreatitis is unknown. Here, we used both  and  murine models of acute pancreatitis to study renalase's effects on this condition.

Renalase also blocked cerulein-induced cell injury and histological changes. In the  cerulein model of pancreatitis, genetic deletion of renalase resulted in more severe disease, and administering rRNLS to cerulein-exposed WT mice after pancreatitis onset was protective. Because pathological increases in acinar cell cytosolic calcium levels are central to the initiation of acute pancreatitis, we also investigated whether rRNLS could function through its binding protein, plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4b (PMCA4b), which excretes calcium from cells. We found that PMCA4b is expressed in both murine and human acinar cells and that a PMCA4b-selective inhibitor worsens pancreatitis-induced injury and blocks the protective effects of rRNLS. These findings suggest that renalase is a protective plasma protein that reduces acinar cell injury through a plasma membrane calcium ATPase.

Bile acids are known to induce Ca signals and necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells but the effects of bile acids on stellate cells are unexplored. Here we show that cholate and taurocholate elicit more dramatic Ca signals and necrosis in stellate cells compared to the adjacent acinar cells in pancreatic lobules; whereas taurolithocholic  3-sulfate primarily affects acinar cells. Ca signals and necrosis are strongly dependent on extracellular Ca as well as Na ; and Na -dependent transport plays an important role in the overall bile  uptake in pancreatic stellate cells. Bile -mediated pancreatic damage can be further escalated by bradykinin-induced signals in stellate cells and thus killing of stellate cells by bile acids might have important implications in acute biliary pancreatitis.Acute biliary pancreatitis, caused by bile reflux into the pancreas, is a serious condition characterised by premature activation of digestive enzymes within acinar cells, followed by necrosis and inflammation. Bile acids are known to induce pathological Ca signals and necrosis in acinar cells. However, bile -elicited signalling events in stellate cells remain unexplored. This is the first study to demonstrate the pathophysiological effects of bile acids on stellate cells in two experimental models: ex vivo (mouse pancreatic lobules) and in vitro (human cells). Sodium cholate and taurocholate induced cytosolic Ca elevations in stellate cells, larger than those elicited simultaneously in the neighbouring acinar cells. In contrast, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S), known to induce Ca oscillations in acinar cells, had only minor effects on stellate cells in lobules. The dependence of the Ca signals on extracellular Na and the presence of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) indicate a Na -dependent bile  uptake mechanism in stellate cells. Bile  treatment caused necrosis predominantly in stellate cells, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca and significantly reduced in the absence of Na , showing that bile-dependent cell death was a downstream event of Ca signals. Finally, combined application of TLC-S and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin caused more extensive necrosis in both stellate and acinar cells than TLC-S alone. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism by which bile acids promote pancreatic pathology. This involves not only signalling in acinar cells but also in stellate cells.© 2016 The Authors The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group).

AP severity was assessed at 24\xa0h by serum biochemistry, multiple cytokines and histopathology.TLCS-AP, FAEE-AP and CER-AP resulted in characteristic elevations in serum amylase and cytokine levels, increased pancreatic trypsin and myeloperoxidase activity, typical pancreatic histopathological changes and lung injury. Treatment with I-BET-762 significantly reduced biochemical, cytokine and histopathological responses in TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP, but not CER-AP.These results suggest that in different forms of AP there are significant differences in the epigenetic control of gene transcription contributing to the severity of disease responses.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR), a xenobiotic sensor and signaling intermediate for certain host-bacterial metabolites, has been shown to negatively regulate TLR4 signaling. Here we investigated the relationship between PXR and TLR4 in the developing murine intestine and explored the capacity of PXR to modulate inflammatory pathways involved in experimental NEC.MethodsWild-type and PXR mice were studied at various time points of development in an experimental model of NEC. In addition, we studied the ability of the secondary bile   (LCA), a known PXR agonist in liver, to activate intestinal PXR and reduce NEC-related intestinal .ResultsWe found a reciprocal relationship between the developmental expression of PXR and TLR4 in wild-type murine intestine, with PXR acting to reduce TLR4 expression by decreasing TLR4 mRNA stability. In addition, PXR mice exhibited a remarkably heightened severity of disease in experimental NEC. Moreover, LCA attenuated intestinal proinflammatory responses in the early stages of experimental NEC.ConclusionThese findings provide proactive insights into the regulation of TLR4 in the developing intestine. Targeting PXR may be a novel approach for NEC prevention.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127325>Acinar injury and early cytokine response in human acute biliary pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Clinical acute pancreatitis (AP) is marked by an early phase of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with multiorgan dysfunction (MODS), and a late phase characterized by sepsis with MODS. However, the mechanisms of acinar injury in human AP and the associated systemic  are not clearly understood. This study, for the first time, evaluated the early interactions of bile  induced human pancreatic acinar injury and the resulting cytokine response. We exposed freshly procured resected human pancreata to taurolithocolic  (TLCS) and evaluated for acinar injury, cytokine release and interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We observed autophagy in acinar cells in response to TLCS exposure. There was also time-dependent release of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α from the injured acini that resulted in activation of PBMCs. We also observed that cytokines secreted by activated PBMCs resulted in acinar cell apoptosis and further cytokine release from them. Our data suggests that the earliest immune response in human AP originates within the acinar cell itself, which subsequently activates circulating PBMCs leading to SIRS. These findings need further detailed evaluation so that specific therapeutic targets to curb SIRS and resulting early adverse outcomes could be identified and tested.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645370>Regulations of bile  metabolism in mouse models with hydrophobic bile  composition.</a></h2><p>The bile  (BA) composition in mice is substantially different from that in humans. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver  was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878403>Effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone in murine acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Although oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP), antioxidant therapy in patients has so far been discouraging. The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10\u2009µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels. Our results suggest that MitoQ would be inappropriate for AP therapy, consistent with prior antioxidant evaluations in this disease.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862015>Secondary Bile Acids and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Colon: A Focus on Colonic Microbiome, Cell Proliferation, Inflammation, and Cancer.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids (BAs) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), two major types of bacterial metabolites in the colon, cause opposing effects on colonic inflammation at chronically high physiological levels. Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

Sialyltransferases (STs) catalyze the transfer of sialic  residues to non-reducing oligosaccharide chains of proteins and lipids, using cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic  (CMP-Neu5Ac) as the donor. Elevated sialyltransferase activity leads to overexpression of cell surface sialic acids and contributes to many disease developments, such as cancer and . Therefore, sialyltransferases are considered as potential drug targets for disease treatment. Inhibitors of sialyltransferases thus are of medicinal interest, especially for the cancer therapy. In addition, sialyltransferase inhibitors are useful tool to study sialyltransferase function and related mechanisms. This review highlights recent development of inhibitors of sialyltransferases reported since 2004.

Species differences exist in BA composition, synthesis, and regulation; however presently, there is no in vitro reproducible cell model to perform studies on BAs in humans. We have evaluated the capacity of the human HepaRG cell line to synthesize, conjugate, and secrete BAs, and analyzed changes in BA content and profile after cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. Our data show that HepaRG cells produced normal BAs at daily levels comparable, though in different proportions, to those measured in primary human hepatocytes. A 4-h treatment with CsA led to BA accumulation and profile changes associated with occurrence of cholestatic features, while after 24 h BAs were decreased in cell layers and increased in media. The latter effects resulted from reduced function of BA uptake transporter (Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide), reduced expression of BA metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P4507A1, cytochrome P4508B1, and cytochrome P45027A1, and induction of alternative basolateral transporters. Noteworthy, HepaRG cells incubated in a 2% serum-supplemented medium showed dose-dependent accumulation of the cytotoxic BA  in a nonsulfoconjugated form associated with early inhibition of the canalicular transporter MRP2 and sulfotransferase 2A1. In summary, our data bring the first demonstration that an in vitro human liver cell line is able to produce and secrete conjugated BAs, and to accumulate endogenous BAs transiently, concomitantly to occurrence of various other cholestatic features following CsA treatment. Retention of the hydrophobic  supports its toxic role in drug-induced cholestasis. Overall, our results argue on the suitability of HepaRG cells for investigating mechanisms involved in the development of the disease.© The Author 2015.

Mitochondria are the main source of ROS as by-products of electron transport chain. Most of the time the intestine responds adequately against the oxidative stress, but with aging or under conditions that exacerbate the ROS and/or RNS production, the defenses are not enough and contribute to developing intestinal pathologies. The endogenous antioxidant defense system in gut includes glutathione (GSH) and GSH-dependent enzymes as major components. When the ROS and/or RNS production is exacerbated, oxidative stress occurs and the intestinal Ca absorption is inhibited. GSH depleting drugs such as DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, menadione and sodium deoxycholate inhibit the Ca transport from lumen to blood by alteration in the protein expression and/or activity of molecules involved in the Ca transcellular and paracellular pathways through mechanisms of oxidative stress, apoptosis and/or autophagy. Quercetin, melatonin,  and ursodeoxycholic acids block the effect of those drugs in experimental animals by their antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and/or anti-autophagic properties.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired  at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens.

We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3749801>Bile  metabolism in patients with Crohn's  in terminal ileum.</a></h2><p>Bile  metabolism was studied by means of the fractional turnover rate or orally ingested 14C-labeled taurocholic  and by gas chromatographic determination of fecal excretion of the bile acids cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA).

The unoperated group of CD patients did not show significant increase in bile  excretion in the stools in contrast to the CD patients with ileal resection. The fecal excretion consisted mostly of primary bile acids, and a significant correlation between length of resection and bile  excretion was found (rs = 0.81, p less than 0.01). The fractional turnover rate of CA + DCA was significantly increased in both unoperated (0.21 l/day) and operated (0.44 l/day) patients compared with normal controls (0.06 l/day). The bile  pool of CA + DCA, however, was normal in patients with ileal resections, indicating a compensatory increase in bile  synthesis. In unoperated patients the bile  pool of CA + DCA was slightly decreased (3.1 mmol) compared with operated patients (6.2 mmol) and normal controls (4.8 mmol). The pool size was not significantly correlated to mean transit time of dietary residue, feces excretion, loss of weight, or amount of fat in feces.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460897>New insights into autoimmune cholangitis through animal models.</a></h2><p>Improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune-mediated cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as well as the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools for these disorders critically depends on easily reproducible animal models. Recently, several spontaneous mouse models for PBC (not requiring previous manipulations for breakdown of immunotolerance) have been reported, including NOD.c3c4 and NOD.c3c4-derived mice, IL-2Ralpha(-/-) mice, dominant negative TGF-beta receptor II mice and Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice. To date, no animal model exhibits all of the attributes of PSC. Rodent models induced by bacterial cell components or colitis may help to explain the strong association between PSC and . Other models include direct injury to biliary epithelia, peribiliary vascular endothelia or portal venous endothelia. Mice with targeted disruption of the Mdr2 (Abcb4) gene encoding a canalicular phospholipid flippase (Mdr2(-/-) mice) spontaneously develop sclerosing cholangitis with macroscopic and microscopic features of human PSC. Another example for a transporter involved in the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR/ABCC7). Xenobiotics and drugs may also lead to bile duct injury and biliary fibrosis via direct toxic and indirect immune-mediated injury. Hydrophobic bile acids, such as , cause bile duct injury and destructive cholangitis with periductal fibrosis resembling sclerosing cholangitis. These models have enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of PBC and PSC and will hopefully result in improved treatment of these disorders.Copyright 2010 S.

We examined TGR5 expression in human peripheral blood monocytes, several types of in vitro differentiated macrophages (Mϕs) and dendritic cells.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine.

Evidence suggests that this effect is not mediated by , the intestinal metabolite of chenodeoxycholic , but that toxicity is due to the chenodeoxycholic  itself. In vitro cytotoxicity of bile salts is positively proportional to their detergent effect, which is, on the other hand, related to their hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance. We hypothesize that in vivo also liver injury can occur when the liver is perfused by an high proportion of strongly detergent bile salts. The more detergent bile salts are unconjugated or glycine conjugated, while the lesser are taurine conjugated and sulfated. Within each class the following order of decreasing detergent power can be indicated:  greater than deoxycholic greater than chenodeoxycholic greater than cholic greater than ursodeoxycholic . Besides chronic exogenous administration of chenodeoxycholic or deoxycholic acids, conditions in which the liver is perfused by an high mass of highly detergent bile salts are those characterized by an enhanced intestinal biodegradation of bile salts. These conditions, which are common features of some chronic , are frequently associated with liver damage. On the other hand, a normally detergent bile salt pool can become hepatotoxic for liver cells which have already been injured. In this respect, as already reported for increased sulfation, the increased proportion of taurine conjugates and the reduced formation of deoxycholic  in liver cirrhosis can be regarded as protective mechanisms. Liver toxicity induced by bile salts' detergent action can be prevented by favouring tauroconjugation or reducing the intestinal degradation of bile salts or by administering poorly detergent bile salts.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316997>Microbiota-Related Changes in Unconjugated Fecal Bile Acids Are Associated With Naturally Occurring, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in Dogs.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans has recently been associated with altered intestinal microbiota. The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114).

Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028).

Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The PKC inhibitor Go6850 and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) counteracted the suppression of -induced IRbeta and PKB phosphorylation by TLCS. Rapamycin and dibutyryl-cAMP, which inhibited basal signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), restored -induced PKB- but not IRbeta phosphorylation.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of  (LCA) on the lipogenesis of breast cancer cells. The putative cytotoxic effects of LCA on these cells were also examined.The effects of LCA on breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were studied using MTT viability assays, Annexin-FITC and Akt phosphorylation assays to evaluate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays to assess the expression of the bile  receptor TGR5 and the estrogen receptor ERα, and genes and proteins involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, p53) and lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, FASN, ACACA). Intracellular lipid droplets were visualized using Oil Red O staining.We found that LCA induces TGR5 expression and exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of lipid droplets compared to untreated control cells.

It was found that this hydrophobic bile  is also a selective anti-tumor chemical compound; it kills different types of cultured cancer cells if used at concentrations that do not compromise the viability of non-cancerous cells. These studies have revealed that yeast can be successfully used as a model organism for high-throughput screens aimed at the discovery of selectively acting anti-tumor small molecules. Two metabolic traits of rapidly proliferating fermenting yeast, namely aerobic glycolysis and lipogenesis, are known to be similar to those of cancer cells. The mechanisms underlying these key metabolic features of cancer cells and fermenting yeast have been established; such mechanisms are discussed in this review. We also suggest how a yeast-based chemical genetic screen can be used for the high-throughput development of selective anti-tumor pharmaceuticals that kill only cancer cells. This screen consists of searching for chemical compounds capable of increasing the abundance of membrane lipids enriched in unsaturated fatty acids that would therefore be toxic only to rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells and fermenting yeast.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20359477>Possible protective role of pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile in -induced hepatotoxicity through enhanced hepatic .</a></h2><p> (LCA) feeding causes both liver parenchymal and cholestatic damages in experimental animals. Although pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)-mediated protection against LCA-induced hepatocyte injury may be explained by induction of drug metabolizing enzymes, the protection from the delayed cholestasis remains incompletely understood. Thus, the PCN-mediated protective mechanism has been studied from the point of modification of lipid metabolism. At an early stage of LCA feeding, an imbalance of biliary bile  and phospholipid excretion was observed. Co-treatment with PCN reversed the increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and hepatic hydrophobic bile  levels. LCA feeding decreased hepatic mRNA levels of several fatty - and phospholipid-related genes before elevation of serum ALT and ALP activities. On the other hand, PCN co-treatment reversed the decrease in the mRNA levels and hepatic levels of phospholipids, triglycerides and free fatty acids. PCN co-treatment also reversed the decrease in biliary phospholipid output in LCA-fed mice. Treatment with PCN alone increased hepatic phospholipid, triglyceride and free fatty  concentrations. Hepatic fatty  and phosphatidylcholine synthetic activities increased in mice treated with PCN alone or PCN and LCA, compared to control mice, whereas these activities decreased in LCA-fed mice. These results suggest the possibility that PCN-mediated stimulation of  contributes to the protection from -induced hepatotoxicity.(c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool fat and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

As far as 11-hydroxylated glucocorticoids are concerned 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) is the most important enzyme charged with target cell metabolism. Inhibition of 11 beta-HSD function either by genetically transmitted deficiency or by exogenous enzyme inhibitors causes severe pathophysiological derangements, which result in a syndrome of "apparent mineralocorticoid excess". In the present paper we have tested whether or not endogenous inhibitors of this enzyme system might exist. The effects of the main naturally occurring mono-, di-, and trihydroxylated bile acids in man on 11 beta-HSD have been studied in in vitro experiments. Using rat renal microsomes it could be demonstrated that unconjugated bile acids of all three classes as well as the corresponding glycine and taurine amidates effectively inhibit oxidative as well as reductive activity of 11 beta-HSD, with  and chenodeoxycholic  being the most potent compounds. It is concluded that bile acids are potent endogenous inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD and, therefore, could participate in abnormalities of cortisol metabolism observed in liver cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction and, possibly, after ingestion of bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14518282>[Hepatocellular transport of bile acids and organic anions in infection and SIRS--evidence for different mechanisms for regulating membrane transport proteins].</a></h2><p>The alteration of proinflammatory mediators during sepsis and SIRS results in a large variety of adaptive changes of metabolic and physiologic variables. This study investigated the alterations of hepatocellular transport in a rat sepsis model (LPS i.p.) as well as in a model inducing SIRS by sterile abscess formation (turpentine i.m.). Two bile acids (Cholyltaurine and Chemodeoxycholyltaurine) and one organic anion (Sulfolithocholyltaurine) were used as marker substrates to investigate the time course of hepatocellular transport function. Experiments were performed in isolated perfused rat livers and plasma membrane vesicles. During sepsis, both, the transport of bile acids and that of the organic anion was markedly reduced. In contrast no alteration of transport was detected during SIRS. However, biliary secretion of glutathione (+90%) and bile  independent bile flow (%) were increased. mRNA levels of bile  and organic anion transport proteins were reduced. The lowest values were noted 12 h after injection of LPS or turpentine. Almost unchanged kinetic parameters during SIRS pointed to a normal population of transporters with regard to quantity and substrate affinity. Therefore it seems that transcriptional regulation plays an important role for the expression of transport proteins during sepsis, whereas posttranscriptional regulation may be of importance during SIRS.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids. References given in this overview section are limited to general publications on bile  metabolism and use as therapeutic agents. Drug Class: Gastrointestinal Agents: Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic ).

SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content.

GLP-1 regulates gut motility, appetite, islet function, and glucose homeostasis, whereas GLP-2 enhances intestinal nutrient absorption. GLP-1R agonists are used to treat diabetes and , and a GLP-2R agonist is approved to treat short bowel syndrome. Unexpectedly, reports of gallbladder disease have been associated with the use of both GLP-1R and GLP-2R agonists and after bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms remain unknown.We investigated whether GLP-1 or GLP-2 acutely controls gallbladder (GB) volume and whether GLP-2 regulates GB muscle activity in mice.

GLP-2 regulation of GB volume was assessed in wildtype,  and  mice. The effect of GLP-2 on GB smooth muscle (GBSM) calcium transients was characterized .Acute administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 lowered glucose but had no effect on GB volume in mice. In contrast, GLP-2 rapidly enhanced GB filling in a dose-dependent manner, actions maintained in the presence of cholecystokinin, and mediated through the canonical GLP-2R. GLP-2 also rapidly induced immediate early gene expression in GB, consistent with detection of the endogenous  in GB RNA.

Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28823924>A novel partial agonist of GPBA reduces blood glucose level in a murine glucose tolerance test.</a></h2><p>GPBA is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by bile acids. Because activation of GPBA leads to increased cAMP levels and secretion of incretins and insulin, GPBA has been proposed as a promising drug target for the treatment of . Previously, we have developed a ligand-screening system to identify novel agonists of GPBA by means of a fusion protein of GPBA with G protein stimulatory α subunit (Gsα) and by a [S]GTPγS-binding assay. To express the GPBA-Gsα fusion protein, transgenic silkworms were employed in this study, and cell membrane fractions were prepared from their fat body or pupae. We applied them to the screening of a chemical library that contains 10,625 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository (NPDepo). Eventually, a unique partial agonist, GUM2, was successfully identified. Our results indicated that the GPCR-Gα fusion proteins were beneficial for ligand identification and that the transgenic silkworms were useful for large-scale production of GPCRs. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing GPBA, GUM2 showed 50% effective concentration (EC) of 3.5 ± 2.4μM and induced GPBA internalization as effectively as did an endogenous agonist, TLC. We also confirmed that GUM2 stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Moreover, a single 2mg/kg dose of GUM2 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in mice during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test even though GUM2 is only a partial agonist with a low intrinsic activity. We concluded that GUM2 is a good candidate for research on GPBA signaling under physiological conditions and for the development of GPBA-targeting therapeutic compounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the metabolism of bile acids and increased the bile  efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR. These lignans may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of cholestatic liver injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that LCA can modulate oxidative stress to exert cytostatic effects in breast cancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with LCA decreased nuclear factor-2 (NRF2) expression and increased Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) expression via activation of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Altered NRF2 and KEAP1 expression subsequently led to decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), an antioxidant enzyme, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant enzymes increased cytostatic effects via increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological induction of NRF2 with RA839, tBHQ, or by thiol antioxidants. The expression of key components of the LCA-elicited cytostatic pathway (iNOS and 4HNE) gradually decreased as the breast cancer stage advanced. The level of lipid peroxidation in tumors negatively correlated with the mitotic index. The overexpression of iNOS, nNOS, CAR, KEAP1, NOX4, and TGR5 or the downregulation of NRF2 correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients, except for triple negative cases. Taken together, LCA, a metabolite of the gut microbiome, elicits oxidative stress that slows down the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The LCA-oxidative stress protective pathway is lost as breast cancer progresses, and the loss correlates with poor prognosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29412511>Comprehensive bile  profiling in hereditary intrahepatic cholestasis: Genetic and clinical correlations.</a></h2><p>Genetic defects causing dysfunction in bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) lead to liver diseases. ABCB11 mutations alter the bile  metabolome. We asked whether profiling plasma bile acids could reveal compensatory mechanisms and track genetic and clinical status.We compared plasma bile acids in 17 ABCB11-mutated patients, 35 healthy controls and 12 genetically undiagnosed cholestasis patients by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/multiple-reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (UPLC/MRM-MS). We developed an index to rank bile  hydrophobicity, and thus toxicity, based on LC retention times. We recruited 42 genetically diagnosed hereditary cholestasis patients, of whom 12 were presumed to have impaired BSEP function but carried mutations in genes other than ABCB11, and 8 healthy controls, for further verification.The overall hydrophobicity indices of total bile acids in both the ABCB11-mutated group (11.89\xa0±\xa01.07\xa0min) and the undiagnosed cholestasis group (11.46\xa0±\xa01.07\xa0min) were lower than those of healthy controls (13.69\xa0±\xa00.77\xa0min) (both p\xa0<\xa00.005). This was owing to increased bile  modifications. Secondary bile acids were detected in patients without BSEP expression, suggesting biliary bile  secretion through alternative routes. A diagnostic panel comprising  (LCA), tauro-LCA, glyco-LCA and hyocholic  was identified that could differentiate the ABCB11-mutated cohort from healthy controls and undiagnosed cholestasis patients (AUC=0.946, p\xa0<\xa00.0001) and, in non-ABCB11-mutated cholestasis patients, could distinguish BSEP dysfunction from normal BSEP function (9/12 vs 0/38, p\xa0<\xa00.0000001).Profiling of plasma bile acids has provided insights into cholestasis alleviation and may be useful for the clinical management of cholestatic diseases.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles.

PC patients administered drugs locally in the tumor region, such as in intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPCh), suffer from low drug retention time and tumor penetration. Herein, we synthesized a  (LCA)-conjugated disulfide-linked polyethyleneimine (ssPEI) micelle (LAPMi) nanoconstruct by covalently conjugating ssPEI and LCA, thereby forming positive charged nanomicellar structures loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) (LAPMi-PTX) for IPCh. The incorporation of a positive surface charge aided in prolonging the peritoneal retention time, presumably via ascites-induced protein corona formation, and the subsequent size expansion caused resistance against undesired clearance through lymphatic openings. Furthermore, preferential tumor penetration by LAPMi-PTX is attributable to the permeation-enhancing properties of LCA, and the subsequent tumor activatable drug release was induced by the presence of disulfide linkages. By integrating these properties, LAPMi exhibited prolonged peritoneal residence time, enhanced tumor permeation and chemotherapeutic effect evidenced by in\xa0vitro, tumor spheroid and in\xa0vivo studies. Importantly, our strategy enabled significant PC inhibition and increased the overall survival rate of tumor-bearing mice.

Dynamic changes in bile  composition appeared throughout the enterohepatic circulation of the BAs; taurine- and glycine-conjugated BAs and free BAs had different dynamic homeostasis levels in the circulatory system. cholic  (CA), beta-muricholic  (beta-MCA),  (LCA), glycocholic  (GCA) and taurocholic  (TCA) greatly fluctuated in the bile  pool under physiological conditions. Taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids constituted more than 90% in the bile and liver, whereas GCA and TCA accounted for more than half of the total bile acids and the secretion of bile mainly via conjugating with taurine. While over 80% of BAs in plasma were unconjugated bile acids, CA and HDCA were the most abundant elements. Unconjugated bile acids constituted more than 90% in the intestine, and CA, beta-MCA and HDCA were the top three bile acids in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum content, but LCA and HDCA were highest in the cecum and colon content. As the main secondary bile  converted by microflora in the intestine, LCA was enriched in the cecum and DCA mostly in the colon. As endogenous substances, the concentrations of plasma BAs were closely related to time rhythm and diet. In conclusion, analyzing detailed BA profiles in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in a single run is possible using LC-MS/MS.

Expression of MAFG and MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, MAT2A, and c-MYC, but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples correlated with hepatitis B, vascular invasion, and shorter survival times of patients.Expression of MAFG increases in cells and tissues with cholestasis, as well as in human cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens; high expression levels correlate with tumor progression and reduced survival time.

Twenty three monoacetyl, diacetyl, and ester derivatives of deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic, , and cholic acids, 15 of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase-catalyzed acetylation, esterification, and alcoholysis reactions in very good to excellent yield and a highly regioselective way. Among them, acetylated ester products, in which the lipase catalyzed both reactions in one pot, were obtained. The influence of various reaction parameters in the enzymatic reactions, such as enzyme source, nucleophile/substrate ratio, enzyme/substrate ratio, solvent, and temperature, was studied. Some of the reported products are novel, and it is not possible to obtain them satisfactorily by following traditional synthetic procedures. Due to its singular structure containing three hydroxyl groups, cholic  showed a different behavior in the enzymatic reactions, from that observed for the other three bile acids studied. In order to shed light to different behaviors of bile acids in the enzymatic reactions, molecular modeling was applied to substrates and some derivatives.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28343940> Hydroxyamide Destabilizes Cyclin D1 and Induces G/G Arrest by Inhibiting Deubiquitinase USP2a.</a></h2><p>USP2a is a deubiquitinase responsible for stabilization of cyclin D1, a crucial regulator of cell-cycle progression and a proto-oncoprotein overexpressed in numerous cancer types. Here we report that  (LCA) derivatives are inhibitors of USP proteins, including USP2a. The most potent LCA derivative, LCA hydroxyamide (LCAHA), inhibits USP2a, leading to a significant Akt/GSK3β-independent destabilization of cyclin D1, but does not change the expression of p27. This leads to the defects in cell-cycle progression. As a result, LCAHA inhibits the growth of cyclin D1-expressing, but not cyclin D1-negative cells, independently of the p53 status. We show that LCA derivatives may be considered as future therapeutics for the treatment of cyclin D1-addicted p53-expressing and p53-defective cancer types.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Bile acids are a component of gastric refluxate and have previously been implicated in the development of fibrosis in other airway subsites. There is clear evidence that bile acids reflux into the upper airway. We therefore investigated the potential role of bile acids in the pathophysiology of laryngotracheal fibrosis and stenosis, specifically investigating the highly conserved process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Translational research study.Human primary tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) were challenged with the four most common digestive bile acids (cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and ). EMT markers transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and procollagen proteins were measured in the supernatant at 48 hours via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was also used to measure E-cadherin and fibronectin expression.Significantly greater concentrations of TGF-β1 and MMP-9 were measured in the culture supernatants of cells treated with each bile  at 10\u2009µmol/L.  and deoxycholic  induced significantly increased expression of procollagen protein. Upregulation of fibronectin and downregulation of E-cadherin were observed with all bile acids, except for deoxycholic .This is the first proof of principle demonstration that physiologically relevant bile  challenge induces EMT mechanisms in PTECs. This implies a potential role for bile acids in laryngotracheal scarring and airway remodeling of potential translational significance in laryngotracheal stenosis.NA.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

We have determined effects of caffeine and its xanthine metabolites on pancreatic acinar IPR-mediated Ca signalling and experimental AP.Isolated pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to secretagogues, uncaged IP or toxins that induce AP and effects of xanthines, non-xanthine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP/cGMP) determined. The intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]), mitochondrial depolarisation and necrosis were assessed by confocal microscopy. Effects of xanthines were evaluated in caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP), taurolithocholic  3-sulfate-induced AP (TLCS-AP) or palmitoleic  plus ethanol-induced AP (fatty  ethyl ester AP (FAEE-AP)). Serum xanthines were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Caffeine, dimethylxanthines and non-xanthine PDE inhibitors blocked IP-mediated Ca oscillations, while monomethylxanthines had little effect. Caffeine and dimethylxanthines inhibited uncaged IP-induced Ca rises, toxin-induced Ca release, mitochondrial depolarisation and necrotic cell death pathway activation; cAMP/cGMP did not inhibit toxin-induced Ca rises. Caffeine significantly ameliorated CER-AP with most effect at 25\u2005mg/kg (seven injections hourly); paraxanthine or theophylline did not. Caffeine at 25\u2005mg/kg significantly ameliorated TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP. Mean total serum levels of dimethylxanthines and trimethylxanthines peaked at >2\u2005mM with 25\u2005mg/kg caffeine but at <100\u2005µM with 25\u2005mg/kg paraxanthine or theophylline.Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites reduced pathological IPR-mediated pancreatic acinar Ca signals but only caffeine ameliorated experimental AP.

However, these effects have not yet been examined in cholestatic liver dysfunction. Hence, this study aimed to explore the ability of vardenafil, a known phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, to repress  (LCA)-induced cholestatic liver injury and investigate the possible molecular .Male Swiss albino mice were treated with LCA (0.125 mg/g) twice daily for 7 days to induce cholestatic liver damage. Vardenafil was administered 3 days before and throughout the administration of LCA. Serum markers of hepatotoxicity and hepatic nitro-oxidative stress along with antioxidant parameters were measured, and the histopathology of liver tissues was assessed. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes was examined using PCR. The activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and the levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined. NLRP3 inflammasome and its components were studied by PCR and western blot.LCA induced marked cholestatic liver damage as demonstrated by increased serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, and bile acids. Examination of liver specimens confirmed the biochemical results. Nitro-oxidative stress parameters were significantly elevated along with reduced antioxidant capacity in hepatic tissue following LCA administration. LCA suppressed Nrf2 and its target genes and decreased the mRNA expression and binding capacity of Nrf2 as well as the mRNA expression of GCLm, GCLc, Nqo1, and HO-1. Additionally, LCA enhanced the activation of NF-κB, which was accompanied by elevations of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, LCA induced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. LCA increased the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β genes and proteins in hepatic tissue. The activities of IL-1β and caspase-1 were increased in the LCA group. Interestingly, vardenafil ameliorated LCA-induced hepatic injury and alleviated all biochemical, histopathological, and inflammatory parameters.These data elucidated the effects of Nrf2 inhibition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LCA-induced liver injury. The hepatoprotective activity of vardenafil in LCA-induced cholestatic damage may result from the drug\'s ability to activate Nrf2 signaling and prevent the activation of NLRP3, which could suppress the inflammatory responses in hepatic tissue. Thus, vardenafil can be considered a novel anti-inflammatory remedy for cholestatic liver damage.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072966>Functional role of MicroRNA-19b in acinar cell necrosis in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and its functional role in acinar cell necrosis of SD rats were investigated. Twelve SD rats were divided into two groups randomly, including control group and ANP group. The rat ANP models were established by intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine (2400 mg/kg body weight), and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl was injected in the control group. MiRNA chip assay was performed to examine the expression of miRNAs in the pancreas in two different groups. Besides, to further explore the role of miR-19b in ANP in vitro, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate disodium salt (TLC-S) (200 μmol/L) was administrated to treat the rat pancreatic acinar cell line, AR42J, for establishing the ANP cells model. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was adopted to measure the miR-19b expression. Moreover, the mimic miRNA, miRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO) and control vector were used to transfect AR42J cells, the expression of miR-19b was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the necrotizing rate of AR42J cells was detected with AO/EB method. The expression of miR-19b was significantly higher in ANP group than in control group as displayed by the miRNA chip assay. Furthermore, after inducing necrosis of AR42J cells in vitro, the expression of miR-19b was significantly increased by 2.51±0.14 times in comparison with the control group. As revealed by qRT-PCR assay, the expression of miR-19b was 5.94±0.95 times higher in the mimic miRNA group than in the control vector group, companied with an obviously increased acinar cell necrotizing rate (50.3%±1.5% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Moreover, the expression of miR-19b in the miRNA AMO group was 0.38±0.15 times lower than in the control vector group, and the cell necrosis rate was much lower accordingly (23.1%±3.3% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference between the control vector cells and the cells without treatment (P>0.05). The expression of miR-19b was significantly induced in ANP.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA  in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA  and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950256>Living longer through mitochondrial housekeeping.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116898>Engineering 7β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase for Enhanced Ursodeoxycholic  Production by Multiobjective Directed Evolution.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the main active ingredient of natural bear bile powder with multiple pharmacological functions. 7β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) is a key biocatalyst for the synthesis of UDCA.

The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced weight loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the  improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to  and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45\u2009±\u200912\xa0years, mean BMI 45\u2009±\u20097\xa0kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12\xa0months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose  and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration.

This lifespan extension is accompanied by an induction of spargel (srl), the fly homolog of mammalian PPAR-γ co-activator 1α\xa0(PGC1α). In wild-type flies, the administration of antibiotics abrogates both the LCA-mediated lifespan induction as well as the upregulation of srl.It is shown that the secondary bile  LCA significantly induces the mean, the median, and the maximum survival in D. melanogaster.

The investigation necessitated the development of novel synthetic routes for  (LCA) glucuronides (Gluc). Biochemical and cell-based assays were used to demonstrate that hydroxylated LCA analogs were not able to bind VDR. This excludes VDR from mediating their biological and pharmacological activities. Among the synthesized LCA conjugates a novel VDR agonist was identified. LCA Gluc II increased the expression of CYP24A1 in DU145 cancer cells especially in the presence of the endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D3. Furthermore, the methyl ester of LCA was identified as novel VDR antagonist. For the first time, we showed that calcitroic , the assumed inactive final metabolite of vitamin D, was able to activate VDR-mediated transcription to a higher magnitude than bile  LCA. Due to a higher  stability in comparison to vitamin D, a very low toxicity, and high concentration in bile and intestine, calcitroic  is likely to be an important mediator of the protective vitamin D properties against colon cancer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

The complexes of the ligand-binding domain of rat VDR (VDR-LBD) with LCA and its derivatives revealed that the ligands bound to the same ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of VDR-LBD that 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to, but in the opposite orientation; their A-ring was positioned at the top of the LBP, whereas their acyclic tail was located at the bottom of the LBP.

Additional interactions between VDR-LBD and the C-3 substituents of the A-ring were also observed in the complexes, probably related to the observed difference in the potency among the LCA-type ligands.

We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, body weight, blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice. Our studies revealed 5b as a promising antidiabetic candidate.

Metabolomic analysis and gene analysis were used to assess involvement of pregnane X receptor (PXR). Molecular docking, cell-based reporter gene analysis and knockout mice were used to demonstrate the critical role of the PXR pathway in the anti-cholestasis effects of SolB.SolB protected against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. Furthermore, therapeutic treatment with SolB decreased mortality in cholestatic mice. Metabolomics and gene analysis showed that SolB accelerated  of bile acids, promoted bile  efflux into the intestine, and induced hepatic expression of the PXR-target genes Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, and Oatp2, which are involved in bile  homeostasis. Mechanistic studies showed that SolB activated human PXR and up-regulated PXR target genes in human cell lines. Additionally, SolB did not protect Pxr-null mice from liver injury induced by intrahepatic cholestasis, thus providing genetic evidence that the effect of SolB was PXR-dependent.These findings provide direct evidence for the hepatoprotective effects of SolB against cholestasis by activating PXR.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the higher degree of exposure of hydrophobic residues in HRP at elevated temperatures enhances the hydrophobic interaction between HRP and the nanotube wall, resulting in the increased amount of HRP surface adsorption and, hence, the overall amount of encapsulation inside the nanotubes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127404>Investigation of novel metabolites potentially involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease using a UHPLC-QTOF/MS-based metabolomics approach.</a></h2><p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is associated with complex  disorders, but its molecular aetiology remains unclear. Using a novel nontargeted metabolomics approach, we explored the global  perturbation profile for CHD. Blood samples from 150 patients with severe obstructive CHD and 150 angiographically normal controls were collected.  fingerprinting was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) technique. After adjusting for CHD traditional risk factors and  batch, a comprehensive list of 105 metabolites was found to be significantly altered in CHD patients. Among the metabolites identified, six metabolites were discovered to have the strongest correlation with CHD after adjusting for multiple testing: palmitic  (β\u2009=\u20090.205; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), linoleic  (β\u2009=\u20090.133; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), 4-pyridoxic  (β\u2009=\u20090.142; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), phosphatidylglycerol (20:3/2:0) (β\u2009=\u20090.287; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), carnitine (14:1) (β\u2009=\u20090.332; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and  (β\u2009=\u20090.224; p\u2009<\u20090.0001); of these, 4-pyridoxic ,  and phosphatidylglycerol (20:3/2:0) were, to the best of our knowledge, first reported in this study.

Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free-energy minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure-activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound. These findings highlight the importance of free-energy calculations in drug design, confirming that META-D simulations can be used to successfully design novel bioactive compounds.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089729>Divergent effects of resistance and endurance exercise on plasma bile acids, FGF19, and FGF21 in humans.</a></h2><p>Exercise has profound pleiotropic health benefits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

In this study, low molecular weight linear polyethyleneimine (2.5\u2009kDa) was modified by conjugation to a lipid, , and complexed with a natural polysaccharide, dermatan sulfate (DS), to mask extra cationic charges of the modified polymer. In vitro examination revealed that these modifications improved complex stability with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transfection efficiency. This novel ternary polyplex (pDNA/3E/DS) was used to investigate if tumor-targeted radiotherapy led to enhanced accumulation and retention of gene therapy vectors in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Imaging of biodistribution revealed that tumor irradiation led to increased accumulation and retention as well as decreased off-target tissue buildup of pDNA in not only pDNA/3E/DS, but also in associated PEI-based polyplexes and commercial DNA delivery vehicles. The DS-containing complexes developed in this study displayed the greatest increase in tumor-specific pDNA delivery.

T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) luciferase assay was employed to examine the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Downregulation of muscarinic 3 receptor (M3R) was achieved through transfection of corresponding siRNA.We found DCA/LCA to induce CSCs in normal human colonic epithelial cells, as evidenced by the increased proportion of CSCs, elevated levels of several CSC markers, as well as a number of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers together with increased colonosphere formation, drug exclusion, ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression, and induction of M3R, p-EGFR, matrix metallopeptidases, and c-Myc. Inhibition of M3R signaling greatly suppressed DCA/LCA induction of the CSC marker ALDHA1 and also c-Myc mRNA expression as well as transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF.Our results suggest that bile acids, specifically DCA and LCA, induce cancer stemness in colonic epithelial cells by modulating M3R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and thus could be considered promoters of colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29664215>Plasma bile  changes in type 2 diabetes correlated with insulin secretion in two-step hyperglycemic clamp.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) conduct crucial signals in human metabolism. Correlations between changes in plasma BA concentrations, insulin secretion defects, and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans have not been sufficiently investigated. This study explored the trajectories of changes in human plasma BA concentrations and their association with insulin secretion dynamics during a two-step hyperglycemic clamp.Eleven healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 33 drug-naïve T2DM subjects were enrolled in the study. The two-step hyperglycemic clamp consisted of a classic clamp as Step 1 with fasting, followed by a Step 2 clamp after ingestion of a carbohydrate meal, illustrating basal and incretin-amplified insulin responses to glucose. Plasma BA were assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Nine T2DM subjects were followed-up, and the two-step clamp was repeated after 3\u2009months sulfonylurea treatment.Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was lower and  (LCA) and taurocholic  (TCA) were higher in T2DM compared with NGT subjects. The dynamics of plasma UDCA concentrations and the UDCA/LCA ratio was positively correlated with insulin secretion in T2DM subjects and were corrected after treatment. Moreover, fasting ratios of UDCA/LCA and unconjugated/conjugated BAs were correlated with the first phase of insulin secretion in T2DM subjects.The abnormal BA composition in T2DM subjects and its correlation with insulin secretion during the clamp suggest an interaction between BA signals and insulin secretion capacity, and the potential to use fasting plasma BA composition indices to predict and evaluate the progression and prognosis of T2DM.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28538412>Biomarkers of unstable angina pectoris and yangxin decoction intervention: An exploratory metabonomics study of blood plasma.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to explore the related  biomarkers and to observe the effects of Yangxin Decoction (YXD) on plasma  of patients with unstable angina (UA).In total, 10 patients with UA (intervention group) and 10 healthy participants (control group) were recruited for this study from January 2009 to December 2010.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of lipid droplets compared to untreated control cells.

The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin, a product isolated from an edible botanical Kava against  (LCA)-induced cholestasis, and further to elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anticholestatic effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The cholestatic liver injury model was established by intraperitoneal injections of LCA in C57BL/6 mice. Serum biomarkers and H&E staining were used to identify the amelioration of cholestasis after yangonin treatment. Mice hepatocytes culture, gene silencing experiment, real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying yangonin hepatoprotection. The results indicated that yangonin promoted bile  efflux and reduced hepatic uptake via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 expression and an inhibition in Ntcp, all of which are responsible for bile  transport. Furthermore, yangonin reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile   through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1, which are involved in bile  synthesis and . In addition, yangonin suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro evidences showed that the changes in transporters and enzymes induced by yangonin were abrogated when FXR was silenced. In conclusions, yangonin produces protective effect against LCA-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis due to FXR-mediated regulation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cholestasis caused by LCA is characterized by segmental bile duct obstruction, whether OA possesses the beneficial effect on completed obstructive cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that BDL-induced mice liver pathological change, and increase in serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP were all significantly reduced by OA (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Meanwhile, OA also lowered total bilirubin and total bile acids levels in serum, as well as total bile acids level in liver, in contrast, urinary total bile acids output was remarkably up-regulated by OA. Gene expression analysis showed that OA caused significant increased mRNA expression of MRP3 and MRP4 located at hepatic basolateral membrane, and restoration of MRP2 and BSEP located at hepatic cannalicular membrane. Furthermore, significant NRF2 protein accumulation in nucleus was also observed in OA treated mice. In mice primary cultured hepatocytes, the effects of OA on MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4 expression were directly proved to be mediated via NRF2 activation, and BSEP downregulation induced by OA was in part due to FXR antagonism. Luciferase assay performed in Hep G2 cells also illustrated that OA was a partial FXR antagonist.

This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P\u2009=\u2009.002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P\u2009=\u2009.049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3\u2009months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P\u2009=\u20090.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE. Additionally, resolution of clinical activity index in dogs with therapeutically managed CE and bile  dysmetabolism are likely correlated. However, subclinical disease (i.e., microbial dysbiosis) can persist in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.© 2019 The Authors.

From soil samples, we have isolated several strains belonging to genus Pseudomonas that grow efficiently in chemical defined media containing some cyclopentane-perhydro-phenantrene derivatives as carbon sources. Genetic and biochemical studies performed with one of these bacteria (P. putida DOC21) allowed the identification of the genes and enzymes belonging to the 9,10-seco pathway, the route involved in the aerobic assimilation of steroids. In this manuscript, we describe the most relevant methods required for (1) isolation and characterization of these species; (2) determining the chromosomal location, nucleotide sequence, and functional analysis of the catabolic genes (or gene clusters) encoding the enzymes from this pathway; and (3) the tools employed to establish the role of some of the proteins that participate in this route.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102695>Vitamin E analogues differentially inhibit human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)-mediated oxidative metabolism of : Impact of δ-tocotrienol on  cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p> is a cytotoxic bile  oxidized at the C-3 position by human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) to form 3-ketocholanoic , but it is not known whether this metabolite is cytotoxic. Tocotrienols, in their various isomeric forms, are vitamin E analogues. In the present study, the hypothesis to be tested is that tocotrienols inhibit CYP3A-catalyzed  3-oxidation, thereby influencing  cytotoxicity. Our enzyme catalysis experiments indicated that human recombinant CYP3A5 in addition to CYP3A4, liver microsomes, and intestinal microsomes catalyzed  3-oxidation to form 3-ketocholanoic . Liver microsomes with the CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 genotypes were associated with decreased  3-oxidation. α-Tocotrienol, γ-tocotrienol, δ-tocotrienol, and a tocotrienol-rich vitamin E mixture, but not α-tocopherol (a vitamin E analogue), differentially inhibited  3-oxidation catalyzed by liver and intestinal microsomes and recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Compared to  3-oxidation, CYP3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation was inhibited to a lesser extent by α-tocotrienol, γ-tocotrienol, δ-tocotrienol, and a tocotrienol-rich vitamin E mixture. δ-Tocotrienol inhibited  3-oxidation by a mixed mode. Like , 3-ketocholanoic  was also cytotoxic in human intestinal and liver cell models. δ-Tocotrienol decreased the extent of  3-oxidation and this inhibition was associated with enhanced cytotoxicity in LS180 cells treated with δ-tocotrienol and . Overall, vitamin E analogues inhibited in vitro  3-oxidation in an isomer-dependent manner, with inhibition occurring with tocotrienols, but not α-tocopherol. The enhanced  toxicity by δ-tocotrienol in a human intestinal cell model warrants future investigations in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The secosteroid stimulates intestinal Ca absorption. Whether LCA alters this process remains unknown. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of LCA on intestinal Ca absorption in the absence or presence of NaDOC, bile  that inhibits the cation transport. The data show that LCA by itself did not alter intestinal Ca absorption, but prevented the inhibitory effect of NaDOC. The concomitant administration of LCA avoided the reduction of intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity caused by NaDOC. In addition, LCA blocked a decrease caused by NaDOC on gene and protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption. The oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC were abrogated by LCA co-treatment. In conclusion, LCA placed in the intestinal lumen protects intestinal Ca absorption against the inhibitory effects caused by NaDOC. LCA avoids the reduction of the transcellular Ca movement, apparently by blocking the oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC, normalizing the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in Ca movement. Therefore, LCA might become a possible treatment to improve intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849189>Screening and validation of differentially expressed extracellular miRNAs in acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to screen for differentially expressed extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) during the development of acute pancreatitis (AP) and validate the miRNA expression in the plasma of patients with AP. The culture medium of taurolithocholic ‑3 sulfate‑treated rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells was collected to extract total RNA for miRNA microarray analysis. Compared with the miRNA test results of the AP rats in the GEO databases, the differentially expressed extracellular miRNAs were screened. The TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar programs were used for target gene prediction of the identified miRNAs, and gene ontology‑biological processes (GO‑BP) functional annotation was performed. Finally, the results from the combined microarray analyses (in\xa0vitro cell line and in\xa0vivo rat samples) were validated using plasma samples from patients with mild and moderately severe AP by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that extracellular miR‑24 was differentially expressed by microarray and bioinformatics analysis in both the cell line and the animal model of AP. Bioinformatics prediction analysis revealed that downstream target genes of miR‑24 included Vav2, Syk, Lhcgr, Slc9a3r1, Cacnb1, Cacna1b, Bcl10, and Fgd3. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the main GO‑BP predicted functional presentations were positive regulation of calcium‑mediated signaling, activation of c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase activity, calcium ion transport, regulation of Rho protein signal transduction, negative regulation of the protein kinase B signaling cascade, and the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Validation analysis for the plasma miR‑24 expression in humans revealed a significant upregulation of miR‑24 in the plasma samples of AP patients compared with the healthy controls, while no significant difference was observed in the miR‑24 expression between the mild and the moderately severe AP groups. The present study confirmed the high expression of miR‑24 in peripheral blood during AP, suggesting that miR‑24 might have an intercellular communication role contributing to the AP‑associated distant organ injury.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734123>Enhanced activity and substrate tolerance of 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by directed evolution for 7-ketolithocholic  production.</a></h2><p>7-Ketolithocholic  (7-KLCA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). UDCA is the main effective component of bear bile powder that is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of human cholesterol gallstones. 7α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7α-HSDH) is the key enzyme used in the industrial production of 7-KLCA. Unfortunately, the natural 7α-HSDHs reported have difficulty meeting the requirements of industrial application, due to their poor activities and strong substrate inhibition. In this study, a directed evolution strategy combined with high-throughput screening was applied to improve the catalytic efficiency and tolerance of high substrate concentrations of NADP+-dependent 7α-HSDH from Clostridium absonum. Compared with the wild type, the best mutant (7α-3) showed 5.5-fold higher specific activity and exhibited 10-fold higher and 14-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and NADP+, respectively. Moreover, 7α-3 also displayed significantly enhanced tolerance in the presence of high concentrations of substrate compared to the wild type. Owing to its improved catalytic efficiency and enhanced substrate tolerance, 7α-3 could efficiently biosynthesize 7-KLCA with a substrate loading of 100\xa0mM, resulting in 99% yield of 7-KLCA at 2\xa0h, in contrast to only 85% yield of 7-KLCA achieved for the wild type at 16\xa0h.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435224>Investigation of triamterene as an inhibitor of the TGR5 receptor: identification in cells and animals.</a></h2><p>G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) has been shown to participate in glucose homeostasis. In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5. Therefore, triamterene can be developed as a clinical inhibitor of TGR5 activation in future studies.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872803>Barley β-glucan increases fecal bile  excretion and short chain fatty  levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals.</a></h2><p>The cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan has been proposed to be the result of a pleiotropic effect, which involves several biological mechanisms such as gut fermentation, inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased bile  excretion and its synthesis. However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular weight promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291252>Influence of ad Libitum Feeding of Piglets With Bacillus Subtilis Fermented Liquid Feed on Gut Flora, Luminal Contents and Health.</a></h2><p>Some scholars caution that long-term ad libitum feeding with probiotic fermented food poses potential health risks to baby animals.

The G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) is an important mediator of bile  signaling and glucose metabolism. However, the effects of TGR5 on mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells remain elusive. In this study, we found that activation of TGR5 using its specific agonist taurolithocholic  (TLCA) promoted the expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Additionally, activation of TGR5 increased the expression of PGC-1α target genes, such as NRF1 and TFAM. Indeed, we found that TLCA treatment promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA (mtDNA/nDNA), COX-Ⅰ expression, and cytochrome c oxidase activity in HAECs. Notably, our results displayed that activation of TGR5 resulted in a functional gain in mitochondria by increasing the rate of respiration and ATP production. Mechanistically, we found that TLCA treatment activated the transcriptional factor CREB by inducing the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. Using the PKA/CREB inhibitor H89 abolished the effects of TLCA on PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM expression as well as the increase in mtDNA/nDNA and ATP production. These findings suggest that activation of TGR5 promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells, which is mediated by the CREB/PGC-1α signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The lipophilicity of these new tracers was determined by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography. The effect of lipophilicity and structure on the biodistribution was investigated in pigs by PET/CT using the tracers derived from cholic  (3α-OH, 7α-OH, 12α-OH), ursodeoxycholic  (3α-OH, 7β-OH), and  (3α-OH).The radiosyntheses of the N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids proceeded with radiochemical yields of 61% (decay-corrected) or greater and radiochemical purities greater than 99%. PET/CT in pigs revealed that the tracers were rapidly taken up by the liver and secreted into bile. There was no detectable radioactivity in urine. Significant reflux of N-(11)C-methyl-taurolithocholic  into the stomach was observed.We have successfully developed a radiosynthesis of N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids.

The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death.

The quality control samples were stable when assessed after 4h at room temperature, 24h at 4°C, 14days at -20°C, and three freeze-thaw cycles. The liver microsomal matrix did not affect 3-KCA quantification. The amount of KCA formed in the human liver microsomal LCA 3-oxidation assay was linear with respect to the amount of microsomal protein (up to 40μg) and incubation time (5-30min). Enzyme kinetics experiment indicated that LCA 3-oxidation followed the Michaelis-Menten model with an apparent Km of 26±7μM and Vmax of 303±50pmol/min/mg protein. This novel UPLC-MS/MS method for quantifying 3-KCA offers a specific, sensitive, and fast approach to determine liver microsomal LCA 3-oxidation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Along with 11 molds which fully degraded DCA, several strains were revealed capable of producing cholic , ursocholic , 12-keto- (12-keto-LCA), 3-keto-DCA, 15β-hydroxy-DCA and 15β-hydroxy-12-oxo-LCA as major products from DCA. The last metabolite was found to be a new compound. The ability to catalyze the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the 7(α/β)-positions of the DCA molecule was shown for 32 strains with the highest 7β-hydroxylase activity level for Fusarium merismoides VKM F-2310. Curvularia lunata VKM F-644 exhibited 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and formed 12-keto-LCA from DCA. Acremonium rutilum VKM F-2853 and Neurospora crassa VKM F-875 produced 15β-hydroxy-DCA and 15β-hydroxy-12-oxo-LCA, respectively, as major products from DCA, as confirmed by MS and NMR analyses. For most of the positive strains, the described DCA-transforming activity was unreported to date.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells.\xa0CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10\xa0kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10]\xa0+\xa0IL-1[10]\xa0+\xa0IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA\xa0±\xa0PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA\xa0±\xa0CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC\xa0±\xa0CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+\xa0IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA\'s leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Recent evidence suggests that bile  microaspiration may contribute to the development of lung fibrosis. However, the molecular evidence is scarce and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We have recently demonstrated that bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts  In the present study, a rat model of bile  microaspiration was established by weekly intratracheal instillation of three major bile acids including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA). Repeated microaspiration of CDCA, DCA, and LCA caused fibrotic changes, including alveolar wall thickening and extensive collagen deposition, in rat lungs. Bile  microaspiration also induced alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as indicated by up-regulation of mesenchymal markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin, as well as down-regulaton of epithelial markers E-cadherin and cytokeratin in alveolar epithelium of rat lungs. The expression of fibrogenic mediators, including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and periostin, was significantly elevated in rat lungs exposed to microaspiration of bile acids. Furthermore, microaspiration of bile acids also induced p-Smad3 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression in rat lungs. Our findings suggest that microaspiration of bile acids could promote the development of pulmonary fibrosis , possibly via stimulating fibrogenic mediator expression and activating TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and FXR.© 2017 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26347551>Mixed input to olfactory glomeruli from two subsets of ciliated sensory neurons does not impede relay neuron specificity in the crucian carp.</a></h2><p>The consensus view of olfactory processing is that the axons of receptor-specific primary olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) converge to a small subset of glomeruli, thus preserving the odour identity before the olfactory information is processed in higher brain centres. In the present study, we show that two different subsets of ciliated OSNs with different odorant specificities converge to the same glomeruli. In order to stain different ciliated OSNs in the crucian carp Carassius carassius we used two different chemical odorants, a bile salt and a purported alarm substance, together with fluorescent dextrans. The dye is transported within the axons and stains glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the axons from the ciliated OSNs co-converge to the same glomeruli. Despite intermingled innervation of glomeruli, axons and terminal fields from the two different subsets of ciliated OSNs remained mono-coloured. By 4-6 days after staining, the dye was transported trans-synaptically to separately stained axons of relay neurons. These findings demonstrate that specificity of the primary neurons is retained in the olfactory  despite mixed innervation of the olfactory glomeruli.

However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200128>TRO40303 Ameliorates Alcohol-Induced Pancreatitis Through Reduction of Fatty  Ethyl Ester-Induced Mitochondrial Injury and Necrotic Cell Death.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibition is a promising approach to treat acute pancreatitis (AP).

In this method, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was initially adsorbed on the fluid interface and induced LCs to adopt the homeotropic ordering. Inclusion complexation of SDS and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) disturbed interaction between LCs and SDS and evoked LCs to keep a tilted alignment. When injecting LCA into the mixed solution of SDS and β-CD, SDS excluded from the cavity of β-CD by competitive host-guest inclusion and could be re-adsorbed at the LCs/aqueous interface, resulting in the orientational transition of LCs from tilted to homeotropic state. Correspondingly, a bright-to-dark optical response was observed under polarized optical microscope (POM). The as-prepared LCs-based sensor could detect LCA as low as about 2\u2009μM in aqueous solution. Moreover, the practicability of the approach was validated by monitoring the known amount of LCA in human urine.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Herein, we used a novel computational strategy with two-dimensional virtual screening for FXR agonists. For the first time, we found that auraptene (AUR), a natural product, can activate FXR to exert hepatoprotective effect against cholestatic liver injury in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, AUR was found to significantly decrease the mortality of cholestatic mice. Dynamic change analysis of bile acids and gene analysis revealed that AUR promoted bile  efflux from liver into intestine via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep and Mrp2 expression, and reduced hepatic uptake through an inhibition in Ntcp. Furthermore, AUR reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile  metabolism through an induction in Sult2a1. In addition, AUR promoted liver repair through an induction in liver regeneration-related gene, and suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. However, the changes in these genes and protein, as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro.

One protein that protects against acute injury, including ischemic injury to both the kidney and heart, is renalase, which is secreted into the blood by the kidney and other tissues. However, whether renalase reduces acute injury associated with pancreatitis is unknown. Here, we used both  and  murine models of acute pancreatitis to study renalase\'s effects on this condition. In isolated pancreatic lobules, pretreatment with recombinant human renalase (rRNLS) blocked zymogen activation caused by cerulein, carbachol, and a bile . Renalase also blocked cerulein-induced cell injury and histological changes. In the  cerulein model of pancreatitis, genetic deletion of renalase resulted in more severe disease, and administering rRNLS to cerulein-exposed WT mice after pancreatitis onset was protective. Because pathological increases in acinar cell cytosolic calcium levels are central to the initiation of acute pancreatitis, we also investigated whether rRNLS could function through its binding protein, plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4b (PMCA4b), which excretes calcium from cells. We found that PMCA4b is expressed in both murine and human acinar cells and that a PMCA4b-selective inhibitor worsens pancreatitis-induced injury and blocks the protective effects of rRNLS. These findings suggest that renalase is a protective plasma protein that reduces acinar cell injury through a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. Because exogenous rRNLS reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis, it has potential as a therapeutic agent.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28011201>Design, synthesis, in vitro characterization and preliminary imaging studies on fluorinated bile  derivatives as PET tracers to study hepatic transporters.</a></h2><p>With the aim of identifying a fluorinated bile  derivative that could be used as [F]-labeled Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the in vivo functioning of liver transporter proteins, and particularly of OATP1B1, three fluorinated bile  triazole derivatives of cholic, deoxycholic and  (CATD, DCATD and LCATD 4a-c, respectively) were synthesized and labeled with tritium. In vitro transport properties were studied with cell-based assays to identify the best substrate for OATP1B1. In addition, the lead compound, LCATD (4c), was tested as a substrate of other liver uptake transporters OATP1B3, NTCP and efflux transporter BSEP to evaluate its specificity of liver transport. The results suggest that 4c is a good substrate of OATP1B1 and NTCP, whereas it is a poor substrate of OATP1B3. The efflux transporter BSEP also appears to be involved in the excretion of 4c from hepatocytes. The automated radiosynthesis of [F]-4c was accomplished in a multi-GBq scale and a pilot imaging experiment in a wild type rat was performed after i.v. administration to assess the biodistribution and clearance of the tracer. PET imaging revealed that radioactivity was primarily located in the liver (t=75s) and cleared exclusively through the bile, thus allowing to image the hepatobiliary excretion of bile acids in the animal model. These findings suggest that [F]-LCATD 4c is a promising PET probe for the evaluation of hepatic transporters OATP1B1, NTCP and BSEP activity with potential for studying drug-drug interactions and drug-induced toxicity involving these transporters.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal barrier function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100\u202fng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal barrier function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Bile acids are known to induce Ca signals and necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells but the effects of bile acids on stellate cells are unexplored. Here we show that cholate and taurocholate elicit more dramatic Ca signals and necrosis in stellate cells compared to the adjacent acinar cells in pancreatic lobules; whereas taurolithocholic  3-sulfate primarily affects acinar cells. Ca signals and necrosis are strongly dependent on extracellular Ca as well as Na ; and Na -dependent transport plays an important role in the overall bile  uptake in pancreatic stellate cells. Bile -mediated pancreatic damage can be further escalated by bradykinin-induced signals in stellate cells and thus killing of stellate cells by bile acids might have important implications in acute biliary pancreatitis.Acute biliary pancreatitis, caused by bile reflux into the pancreas, is a serious condition characterised by premature activation of digestive enzymes within acinar cells, followed by necrosis and inflammation. Bile acids are known to induce pathological Ca signals and necrosis in acinar cells. However, bile -elicited signalling events in stellate cells remain unexplored. This is the first study to demonstrate the pathophysiological effects of bile acids on stellate cells in two experimental models: ex vivo (mouse pancreatic lobules) and in vitro (human cells). Sodium cholate and taurocholate induced cytosolic Ca elevations in stellate cells, larger than those elicited simultaneously in the neighbouring acinar cells. In contrast, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S), known to induce Ca oscillations in acinar cells, had only minor effects on stellate cells in lobules. The dependence of the Ca signals on extracellular Na and the presence of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) indicate a Na -dependent bile  uptake mechanism in stellate cells. Bile  treatment caused necrosis predominantly in stellate cells, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca and significantly reduced in the absence of Na , showing that bile-dependent cell death was a downstream event of Ca signals. Finally, combined application of TLC-S and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin caused more extensive necrosis in both stellate and acinar cells than TLC-S alone. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism by which bile acids promote pancreatic pathology. This involves not only signalling in acinar cells but also in stellate cells.© 2016 The Authors The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile acids, intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern. In this review, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in yeast chronological aging.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932556>Orally Administered Berberine Modulates Hepatic Lipid  by Altering Microbial Bile   and the Intestinal FXR Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Previous studies suggest that the lipid-lowering effect of berberine (BBR) involves actions on the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling . However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid , we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28863822>Regulation of Ca-Sensitive K Channels by Cholesterol and Bile Acids via Distinct Channel Subunits and Sites.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol (CLR) conversion into bile acids (BAs) in the liver constitutes the major pathway for CLR elimination from the body. Moreover, these steroids regulate each other\'s . While the roles of CLR and BAs in regulating  and tissue function are well known, research of the last two decades revealed the existence of specific protein receptors for CLR or BAs in tissues with minor contribution to lipid , raising the possibility that these lipids serve as signaling molecules throughout the body. Among other lipids, CLR and BAs regulate ionic current mediated by the activity of voltage- and Ca-gated, K channels of large conductance (BK channels) and, thus, modulate cell physiology and participate in tissue pathophysiology. Initial work attributed modification of BK channel function by CLR or BAs to the capability of these steroids to directly interact with bilayer lipids and thus alter the physicochemical properties of the bilayer with eventual modification of BK channel function. Based on our own work and that of others, we now review evidence that supports direct interactions between CLR or BA and specific BK protein subunits, and the consequence of such interactions on channel activity and organ function, with a particular emphasis on arterial smooth muscle. For each steroid type, we will also briefly discuss several mechanisms that may underlie modification of channel steady-state activity. Finally, we will present novel computational data that provide a chemical basis for differential recognition of CLR vs  by distinct BK channel subunits and recognition sites.© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the pathophysiology is not fully understood. Here, we explored the roles of mTOR signaling and ER stress in placenta during ICP.Placental tissues were collected from normal and ICP pregnancies. mTOR signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress were detected by immunohistochemistry in the placenta. The human placenta trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo was used in vitro experiment.ICP placenta displayed histological abnormalities with fewer trophoblasts.

In in vitro studies, the bile acids specifically to  rather than taurocholic  or ursodeoxycholic , drastically increased the phosphorylation of pS6K1(T389), pS6(S235/236), or pAkt(S473), whereas the mTOR inhibitor can prohibit the upregulation. Similarly, the expressions of IRE1α and BiP increased sharply under  (20\u202fμM) administration, while the same inhibitor can also decrease the expression. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy showed enlarged endoplasmic reticulum lumen under the  treatment. Furthermore, the cell viability reduced sharply under treatment with different dose of . The mTOR inhibitor can reverse the decrease of cell viability to some extent.Bile  can activate mTOR signaling which resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to trophocyte viability decrease. mTOR pathway activation may be associated with the pathophysiology of ICP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the connections between LCA function performance and change of UGT2B7 enzymatic activity in mice livers, two morphine metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) were quantified by solid phase extraction (SPE)-HPLC-MS/MS. The result indicated no matter in acute or chronic morphine tolerance, the concentrations of M3G and M6G were all decreased, the later one fell even more. Besides that, 50 mg/kg of LCA administration can prevent auto-phosphorylation of CaMKIIα at Thr286 in acute or chronic morphine tolerance mice prefrontal cortexes (mPFCs) due to synthesis increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. As a consequence, UGT2B7 depression mediated by LCA can affect its selective catalysis ability to morphine, that may be responsible to acute or chronic morphine tolerance alleviation.

Here, we determined whether there is interplay between c-Myc, Maf proteins, and methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1), which is responsible for SAMe biosynthesis in the liver. We used bile duct ligation (BDL) and  (LCA) treatment in mice as chronic cholestasis models, a murine CCA model, human CCA cell lines KMCH and Huh-28, human liver cancer HepG2, and human CCA specimens to study gene and protein expression, protein-protein interactions, molecular mechanisms, and functional outcomes. We found that c-Myc, MATα1 (encoded by MAT1A), MafG, and c-Maf interact with one another directly. MAT1A expression fell in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells during chronic cholestasis and in murine and human CCA. The opposite occurred with c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf expression. MATα1 interacts mainly with Mnt in normal liver, but this switches to c-Maf, MafG, and c-Myc in cholestatic livers and CCA. Promoter regions of these genes have E-boxes that are bound by MATα1 and Mnt in normal liver and benign bile duct epithelial cells that switched to c-Myc, c-Maf, and MafG in cholestasis and CCA cells. E-box positively regulates c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf, but it negatively regulates MAT1A. MATα1 represses, whereas c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf enhance, E-box-driven promoter activity. Knocking down MAT1A or overexpressing MafG or c-Maf enhanced CCA growth and invasion in vivo.There is a novel interplay between MATα1, c-Myc, and Maf proteins, and their deregulation during chronic cholestasis may facilitate CCA oncogenesis.

Overexpression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been detected in CRC, and it contributes to poor prognosis. However, the effect of LCA on IL-8 expression is still undefined. In this study, we observed that LCA treatment induced IL-8 expression in CRC HCT116 cells. Pharmacological inhibition and mutagenesis studies indicated that Erk1/2 is critical for LCA-induced IL-8 expression. Furthermore, LCA reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3, and the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, accelerated LCA-induced IL-8 expression, suggesting that STAT3 is involved in LCA-induced IL-8 expression. Activation of Erk1/2 functioned as an upstream signal of the STAT3 suppression induced by LCA. In conclusion, LCA activated Erk1/2 and in turn, suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation to induce IL-8 expression in HCT116 cells, thus stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and tube like formation.

We then investigated the antitumor potential, toxicity, and median survival in 4T1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice upon LCA-Tam-PC treatment. Our studies confirmed a significant reduction in the tumor volume, tumor weight, and reduced hepatotoxicity with a significant increase in median survival on LCA-Tam-PC treatment as compared to the parent drug.

To make clear the actions of those BAs on this physiological process, an overview of current information about the mechanisms by which the intestinal Ca2+ occurs is described.The PubMed database was searched until 2017, using the keywords bile acids, NaDOC, UDCA and LCA and redox state, apoptosis, autophagy and intestinal Ca2+ absorption.The modulation of redox state, apoptosis and autophagy are mechanisms that are involved in the action of BAs on intestinal Ca2+ absorption. Although the mechanisms are still not completely understood, we provide the latest knowledge regarding the effect of BAs on intestinal Ca2+ absorption.The response of the intestine to absorb Ca2+ is affected by BAs, but it is different according to the type and dose of BA. When there is a single administration, NaDOC has an inhibitory effect, UDCA is an stimulator whereas LCA does not have any influence. However, the combination of BAs modifies the response. Either UDCA or LCA protects the intestine against the oxidative injury caused by NaDOC by blocking the oxidative/nitrosative stress, apoptosis and autophagy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325318>Mono-lithocholated exendin-4-loaded glycol chitosan nanoparticles with prolonged antidiabetic effects.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan (HGC) nanoparticles loaded with mono--conjugated exendin-4 at the Lys(27) residue (LAM1-Ex4) were prepared and characterized by particle size measurement, proteolytic stability, in vitro drug-release profile, and in vivo antidiabetic effects in a db/db diabetic mouse model.

BAs and their  and transportation appear to follow the clear circadian rhythms, and they are recently proposed also as the potential chronobiological signals that can affect the molecular clock mechanism. Cholecystectomy are believed to affect the circadian rhythms of BAs and the relevant enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and their regulatory signaling , for the reason that the circadian cycle of gallbladder filling and emptying play a pivotal role in controlling the flow of bile into the intestine and the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Here, in the present study, the circadian rhythms about BAs concentration and composition and the mRNA expression of genes involved in BAs transportation,  and regulation in liver and ileum of mice with or without gallbladder were evaluated. As a result, it has been found that, mice with gallbladder exhibited significant and distinct circadian oscillations in BAs concentration, mRNA expression of enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and farnesoid X receptor-mediated regulatory  both in liver and ileum during gallbladder emptying period (1:00 AM and 1:00 PM), despite food was restricted during these periods; the circadian rhythmicity of BAs pool and hepatic and ileal BAs diminished but the BAs composition had no significant alteration in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy as compared with sham-operated mice; in parallel to the alteration of BAs levels in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy, the day/night circadian oscillations in the mRNA expression of the relevant transporting and  genes and the farnesoid X receptor signaling pathway-mediated â€œintestine-liverâ€ regulatory axis also shifted. In conclusion, the BAs concentration and the corresponding genes exhibit significant circadian rhythms in mice with gallbladder, and the circadian oscillations of most of the investigation factors are flattened and altered following by cholecystectomy, which could mainly ascribe to the disappearance of the filling and emptying cycle of gallbladder and might result in pathological states or drug chronopharmacology alternation.

Treatment with I-BET-762 significantly reduced biochemical, cytokine and histopathological responses in TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP, but not CER-AP.These results suggest that in different forms of AP there are significant differences in the epigenetic control of gene transcription contributing to the severity of disease responses.

Wound healing within the corneal endothelium typically occurs through cell spreading and migration rather than through proliferation. The mechanisms that control corneal endothelial cell migration are unclear. In this study we demonstrate that cultures of corneal endothelial cells display reduced migration in scratch wound assays, and reduced levels of E-cadherin mRNA, following suppression of ligand-activated Eph receptor signalling by treatment with . Two Eph receptors, EphA1 and EphA2, were subsequently detected in corneal endothelial cells, and their potential involvement during migration was explored through gene silencing using siRNAs. EphA2 siRNA reduced levels of mRNA for both EphA2 and N-cadherin, but increased levels of mRNA for both EphA1 and E-cadherin. No effect, however, was observed for EphA2 siRNA on migration. Our results indicate a potential role for Eph receptor signalling during corneal endothelial cell migration via changes in cadherin expression. Nevertheless, defining a precise role for select Eph receptors is likely to be complicated by crosstalk between Eph-mediated signalling .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Twelve mono-, diacetyl and ester derivatives of deoxycholic, chenodeoxycholic and , seven of them new compounds, were obtained through lipase-catalyzed acetylation, esterification and alcoholysis reactions in very good to excellent yield and a highly regioselective way. Among them, acetylated ester products, in which the lipase catalyzed both reactions in one-pot, were obtained. The influence of various reaction parameters in the enzymatic reactions, such as enzyme source, acylating agent/substrate ratio, enzyme/substrate ratio, solvent and temperature, was studied. Some of the evaluated compounds showed a remarkable activity as Trypanosoma cruzi growth inhibitors, obtaining the best results with ethyl chenodeoxycholate 3-acetate and chenodeoxycholic  3,7-diacetate, which showed IC50: 8.6 and 22.8 μM, respectively. In addition, in order to shed light to bile acids behavior in enzymatic reactions, molecular modeling was applied to some derivatives.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR), a xenobiotic sensor and signaling intermediate for certain host-bacterial metabolites, has been shown to negatively regulate TLR4 signaling. Here we investigated the relationship between PXR and TLR4 in the developing murine intestine and explored the capacity of PXR to modulate inflammatory  involved in experimental NEC.MethodsWild-type and PXR mice were studied at various time points of development in an experimental model of NEC. In addition, we studied the ability of the secondary bile   (LCA), a known PXR agonist in liver, to activate intestinal PXR and reduce NEC-related intestinal inflammation.ResultsWe found a reciprocal relationship between the developmental expression of PXR and TLR4 in wild-type murine intestine, with PXR acting to reduce TLR4 expression by decreasing TLR4 mRNA stability. In addition, PXR mice exhibited a remarkably heightened severity of disease in experimental NEC. Moreover, LCA attenuated intestinal proinflammatory responses in the early stages of experimental NEC.ConclusionThese findings provide proactive insights into the regulation of TLR4 in the developing intestine.

Deoxycholic  (DCA), Chemodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (LCA) activated the PERK arm of the UPR, via phosphorylation of eIF2α and up-regulation of ATF3, CHOP and BiP/GRP78. UPR activation by these bile acids is mechanistically linked with Golgi fragmentation, as modulating the UPR using a PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) or salubrinal attenuated bile -induced effects on Golgi structure. Furthermore we demonstrate that DCA, CDCA and LA activate Src kinase and that inhibition of this kinase attenuated both bile -induced BiP/GRP78 expression and Golgi fragmentation.

The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides.

The in vitro study demonstrated that the effect of Tan IIA on CYP3A4 was mediated by transactivation of PXR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The in vivo experiments using PXR siRNA revealed that Tan IIA could protect against LCA-induced hepatotoxicity and cholestasis in a dose-dependent manner.

A preliminary study has shown that patients with IBS-C have reduced levels of bile acids (BAs) in feces and reduced synthesis of BA. We compared the levels of primary and secondary BAs in fecal samples collected over a 48-hour period from patients with IBS-C on a diet that contained 100 g fat per day, and compared them with levels in samples from healthy volunteers (controls). We also examined the relationship between overall colonic transit and biomarkers of BAs in patients with IBS-C.We performed a retrospective study of 45 patients with IBS-C and 184 controls.

Twelve young pigs (11.05 ± 0.11 kg) were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed corn-soybean meal diets with either 5% pectin or cornstarch for 72 d. In pigs fed with pectin, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were lowered but high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was increased (P < 0.05). Serum triglycerides tended to be lower in the pectin-fed animals (P = 0.093), whereas no change was noted in serum total bile . Along the length of the intestine, the size and composition of BA pools vary. The ratio of primary, secondary, taurine-conjugated, and glycine-conjugated BAs in the ileal pool was about 46:15:9:30, whereas it was 28:61:1:11 in the cecum and 22:65:3:9 in the colon (P < 0.05).

Expression multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) gradually decreased towards the end of the intestine (P < 0.05). Greater expression of G protein-coupled bile  receptor and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3) was found in the cecum and colon (P < 0.05). In pigs fed with 5% pectin, only cecal UDCA (P = 0.097) and hyocholic  (P = 0.088) showed a decreasing tendency.

Liver enzymes involved in BA biosynthesis (CYP7A1, CYP27A1, bile -CoA synthase, and bile -CoA:amino  N acyltransferase) were not affected by pectin consumption. In conclusion, the abundant distribution of BA transporters and the greater BA pool size suggests the ileum as the major site for intestinal BA reabsorption in pigs.

Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver  was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules.

In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis. The delayed pathogenesis of  in -colonized mice was associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile  transformation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878403>Effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone in murine acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Although oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP), antioxidant therapy in patients has so far been discouraging. The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10\u2009µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels. Our results suggest that MitoQ would be inappropriate for AP therapy, consistent with prior antioxidant evaluations in this disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580281>Glucagon-like peptide-2 promotes gallbladder refilling via a TGR5-independent, GLP-2R-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) are secreted from enteroendocrine cells in response to nutrients and bile acids and control  via actions on structurally-related yet distinct G protein coupled receptors. GLP-1 regulates gut motility, appetite, islet function, and glucose homeostasis, whereas GLP-2 enhances intestinal nutrient absorption. GLP-1R agonists are used to treat diabetes and obesity, and a GLP-2R agonist is approved to treat short bowel syndrome. Unexpectedly, reports of gallbladder disease have been associated with the use of both GLP-1R and GLP-2R agonists and after bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms remain unknown.We investigated whether GLP-1 or GLP-2 acutely controls gallbladder (GB) volume and whether GLP-2 regulates GB muscle activity in mice. The expression of , , and  was assessed in mouse GB, and the effects of GLP-2 on hepatic bile  (BA) flow, intestinal and liver BA uptake, and GB gene expression were determined. GLP-2 regulation of GB volume was assessed in wildtype,  and  mice. The effect of GLP-2 on GB smooth muscle (GBSM) calcium transients was characterized .Acute administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 lowered glucose but had no effect on GB volume in mice. In contrast, GLP-2 rapidly enhanced GB filling in a dose-dependent manner, actions maintained in the presence of cholecystokinin, and mediated through the canonical GLP-2R. GLP-2 also rapidly induced immediate early gene expression in GB, consistent with detection of the endogenous  in GB RNA. The ability of GLP-2 to increase GB volume was not abrogated by systemic administration of hexamethonium, propranolol, a vasoactive peptide receptor antagonist or N-Nitroarginine methyl ester, and was maintained in  mice. In contrast, , a Tgr5 agonist, increased GB filling in  but not in  mice. GLP-2 had no effect on ileal uptake or hepatic clearance of taurocholic  or on hepatic bile flow, yet reduced the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in murine GBSM , in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner.Our data extend endocrine concepts of regulation of GB filling beyond FXR-FGF15/19 and the direct effects of BA via Tgr5, to encompass a novel BA-Tgr5-L cell GLP-2 axis providing nutrient-mediated feedback from BA to terminate meal-related GB contraction. These findings have implications for conditions characterized by elevated circulating levels of GLP-2 such as after bariatric surgery and the development and use of agents that promote Tgr5 activation, L cell secretion, or GLP-2R agonism for the treatment of  disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076617> attenuates cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion in human colonic epithelial T84 cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) play a complex role in colonic fluid secretion. We showed that dihydroxy BAs, but not the monohydroxy BA  (LCA), stimulate Cl(-) secretion in human colonic T84 cells (Ao M, Sarathy J, Domingue J, Alrefai WA, Rao MC. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 305: C447-C456, 2013). In this study, we explored the effect of LCA on the action of other secretagogues in T84 cells. While LCA (50 μM, 15 min) drastically (>90%) inhibited FSK-stimulated short-circuit current (Isc), it did not alter carbachol-stimulated Isc LCA did not alter basal Isc, transepithelial resistance, cell viability, or cytotoxicity. LCA\'s inhibitory effect was dose dependent, acted faster from the apical membrane, rapid, and not immediately reversible. LCA also prevented the Isc stimulated by the cAMP-dependent secretagogues 8-bromo-cAMP, lubiprostone, or chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The LCA inhibitory effect was BA specific, since CDCA, cholic , or taurodeoxycholic  did not alter FSK or carbachol action. While LCA alone had no effect on intracellular cAMP concentration ([cAMP]i), it decreased FSK-stimulated [cAMP]i by 90%. Although LCA caused a small increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), chelation by BAPTA-AM did not reverse LCA\'s effect on Isc LCA action does not appear to involve known BA receptors, farnesoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, or bile -specific transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5. LCA significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was completely abolished by the MEK inhibitor PD-98059. Surprisingly PD-98059 did not reverse LCA\'s effect on Isc Finally, although LCA had no effect on basal Isc, nystatin permeabilization studies showed that LCA both stimulates an apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) current and inhibits a basolateral K(+) current. In summary, 50 μM LCA greatly inhibits cAMP-stimulated Cl(-) secretion, making low doses of LCA of potential therapeutic interest for diarrheal diseases.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871908>Acetylated deoxycholic (DCA) and cholic (CA) acids are potent ligands of pregnane X (PXR) receptor.</a></h2><p>The Pregnane X (PXR), Vitamin D (VDR) and Farnesoid X (FXR) nuclear receptors have been shown to be receptors of bile acids controlling their detoxification or synthesis. Chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) and  (LCA) acids are ligands of FXR and VDR, respectively, whereas 3-keto and acetylated derivates of LCA have been described as ligands for all three receptors. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidation or acetylation at position 3, 7 and 12 of bile acids DCA (deoxycholic ), LCA, CA (cholic ), and CDCA by detoxification enzymes or microbiome may have an effect on the interactions with bile  nuclear receptors. We employed reporter gene assays in HepG2 cells, the TR-FRET assay with recombinant PXR and RT-PCR to study the effects of acetylated and keto bile acids on the nuclear receptors activation and their target gene expression in differentiated hepatic HepaRG cells. We demonstrate that the DCA 3,12-diacetate and CA 3,7,12-triacetate derivatives are ligands of PXR and DCA 3,12-diacetate induces PXR target genes such as CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and ABCB1/MDR1.

Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of fat, serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of fat in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal deoxycholic  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect. Addition of flaxseed meal and oat hulls in growing pig diets reduced fat digestibility and serum cholesterol and stimulated malabsorption of primary BA and excretion of secondary BA and NS.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27630168>Reduction in circulating bile  and restricted diffusion across the intestinal epithelium are associated with a decrease in blood cholesterol in the presence of oat β-glucan.</a></h2><p>Although oat (1,3:1,4)-β-glucan (BG) has been shown to decrease blood cholesterol in intervention trials, the detailed mechanism is not yet defined, but restricted reabsorption of bile acids (BAs) has been hypothesized. Using pigs as a model for humans we demonstrated that, compared to the control, BG added to the diet for 26 d caused decreases of 24% in blood total BAs (TBAs), 34% in total cholesterol (TC), and 57% in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.01); decreases of 20% TBA in the midjejunum and terminal ileum (P < 0.01); increases of 80% in cecal total neutral sterols (TNSs) including cholesterol (P < 0.01); a 50% reduction in BA active transport across ex vivo ileum after 40 min (P < 0.001); and 32% decrease in jejunal microvillus heights with apparent increased goblet cell activity. The results suggest that BG not only physically hinders the active reabsorption of BAs and uptake of cholesterol, but also changes the BAs profile with lower circulating levels without excess excretion in the feces, thus resulting in reduced blood TC and LDL-C.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol , lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

This study tested whether increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression prevents dedifferentiation of β cells in a high-glucose state in vitro. Culturing a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) in a high-glucose environment decreased VDR expression. However, increased VDR following vitamin D3 (VD3) treatment improved insulin release of early-passage MIN6 and insulin index of db/- (heterozygous) islets to levels seen in normal functional islets. Treatment with VD3, its analogues and derivatives also increased the expression of essential transcription factors, such as Pdx1, MafA and VDR itself, ultimately increasing expression of Ins1 and Ins2, which might protect β cells against dedifferentiation. VD3 agonist  (LCA) propionate was the most potent candidate molecule for protecting against dedifferentiation, and an e-pharmacophore mapping model confirmed that LCA propionate exhibits a stabilizing conformation within the VDR binding site. This study concluded that treating db/+ islets with a VD3 analogue and/or derivatives can increase VDR activity, preventing the pathological dedifferentiation of β cells and the onset of T2D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters.

Paradoxically, taurolithocholate (TLC) activates p38 MAPK but decreases PM-MRP2 in hepatocytes. These opposing effects of cAMP and TLC could be mediated via different p38 MAPK isoforms (α and β) that are activated differentially by upstream kinases (MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6). Thus we tested the hypothesis that p38α MAPK and p38β MAPK mediate increases and decreases in PM-MRP2 by cAMP and TLC, respectively. Studies were conducted in hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and MKK3-knockout (MKK3(-/-)) mice and in a hepatoma cell line (HuH7) that overexpresses sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) (HuH-NTCP). Cyclic AMP activated MKK3, p38 MAPK, and p38α MAPK and increased PM-MRP2 in WT hepatocytes, but failed to activate p38α MAPK or increase PM-MRP2 in MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes. In contrast to cAMP, TLC activated total p38 MAPK but decreased PM-MRP2, and did not activate MKK3 or p38α MAPK in WT hepatocytes. In MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes, TLC still decreased PM-MRP2 and activated p38 MAPK, indicating that these effects are not MKK3-dependent. Additionally, TLC activated MKK6 in MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes, and small interfering RNA knockdown of p38β MAPK abrogated TLC-mediated decreases in PM-MRP2 in HuH-NTCP cells. Taken together, these results suggest that p38α MAPK facilitates plasma membrane insertion of MRP2 by cAMP, whereas p38β MAPK mediates retrieval of PM-MRP2 by TLC.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639449>Identification of the anti-oxidant components in a two-step solvent extract of bovine bile lipid: Application of reverse phase HPLC, mass spectrometry and fluorimetric assays.</a></h2><p>An ether extract of nine different bacterial metabolites in combination with two solvent extract (ether followed by ethanol) of bile lipids from ox gall bladder is used as an immune stimulator drug.

Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including  syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192491>Sialyltransferase inhibition and recent advances.</a></h2><p>Sialic acids, existing as terminal sugars of glycoconjugates, play important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell-cell adhesion, immune defense, tumor cell metastasis, and inflammation.

Here, we analyzed the impact of vitamin C on bile  induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and  (LCA)-induced liver injury in vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice, which cannot synthesize vitamin C similarly to humans. When Huh-BAT cells were treated with bile , apoptosis was induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress-related JNK activation but vitamin C attenuated bile -induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro.

We developed a strategy for modifying proteins with a wide variety of synthetic lipids using microbial transglutaminase (MTG), which catalyzes the cross-linking reaction between a specific glutamine (Q) in a protein and lysine (K) in the lipid-fused peptide. The synthesized lipid-G S-MRHKGS lipid (lipid: fatty acids, tocopherol, , cholesterol) was successfully conjugated to a protein fused with LLQG (Q-tagged protein) by an MTG reaction, yielding >90\u2009% conversion of the Q-tagged protein in a lipidated form. The purified lipid-protein conjugates were used for labeling the cell membrane in vitro, resulting in best-anchoring ability of cholesterol modification. Furthermore, in situ cell-surface decoration with the protein was established in a simple manner: subjection of cells to a mixture of cholesterol-fused peptides, Q-tagged proteins and MTG.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Because activation of GPBA leads to increased cAMP levels and secretion of incretins and insulin, GPBA has been proposed as a promising drug target for the treatment of  syndrome. Previously, we have developed a ligand-screening system to identify novel agonists of GPBA by means of a fusion protein of GPBA with G protein stimulatory α subunit (Gsα) and by a [S]GTPγS-binding assay. To express the GPBA-Gsα fusion protein, transgenic silkworms were employed in this study, and cell membrane fractions were prepared from their fat body or pupae. We applied them to the screening of a chemical library that contains 10,625 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository (NPDepo). Eventually, a unique partial agonist, GUM2, was successfully identified. Our results indicated that the GPCR-Gα fusion proteins were beneficial for ligand identification and that the transgenic silkworms were useful for large-scale production of GPCRs. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing GPBA, GUM2 showed 50% effective concentration (EC) of 3.5 ± 2.4μM and induced GPBA internalization as effectively as did an endogenous agonist, TLC. We also confirmed that GUM2 stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Moreover, a single 2mg/kg dose of GUM2 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in mice during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test even though GUM2 is only a partial agonist with a low intrinsic activity. We concluded that GUM2 is a good candidate for research on GPBA signaling under physiological conditions and for the development of GPBA-targeting therapeutic compounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Competitive ligand binding assays revealed that the receptor\'s affinity for  is highly conserved across species, suggesting that  affinity is an ancient and non-adaptive trait. However, transient transactivation assays revealed that -mediated VDR activation might have evolved more recently, as the non-mammalian receptors did not respond to  unless exogenous coactivator proteins were co-expressed. Subsequent functional assays indicated that differential -mediated receptor activation is potentially driven by differential protein-protein interactions between VDR and nuclear receptor coregulator proteins.

Bile acids are one of the principle components of gastric refluxate and have previously been implicated in the development of oesophageal and bowel malignancies. There is clear evidence that bile acids reflux into the laryngopharynx. Despite this, the carcinogenic properties of bile acids in this area are yet to be fully identified. We therefore investigated the potential role of bile acids in pharyngeal malignancy, through the highly conserved process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT occurs in invasion and metastasis and is a central process in the development of epithelial carcinoma.Translational research study.Human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma FaDu cells were challenged with primary (cholic or chenodeoxycholic) and secondary (deoxycholic or ) bile acids. EMT-relevant proteins TGF-β1 and MMP-9 were measured in the cell culture supernates at 48 h via ELISA. Cell viability was confirmed >95% via CellTiter-Blue assay.Significantly greater concentrations of TGF-β1 were measured in the culture supernates of cells treated with cholic , deoxycholic  and chenodeoxycholic . MMP-9 levels were increased in deoxycholic  and lithocolic  stimulations when compared to control (P < 0.05).This is the first demonstration that bile acids induce TGF-β1 and MMP-9 in pharyngeal cells. TGF-β1 is considered a master switch for EMT, while MMP-9 is a part of the EMT proteome which degrades basement membranes. This implies a potential role for bile acids in pharyngeal carcinogenesis through the mechanism of EMT and suggests potential novel therapeutic targets.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27450898>Quantitative profiling of bile acids in rat bile using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry: Alteration of the bile  composition with aging.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) play important roles in physiological functions, including the homeostasis of cholesterol and lipids and as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). With the increasing importance of BAs, analytical methods for their quantification and screening have been developed. However, due to the diverse range and variety of BAs with different activation potency, a simple, effective, and sensitive method is required to screen BAs for accurate quantification and identification. This paper presents an application of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS) for profiling BAs in bile. Using this method, along with the accurate quantification of 19 targeted BAs, 22 unknown BAs were detected and characterized by their fragmentation patterns. The method is beneficial for screening most of the BAs (quantitatively and qualitatively) in rat bile with simple preparation in a single run. The sample dilution ranges of each BA were optimized depending on the concentration of BAs in the bile to obtain good peak separation and accurate data. The method validation was performed successfully using charcoal-treated bile and the intra and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 20% for all BAs while the recovery were above 88.5% except for the . The method was applied to profile the age-dependent changes in the contents of rat BAs. Through statistical analysis, we found that as the rats aged, unconjugated BAs and glycine-conjugated BAs decreased or were unaffected, while taurine-conjugated BAs were increased in general. Among the unknown BAs, 5 of the taurine-conjugated BAs increased, while a glycine-conjugated BA decreased, in agreement with the trends of the targeted BAs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the synthetic steroid N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) arised as a promising LXR ligand. This compound was able to dissociate certain beneficial LXRs effects from those undesirable ones involved in triglyceride . Here, we synthetized a series of DMHCA analogues with different modifications in the steroidal nucleus involving the A/B ring fusion, that generate changes in the overall conformation of the steroid. The LXRα and LXRβ activity of these analogues was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay in BHK21 cells. Compounds were tested in both the agonist and antagonist modes. Results indicated that the agonist/antagonist profile is dependent on the steroid configuration at the A/B ring junction. Notably, in contrast to DMHCA, the amide derived from  (2) with an A/B cis configuration and its 6,19-epoxy analogue 4 behaved as LXRα selective agonists, while the 2,19-epoxy analogues with an A/B trans configuration were antagonists of both isoforms. The binding mode of the analogues to both LXR isoforms was assessed by using 50\u202fns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed conformational differences between LXRα- and LXRβ-ligand complexes, mainly in the hydrogen bonding network that involves the C-3 hydroxyl.

High- and low-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of BAs and their metabolites. Major species differences were found in the  of BAs. Sulfation into 3-O-sulfates was a major pathway in human and chimpanzee (4.8%-52%) and it was a minor pathway in all other species (0.02%-14%). Amidation was primarily with glycine (62%-95%) in minipig and rabbit and it was primarily with taurine (43%-81%) in human, chimpanzee, dog, hamster, rat and mice. Hydroxylation was highest (13%-80%) in rat and mice followed by hamster, while it was lowest (1.6%-22%) in human, chimpanzee and minipig.

We have previously shown that FGF19 can modulate glucose handling by suppressing the activity of hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons. As bile acids stimulate the release of FGF19/FGF15 into the circulation, we pursued the potential of bile acids to improve glucose tolerance via a gut-brain axis involving FXR and FGF15/FGF19 within enterocytes and FGF receptors on hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons.A 5-day gavage of taurocholic , mirroring our previous protocol of a 5-day FGF19 treatment, was performed. Oral glucose tolerance tests in mice with genetic manipulations of FGF signaling and melanocortin signaling were used to define a gut-brain axis responsive to bile acids.The taurocholic  gavage led to increased serum concentrations of taurocholic  as well as increases of FGF15 mRNA in the ileum and improved oral glucose tolerance in obese (ob/ob) mice. In contrast, , an FXR antagonist but a potent agonist for GPBAR1, did not improve glucose tolerance. The positive response to taurocholic  is dependent upon an intact melanocortinergic system as obese MC4R-null mice or ob/ob mice without AGRP did not show improvements in glucose tolerance after taurocholate gavage. We also tested the FGF receptor isoform necessary for the bile  response, using AGRP:Fgfr1-/- and AGRP:Fgfr2-/- mice. While the absence of FGFR1 in AGRP/NPY neurons did not alter glucose tolerance after taurocholate gavage, manipulations of Fgfr2 caused bidirectional changes depending upon the experimental model. We hypothesized the existence of an endogenous hypothalamic FGF, most likely FGF17, that acted as a chronic activator of AGRP/NPY neurons. We developed two short peptides based on FGF8 and FGF17 that should antagonize FGF17 action. Both of these peptides improved glucose homeostasis after a 4-day course of central and peripheral injections. Significantly, daily average blood glucose from continuous glucose monitoring was reduced in all tested animals but glucose concentrations remained in the euglycemia range.We have defined a gut-brain axis that regulates glucose  mediated by antagonistic fibroblast growth factors. From the intestine, bile acids stimulate FGF15 secretion, leading to activation of the FGF receptors in hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons. FGF receptor intracellular signaling subsequently silences AGRP/NPY neurons, leading to improvements of glucose tolerance that are likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Finally, short peptides that antagonize homodimeric FGF receptor signaling within the hypothalamus have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis without inducing hypoglycemia. These peptides could provide a new mode of regulating glucose .Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC).

Despite that bile acids cause vasodilation, it is unclear why these effects involve GPBAR1, and the vascular phenotype of GPBAR1 deficient mice remains poorly defined. Previous studies have suggested a role for nitric oxide (NO) in regulatory activity exerted by GPBAR1 in liver endothelial cells. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a vasodilatory agent generated in endothelial cells by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE). Here we demonstrate that GPBAR1 null mice had increased levels of primary and secondary bile acids and impaired vasoconstriction to phenylephrine. In aortic ring preparations, vasodilation caused by chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a weak GPBAR1 ligand and farnesoid-x-receptor agonist (FXR), was iberiotoxin-dependent and GPBAR1-independent. In contrast, vasodilation caused by LCA was GPBAR1 dependent and abrogated by propargyl-glycine, a CSE inhibitor, and by 5β-cholanic , a GPBAR1 antagonist, but not by N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (l-NIO), an endothelial NO synthase inhibitor, or iberiotoxin, a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels antagonist. In venular and aortic endothelial (HUVEC and HAEC) cells GPBAR1 activation increases CSE expression/activity and H2S production. Two cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) sites (CREs) were identified in the CSE promoter. In addition, TLCA stimulates CSE phosphorylation on serine residues. In conclusion we demonstrate that GPBAR1 mediates the vasodilatory activity of LCA and regulates the expression/activity of CSE. Vasodilation caused by CDCA involves BKCa channels.

Species differences exist in BA composition, synthesis, and regulation; however presently, there is no in vitro reproducible cell model to perform studies on BAs in humans. We have evaluated the capacity of the human HepaRG cell line to synthesize, conjugate, and secrete BAs, and analyzed changes in BA content and profile after cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. Our data show that HepaRG cells produced normal BAs at daily levels comparable, though in different proportions, to those measured in primary human hepatocytes. A 4-h treatment with CsA led to BA accumulation and profile changes associated with occurrence of cholestatic features, while after 24 h BAs were decreased in cell layers and increased in media. The latter effects resulted from reduced function of BA uptake transporter (Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide), reduced expression of BA metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P4507A1, cytochrome P4508B1, and cytochrome P45027A1, and induction of alternative basolateral transporters. Noteworthy, HepaRG cells incubated in a 2% serum-supplemented medium showed dose-dependent accumulation of the cytotoxic BA  in a nonsulfoconjugated form associated with early inhibition of the canalicular transporter MRP2 and sulfotransferase 2A1. In summary, our data bring the first demonstration that an in vitro human liver cell line is able to produce and secrete conjugated BAs, and to accumulate endogenous BAs transiently, concomitantly to occurrence of various other cholestatic features following CsA treatment. Retention of the hydrophobic  supports its toxic role in drug-induced cholestasis. Overall, our results argue on the suitability of HepaRG cells for investigating mechanisms involved in the development of the disease.© The Author 2015.

However, the scarcity and variability of primary hepatocytes currently limits their utility. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent an excellent source of differentiated hepatocytes; however, current protocols still produce fetal-like hepatocytes with limited mature function. Interestingly, fetal hepatocytes acquire mature CYP450 expression only postpartum, suggesting that nutritional cues may drive hepatic maturation. We show that vitamin K2 and , a by-product of intestinal flora, activate pregnane X receptor (PXR) and subsequent CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 expression in hPSC-derived and isolated fetal hepatocytes. Differentiated cells produce albumin and apolipoprotein B100 at levels equivalent to primary human hepatocytes, while demonstrating an 8-fold induction of CYP450 activity in response to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist omeprazole and a 10-fold induction in response to PXR agonist rifampicin. Flow cytometry showed that over 83% of cells were albumin and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) positive, permitting high-content screening in a 96-well plate format. Analysis of 12 compounds showed an R(2) correlation of 0.94 between TC50 values obtained in stem cell-derived hepatocytes and primary cells, compared to 0.62 for HepG2 cells. Finally, stem cell-derived hepatocytes demonstrate all toxicological endpoints examined, including steatosis, apoptosis, and cholestasis, when exposed to nine known hepatotoxins.Our work provides fresh insights into liver development, suggesting that microbial-derived cues may drive the maturation of CYP450 enzymes postpartum. Addition of these cues results in the first functional, inducible, hPSC-derived hepatocyte for predictive toxicology.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408609>Microbiota-Derived  Factors Reduce Campylobacteriosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni, a prevalent foodborne bacterial pathogen, exploits the host innate response to induce colitis. Little is known about the roles of microbiota in C jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation. We investigated interactions between microbiota and intestinal cells during C jejuni infection of mice.Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10 mice were colonized with conventional microbiota and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10 colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional microbiota were cultured under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into germ-free Il10 mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal microbiota and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively.Introduction of conventional microbiota reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously germ-free Il10 mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Microbiota transplantation and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice colonized with microbiota cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis) compared with mice fed microbiota cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible to colitis). Oral administration to mice of microbiota-derived secondary bile  sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic  or , reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile -producing bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C\xa0jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10 mice compared with the nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic ; colitis induction by antibiotics was associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate.We identified a mechanism by which the microbiota controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

However, whether WZ exerts a protective effect against cholestasis remains unclear. In this study, the protective effect of WZ on  (LCA)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice was characterized and the involved mechanisms were investigated. WZ pretreatment (350 mg/kg) with LCA significantly reversed liver necrosis and decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids and total bilirubin were also remarkably reduced. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed that hepatic expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR) target genes such as CYP3A11 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 were significantly increased by WZ treatment. Luciferase assays performed in LS174T cells illustrated that WZ extract and its six bioactive lignans could all activate human PXR. In addition, WZ treatment significantly promoted liver regeneration via inhibition of p53/p21 to induce cell proliferation-associated proteins such as cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In conclusion, WZ has a protective effect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, partially owing to activation of the PXR pathway and promotion of liver regeneration.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924312>Effect of Wheat Dietary Fiber Particle Size during Digestion In Vitro on Bile , Faecal Bacteria and Short-Chain Fatty  Content.</a></h2><p>The influence of bile  concentration on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria was demonstrated.

In this study, we examined whether this decrease in CYP3A expression is induced by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the main component of GP. After a diet containing 1.5% EGCG was given to mice, the hepatic CYP3A expression was measured. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp., the concentration of  (LCA) in the feces, and the level of the translocation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) to the nucleus in the liver were examined. A decrease in the CYP3A expression level was observed beginning on the second day of the treatment with EGCG. The level of translocation of PXR to the nucleus was significantly lower in the EGCG group. The fecal level of LCA was clearly decreased by the EGCG treatment. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp. was also decreased by the EGCG treatment. It is clear that the hepatospecific decrease in the CYP3A expression level observed after a high-dose intake of GP was caused by EGCG. Because EGCG, which is not absorbed from the intestine, causes a decrease in the level of LCA-producing bacteria in the colon, the level of LCA in the liver decreases, resulting in a decrease in the nuclear translocation of PXR, which in turn leads to the observed decrease in the expression level of CYP3A.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the serum biochemistry, liver histopathology, and bile  profiles by LC-MS/MS, and the mRNA expression of transporters and CYPs by an RT-PCR after the following treatments to male Crl:CD (SD) rats: (a) bile duct ligation (BDL); (b) a single oral dose of 150\xa0mg/kg α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT); and (c) repeated oral doses of a novel pyrrolidinecarboxylic  derivative (abbreviated as PCA) at 30, 300, and 1000\xa0mg/kg. The serum total bile  levels and bilirubin concentrations were found to be elevated in all of the groups. However, the bile  component profiles of the PCA group differed significantly from BDL and ANIT models: deoxycholic , , and sulfated bile acids were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner only in the PCA group. In addition, the PCA group demonstrated high levels of hepatic heme oxygenase-1 expression, whereas the profiles of the mRNA levels of the hepatic transporters and CYPs of all groups were found to be similar. The histopathological findings, for both the BDL and ANIT groups, were of bile duct hyperplasia, hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis. In contrast, only bile duct hyperplasia and hepatocyte degeneration were observed in the PCA group, even at a lethal dose. These results indicated that PCA induced a cholestatic condition and the increase of oxidative stress markers implies that this will also lead hepatocellular injury. In conclusion, the serum bile  components and sulfated bile  levels, and the expression of oxidative stress markers could provide information that aids in the diagnosis of liver injury type and helps to elucidate the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity.

This action has been attributed to activation of the G protein-coupled bile  receptor GPBAR1 (TGR5), although other potential bile  sensors include the nuclear farnesoid receptor and the apical sodium-coupled bile  transporter ASBT. The aim of this study was to identify  important for GLP-1 release and to determine whether bile acids target their receptors on GLP-1-secreting L-cells from the apical or basolateral compartment. Using transgenic mice expressing fluorescent sensors specifically in L-cells, we observed that taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) and taurolithocholate (TLCA) increased intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+). In primary intestinal cultures, TDCA was a more potent GLP-1 secretagogue than taurocholate (TCA) and TLCA, correlating with a stronger Ca(2+) response to TDCA. Using small-volume Ussing chambers optimized for measuring GLP-1 secretion, we found that both a GPBAR1 agonist and TDCA stimulated GLP-1 release better when applied from the basolateral than from the luminal direction and that luminal TDCA was ineffective when intestinal tissue was pretreated with an ASBT inhibitor. ASBT inhibition had no significant effect in nonpolarized primary cultures. Studies in the perfused rat gut confirmed that vascularly administered TDCA was more effective than luminal TDCA. Intestinal primary cultures and Ussing chamber-mounted tissues from GPBAR1-knockout mice did not secrete GLP-1 in response to either TLCA or TDCA. We conclude that the action of bile acids on GLP-1 secretion is predominantly mediated by GPBAR1 located on the basolateral L-cell membrane, suggesting that stimulation of gut hormone secretion may include postabsorptive mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656109>Bile acids are important direct and indirect regulators of the secretion of appetite- and -regulating hormones from the gut and pancreas.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) facilitate fat absorption and may play a role in glucose and  regulation, stimulating the secretion of gut hormones. The relative importance and mechanisms involved in BA-stimulated secretion of appetite and  regulating hormones from the gut and pancreas is not well described and was the purpose of this study.The effects of bile acids on the secretion of gut and pancreatic hormones was studied in rats and compared to the most well described nutritional secretagogue: glucose. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the secretion was studied by isolated perfused rat and mouse small intestine and pancreas preparations and supported by immunohistochemistry, expression analysis, and pharmacological studies.Bile acids robustly stimulate secretion of not only the incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but also glucagon and insulin in\xa0vivo, to levels comparable to those resulting from glucose stimulation. The mechanisms of GLP-1, neurotensin, and peptide YY (PYY) secretion was secondary to intestinal absorption and depended on activation of basolateral membrane Takeda G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) receptors on the L-cells in the following order of potency:  (LCA) >Deoxycholicacid (DCA)>Chenodeoxycholicacid (CDCA)> Cholic  (CA). Thus BAs did not stimulate secretion of GLP-1 and PYY from perfused small intestine in TGR5 KO mice but stimulated robust responses in wild type littermates. TGR5 is not expressed on α-cells or β-cells, and BAs had no direct effects on glucagon or insulin secretion from the perfused pancreas.BAs should be considered not only as fat emulsifiers but also as important regulators of appetite- and -regulating hormones by activation of basolateral intestinal TGR5.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial  on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial  of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine.

In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance.

Activation of PKC was determined from the translocation of PKC to PM using a biotinylation method. Phosphorylation of MARCKS was determined by immunoblotting with a phospho-MARCKS antibody.

Based on these results, we conclude that the reversal of TLC-induced cholestasis by cAMP and TUDC involves, at least in part, inhibition of TLC-mediated activation of the PKCε/MARCKS phosphorylation pathway.© 2017 The Authors.

Although there is accumulating preclinical evidence that walnuts beneficially affect the gastrointestinal microbiota and gut and metabolic health, these relations have not been investigated in humans.We aimed to assess the impact of walnut consumption on the human gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolic markers of health.A controlled-feeding, randomized crossover study was undertaken in healthy men and women [n\xa0=\xa018; mean age\xa0=\xa053.1 y; body mass index (kg/m2): 28.8]. Study participants received isocaloric diets containing 0 or 42 g walnuts/d for two 3-wk periods, with a 1-wk washout between diet periods. Fecal and blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each period to assess secondary outcomes of the study, including effects of walnut consumption on fecal microbiota and bile acids and metabolic markers of health.Compared with after the control period, walnut consumption resulted in a 49-160% higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Dialister, and Roseburia and 16-38% lower relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Dorea, Oscillospira, and Bifidobacterium (P\xa0<\xa00.05). Fecal secondary bile acids, deoxycholic  and , were 25% and 45% lower, respectively, after the walnut treatment compared with the control treatment (P\xa0<\xa00.05). Serum LDL cholesterol and the noncholesterol sterol campesterol concentrations were 7% and 6% lower, respectively, after walnut consumption compared with after the control treatment (P\xa0<\xa00.01).Walnut consumption affected the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiota, increasing the relative abundances of Firmicutes species in butyrate-producing Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and reducing microbially derived, proinflammatory secondary bile acids and LDL cholesterol. These results suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiota may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial health effects of walnut consumption.

Implications in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis in advanced cholestatic and end-stage liver disease is related to low bone formation. Previous studies have demonstrated the deleterious consequences of  (LCA) and bilirubin on osteoblastic cells. These effects are partially or completely neutralized by ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). We have assessed the differential gene expression of osteoblastic cells under different culture conditions. The experiments were performed in human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) cultured with LCA (10 μM), bilirubin (50 μM) or UDCA (10 and 100 μM) at 2 and 24 hours. Expression of 87 genes related to bone metabolism and other signalling pathways were assessed by TaqMan micro fluidic cards. Several genes were up-regulated by LCA, most of them pro-apoptotic (BAX, BCL10, BCL2L13, BCL2L14), but also MGP (matrix Gla protein), BGLAP (osteocalcin), SPP1 (osteopontin) and CYP24A1, and down-regulated bone morphogenic protein genes (BMP3 and BMP4) and DKK1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1). Parallel effects were observed with bilirubin, which up-regulated apoptotic genes and CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and down-regulated antiapoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L1), BMP3, BMP4 and RUNX2. UDCA 100 μM had specific consequences since differential expression was observed, up-regulating BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, CALCR (calcitonin receptor), SPOCK3 (osteonectin), BGLAP (osteocalcin) and SPP1 (osteopontin), and down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, most of the differential expression changes induced by both LCA and bilirubin were partially or completely neutralized by UDCA. Conclusion: Our observations reveal novel target genes, whose regulation by retained substances of cholestasis may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in cholestatic and end-stage liver diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The complicated etiology and injury mechanism greatly limits the development of new drugs for its treatment. To better understand the mechanism of cholestatic liver damage, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-linked electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS) and multivariate data analysis were used to determine the metabolic changes in three recognized mouse cholestasis models. The cholestatic liver damage was generated by alphanaphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT), 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) and  (LCA). The results indicated that the levels of bile acids were commonly increased in plasma of three mouse cholestasis models, while arginine was decreased. The level of plasma glutathione was decreased in ANIT- and LCA-induced intrahepatic PBC and PSC, respectively. But, the liver glutathione was decreased in DDC induced extrahepatic PSC. The level of plasma phospholipids was elevated in ANIT and DDC models, whereas that was depleted in LCA model. And protoporphyrin IX was significantly increased in the liver of DDC model. These metabolomics data could potentially distinguish the metabolic differences of three types of cholestasis, contributing to the understanding of the potential mechanism of cholestatic liver damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because TGR5 promotes energy expenditure and improves glucose homeostasis, it is recognized as a key target in treating  diseases. We previously showed that nomilin, a citrus limonoid, activates TGR5 and confers anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic effects in mice. Information on the TGR5-nomilin interaction regarding molecular structure, however, has not been reported. In the present study, we found that human TGR5 (hTGR5) shows higher nomilin responsiveness than does mouse TGR5 (mTGR5). Using mouse-human chimeric TGR5, we also found that three amino  residues (Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29) are important in the hTGR5-nomilin interaction. Based on these results, an hTGR5-nomilin binding model was constructed using in silico docking simulation, demonstrating that four hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between nomilin and hTGR5. The binding mode of hTGR5-nomilin is vastly different from those of other TGR5 agonists previously reported, suggesting that TGR5 forms various binding patterns depending on the type of agonist. Our study promotes a better understanding of the structure of TGR5, and it may be useful in developing and screening new TGR5 agonists.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185272>Bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts through farnesoid X receptor-dependent and independent .</a></h2><p>The roles of bile  microaspiration and bile -activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that bile acids activate alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts, which may be regulated by FXR activation.Human AECs and normal or IPF-derived lung fibroblast cells were incubated with the three major bile acids:  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The AECs injury indices, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung fibroblast activation were evaluated. FXR expression in IPF lungs and the roles of FXR and FXR-independent  in bile -induced profibrotic effects were also investigated.LCA, DCA and CDCA reduced cell viability and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in A549 cells. They all induced EMT, as shown by enhanced α-SMA and vimentin and decreased E-cadherin levels. LCA directly induced differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. All three bile acids promoted cellular migration but not proliferation of lung fibroblasts. FXR expression was upregulated in IPF lungs, and inhibition of FXR restrained the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast activation. Differentiation and proliferation were enhanced in lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from bile -stimulated A549 cells, which contained increased levels of profibrotic factors.

They undergo enterohepatic circulation through various transporters expressed in intestine and liver. Human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 contribute to hepatic uptake of bile acids such as taurocholic . However, the transport properties of individual bile acids are not well understood. Therefore, we selected HEK293 cells overexpressing OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 to evaluate the transport of five major human bile acids (cholic , chenodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , ursodeoxycholic , ) together withtheir glycine and taurine conjugates via OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The bile acids were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The present study revealed that cholic , chenodeoxyxcholic , and deoxycholic  were transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, while ursodeoxycholic  and  were not significantly transported by OATPs. However, all the conjugated bile acids were taken up rapidly by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Kinetic analyses revealed the involvement of saturable OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bile acids. The apparent Km values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 of the conjugated bile acids were similar (0.74-14.7 μM for OATP1B1 and 0.47-15.3 μM for OATP1B3). They exhibited higher affinity than cholic  (47.1 μM for OATP1B1 and 42.2 μM for OATP1B3).

These bioactive molecules play important roles in several physiological  including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of human NAPE-PLD and discovered specific binding sites for the bile  deoxycholic . In this study, we demonstrate that in the presence of this secondary bile , the stiffness of the protein measured by elastic neutron scattering increases, and NAPE-PLD is ∼7 times faster to catalyze the hydrolysis of the more unsaturated substrate N-arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, compared with N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Chenodeoxycholic  and glyco- or tauro-dihydroxy conjugates can also bind to NAPE-PLD and drive its activation. The only natural monohydroxy bile , , shows an affinity of ∼20 μM and acts instead as a reversible inhibitor (IC ≈ 68 μM).

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and deoxycholic and  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant microbiota corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant microbiota corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex microbiota dominated by a variety of  and  species.

Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the dimeric MNoV VP1 protruding (P) domain in complex with its cellular receptor CD300lf. CD300lf binds the P domain with a 2:2 stoichiometry, engaging a cleft between the AB and DE loops of the P2 subdomain at a site that overlaps the epitopes of neutralizing antibodies. We also identify that bile acids are cofactors enhancing MNoV cell-binding and infectivity. Structures of CD300lf-P domain in complex with glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) and  (LCA) reveal two bile  binding sites at the P domain dimer interface distant from receptor binding sites. The structural determinants for receptor and bile  binding are supported by numerous biophysical assays utilizing interface residue mutations. We find that the monomeric affinity of CD300lf for the P domain is low and is divalent cation dependent. We have also determined the crystal structure of CD300lf in complex with phosphocholine, revealing that MNoV engages its receptor in a manner mimicking host ligands including similar metal coordination. Docking of the cocomplex structures onto a cryo-EM-derived model of MNoV suggests that each virion can make multiple CD300lf engagements, and thus, infection may be driven by the avidity of cell surface clustered CD300lf. These studies identify multiple potential modulators of norovirus infection that may act to regulate the interaction between the viral capsid P domain and its cognate cellular receptor.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Twelve Genesus [(Duroc ♂ × Yorkshire-Landrace ♀)] cannulated barrows (initial BW: 35.1 ± 0.44 kg) were individually housed and offered diets in a two-period cross-over design (n = 8). In each period, four pigs were assigned to one of the three corn-soybean meal-based diets without (control), or with FM or OHs. Soybean oil was added in each diet to give an FA content of 4.56%, 6.02%, and 6.05 % in the control, FM, and OH diets, respectively. Feces and ileal digesta contents were collected to determine apparent ileal (AID), total tract (ATTD) digestibility of dietary components and flows of FA and BA. Pigs fed the control diet had greater (P < 0.05) AID of SFA and insoluble DF and ATTD of SFA than pigs offered the OH and FM diets. The AID of total FA and MUFA in FM diet-fed pigs was lower (P = 0.02) compared to those fed the control and OH diets. The ATTD of CP, NDF, insoluble and total DF was lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the OH diet than in pigs that consumed the control and FM diets. In the terminal ileum, pigs fed OH and FM diets excreted more (P < 0.05) primary BA and all secondary BA (except ) compared to control diet-fed pigs. The intestinal flows of  in pigs fed the FM diet were higher (P < 0.05) than in pigs offered the control diet. Pigs fed FM and OH diets excreted more (P = 0.001) fecal ursodeoxycholic and total BAs compared to pigs that consumed the control diet. The ileal flows of eicosapentaenoic and erucic acids in pigs fed the FM and OH diets were greater (P < 0.05) than in pigs fed the control diet. The flow of all SFA, and palmitoleic, palmitelaidic, oleic, nervonic, linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, erucic, docosatetraenoic and docosapentaenoic acids in feces were greater (P < 0.05) in OH diet-fed pigs compared to pigs fed other diets. In conclusion, addition of FM and OHs in pig diets reduced FA digestibility, increased gastrointestinal flows of FA and excretion of BA. Dietary supplementation with FM and OHs induces variable effects on digestibility of DF fractions and fecal flows of unsaturated FA. Future studies are needed to quantify the contribution of endogenous FA losses from the host to gastrointestinal flows of FA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248338>Angiopoietin-Like Protein 8 Is a Novel Vitamin D Receptor Target Gene Involved in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression is increased in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and is required for liver steatosis in an NAFL mouse model. However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or . The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Dietary fibre should be contained in everyday, easily accessible food products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine sorption capacities of primary bile  (cholic  - CA) and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic - DCA and  acids - LCA) by muffins (BM) and cookies (BC) with bioactive substances and control muffins (CM) and cookies (CC) in two sections of the in vitro gastrointestinal tract.

Enzymes: pepsin, pancreatin and bile salts: cholic , deoxycholic  and  were added to the culture. Faecal bacteria, isolated from human large intestine, were added in the section of large intestine. The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325587>Oxidative stress markers, secondary bile acids and sulfated bile acids classify the clinical liver injury type: Promising diagnostic biomarkers for cholestasis.</a></h2><p>Clinicians sometimes encounter difficulty in choosing a therapeutic strategy due to the uncertainty regarding the type of liver injury. In particular, cholestasis is difficult to diagnose by conventional markers at an early stage of disease. The aim of this study was to identify promising biomarkers for distinguishing the symptom-based types of liver injury (e.g. hepatocellular injury, cholestasis), which was derived from a rigorously statistical perspective. The associations between diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. bile  components, oxidative stress markers and liver fibrosis markers) and the liver injury types were assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis using 304 blood samples from patients with liver disease. As a result, reductions in the  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) levels, and elevation of the serum sulfated bile  (SSBA), liver fibrosis marker IV collagen (type IV collagen), hyaluronic  (HA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all significantly associated with cholestasis. On the other hand, elevations in the LCA and type IV collagen levels, and a reduction in the ursodeoxy cholic  (UDCA) level, were significantly associated with hepatocellular injury. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for ROS, followed by DCA, HA, LCA, SSBA and type IV collagen in the cholestatic-type cases. These results indicated that ROS, the secondary bile  levels such as DCA and LCA, and SSBA are promising biomarkers for cholestasis and for classifying the type of liver injuries.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA) are the only two FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches for cholestasis. Here, anti-cholestasis effects of the lignans from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Schisandra sphenanthera, were investigated as well as the involved mechanisms.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 9 groups including the control group, LCA group, LCA with specific lignan treatment of Schisandrin A (SinA), Schisandrin B (SinB), Schisandrin C (SinC), Schisandrol A (SolA), Schisandrol B (SolB), Schisantherin A (StnA) and Schisantherin B (StnB), respectively. Mice were treated with each drug (qd) for 7 days, while the administration of  (LCA) (bid) was launched from the 4th day. Twelve hours after the last LCA injection, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Serum biochemical measurement and histological analysis were conducted. Metabolomics analysis of serum, liver, intestine and feces were performed to study the  profile of bile acids. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the hepatic expression of genes and proteins related to bile  homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the transactivation effect of lignans on human pregnane X receptor (hPXR). RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the  of bile acids and increased the bile  efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR.

We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling  in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota.

Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile   are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed.

Plasma biomarkers are needed to guide the genetic testing of spastic paraplegia. Spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5) is an autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia due to mutations in CYP7B1, which encodes a cytochrome P450 7α-hydroxylase implicated in cholesterol and bile acids . We developed a method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to validate two plasma 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) as diagnostic biomarkers in a cohort of 21 patients with SPG5. For 14 patients, SPG5 was initially suspected on the basis of genetic analysis, and then confirmed by increased plasma 25-OHC, 27-OHC and their ratio to total cholesterol. For seven patients, the diagnosis was initially based on elevated plasma oxysterol levels and confirmed by the identification of two causal CYP7B1 mutations. The receiver operating characteristic curves analysis showed that 25-OHC, 27-OHC and their ratio to total cholesterol discriminated between SPG5 patients and healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Taking advantage of the robustness of these plasma oxysterols, we then conducted a phase II therapeutic trial in 12 patients and tested whether candidate molecules (atorvastatin, chenodeoxycholic  and resveratrol) can lower plasma oxysterols and improve bile acids profile. The trial consisted of a three-period, three-treatment crossover study and the six different sequences of three treatments were randomized. Using a linear mixed effect regression model with a random intercept, we observed that atorvastatin decreased moderately plasma 27-OHC (∼30%, P < 0.001) but did not change 27-OHC to total cholesterol ratio or 25-OHC levels. We also found an abnormal bile acids profile in SPG5 patients, with significantly decreased total serum bile acids associated with a relative decrease of ursodeoxycholic and  acids compared to deoxycholic . Treatment with chenodeoxycholic  restored bile acids profile in SPG5 patients. Therefore, the combination of atorvastatin and chenodeoxycholic  may be worth considering for the treatment of SPG5 patients but the neurological benefit of these  interventions remains to be evaluated in phase III therapeutic trials using clinical, imaging and/or electrophysiological outcome measures with sufficient effect sizes. Overall, our study indicates that plasma 25-OHC and 27-OHC are robust diagnostic biomarkers of SPG5 and shall be used as first-line investigations in any patient with unexplained spastic paraplegia.© The Author (2017).

We hypothesized that LCA can modulate oxidative stress to exert cytostatic effects in breast cancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with LCA decreased nuclear factor-2 (NRF2) expression and increased Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) expression via activation of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Altered NRF2 and KEAP1 expression subsequently led to decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), an antioxidant enzyme, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant enzymes increased cytostatic effects via increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological induction of NRF2 with RA839, tBHQ, or by thiol antioxidants. The expression of key components of the LCA-elicited cytostatic pathway (iNOS and 4HNE) gradually decreased as the breast cancer stage advanced. The level of lipid peroxidation in tumors negatively correlated with the mitotic index. The overexpression of iNOS, nNOS, CAR, KEAP1, NOX4, and TGR5 or the downregulation of NRF2 correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients, except for triple negative cases. Taken together, LCA, a metabolite of the gut microbiome, elicits oxidative stress that slows down the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The LCA-oxidative stress protective pathway is lost as breast cancer progresses, and the loss correlates with poor prognosis.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  and . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and deoxycholic , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29655782>, a bacterial metabolite reduces breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressiveness.</a></h2><p>Our study aimed at finding a mechanistic relationship between the gut microbiome and breast cancer.

In murine and bench experiments, a secondary bile ,  (LCA) in concentrations corresponding to its tissue reference concentrations (< 1 μM), reduced cancer cell proliferation (by 10-20%) and VEGF production (by 37%), aggressiveness and metastatic potential of primary tumors through inducing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, increased antitumor immune response, OXPHOS and the TCA cycle. Part of these effects was due to activation of TGR5 by LCA. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced serum LCA levels, reduced chenodeoxycholic  to LCA ratio, and reduced abundance of the baiH (7α/β-hydroxysteroid dehydroxylase, the key enzyme in LCA generation) gene in fecal DNA, all suggesting reduced microbial generation of LCA in early breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal  profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight.

The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549099>Metabolism of Oxo-Bile Acids and Characterization of Recombinant 12α-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases from Bile  7α-Dehydroxylating Human Gut Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are important cholesterol-derived nutrient signaling hormones, synthesized in the liver, that act as detergents to solubilize dietary lipids.

We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2\u2009weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn\'s disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn\'s disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn\'s disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut . Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The putative cytotoxic effects of LCA on these cells were also examined.The effects of LCA on breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were studied using MTT viability assays, Annexin-FITC and Akt phosphorylation assays to evaluate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays to assess the expression of the bile  receptor TGR5 and the estrogen receptor ERα, and genes and proteins involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, p53) and lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, FASN, ACACA). Intracellular lipid droplets were visualized using Oil Red O staining.We found that LCA induces TGR5 expression and exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of lipid droplets compared to untreated control cells. Finally, a decrease in ERα expression was observed in MCF-7 cells treated with LCA.Our data suggest a potential therapeutic role of  in breast cancer cells through a reversion of lipid metabolism deregulation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957301>Longitudinal assessment of microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile  concentrations, and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive chronic inflammatory enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence from human studies suggests that bile  dysmetabolism might play a role in various human chronic gastrointestinal diseases. It is unknown whether fecal bile  dysmetabolism occurs in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CE).To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.Twenty-four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid-responsive CE.In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal microbiota were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P\u2009=\u2009.002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P\u2009=\u2009.049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3\u2009months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P\u2009=\u20090.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE.

This difference has a major impact on the gut microbiome, especially on anaerobic spore-forming bacteria. CA augments germination of spores in the terminal ileum.

The control mechanism that exists in the adult cecum is absent in the young child and results in unrestrained proliferation of anaerobes, such as , in the cecum.

The mammalian liver synthesizes and secretes hydrophilic primary bile acids, some of which enter the colon during the enterohepatic circulation, and are converted into numerous hydrophobic metabolites which are capable of entering the portal circulation, returned to the liver, and in humans, accumulating in the biliary pool. Bile acids are hormones that regulate their own synthesis, transport, in addition to glucose and lipid homeostasis, and energy balance. The gut microbial community through their capacity to produce bile  metabolites distinct from the liver can be thought of as an "endocrine organ" with potential to alter host physiology, perhaps to their own favor. We propose the term "sterolbiome" to describe the genetic potential of the gut microbiome to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous and exogenous steroids in the mammalian gut. The affinity of secondary bile  metabolites to host nuclear receptors is described, the potential of secondary bile acids to promote tumors, and the potential of bile acids to serve as therapeutic agents are discussed.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833939>Differential View on the Bile  Stress Response of .</a></h2><p> is an intestinal human pathogen that uses the opportunity of a depleted  to cause an infection.

However, the specific response of growing  cells to diverse bile acids on the molecular level has not been described yet. In this study, we recorded proteome signatures of shock and long-term (LT) stress with the four main bile acids cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA). A general overlapping response to all tested bile acids could be determined particularly in shock experiments which appears plausible in the light of their common steroid structure. However, during LT stress several proteins showed an altered abundance in the presence of only a single or a few of the bile acids indicating the existence of specific adaptation mechanisms. Our results point at a differential induction of the groEL and dnaKJgrpE chaperone systems, both belonging to the class I heat shock genes. Additionally, central metabolic pathways involving butyrate fermentation and the reductive Stickland fermentation of leucine were effected, although CA caused a proteome signature different from the other three bile acids. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed a loss of flagellar proteins in LT stress with LCA. The absence of flagella could be substantiated by electron microscopy which also indicated less flagellated cells in the presence of DCA and CDCA and no influence on flagella formation by CA. Our data break down the bile  stress response of  into a general and a specific adaptation. The latter cannot simply be divided into a response to primary and secondary bile acids, but rather reflects a complex and variable adaptation process enabling  to survive and to cause an infection in the intestinal tract.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864445>Undernutrition Shapes the Gut Microbiota and Bile  Profile in Association with Altered Gut-Liver FXR Signaling in Weaning Pigs.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, synthesized in the liver and metabolized by microbiota, have emerged as important signaling molecules regulating immune responses and cell proliferation.

Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased  production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202273>Effects of barley variety, dietary fiber and β-glucan content on bile  composition in cecum of rats fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced  and insulin resistance have been linked to changes in bile  (BA) profiles, which in turn are highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is regarded as a chemopreventive beneficial bile  due to its low hydrophobicity. However, it is a minor constituent of human bile acids. Here, we characterized an UDCA-producing bacterium, N53, isolated from human feces. 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified this isolate as Ruminococcus gnavus, a novel UDCA-producer. The forward reaction that produces UDCA from 7-oxo- was observed to have a growth-dependent conversion rate of 90-100% after culture in GAM broth containing 1 mM 7-oxo-, while the reverse reaction was undetectable. The gene encoding 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH), which facilitates the UDCA-producing reaction, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of the purified 7β-HSDH revealed that the kcat/Km value was about 55-fold higher for the forward reaction than for the reverse reaction, indicating that the enzyme favors the UDCA-producing reaction.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut , and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group).

We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and hepatic metabolism. In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut microbiome, bile  metabolism, and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides. Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced metabolic phenotypes and inhibited taurolithocholic  synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile  synthesis gene expression but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX treatment effectively improved lipid profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion, improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning, while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial metabolic effects of FEX in obese and diabetic mice.This study uncovered a mechanism in which activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut  to activate TGR5/GLP-1 signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose tissue browning; the gut  plays a critical role in bile  metabolism and signaling to regulate metabolic homeostasis in health and disease.

The conversion of bile acids by the gut microbiome is now recognized as a factor affecting both host metabolism and immune responses, but its physiological roles remain unclear. We conducted a screen for microbiome metabolites that would function as inflammasome activators and herein report the identification of 12-oxo- (BAA485), a potential microbiome-derived bile  metabolite. We demonstrate that the more potent analogue 11-oxo-12-hydroxylithocholic  methyl ester (BAA473) can induce secretion of interleukin-18 (IL-18) through activation of the inflammasome in both myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen with compound induced pyroptosis in THP-1 cells, we identified that inflammasome activation by BAA473 is pyrin-dependent (). To our knowledge, the bile  analogues BAA485 and BAA473 are the first small molecule activators of the pyrin inflammasome. We surmise that pyrin inflammasome activation through -modified bile  metabolites such as BAA473 and BAA485 plays a role in gut  regulated intestinal immune response.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis. The delayed pathogenesis of  in -colonized mice was associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile  transformation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871908>Acetylated deoxycholic (DCA) and cholic (CA) acids are potent ligands of pregnane X (PXR) receptor.</a></h2><p>The Pregnane X (PXR), Vitamin D (VDR) and Farnesoid X (FXR) nuclear receptors have been shown to be receptors of bile acids controlling their detoxification or synthesis. Chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) and  (LCA) acids are ligands of FXR and VDR, respectively, whereas 3-keto and acetylated derivates of LCA have been described as ligands for all three receptors. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidation or acetylation at position 3, 7 and 12 of bile acids DCA (deoxycholic ), LCA, CA (cholic ), and CDCA by detoxification enzymes or microbiome may have an effect on the interactions with bile  nuclear receptors. We employed reporter gene assays in HepG2 cells, the TR-FRET assay with recombinant PXR and RT-PCR to study the effects of acetylated and keto bile acids on the nuclear receptors activation and their target gene expression in differentiated hepatic HepaRG cells. We demonstrate that the DCA 3,12-diacetate and CA 3,7,12-triacetate derivatives are ligands of PXR and DCA 3,12-diacetate induces PXR target genes such as CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and ABCB1/MDR1.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks.

Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269035>Cranberries attenuate animal-based diet-induced changes in  composition and functionality: a randomized crossover controlled feeding trial.</a></h2><p>Cranberries have multiple health effects but their impact on gut  has not been examined in randomized controlled feeding trials.

In this study, we examined whether this decrease in CYP3A expression is induced by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the main component of GP. After a diet containing 1.5% EGCG was given to mice, the hepatic CYP3A expression was measured. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp., the concentration of  (LCA) in the feces, and the level of the translocation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) to the nucleus in the liver were examined. A decrease in the CYP3A expression level was observed beginning on the second day of the treatment with EGCG. The level of translocation of PXR to the nucleus was significantly lower in the EGCG group. The fecal level of LCA was clearly decreased by the EGCG treatment. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp. was also decreased by the EGCG treatment. It is clear that the hepatospecific decrease in the CYP3A expression level observed after a high-dose intake of GP was caused by EGCG. Because EGCG, which is not absorbed from the intestine, causes a decrease in the level of LCA-producing bacteria in the colon, the level of LCA in the liver decreases, resulting in a decrease in the nuclear translocation of PXR, which in turn leads to the observed decrease in the expression level of CYP3A.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934972>-Microbial Metabolome-Cancer Cell Interactions in Breast Cancer-Familiar, but Unexplored.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide.

Remarkably, DCA excluded C. jejuni cecal colonization below the limit of detection at 16 and 28 days of age. Neither chicken ages of infection nor LCA or UDCA altered C. jejuni AR101 chicken colonization level, while DCA reduced 91% of the bacterium in chickens at d28. Notably, DCA diet reduced phylum Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes compared to infected control birds. Importantly, DCA-Anaero attenuated 93% of C. jejuni colonization at d28 compared to control infected birds. In conclusion, DCA shapes microbiota composition against C. jejuni colonization in chickens, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and microbial metabolites.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550982>The association between gut  development and maturation of intestinal bile  metabolism in the first 3 y of healthy Japanese infants.</a></h2><p>The gut microbial community greatly changes in early life, influencing infant health and subsequent host physiology, notably through its collective metabolism, including host- interplay of bile  (BA) metabolism. However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and deoxycholic and  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant  corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant  corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex  dominated by a variety of  and  species. Addressing the link of the common developmental passage of intestinal BA metabolism with infant\'s health and subsequent host physiology requires further study.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769799>Allspice and Clove As Source of Triterpene Acids Activating the G Protein-Coupled Bile  Receptor TGR5.</a></h2><p>Worldwide, metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2  have reached epidemic proportions. A major regulator of metabolic processes that gained interest in recent years is the bile  receptor TGR5 (Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). This G protein-coupled membrane receptor can be found predominantly in the intestine, where it is mainly responsible for the secretion of the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). The aim of this study was (i) to identify plant extracts with TGR5-activating potential, (ii) to narrow down their activity to the responsible constituents, and (iii) to assess whether the intestinal microbiota produces transformed metabolites with a different activity profile. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) served as positive control for both, the applied cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay for TGR5 activity and the biotransformation assay using mouse fecal slurry. The suitability of the workflow was demonstrated by the biotransformation of CDCA to  resulting in a distinct increase in TGR5 activity. Based on a traditional Tibetan formula, 19 plant extracts were selected and investigated for TGR5 activation. Extracts from the commonly used spices  (SaroE, clove),  (PdioE, allspice), and  (KgalE, aromatic ginger) significantly increased TGR5 activity. After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM). In conclusion, extracts of clove, allspice, and aromatic ginger activate TGR5, which might play a pivotal role in their therapeutic use for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Moreover, the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to TTAs.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25677572>Binding of bile acids by pastry products containing bioactive substances during in vitro digestion.</a></h2><p>The modern day consumer tends to choose products with health enhancing properties, enriched in bioactive substances. One such bioactive food component is dietary fibre, which shows a number of physiological properties including the binding of bile acids. Dietary fibre should be contained in everyday, easily accessible food products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine sorption capacities of primary bile  (cholic  - CA) and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic - DCA and  acids - LCA) by muffins (BM) and cookies (BC) with bioactive substances and control muffins (CM) and cookies (CC) in two sections of the in vitro gastrointestinal tract. Variations in gut flora were also analysed in the process of in vitro digestion of pastry products in a bioreactor. Enzymes: pepsin, pancreatin and bile salts: cholic , deoxycholic  and  were added to the culture. Faecal bacteria, isolated from human large intestine, were added in the section of large intestine. The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493883> controls adaptive immune responses by inhibition of Th1 activation through the Vitamin D receptor.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are established signaling molecules next to their role in the intestinal emulsification and uptake of lipids. We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota. Our data may suggest that these factors also impact on adaptive immunity via a yet unrecognized LCA-Th cell axis.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617190>Bile  oxidation by Eggerthella lenta strains C592 and DSM 2243.</a></h2><p>Strains of Eggerthella lenta are capable of oxidation-reduction reactions capable of oxidizing and epimerizing bile  hydroxyl groups. Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile  metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut . We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile  metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile  metabolism in the gut.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  and . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and deoxycholic , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978875>Agaro-Oligosaccharides Regulate Gut  and Adipose Tissue Accumulation in Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  are deeply associated with the prevalence of obesity.

Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal  profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight.

The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM.

Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01).

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn\'s disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn\'s disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn\'s disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion.

Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Biliary acids are currently recognized as signaling molecules in the intestine, in addition to their classical roles in the digestion and absorption of lipids. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of  (LCA) on the lipogenesis of breast cancer cells. The putative cytotoxic effects of LCA on these cells were also examined.The effects of LCA on breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were studied using MTT viability assays, Annexin-FITC and Akt phosphorylation assays to evaluate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays to assess the expression of the bile  receptor TGR5 and the estrogen receptor ERα, and genes and proteins involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, p53) and lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, FASN, ACACA). Intracellular lipid droplets were visualized using Oil Red O staining.We found that LCA induces TGR5 expression and exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of lipid droplets compared to untreated control cells. Finally, a decrease in ERα expression was observed in MCF-7 cells treated with LCA.Our data suggest a potential therapeutic role of  in breast cancer cells through a reversion of lipid metabolism deregulation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957301>Longitudinal assessment of microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile  concentrations, and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive chronic inflammatory enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence from human studies suggests that bile  dysmetabolism might play a role in various human chronic gastrointestinal diseases. It is unknown whether fecal bile  dysmetabolism occurs in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CE).To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.Twenty-four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid-responsive CE.In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal microbiota were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P\u2009=\u2009.002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P\u2009=\u2009.049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3\u2009months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P\u2009=\u20090.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE. Additionally, resolution of clinical activity index in dogs with therapeutically managed CE and bile  dysmetabolism are likely correlated. However, subclinical disease (i.e., microbial dysbiosis) can persist in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.© 2019 The Authors.

In the first 3 yr of life, intestinal bile consists mostly of two primary bile acids, cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA); however, in adults, primary bile acids are transformed into the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic  (DCA) and . This difference has a major impact on the gut microbiome, especially on anaerobic spore-forming bacteria. CA augments germination of spores in the terminal ileum. On the other hand, DCA curtails the number of germinated anaerobes entering the cecum from the terminal ileum. The control mechanism that exists in the adult cecum is absent in the young child and results in unrestrained proliferation of anaerobes, such as , in the cecum. A similar situation may develop during antibiotic therapy when an antibiotic eradicates the anaerobic population capable of converting primary bile acids into secondary bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833939>Differential View on the Bile  Stress Response of .</a></h2><p> is an intestinal human pathogen that uses the opportunity of a depleted  to cause an infection. It is known, that the composition of the intestinal bile  cocktail has a great impact on the susceptibility toward a  infection. However, the specific response of growing  cells to diverse bile acids on the molecular level has not been described yet. In this study, we recorded proteome signatures of shock and long-term (LT) stress with the four main bile acids cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA). A general overlapping response to all tested bile acids could be determined particularly in shock experiments which appears plausible in the light of their common steroid structure. However, during LT stress several proteins showed an altered abundance in the presence of only a single or a few of the bile acids indicating the existence of specific adaptation mechanisms. Our results point at a differential induction of the groEL and dnaKJgrpE chaperone systems, both belonging to the class I heat shock genes. Additionally, central metabolic pathways involving butyrate fermentation and the reductive Stickland fermentation of leucine were effected, although CA caused a proteome signature different from the other three bile acids. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed a loss of flagellar proteins in LT stress with LCA. The absence of flagella could be substantiated by electron microscopy which also indicated less flagellated cells in the presence of DCA and CDCA and no influence on flagella formation by CA. Our data break down the bile  stress response of  into a general and a specific adaptation. The latter cannot simply be divided into a response to primary and secondary bile acids, but rather reflects a complex and variable adaptation process enabling  to survive and to cause an infection in the intestinal tract.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864445>Undernutrition Shapes the Gut Microbiota and Bile  Profile in Association with Altered Gut-Liver FXR Signaling in Weaning Pigs.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, synthesized in the liver and metabolized by microbiota, have emerged as important signaling molecules regulating immune responses and cell proliferation. However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased  production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202273>Effects of barley variety, dietary fiber and β-glucan content on bile  composition in cecum of rats fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced  and insulin resistance have been linked to changes in bile  (BA) profiles, which in turn are highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is regarded as a chemopreventive beneficial bile  due to its low hydrophobicity. However, it is a minor constituent of human bile acids. Here, we characterized an UDCA-producing bacterium, N53, isolated from human feces. 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified this isolate as Ruminococcus gnavus, a novel UDCA-producer. The forward reaction that produces UDCA from 7-oxo- was observed to have a growth-dependent conversion rate of 90-100% after culture in GAM broth containing 1 mM 7-oxo-, while the reverse reaction was undetectable. The gene encoding 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH), which facilitates the UDCA-producing reaction, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of the purified 7β-HSDH revealed that the kcat/Km value was about 55-fold higher for the forward reaction than for the reverse reaction, indicating that the enzyme favors the UDCA-producing reaction. As R. gnavus is a common, core bacterium of the human gut , these results suggest that this bacterium plays a pivotal role in UDCA formation in the colon.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770201>Potential biomarkers to predict outcome of faecal  transfer for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Faecal  transplantation (FMT) has proven high clinical efficacy in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) with cure rates of over 80% after a single treatment. Nevertheless, the reasons for failure in the remaining 20% remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate different potential predictors of response to FMT.Faecal specimens of sixteen patients undergoing FMT for rCDI, as well as samples from the respective donors were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling, bile -inducible (baiCD) gene specific qPCR, and liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids.Using the faecal concentration of the secondary bile   (LCA)within the patient specimens, we were able to predict response to FMT (accuracy 95.2%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 90.9%). By combining the faecal LCA concentration with the urinary pCS concentration, an accuracy of 100% was achieved.LCA appears to be a promising marker candidate for prediction of clinical response to FMT. Other makers, such as urinary concentration of pCS, but not 3-IS, might be used to improve accuracy of prediction.

SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut , and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group).

FXR and TGR5 are coexpressed in the enteroendocrine L cells, but their roles in integrated regulation of metabolism are not completely understood. We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and hepatic metabolism. In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut microbiome, bile  metabolism, and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides. Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced metabolic phenotypes and inhibited taurolithocholic  synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile  synthesis gene expression but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX treatment effectively improved lipid profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion, improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning, while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial metabolic effects of FEX in obese and diabetic mice.This study uncovered a mechanism in which activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut  to activate TGR5/GLP-1 signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose tissue browning; the gut  plays a critical role in bile  metabolism and signaling to regulate metabolic homeostasis in health and disease.

Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids.

We surmise that pyrin inflammasome activation through -modified bile  metabolites such as BAA473 and BAA485 plays a role in gut  regulated intestinal immune response. The discovery of these two bioactive compounds may help to further unveil the importance of pyrin in gut homeostasis and autoimmune diseases.© 2019 Alimov et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645370>Regulations of bile  metabolism in mouse models with hydrophobic bile  composition.</a></h2><p>The bile  (BA) composition in mice is substantially different from that in humans. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis. The delayed pathogenesis of  in -colonized mice was associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile  transformation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168912> and cancer: A mechanistic overview of metabolic changes in  that impact genetic instability.</a></h2><p>, defined as a state of positive energy balance with a body mass index exceeding 30 kg/m in adults and 95th percentile in children, is an increasing global concern.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30269035>Cranberries attenuate animal-based diet-induced changes in  composition and functionality: a randomized crossover controlled feeding trial.</a></h2><p>Cranberries have multiple health effects but their impact on gut  has not been examined in randomized controlled feeding trials.

The animal-based diet included meats, dairy products, and simple sugars. Stool, urine, and blood samples were obtained before and after each intervention phase. As compared to the pre-control diet, control diet modified 46 taxonomic clades, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes. Moreover, it increased bacteria-derived deoxycholic  and decreased acetate and butyrate in stool. As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile acids and decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic acids. No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines.

The chief secondary colonic bile acids, deoxycholic  and , were correlated with fat intake and similar between AAs and CAs, but 3-4 times higher than in AAs (p < 0.05). The major SCFAs were lower in AAs (p < 0.001) and CAs (p < 0.001) compared to AAs, but conversely, the branched chain fatty acids (BFCA) were higher. Our results suggest that the higher risk of colon cancer in Americans may be partly explained by their high-fat and high-protein, low complex carbohydrate diet, which produces colonic residues that promote microbes to produce potentially carcinogenic secondary bile acids and less antineoplastic SCFAs.

This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH.

In this study, we examined whether this decrease in CYP3A expression is induced by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the main component of GP. After a diet containing 1.5% EGCG was given to mice, the hepatic CYP3A expression was measured. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp., the concentration of  (LCA) in the feces, and the level of the translocation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) to the nucleus in the liver were examined. A decrease in the CYP3A expression level was observed beginning on the second day of the treatment with EGCG. The level of translocation of PXR to the nucleus was significantly lower in the EGCG group. The fecal level of LCA was clearly decreased by the EGCG treatment. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp. was also decreased by the EGCG treatment. It is clear that the hepatospecific decrease in the CYP3A expression level observed after a high-dose intake of GP was caused by EGCG. Because EGCG, which is not absorbed from the intestine, causes a decrease in the level of LCA-producing bacteria in the colon, the level of LCA in the liver decreases, resulting in a decrease in the nuclear translocation of PXR, which in turn leads to the observed decrease in the expression level of CYP3A.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273788>Dysregulated hepatic bile acids collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated bile acids (BAs) are closely associated with liver diseases and attributed to altered gut microbiota.

A major regulator of metabolic processes that gained interest in recent years is the bile  receptor TGR5 (Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). This G protein-coupled membrane receptor can be found predominantly in the intestine, where it is mainly responsible for the secretion of the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). The aim of this study was (i) to identify plant extracts with TGR5-activating potential, (ii) to narrow down their activity to the responsible constituents, and (iii) to assess whether the intestinal microbiota produces transformed metabolites with a different activity profile. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) served as positive control for both, the applied cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay for TGR5 activity and the biotransformation assay using mouse fecal slurry. The suitability of the workflow was demonstrated by the biotransformation of CDCA to  resulting in a distinct increase in TGR5 activity. Based on a traditional Tibetan formula, 19 plant extracts were selected and investigated for TGR5 activation. Extracts from the commonly used spices  (SaroE, clove),  (PdioE, allspice), and  (KgalE, aromatic ginger) significantly increased TGR5 activity. After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM).

The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493883> controls adaptive immune responses by inhibition of Th1 activation through the Vitamin D receptor.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are established signaling molecules next to their role in the intestinal emulsification and uptake of lipids. We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota. Our data may suggest that these factors also impact on adaptive immunity via a yet unrecognized LCA-Th cell axis.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617190>Bile  oxidation by Eggerthella lenta strains C592 and DSM 2243.</a></h2><p>Strains of Eggerthella lenta are capable of oxidation-reduction reactions capable of oxidizing and epimerizing bile  hydroxyl groups. Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile  metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut . We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile  metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile  metabolism in the gut.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410198>Specific changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and increase the geroprotective efficiency of  in chronologically aging yeast.</a></h2><p>We have previously found that exogenously added  delays yeast chronological aging.

The intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]), mitochondrial depolarisation and necrosis were assessed by confocal microscopy. Effects of xanthines were evaluated in caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP), taurolithocholic  3-sulfate-induced AP (TLCS-AP) or palmitoleic  plus ethanol-induced AP (fatty  ethyl ester AP (FAEE-AP)). Serum xanthines were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Caffeine, dimethylxanthines and non-xanthine PDE inhibitors blocked IP-mediated Ca oscillations, while monomethylxanthines had little effect. Caffeine and dimethylxanthines inhibited uncaged IP-induced Ca rises, toxin-induced Ca release, mitochondrial depolarisation and necrotic cell death pathway activation; cAMP/cGMP did not inhibit toxin-induced Ca rises. Caffeine significantly ameliorated CER-AP with most effect at 25\u2005mg/kg (seven injections hourly); paraxanthine or theophylline did not. Caffeine at 25\u2005mg/kg significantly ameliorated TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP. Mean total serum levels of dimethylxanthines and trimethylxanthines peaked at >2\u2005mM with 25\u2005mg/kg caffeine but at <100\u2005µM with 25\u2005mg/kg paraxanthine or theophylline.Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites reduced pathological IPR-mediated pancreatic acinar Ca signals but only caffeine ameliorated experimental AP.

Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that LCA alters the age-related dynamics of changes in levels of many mitochondrial proteins, as well as numerous proteins in cellular locations outside of mitochondria. These proteins belong to 2\xa0regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3\xa0different patterns of the age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for many longevity-defining nuclear genes. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how such LCA-driven changes early and late in life of chronologically aging yeast cause a stepwise development of an anti-aging cellular pattern and its maintenance throughout lifespan.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318299>: a new emergent protector of intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</a></h2><p>LCA and 1,25(OH)D are vitamin D receptor ligands with different binding affinity. The secosteroid stimulates intestinal Ca absorption. Whether LCA alters this process remains unknown. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of LCA on intestinal Ca absorption in the absence or presence of NaDOC, bile  that inhibits the cation transport. The data show that LCA by itself did not alter intestinal Ca absorption, but prevented the inhibitory effect of NaDOC. The concomitant administration of LCA avoided the reduction of intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity caused by NaDOC. In addition, LCA blocked a decrease caused by NaDOC on gene and protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption. The oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC were abrogated by LCA co-treatment. In conclusion, LCA placed in the intestinal lumen protects intestinal Ca absorption against the inhibitory effects caused by NaDOC. LCA avoids the reduction of the transcellular Ca movement, apparently by blocking the oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC, normalizing the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in Ca movement. Therefore, LCA might become a possible treatment to improve intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709472>Activation of TGR5 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis has been associated with vascular pathophysiology. The G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) is an important mediator of bile  signaling and glucose . However, the effects of TGR5 on mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells remain elusive. In this study, we found that activation of TGR5 using its specific agonist taurolithocholic  (TLCA) promoted the expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Additionally, activation of TGR5 increased the expression of PGC-1α target genes, such as NRF1 and TFAM. Indeed, we found that TLCA treatment promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA (mtDNA/nDNA), COX-Ⅰ expression, and cytochrome c oxidase activity in HAECs. Notably, our results displayed that activation of TGR5 resulted in a functional gain in mitochondria by increasing the rate of respiration and ATP production. Mechanistically, we found that TLCA treatment activated the transcriptional factor CREB by inducing the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. Using the PKA/CREB inhibitor H89 abolished the effects of TLCA on PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM expression as well as the increase in mtDNA/nDNA and ATP production. These findings suggest that activation of TGR5 promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells, which is mediated by the CREB/PGC-1α signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy.

Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern.

The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10\u2009µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels.

At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced  and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605678>Parabacteroides distasonis Alleviates  and Metabolic Dysfunctions via Production of Succinate and Secondary Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated the metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis (PD) on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.

We tested the novel hypothesis that naturally occurring bile acids interfere with protein-mediated hepatic long chain free fatty  (LCFA) uptake. To this end, stable cell lines expressing fatty  transporters as well as primary hepatocytes from mouse and human livers were incubated with primary and secondary bile acids to determine their effects on LCFA uptake rates. We identified ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) as the two most potent inhibitors of the liver-specific fatty  transport protein 5 (FATP5). Both UDCA and DCA were able to inhibit LCFA uptake by primary hepatocytes in a FATP5-dependent manner. Subsequently, mice were treated with these secondary bile acids in vivo to assess their ability to inhibit diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Administration of DCA in vivo via injection or as part of a high-fat diet significantly inhibited hepatic fatty  uptake and reduced liver triglycerides by more than 50%.The data demonstrate a novel role for specific bile acids, and the secondary bile  DCA in particular, in the regulation of hepatic LCFA uptake. The results illuminate a previously unappreciated means by which specific bile acids, such as UDCA and DCA, can impact hepatic triglyceride metabolism and may lead to novel approaches to combat -associated fatty liver disease.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303767>Prevention of Cell Growth by Suppression of Villin Expression in -Stimulated HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Cholestasis is a condition wherein bile flow is interrupted and  is known to play a key role in causing severe liver injury.

The cause of elevations of serum transaminase in 25% of humans ingesting CDC, however, is unknown, but also may be due to LC. Because efficient hepatic sulfation of LC may protect against hepatic injury, the aim of this study was to determine if sulfation of LC might modify CDC-induced elevations of transaminase. Pretreatment sulfation fraction (SF) was estimated in 63 randomly selected patients with gallstones in a double-blind randomized trial of CDC, 750 mg/d, 375 mg/d, or placebo; in 27 of these, SF was repeated at 1 or 2 yr. In four other patients, the SF was measured at 2 yr only. Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase were determined monthly for 3 mo and then every 3 or 4 mo; an elevation of transaminase was defined as > 150% of the normal upper limit in asymptomatic patients. 10 muCi of (3)H-glyco-LC (sp act 84 mCi/mol) was ingested 10-12 h before fasting duodenal biliary drainage. Bile acids in bile were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The SF was estimated as a percentage of total radioactivity (scintillation counting) in sulfated glyco-LC. The standard deviation for replicate SF determinations (n = 311) was 2.1% The pretreatment SF (mean 60.7+/-1.7 SEM) correlated inversely with age (r = 0.336, P < 0.005) and directly with the  index (r = 0.495, P > 0.001), but was independent of sex. The SF, remeasured at 1 or 2 yr, did not change significantly with time or CDC. Among CDC-treated patients, elevations of transaminase occurred in 75% of patients with a SF < 45% vs. 11% with a SF > 45% (P < 0.001). In conclusion, a SF < 45% occurred in patients with gallstones who had a high probability of developing elevated serum transaminase when treated with CDC.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM). In conclusion, extracts of clove, allspice, and aromatic ginger activate TGR5, which might play a pivotal role in their therapeutic use for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Moreover, the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to TTAs.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013964> Workflow for the Discovery of Natural Products Activating the G Protein-Coupled Bile  Receptor 1.</a></h2><p>The G protein-coupled bile  receptor (GPBAR1) has been recognized as a promising new target for the treatment of diverse diseases, including , type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. The identification of novel and potent GPBAR1 agonists is highly relevant, as these diseases are on the rise and pharmacological unmet therapeutic needs are pervasive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a proficient workflow for the  prediction of GPBAR1 activating compounds, primarily from natural sources. A protocol was set up, starting with a comprehensive collection of structural information of known ligands. This information was used to generate ligand-based pharmacophore models in LigandScout 4.08 Advanced. After theoretical validation, the two most promising models, namely BAMS22 and TTM8, were employed as queries for the virtual screening of natural product and synthetic small molecule databases. Virtual hits were progressed to shape matching experiments and physicochemical clustering. Out of 33 diverse virtual hits subjected to experimental testing using a reporter gene-based assay, two natural products, farnesiferol B () and microlobidene (), were confirmed as GPBAR1 activators reaching more than 50% receptor activation at 20 μM with ECs of 13.53 μM and 13.88 μM, respectively. This activity is comparable to that of the endogenous ligand  (). Seven further virtual hits showed activity reaching at least 15% receptor activation either at 5 or 20 μM, including new scaffolds from natural and synthetic origin.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20665558>The bile  receptor TGR5 (Gpbar-1) acts as a neurosteroid receptor in brain.</a></h2><p>TGR5 (Gpbar-1) is a membrane-bound bile  receptor in the gastrointestinal tract and immune cells with pleiotropic actions. As shown in the present study, TGR5 is also expressed in astrocytes and neurons. Here, TGR5 may act as a neurosteroid receptor, which is activated by nanomolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and micromolar concentrations of 5β-pregnan-3α-17α-21-triol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone). TGR5 stimulation in astrocytes and neurons is coupled to adenylate cyclase activation, elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and the generation of reactive  species. In cultured rat astrocytes, TGR5 mRNA is downregulated in the presence of neurosteroids and ammonia already at concentrations of 0.5 mmol L(-1). Furthermore, TGR5 protein levels are significantly reduced in isolated rat astrocytes after incubation with ammonia. A marked downregulation of TGR5 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex from cirrhotic patients dying with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) when compared with brains from noncirrhotic control subjects. It is concluded that TGR5 is a novel neurosteroid receptor in brain with implications for the pathogenesis of HE.© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825559>Anti-oxidants do not prevent bile -induced cell death in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines are crucial regulators of cell death in acute and chronic liver diseases. The contribution of each factor to hepatocyte death, either apoptosis or necrosis, has not been clarified as yet. It has been suggested that the generation of oxidative stress by bile acids contributes to hepatocyte death during cholestasis and bile  toxicity, although the beneficial role of ROS prevention in bile -mediated cell death is not fully understood.Study the effects of anti-oxidants in bile -induced cell death in vitro.Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to the bile acids glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) or taurolithocholic -3 sulphate in the absence or presence of ROS scavengers or anti-oxidants. Haeme oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA levels were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Apoptosis was quantified by acridine orange staining and caspase-3 activity assay. Necrosis was detected by Sytox green staining.Anti-oxidants do not attenuate bile -induced cell death. Furthermore, bile  exposure does not enhance the mRNA expression of the oxidative stress-responsive gene HO-1. The Src-kinase inhibitor, SU6656, does reduce GCDCA-induced apoptosis and necrosis.In hepatocytes, bile -induced toxicity is not prevented by scavengers of oxidative stress. The beneficial effects observed in patients might be because of the contribution of ROS and cytokines rather than bile -mediated oxidative stress. However, the use of specific Src kinase inhibitors might be a useful tool to prevent bile -induced injury in liver diseases.© 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24370495>Ursodeoxycholic  inhibits overexpression of P-glycoprotein induced by doxorubicin in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>The hepatoprotective action of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was previously suggested to be partially dependent on its antioxidative effect. Doxorubicin (DOX) and reactive  species have also been implicated in the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is encoded by the MDR1 gene and causes antitumor multidrug resistance. In the present study, we assessed the effects of UDCA on the expression of MDR1 mRNA, P-gp, and intracellular reactive  species levels in DOX-treated HepG2 cells and compared them to those of other bile acids. DOX-induced increases in reactive  species levels and the expression of MDR1 mRNA were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, and the DOX-induced increase in reactive  species levels and DOX-induced overexpression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp were inhibited by UDCA. Cells treated with UDCA showed improved rhodamine 123 uptake, which was decreased in cells treated with DOX alone. Moreover, cells exposed to DOX for 24h combined with UDCA accumulated more DOX than that of cells treated with DOX alone. Thus, UDCA may have inhibited the overexpression of P-gp by suppressing DOX-induced reactive  species production. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) also exhibited these effects, whereas deoxycholic  and litocholic  were ineffective. In conclusion, UDCA and CDCA had an inhibitory effect on the induction of P-gp expression and reactive  species by DOX in HepG2 cells. The administration of UDCA may be beneficial due to its ability to prevent the overexpression of reactive  species and acquisition of multidrug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The authors used an isolated, perfused rat liver preparation to determine whether PMNs might injure the liver. Livers from fasted rats were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a recirculating system. Rat peritoneal PMNs (4 x 10(8] or vehicle (Hank\'s balanced salt solution [HBSS], pH 7.35) were added, and liver injury was assessed 90 minutes later by release of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) into the perfusion medium and histopathologic analysis of liver sections. Perfusion of livers receiving only HBSS for 90 minutes resulted in a small increase in ALT activity in the perfusion medium but did not significantly alter histologic features of liver sections. Addition of unstimulated PMNs did not increase further the ALT activity and, with the exception of vascular neutrophilia, did not significantly change the histomorphology compared with controls. When PMNs activated with a combination of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 31 ng/ml) and lithocholate (100 mumol/l [micromolar]) were added to the perfusion system, however, livers released greater amounts of ALT than those perfused with PMA, lithocholate, and HBSS. Activated PMNs caused a transient reduction in flow of perfusion medium that lasted approximately 5 to 15 minutes. Liver sections had multifocal to coalescing foci of moderate to severe, acute hepatocellular necrosis associated with the areas of intense sinusoidal neutrophilia. In addition a second type of lesion was observed and was characterized by triangular foci of necrosis located adjacent to periportal regions of sinusoids or portal veins containing neutrophilic thrombi. These lesions were void of PMNs and were consistent with infarcts. A combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase added to the perfusion medium (500 U/ml each) prevented the elevation in ALT activity but not the transient reduction in flow. These results indicate that activated PMNs may cause liver injury by an  radical-dependent mechanism. It is unclear whether PMN-derived  radicals, hepatocellular-derived  species resulting from reduced tissue perfusion and reperfusion, or both are involved in the pathogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524653>Which way to die: the regulation of acinar cell death in pancreatitis by mitochondria, calcium, and reactive  species.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10048711>The role of ursodeoxycholic  in bile -mediated kidney fragment toxicity.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of bile acids are thought to play an important role in the renal failure of patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing surgery. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (UDA) is widely used to improve cholestasis and has been proposed as protective bile acids and antioxidant. The present study employs kidney fragments to determine the role of reactive  species (ROS) in the mechanism of toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids and to determine the nephroprotectant properties of UDA against the hydrophobic bile acids. The hydrophobic bile acids chenodeoxycholic (200 microM) and deoxycholic  (200 microM) significantly (P<0.05) increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage (LDH) from glomerular fragments from 2.7+/-0.4 to 5.03+/-0.23 and 4.66+/-0.37 (micromol NADH consumed/min/mg protein) for chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic  respectively. Preincubating the fragments with UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the leakage of LDH caused by the bile acids. The level of lipid peroxidation was not increased in fragments exposed to either ursodeoxycholic (0-500 microM),  (0-100 microM), chenodeoxycholic (0-500 microM) or deoxycholic  (0-500 microM). Furthermore UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the increase in lipid peroxidation caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0-1000 microM) in the fragments. These results suggest that hydrophobic bile acids do not cause lipid peroxidation in kidney fragments and that UDA is neither capable of preventing the loss of membrane integrity induced by hydrophobic bile acids or acting as an antioxidant in kidney fragments.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2365980>Tauroursodeoxycholate prevents taurolithocholate-induced cholestasis and toxicity in rat liver.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate has been advocated for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. The coinfusion of tauroursodeoxycholate with taurolithocholate in the perfused rat liver completely prevented the decrease of bile flow and the increase of  uptake found with taurolithocholate only. Bile flow and bile salt secretion were increased with the coinfusion of both bile acids as compared with the infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate only (+4.30 microliters/g liver per 30 min) with 16 and 32 mumol/l tauroursodeoxycholate (+1.55 microliters/g liver per 30 min with 80 and 160 mumol/l). Morphological examination revealed a 50% decrease of the number of necrotic cells in the periportal area.

It is of particular relevance in carcinogenesis, as it represents an epigenetic mechanism for modulation of gene expression. In the present study, A431 cells were exposed to tumor promoters phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), benzoyl peroxide (BP), mezerein and 6-keto- (KA), and their effect on poly-ADP-ribosylation was studied. All these tumor promoters increased the activity of poly-ADPRT in these cells--PMA 2.3-fold, BP and mezerein 2.2-fold each and KA 1.3-fold. The enzyme inhibitor 3-amino benzamide (3AB) partially prevented the stimulation of poly-ADPRT by these promoters. There was a concomitant decrease in NAD levels, the substrate for poly-ADPRT. The decrease was 44% for PMA, 46% for BP, 21% for KA and 34% for mezerein. The induction of poly-ADP-ribose synthesis by PMA and BP appears to be mediated at least in part by active  species, as they induced an increase in superoxide anions and anti-oxidants prevented the increase of poly-ADPRT activity to varying extents.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563847>A mitochondrially targeted compound delays aging in yeast through a mechanism linking mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism to mitochondrial redox biology.</a></h2><p>A recent study revealed a mechanism of delaying aging in yeast by a natural compound which specifically impacts mitochondrial redox processes.

These proteins belong to 2\xa0regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3\xa0different patterns of the age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for many longevity-defining nuclear genes.

In this study, we have examined the effect of diets containing dried plums on the number of colonic precancerous lesions (aberrant crypts, ACs), fecal bile  concentration, and cecal bacterial enzyme activities related to colon cancer risk.

All animals were then administered azoxymethane (15 mg/kg, s.c., given two times, 1 wk apart) and fed their respective diets for 9 additional weeks. The number of AC foci (ACF), large ACF (>3 AC/ACF), or ACF multiplicity (AC/ACF) did not differ among the four groups.

The LCDP and HCDP diets significantly decreased the cecal activity of 7alpha-dehydroxylase, and the LCDP also had lower beta-glucuronidase activity. The LCDP, HCDP, and CH-M groups had significantly greater cecal nitroreductase activities than the basal group. There was a significant correlation between 7alpha-dehydroxylase activity and fecal  concentration.

Inhibition of the antioxidant reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinine oxidoreductase by 2,4-dimethoxy-2-methylnaphthalene potentiated the increases in [ROS]I and apoptosis but reduced necrosis, whereas the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine reduced [ROS]I and apoptosis but increased necrosis. Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS production prevented apoptosis but did not alter necrosis; autophagy had no detectable role.

In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by  (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2358447>Side chain conjugation prevents bacterial 7-dehydroxylation of bile acids.</a></h2><p>The effect of side chain conjugation on 7-dehydroxylation of bile acids has been investigated. C24-bile acids and their glycine and taurine conjugates and keto bile acids were incubated with pure strains of Eubacterium sp. VPI 12708. Bile acids of the 5 alpha- or 5 beta-series with a free terminal carboxyl group and a 3 alpha, 7 alpha-dihydroxy system were very effectively 7 alpha-dehydroxylated, whereas 7 beta-hydroxy bile acids resisted 7-dehydroxylation. Oxo bile acids were metabolized at the  function also. Glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids were neither deamidated nor 7-dehydroxylated by the bacteria.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells.\xa0CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10\xa0kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10]\xa0+\xa0IL-1[10]\xa0+\xa0IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA\xa0±\xa0PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA\xa0±\xa0CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC\xa0±\xa0CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+\xa0IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA\'s leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

TLCS induced a rapid serine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). Inhibitors of p47phox phosphorylation and p47phox protein knockdown abolished the TLCS-induced oxidative stress response and blunted subsequent CD95 activation. Consequences of TLCS-induced oxidative stress were c-Jun-N-terminal kinase activation and Yes-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), followed by EGFR-catalyzed CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and execution of apoptosis. As shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in Huh7 cells, TLCS induced a c-Jun-N-terminal kinase-dependent EGFR/CD95 association in the cytosol and trafficking of this protein complex to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 allowed for cytosolic EGFR/CD95 association, but prevented targeting of the EGFR/CD95 complex to the plasma membrane. Both processes, and TLCS-induced Yes and EGFR activation, were sensitive to inhibition of sphingomyelinase, PKCzeta, or NADPH oxidases.The data suggest that hydrophobic bile salts activate NADPH oxidase isoforms with the resulting oxidative stress response triggering activation of the CD95 system and apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7175373>Hepatic bile  uptake: effect of conjugation, hydroxyl and keto groups, and albumin binding.</a></h2><p>Hepatic extraction of trihydroxy (free, glyco- and tauro-conjugated) dihydroxy, and monohydroxy bile acids has been evaluated in single pass liver perfusion experiments in rats. The percentage of each bile  bound to albumin was also evaluated by equilibrium dialysis. Conjugation increased bile  liver extraction, without relevant differences in the percentage of bile  bound to albumin. Among the free bile acids, trihydroxy bile acids were more efficiently cleared by the liver than the dihydroxy acids, and the latter more than monohydroxy bile acids. 7-Ketolithocholic  uptake was slightly less than that of cholic . Conversely, among dihydroxy bile acids, the percentage of the bile  bound to albumin decreased from  to cholic . Decreasing the albumin concentration in the medium, and hence the fraction of the bile  bound to albumin, resulted in an increase in bile  liver extraction. Therefore besides differences in the chemical structure of bile acids, the extent of bile -albumin binding may be a determinant in bile  liver uptake.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032975>Microbiome and Metabolome Profiles Associated With Different Types of Short Bowel Syndrome: Implications for Treatment.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome and metabolome may significantly influence clinical outcomes in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS).

SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort.

Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern. In this review, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in yeast chronological aging.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27896021> induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in human prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p> (LCA) is a secondary bile  that is selectively toxic to human neuroblastoma, breast and prostate cancer cells, whilst sparing normal cells. We previously reported that LCA inhibited cell viability and proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis of androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the toxicity of LCA in PC-3 and autophagy deficient, androgen-independent DU-145 cells. LCA induced ER stress-related proteins, such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (p-eIF2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK) in both cancer cell-types. The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and B cell lymphoma-like protein 11 (BIM) levels were decreased at overtly toxic LCA concentrations, although PUMA levels increased at lower LCA concentrations in both cell lines. LCA induced autophagy-related conversion of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3BI-LC3BII), and autophagy-related protein ATG5 in PC-3 cells, but not in autophagy-deficient DU-145 cells. LCA (>10 µM) increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration-dependently in PC-3 cells, whereas ROS levels were not affected in DU-145 cells. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2 dephosphorylation and ER stress, reduced LCA-induced CHOP levels slightly in PC-3, but not DU-145 cells. Salubrinal pre-treatment increased the cytotoxicity of LCA in PC-3 and DU-145 cells and resulted in a statistically significant loss of cell viability at normally non-toxic concentrations of LCA. The late-stage autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 exacerbated LCA toxicity at subtoxic LCA concentrations in PC-3 cells. The antioxidant -tocotrienol strongly inhibited the toxicity of LCA in PC-3 cells, but not in DU-145 cells. Collectively, although LCA induces autophagy and ER stress in PC-3 cells, these processes appear to be initially of protective nature and subsequently consequential to, but not critical for the ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity of LCA. The full mechanism of LCA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity in the similarly sensitive DU-145 cells remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2315560>Hepatic passage of bile acids increases  uptake by perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>It has been claimed that the hepatic passage of conjugated bile acids does not increase  uptake by the isolated perfused rat liver.

Here, we synthesized the AuNPs capped with ligands that possess polyethylene glycol (PEG) and  (LCA) linked by carboxyl groups (AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA). Our cytotoxicity results indicated that AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA have better cell selectivity; in other words, it could inhibit the growth of multiple liver cancer cells more effectively than other cancer cells and normal cells. Apoptosis plays a role in AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA inhibition cell proliferation, which was convincingly proved by some apoptotic index experiments, such as nuclear staining, annexin V-FITC, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis, and AO/EB staining experiments. The most potent AuNP@MPA-PEG-LCA were confirmed to efficiently induce apoptosis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediating mitochondrial dysfunction.

Ultrastructural morphometric studies were performed in polarized rat bile ductule fragments exposed in vitro to increasing concentrations (10-100 micromol/L) of lithocholate (LCA), deoxycholate (DCA), chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), cholate (CA), ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), their taurine-conjugates, and glycoconjugates of cholic (GCA) or chenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) for 20, 30, or 75 minutes. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of unconjugated hydrophobic bile salts against biliary epithelium (BDE) in the whole liver, livers were isolated from rats with impaired taurine-conjugation capacity (beta-alanine treatment) and perfused for 70 minutes with 2 micromol/min LCA (n = 6), CDCA (n = 6), CA (n = 6), or 0.5 micromol/min tauro-LCA (n = 4). In isolated bile ductule fragments, hydrophobic unconjugated bile salts (LCA, CDCA, DCA) induced a marked damage of intracellular organelles, mainly mitochondria. The damage started at a concentration of 10 micromol/L and became prominent at concentrations higher than 50 micromol/L. No damage of the apical and basolateral membrane was seen and tight junctions appeared intact. UDCA, taurine and glycoconjugated bile salts failed to induce any evident ultrastructural alteration. In taurine-depleted isolated livers, perfused with LCA, CDCA, or CA, bile duct epithelial cells showed no evidence of intracellular damage, despite the increased biliary excretion of unconjugated BS. Marked alterations of the apical cell membrane were seen only in livers perfused with LCA and in isolated segments of the biliary epithelium. In contrast with biliary epithelium, hepatocytes showed prominent subcellular damage with CA and CDCA, and profound alterations of the canalicular membrane with LCA and tauro-LCA. We have shown that, in vitro, BDE cells are not damaged by taurine- or glycine-conjugated BS, but they are very sensitive to cytotoxicity of hydrophobic unconjugated BS. Such sensitivity is not present in the whole liver, probably because of the specificity of BS transport processes, the microvascular architecture of the bile ductal system, and the presence in bile of a physiological surfactant, such as phospholipids.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878403>Effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone in murine acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Although oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP), antioxidant therapy in patients has so far been discouraging. The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10\u2009µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels. Our results suggest that MitoQ would be inappropriate for AP therapy, consistent with prior antioxidant evaluations in this disease.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924582>Mitochondrial membrane lipidome defines yeast longevity.</a></h2><p>Our studies revealed that  (LCA), a bile , is a potent anti-aging natural compound that in yeast cultured under longevity-extending caloric restriction (CR) conditions acts in synergy with CR to enable a significant further increase in chronological lifespan. Here, we investigate a mechanism underlying this robust longevity-extending effect of LCA under CR. We found that exogenously added LCA enters yeast cells, is sorted to mitochondria, resides mainly in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and also associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane. LCA elicits an age-related remodeling of glycerophospholipid synthesis and movement within both mitochondrial membranes, thereby causing substantial changes in mitochondrial membrane lipidome and triggering major changes in mitochondrial size, number and morphology. In synergy, these changes in the membrane lipidome and morphology of mitochondria alter the age-related chronology of mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, ATP synthesis and reactive  species homeostasis. The LCA-driven alterations in the age-related dynamics of these vital mitochondrial processes extend yeast longevity. In sum, our findings suggest a mechanism underlying the ability of LCA to delay chronological aging in yeast by accumulating in both mitochondrial membranes and altering their glycerophospholipid compositions. We concluded that mitochondrial membrane lipidome plays an essential role in defining yeast longevity.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057690>Hepatoprotective effect of vitamin C on -induced cholestatic liver injury in Gulo(-/-) mice.</a></h2><p>Prevention and restoration of hepatic fibrosis from chronic liver injury is essential for the treatment of patients with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin C is known to have hepatoprotective effects, but their underlying mechanisms are unclear, especially those associated with hepatic fibrosis. Here, we analyzed the impact of vitamin C on bile  induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and  (LCA)-induced liver injury in vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice, which cannot synthesize vitamin C similarly to humans. When Huh-BAT cells were treated with bile , apoptosis was induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress-related JNK activation but vitamin C attenuated bile -induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro. In our in vivo experiments, LCA feeding increased plasma marker of cholestasis and resulted in more extensive liver damage and hepatic fibrosis by more prominent apoptotic cell death and recruiting more intrahepatic inflammatory CD11b(+) cells in the liver of vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice compared to wild type mice which have minimal hepatic fibrosis. However, when vitamin C was supplemented to vitamin C-insufficient Gulo(-/-) mice, hepatic fibrosis was significantly attenuated in the liver of vitamin C-sufficient Gulo(-/-) mice like in wild type mice and this hepatoprotective effect of vitamin C was thought to be associated with both decreased hepatic apoptosis and necrosis.

Understanding the mechanisms of bile  toxicity and apoptosis, which could include nonspecific detergent effects and/or specific receptor activation, has potential therapeutic significance. In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of  (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic  (ent-CDCA), and deoxycholic  (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile -induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive  species compared with ent-LCA. This suggests that LCA/ent-LCA induce apoptosis enantioselectively through CD95 activation, likely because of increased reactive  species generation, with resulting procaspase-8 cleavage.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187369>Synthesis of nitrogen- and -containing macrocycles--derivatives of .</a></h2><p>Palladium-catalyzed amination of 3,24-bis(3-bromophenoxy)cholane (4) with various polyamines and polyoxadiamines 5 taken in 1:1 ratio was used for the synthesis of the macrocycles 6, which contain steroidal and polyamine moieties and were obtained in 38-65 % yields.

In addition, bile acids also actively participate in regulation of gene expression through their ability to act as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor or by activating kinase signaling pathways. Under cholestatic conditions, elevated levels of bile acids in the liver induce hepatic inflammation, and because bile  levels are also elevated in the circulation, they might also induce vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic endothelial cells were treated with bile acids, and the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were monitored. The three major bile acids found in the circulation, chenodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , and , all strongly induced both the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.

Thauera spp. were obtained on the -containing monoterpenes linalool, menthol, and eucalyptol. Several strains of Alcaligenes defragrans were isolated on unsaturated monoterpenes as growth substrates. A novel denitrifying beta-Proteobacterium, strain 72Chol, mineralizes cholesterol completely to carbon dioxide.

Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to TNF-α/Actinomycin D, the ROS-generating agent menadione or the bile salts: glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) and tauro--3 sulfate (TLCS), to induce apoptosis. AT-II (100 nmol/L) was added 10 minutes prior to the cell death-inducing agent. AT-1R antagonists (Sartans) and the AT-2R antagonist PD123319 were used at 1 µmol/L. Apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, acridine orange staining) and necrosis (Sytox green staining) were quantified. Expression of CHOP (marker for ER stress) and AT-II receptor mRNAs were quantified by Q-PCR. AT-II dose-dependently reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05) without inducing necrosis. In addition, AT-II reduced TLCS-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05). However, AT-II did not suppress TNF/Act-D and menadione-induced apoptosis. Only the AT-1R antagonists abolished the protective effect of AT-II against GCDCA-induced apoptosis. AT-II increased phosphorylation of ERK and a significant reversal of the protective effect of AT-II was observed when signaling kinases, including ERK, were inhibited. Moreover, AT-II prevented the GCDCA-induced expression of CHOP (the marker of the ER-mediated apoptosis).Angiotensin II protects hepatocytes from bile salt-induced apoptosis through a combined activation of PI3-kinase, MAPKs, PKC pathways and inhibition of bile salt-induced ER stress. Our results suggest a mechanism for the observed hepatocyte-toxicity of Sartans (angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs) in some patients with chronic liver injury.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512997>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dysregulation of cardiac energetics in a mouse model of biliary fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cardiac dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease; yet the mechanisms remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that the complex interrelated impairments in cardiac structure and function secondary to progression of liver diseases involve alterations in signaling pathways engaged in cardiac energy metabolism and hypertrophy, augmented by direct effects of high circulating levels of bile acids. Biliary fibrosis was induced in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydroxychollidine (DDC) supplemented diet. After 3 weeks, mice underwent live imaging (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scanning, two-dimensional echocardiography [2DE], electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), exercise treadmill testing, and histological and biochemical analyses of livers and hearts. Compared with chow-fed mice, DDC-fed mice fatigued earlier on the treadmill, with reduced VO(2). Marked changes were identified electrophysiologically (bradycardia and prolonged QT interval) and functionally (hyperdynamic left ventricular [LV] contractility along with increased LV thickness). Hearts of DDC-fed mice showed hypertrophic signaling (activation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene/protein kinase B [AKT], inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK3beta], a 20-fold up-regulation of beta myosin heavy chain RNA and elevated G(s)alpha/G(i)alpha ratio. Genes regulating cardiac fatty  oxidation pathways were suppressed, along with a threefold increase in myocardial glycogen content. Treatment of mouse cardiomyocytes (which express the membrane bile  receptor TGR5) with potent natural TGR5 agonists, taurochenodeoxycholic  and , activated AKT and inhibited GSK3beta, similar to the changes seen in DDC-fed mouse hearts. This provides support for a novel mechanism whereby circulating natural bile acids can induce signaling pathways in heart associated with hypertrophy.Three weeks of DDC feeding-induced biliary fibrosis leads to multiple functional, metabolic, electrophysiological, and hypertrophic adaptations in the mouse heart, recapitulating some of the features of human cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3985610>Optimum conditions for ursodeoxycholic  production from  by Fusarium equiseti M41.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  dissolves cholesterol gallstones in humans.

At a concentration of 30 mumol/L, both chenodeoxycholate and lithocholate reduced state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. In contrast, ADP/O ratios of these substrates and oxidative metabolism of ascorbate were not significantly affected. Ursodeoxycholate did not impair mitochondrial oxidative metabolism up to concentrations of 100 mumol/L; at 300 mumol/L, however, it decreased state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. Tauroursodeoxycholate had no significant inhibitory effect on state 3 oxidation rates of L-glutamate and succinate at concentrations up to 300 mumol/L. When ursodeoxycholate (final concentration, 30 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) was added to mitochondrial incubations containing chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, the toxic effects of lipophilic bile acids on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were partially reversed. However, 300 mumol/L ursodeoxycholate, in combination with chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, exhibited greater toxicity compared with incubations containing only the individual bile acids. In contrast to ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate did not reduce the toxic effects of chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate on mitochondrial metabolism. Ursodeoxycholate (100 mumol/L) significantly decreased the incorporation of chenodeoxycholate into mitochondrial membranes, whereas the decrease in lithocholate incorporation was not statistically significant.

At relatively low redox potential (Eh) values, high yields of urso bile acids were achieved (60-75%). If, however, the Eh value of the culture was allowed to rise above approximately -100 mv, the 7-oxo bile  would tend to predominate (more than 75%) and the "death phase" was accelerated. Growth of C. absonum in sterile graduated cylinders instead of in conventional Erlenmeyer flasks was effective in delaying the rise in Eh value with time (which appears largely due to diffusion of atmospheric  into the medium) and in preserving a higher viable count of organisms. It is proposed that the formation of excess amounts of 7-oxo bile  is a manifestation of  toxicity and that it could be mediated by an increasing intracellular NADP:NADPH ratio. Additionally, the reaction: primary bile  in equilibrium oxo bile  in equilibrium urso bile  was shown to be partially reversible. When the organisms were grown with [24-(14)C]chenodeoxycholic, -cholic, or -7-keto-, this reaction could be clearly demonstrated. The addition of an equimolar concentration of deoxycholic  (which itself is not metabolized) effectively enhanced the rate of bioconversion of cholate and 7-keto-, but not chenodeoxycholate (whose rate of bioconversion was the fastest of the three). When the organisms were grown with urso bile acids (ursocholic or ursodeoxycholic) or with 7-keto-deoxycholic , very little metabolism occurred unless deoxycholic  was added which induced formation of primary and keto bile acids. In all cases, formation of oxo bile  from primary or urso bile  occurred as the Eh value of the medium rose with time and could thus be delayed by the use of a cylinder instead of a flask for growing the culture. These results were rationalized by demonstrating that induction of 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is strongly mediated by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids, weakly mediated by cholic and 7-keto- acids, and ineffective with 7-keto-deoxycholic, ursocholic, and ursodeoxycholic acids.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909664>Design, synthesis, and mechanistic investigations of bile -tamoxifen conjugates for breast cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>We have synthesized two series of bile  tamoxifen conjugates using three bile acids  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and cholic  (CA). These bile -tamoxifen conjugates possess 1, 2, and 3 tamoxifen molecules attached to hydroxyl groups of bile acids having free  and amine functionalities at the tail region of bile acids. The in vitro anticancer activities of these bile -tamoxifen conjugates show that the free amine headgroup based cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) is the most potent anticancer conjugate as compared to the parent drug tamoxifen and other  and amine headgroup based bile -tamoxifen conjugates. The cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) bearing three tamoxifen molecules shows enhanced anticancer activities in both estrogen receptor +ve and estrogen receptor -ve breast cancer cell lines. The enhanced anticancer activity of CA-Tam3-Am is due to more favorable irreversible electrostatic interactions followed by intercalation of these conjugates in hydrophobic core of membrane lipids causing increase in membrane fluidity. Annexin-FITC based FACS analysis showed that cells undergo apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis showed the arrest of cells in sub G0 phase. ROS assays showed a high amount of generation of ROS independent of ER status of the cell line indicating changes in mitochondrial membrane fluidity upon the uptake of the conjugate that further leads to the release of cytochrome c, a direct and indirect regulator of ROS. The mechanistic studies for apoptosis using PCR and western analysis showed apoptotsis by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in ER +ve MCF-7 cells and by only an intrinsic pathway in ER -ve cells. In vivo studies in the 4T1 tumor model showed that CA-Tam3-Am is more potent than tamoxifen.

Patients treated with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, had markedly elevated urinary excretion of 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic  compared to healthy controls. The importance of CYP3A4 in this process was verified by incubations with recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes, both of which efficiently converted deoxycholic  into 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic .

In particular, cholestasis is difficult to diagnose by conventional markers at an early stage of disease. The aim of this study was to identify promising biomarkers for distinguishing the symptom-based types of liver injury (e.g. hepatocellular injury, cholestasis), which was derived from a rigorously statistical perspective. The associations between diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. bile  components, oxidative stress markers and liver fibrosis markers) and the liver injury types were assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis using 304 blood samples from patients with liver disease. As a result, reductions in the  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) levels, and elevation of the serum sulfated bile  (SSBA), liver fibrosis marker IV collagen (type IV collagen), hyaluronic  (HA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all significantly associated with cholestasis. On the other hand, elevations in the LCA and type IV collagen levels, and a reduction in the ursodeoxy cholic  (UDCA) level, were significantly associated with hepatocellular injury. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for ROS, followed by DCA, HA, LCA, SSBA and type IV collagen in the cholestatic-type cases. These results indicated that ROS, the secondary bile  levels such as DCA and LCA, and SSBA are promising biomarkers for cholestasis and for classifying the type of liver injuries.

This strain combination was then administered to hypercholesterolaemic pigs over a 3-week period, as two daily preprandial doses of either viable (six experimental pigs) or heat-inactivated bacteria (six controls). The main effects of treatment were on unconjugated bile acids (P=0.035) and UDCA (P<0.0001) absorbed into the portal vein, which increased 1.6-1.7- and 3.5-7.5-fold, respectively, under administration of living compared with inactivated bacteria.

TNF+\xa0IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100\u202fng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue  and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content  were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue . The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue . Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits obesity in mice.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072966>Functional role of MicroRNA-19b in acinar cell necrosis in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and its functional role in acinar cell necrosis of SD rats were investigated. Twelve SD rats were divided into two groups randomly, including control group and ANP group. The rat ANP models were established by intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine (2400 mg/kg ), and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl was injected in the control group. MiRNA chip assay was performed to examine the expression of miRNAs in the pancreas in two different groups. Besides, to further explore the role of miR-19b in ANP in vitro, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate disodium salt (TLC-S) (200 μmol/L) was administrated to treat the rat pancreatic acinar cell line, AR42J, for establishing the ANP cells model. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was adopted to measure the miR-19b expression. Moreover, the mimic miRNA, miRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO) and control vector were used to transfect AR42J cells, the expression of miR-19b was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the necrotizing rate of AR42J cells was detected with AO/EB method. The expression of miR-19b was significantly higher in ANP group than in control group as displayed by the miRNA chip assay. Furthermore, after inducing necrosis of AR42J cells in vitro, the expression of miR-19b was significantly increased by 2.51±0.14 times in comparison with the control group. As revealed by qRT-PCR assay, the expression of miR-19b was 5.94±0.95 times higher in the mimic miRNA group than in the control vector group, companied with an obviously increased acinar cell necrotizing rate (50.3%±1.5% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Moreover, the expression of miR-19b in the miRNA AMO group was 0.38±0.15 times lower than in the control vector group, and the cell necrosis rate was much lower accordingly (23.1%±3.3% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference between the control vector cells and the cells without treatment (P>0.05). The expression of miR-19b was significantly induced in ANP. In addition, up-regulation of miR-19b could promote the necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells and miR-19b deficiency could decrease the rate of pancreatic acinar cell necrosis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069691>Serum Bile  Levels Before and After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Their Correlation with Obesity-Related Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>The rising prevalence of morbid obesity is increasing the demand for bariatric surgery. The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced  loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the metabolic improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to metabolic and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45\u2009±\u200912\xa0years, mean BMI 45\u2009±\u20097\xa0kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12\xa0months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose metabolism and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration. In conclusion, an interplay between glucose metabolism and circulating BA exists but further studies are needed.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560290>Farnesoid X Receptor Agonist Treatment Alters Bile   but\xa0Exacerbates Liver Damage in a Piglet Model of Short-Bowel\xa0Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Options for the prevention of short-bowel syndrome-associated liver disease (SBS-ALDs) are limited and often ineffective. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a newly emerging pharmaceutical target and FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate cholestasis and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool  and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced  malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

(LCA), one of the four main bile acids in the human , possesses a high albumin binding rate. We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, , blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice. Our studies revealed 5b as a promising antidiabetic candidate. Furthermore, our study suggests the derivatization of Xenopus GLP-1 analogs with LCA represents an effective strategy to develop potent long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324765>Systematic Modulation of the Supramolecular Gelation Properties of Bile  Alkyl Amides.</a></h2><p>The self-assembly properties of nine low-molecular- gelators (LMWGs) based on bile  alkyl amides were studied in detail. Based on the results, the number of hydroxyl groups attached to the steroidal backbone plays a major role in the gelation, although the nature of the aliphatic side chain also modulates the gelation abilities. Of the 50 gel systems studied, 35 are based on  and 15 on cholic  derivatives. The deoxycholic  derivatives did not form any gels. The gelation occurred primarily in aromatic solvents and the gels manifested typical fibrous or spherical morphologies. The  C cross-polarized magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectra measured on the crystalline materials and the corresponding wet organogels were analogous, suggesting that the chemical environments, that is, the intermolecular interactions found in the two materials were similar. The single-crystal X-ray structures of all nine bile- amide derivatives studied revealed very similar molecular conformations in the solid state and gave insights into the possible intermolecular interactions in the gel state.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, low molecular weight linear polyethyleneimine (2.5\u2009kDa) was modified by conjugation to a , , and complexed with a natural polysaccharide, dermatan sulfate (DS), to mask extra cationic charges of the modified polymer. In vitro examination revealed that these modifications improved complex stability with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transfection efficiency. This novel ternary polyplex (pDNA/3E/DS) was used to investigate if tumor-targeted radiotherapy led to enhanced accumulation and retention of gene therapy vectors in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Imaging of biodistribution revealed that tumor irradiation led to increased accumulation and retention as well as decreased off-target tissue buildup of pDNA in not only pDNA/3E/DS, but also in associated PEI-based polyplexes and commercial DNA delivery vehicles. The DS-containing complexes developed in this study displayed the greatest increase in tumor-specific pDNA delivery. These findings demonstrate a step forward in nucleic  vehicle design as well as a promising approach to overall cancer gene therapy through utilization of radiotherapy as a tool for enhanced delivery.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26273290>First serine protease inhibitor isolated from Rhinella schneideri poison.</a></h2><p>Toad secretions are a source of molecules with potential biotechnological application on a wide spectrum of diseases. Toads from the Rhinella family have two kinds of poisonous glands, namely granular and mucous glands. Rhinella schneideri toads produce granular secretions that comprise a great number of molecules, including serine proteases inhibitors. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, are enzymes that have a serine amino  into its catalytic site and can be found in a large number of vertebrate species and pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, the present work aims to purify a serine protease inhibitor from Rhinella schneideri granular secretions.This study presents the protocol used to purify a serine protease inhibitor from the Rhinella schneideri poison. The granular secretion was submitted to dialysis in order to separate the low molecular  compounds, which were submitted to a reversed phase-fast protein liquid chromatography fractionation step in a C2C18 column. The major fractions were tested over trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase through colorimetric assay. The inhibition tests were performed with the enzyme in absence (positive control) and presence of fractions, denatured enzyme (negative control) and the respective chromogenic substrate. Rs20 was the compound with the major inhibitory activity over chymotrypsin, inducing a delay in the formation of the chromogenic enzymatic product. The structure characterization of Rs20 was performed by high resolution electronspray ionization-mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HRESI showed an intense signal suggesting the presence of bufadienolide with less than 10\xa0ppm error. In addition, it was observed a low intense signal at m/z 399 that could be , a biosynthetic precursor of bufadienolide. Finally, GC-MS analysis applying NIST library identification reinforced this hypothesis.The current study have isolated and partially characterized the function and structure of the first bufadienolide with inhibitory action over chymotrypsin.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872803>Barley β-glucan increases fecal bile  excretion and short chain fatty  levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals.</a></h2><p>The cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan has been proposed to be the result of a pleiotropic effect, which involves several biological mechanisms such as gut fermentation, inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased bile  excretion and its synthesis. However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular  (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular  promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544648>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the anthropogenic marker isolithocholic  in water.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are promising chemical markers to assess the pollution of water samples with fecal material. This study describes the optimization and validation of a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the bile  isolithocholic  (ILA). The quantification range of the optimized assay was between 0.09 and 15\xa0μg/L. The assay was applied to environmental water samples. Most studies until now were focused on bile  fractions in the particulate phase of water samples. In order to avoid tedious sample preparation, we undertook to evaluate the dynamics and significance of ILA levels in the aqueous phase. Very low concentrations in tap and surface water samples made a pre-concentration step necessary for this matrix as well as for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Mean recoveries for spiked water samples were between 97% and 109% for tap water and WWTP influent samples and between 102% and 136% for WWTP effluent samples. 90th percentiles of intra-plate and inter-plate coefficients of variation were below 10% for influents and below 20% for effluents and surface water. ILA concentrations were quantified in the range of 33-72\xa0μg/L in influent, 21-49\xa0ng/L in effluent and 18-48\xa0ng/L in surface water samples. During wastewater treatment the ILA levels were reduced by more than 99%. ILA concentrations of influents determined by ELISA and LC-MS/MS were in good agreement. However, findings in LC-ELISA experiments suggest that the true ILA levels in concentrated samples are lower due to interfering effects of matrix compounds and/or cross-reactants. Yet, the ELISA will be a valuable tool for the performance check and comparison of WWTPs and the localization of fecal matter input into surface waters.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of , we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high--diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its -lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083862>Tethering of Chemotherapeutic Drug/Imaging Agent to Bile -Phospholipid Increases the Efficacy and Bioavailability with Reduced Hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Weakly basic drugs display poor solubility and tend to precipitate in the stomach's acidic environment causing reduced oral bioavailability.

The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels.

We found that i.c.v. administration of tLCA (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 1\u2005μM) increased  oxidation (tLCA group: 0.083\u2005±\u20050.006 vs control group: 0.036\u2005±\u20050.023\u2005kcal/h, \u2005=\u20055.46, \u2005=\u20050.04) and decreased  mass (after 9 days of tLCA infusion: 1.35\u2005±\u20050.13 vs controls: 1.96\u2005±\u20050.23\u2005g, \u2005=\u20050.03). These changes were associated with enhanced uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids by brown adipose tissue and with browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. I.c.v. administration of GW4064 (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 10\u2005μM) did not affect energy , body composition nor bile  levels, negating a role of FXR in the central nervous system in metabolic control. In conclusion, bile acids such as tLCA may exert metabolic effects on  via the brain.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27203081>Bile Acids and Dysbiosis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by dysbiosis. The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for  mass index and -adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively). C. leptum was positively correlated with fecal unconjugated  (LCA) (r = 0.526, p = 0.003) and inversely with unconjugated CA (r = -0.669, p<0.0001) and unconjugated CDCA (r = - 0.630, p<0.0001). FGF19 levels were not different between the groups (p = 0.114).In adults with NAFLD, dysbiosis is associated with altered BA homeostasis, which renders them at increased risk of hepatic injury.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30740753>Bile and fat excretion are biomarkers of clinically significant diarrhoea and constipation in irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Biomarkers in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may guide targeted therapy in this multifactorial disease. It has been suggested that 75% accuracy and cost <$500 categorise biomarkers as cost-effective.To identify differences in faecal bile acids, faecal fat and fasting serum C4 (7a-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) among patients with IBS-D, IBS-C and healthy controls and to determine accurate, cost-effective biomarkers for clinically relevant diarrhoea and constipation.We assessed daily stool frequency and consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale) from validated bowel diaries, 48\xa0hours total and individual faecal bile acids, 48\xa0hours faecal fat and , fasting serum C4 and FGF19, and colonic transit by scintigraphy from healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with IBS-D and IBS-C (Rome III criteria). We utilised multivariate logistic regression to determine biomarkers of clinically significant diarrhoea or constipation based on stool frequency, consistency and .Among the 126 HV (44M/82F, 37.5\xa0±\xa010.9\xa0years [SD]), 64 IBS-D (5M/59F, 41.9\xa0±\xa012.2\xa0years), and 30 IBS-C (0M/30F, 44.6\xa0±\xa010\xa0years) patients, there were significant differences between all groups in stool , frequency, and consistency; in addition, there were differences in colonic transit at 48\xa0hours, faecal fat, and total and individual faecal bile acids between IBS-D and IBS-C. Reduced total and primary faecal bile acids and increased faecal  were significant predictors of decreased faecal , frequency and consistency with AUC\xa0>\xa00.82 (sensitivity >76%, specificity >72%). Total and primary faecal bile acids and faecal fat were significant predictors of increased stool , frequency and consistency with AUC\xa0>\xa00.71 (sensitivity >55%, specificity >74%).The faecal parameters had a 11.5 positive likelihood ratio in predicting elevated faecal .Faecal bile acids and faecal fat are cost-effective and accurate biomarkers associated with significant bowel dysfunction among IBS-D and IBS-C patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p></html>"></html>
