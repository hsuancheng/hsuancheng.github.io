The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147381>Donor  characteristics drive effects of faecal microbiota transplantation on recipient insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and intestinal transit time.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism. Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

(LCA), one of the four main bile acids in the human body, possesses a high albumin binding rate. We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, body weight, blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice. Our studies revealed 5b as a promising antidiabetic candidate. Furthermore, our study suggests the derivatization of Xenopus GLP-1 analogs with LCA represents an effective strategy to develop potent long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 .</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6743671>Abnormal bile  pool and composition in neonates of spontaneously diabetic Wistar BB rats and its change during development.</a></h2><p>Streptozotocin-induced  during pregnancy in rats causes a decrease in primary bile  pool in neonates.

Correlations between changes in plasma BA concentrations, insulin secretion defects, and progression of type 2  (T2DM) in humans have not been sufficiently investigated. This study explored the trajectories of changes in human plasma BA concentrations and their association with insulin secretion dynamics during a two-step hyperglycemic clamp.Eleven healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 33 drug-naïve T2DM subjects were enrolled in the study. The two-step hyperglycemic clamp consisted of a classic clamp as Step 1 with fasting, followed by a Step 2 clamp after ingestion of a carbohydrate meal, illustrating basal and incretin-amplified insulin responses to glucose. Plasma BA were assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Nine T2DM subjects were followed-up, and the two-step clamp was repeated after 3 months sulfonylurea treatment.Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was lower and  (LCA) and taurocholic  (TCA) were higher in T2DM compared with NGT subjects. The dynamics of plasma UDCA concentrations and the UDCA/LCA ratio was positively correlated with insulin secretion in T2DM subjects and were corrected after treatment. Moreover, fasting ratios of UDCA/LCA and unconjugated/conjugated BAs were correlated with the first phase of insulin secretion in T2DM subjects.The abnormal BA composition in T2DM subjects and its correlation with insulin secretion during the clamp suggest an interaction between BA signals and insulin secretion capacity, and the potential to use fasting plasma BA composition indices to predict and evaluate the progression and prognosis of T2DM.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7283991>Effect of maternal  on fetal bile  metabolism in the rat.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435224>Investigation of triamterene as an inhibitor of the TGR5 receptor: identification in cells and animals.</a></h2><p>G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) has been shown to participate in glucose homeostasis. In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5. Therefore, triamterene can be developed as a clinical inhibitor of TGR5 activation in future studies.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16362452>Biochemical and physiological properties of a novel series of long-acting insulin analogs obtained by acylation with cholic  derivatives.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to assess the suitability of insulin analogs acylated by various cholic  derivatives for use as basal insulin, and to test the most promising of these, LysB29(Nepsilon-lithocholyl-gamma-Glu) des(B30) human insulin (NN344) in pigs.Circular dichroism spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography were used to explore the physicochemical properties of the analogs, and affinities for albumin and insulin receptors were determined. After subcutaneous injection in pigs, disappearance half-times were measured, and the plasma profile and glucose-lowering effect in a euglycemic clamp were assessed for NN344.NN344 showed glucose-lowering activity lasting more than 24 h. Glucose infusion rate was essentially constant from 5 to 19 h after injection. NN344 seemed to be a dodecamer in the presence of zinc ions and phenol. Without phenol, the apparent molecular mass was >5000 kDa. Formation of such a self-assembly at the site of s.c. injection and its subsequent slow decomposition might explain the long duration of action of NN344.

In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by  (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23067554>Synthesis and biological evaluation of 4,4-dimethyl  derivatives as novel inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.</a></h2><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a major negative regulator of both insulin and leptin signals.

Here we characterized the effects of these agents on ATP levels in the cytosol and mitochondria.ATP levels were monitored using cytosolic- or mitochondrial-targeted luciferases.Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation produced a substantial decrease in cytosolic ATP comparable to that induced by inhibition of glycolysis. Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) increased cytosolic ATP in spite of accelerating ATP consumption. Acetylcholine, caerulein, and bombesin had similar effect. A bile , taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S); a fatty , palmitoleic  (POA); and palmitoleic  ethyl ester (POAEE) reduced cytosolic ATP. The ATP decrease in response to these substances was observed in cells with intact or inhibited oxidative phosphorylation. TLC-S, POA, and POAEE reduced mitochondrial ATP, whereas physiological CCK increased mitochondrial ATP. Supramaximal CCK produced a biphasic response composed of a small initial decline followed by a stronger increase.Both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation make substantial contributions to ATP production in acinar cells. Ca(2+)-releasing secretagogues increased ATP level in the cytosol and mitochondria of intact isolated cells. TLC-S, POA, and POAEE reduced cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids. References given in this overview section are limited to general publications on bile  metabolism and use as therapeutic agents. Drug Class: Gastrointestinal Agents: Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic ).

In the present study, we explored the potentials of  (LCA)-modified exendin-4 derivatives as novel long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. Exendin-4 was modified with  at two lysine residues to produce three derivatives that were obtained by reverse-phase HPLC separation, namely, Lys(12)-LCA-exendin-4 (LCA-M2), Lys(27)-LCA-exendin-4 (LCA-M1), and Lys(12,27)-LCA-exendin-4 (LCA-Di)). The biological, pharmacological, and physicochemical characteristics of these three exendin-4 analogues were then investigated. Although slight reductions in the GLP-1 receptor binding capacity and insulinotropic activity of exendin-4 were observed after derivatization, the mono-LCA substitutions, especially LCA-M1, well-preserved antidiabetic activity in type 2 diabetic mice when administered subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic characteristics were dramatically enhanced, that is, absorption was delayed and elimination half-life was increased (1.6+/-0.4 and 9.7+/-1.4h by exendin-4 and LCA-M1, respectively). The enhanced long-acting characteristics of the derivative was found to be due to albumin binding and nanoparticle formation, and these were verified by the restoration of normoglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice after single injection (>24h, >10 nmol/kg, s.c.) and daily injections (15 nmol/kg/day) maintained normoglycemia for the 4-week administration period. Furthermore, antidiabetic potentials, such as, glucose clearance kinetics and percentage areas occupied by pancreatic beta-cells were also enhanced by long-term LCA-M1 administration. The present study demonstrates that the derivatization of exendin-4 with LCA offers a possible means of producing a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TGR5 is shown to express in hearts, but its functional role in diabetes-induced cardiac hypertrophy remained unclear. The current study investigated the role of TGR5 on high glucose-induced hypertrophy of H9C2 cells. After incubation with a high level of glucose, H9C2 cells showed hypertrophic responses. Activation of TGR5 by  (LCA) ameliorated cell hypertrophy and enhanced SERCA2a and phosphorylated phospholamban (PLN) expression in H9C2 cells. Triamterene inhibited these effects at an effective dose to block TGR5. However, LCA failed to modify the free radical elevation induced by high-glucose in the H9c2 cells.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of taurolithocholate (tLCA), a strong TGR5 agonist, and GW4064, a synthetic FXR agonist, on energy metabolism. We determined the effects of chronic i.c.v. infusion of tLCA, GW4064, or vehicle on energy expenditure, body weight and composition as well as tissue specific fatty  uptake in mice equipped with osmotic minipumps. We found that i.c.v. administration of tLCA (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 1 μM) increased fat oxidation (tLCA group: 0.083 ± 0.006 vs control group: 0.036 ± 0.023 kcal/h,  = 5.46,  = 0.04) and decreased fat mass (after 9 days of tLCA infusion: 1.35 ± 0.13 vs controls: 1.96 ± 0.23 g,  = 0.03).

Better understanding of the roles of FXR in digestive system will accelerate the development of FXR ligands/modulators for the treatment of digestive system diseases.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580281>Glucagon-like peptide-2 promotes gallbladder refilling via a TGR5-independent, GLP-2R-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) are secreted from enteroendocrine cells in response to nutrients and bile acids and control metabolism via actions on structurally-related yet distinct G protein coupled receptors. GLP-1 regulates gut motility, appetite, islet function, and glucose homeostasis, whereas GLP-2 enhances intestinal nutrient absorption. GLP-1R agonists are used to treat diabetes and , and a GLP-2R agonist is approved to treat short bowel syndrome. Unexpectedly, reports of gallbladder disease have been associated with the use of both GLP-1R and GLP-2R agonists and after bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms remain unknown.We investigated whether GLP-1 or GLP-2 acutely controls gallbladder (GB) volume and whether GLP-2 regulates GB muscle activity in mice. The expression of , , and  was assessed in mouse GB, and the effects of GLP-2 on hepatic bile  (BA) flow, intestinal and liver BA uptake, and GB gene expression were determined. GLP-2 regulation of GB volume was assessed in wildtype,  and  mice. The effect of GLP-2 on GB smooth muscle (GBSM) calcium transients was characterized .Acute administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 lowered glucose but had no effect on GB volume in mice. In contrast, GLP-2 rapidly enhanced GB filling in a dose-dependent manner, actions maintained in the presence of cholecystokinin, and mediated through the canonical GLP-2R. GLP-2 also rapidly induced immediate early gene expression in GB, consistent with detection of the endogenous  in GB RNA. The ability of GLP-2 to increase GB volume was not abrogated by systemic administration of hexamethonium, propranolol, a vasoactive peptide receptor antagonist or N-Nitroarginine methyl ester, and was maintained in  mice. In contrast, , a Tgr5 agonist, increased GB filling in  but not in  mice. GLP-2 had no effect on ileal uptake or hepatic clearance of taurocholic  or on hepatic bile flow, yet reduced the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in murine GBSM , in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner.Our data extend endocrine concepts of regulation of GB filling beyond FXR-FGF15/19 and the direct effects of BA via Tgr5, to encompass a novel BA-Tgr5-L cell GLP-2 axis providing nutrient-mediated feedback from BA to terminate meal-related GB contraction. These findings have implications for conditions characterized by elevated circulating levels of GLP-2 such as after bariatric surgery and the development and use of agents that promote Tgr5 activation, L cell secretion, or GLP-2R agonism for the treatment of metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19827752>Preparation and structural, biochemical, and pharmaceutical characterizations of bile -modified long-acting exendin-4 derivatives.</a></h2><p>To develop an effective long-acting antidiabetic, the GLP-1 analogue of exendin-4 was modified with three different bile acids (BAs; cholic, deoxycholic, or ), at its two lysine residues. The biological, pharmaceutical, and physicochemical characteristics of these exendin-4 analogues were carefully investigated. Biological activity tests demonstrated that the monobile  substitutions of exendin-4 showed well preserved receptor binding efficacy without noticeable insulinotropic or antidiabetic activity loss. However, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the albumin-binding properties and in vivo elimination half-lives of BAM1-Ex4s (Lys(27)-BA-Ex4s) were significantly enhanced by increasing the hydrophobicities of the conjugated BAs. Furthermore, the protracted antidiabetic effects of the BAM1-Ex4s were also verified by the prolonged restoration of normoglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice. Accordingly, the present study suggests that the derivatization of exendin-4 with BAs offers a means of producing long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetic therapy.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19965603>Urinary metabolomics in Fxr-null mice reveals activated adaptive metabolic pathways upon bile  challenge.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in synthesis, metabolism, and transport of bile acids and thus plays a major role in maintaining bile  homeostasis. In this study, metabolomic responses were investigated in urine of wild-type and Fxr-null mice fed cholic , an FXR ligand, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Multivariate data analysis between wild-type and Fxr-null mice on a cholic  diet revealed that the most increased ions were metabolites of p-cresol (4-methylphenol), corticosterone, and cholic  in Fxr-null mice. The structural identities of the above metabolites were confirmed by chemical synthesis and by comparing retention time (RT) and/or tandem mass fragmentation patterns of the urinary metabolites with the authentic standards. Tauro-3alpha,6,7alpha,12alpha-tetrol (3alpha,6,7alpha,12alpha-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyltaurine), one of the most increased metabolites in Fxr-null mice on a CA diet, is a marker for efficient hydroxylation of toxic bile acids possibly through induction of Cyp3a11. A cholestatic model induced by  revealed that enhanced expression of Cyp3a11 is the major defense mechanism to detoxify cholestatic bile acids in Fxr-null mice.

This study tested whether increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression prevents dedifferentiation of β cells in a high-glucose state in vitro. Culturing a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) in a high-glucose environment decreased VDR expression. However, increased VDR following vitamin D3 (VD3) treatment improved insulin release of early-passage MIN6 and insulin index of db/- (heterozygous) islets to levels seen in normal functional islets. Treatment with VD3, its analogues and derivatives also increased the expression of essential transcription factors, such as Pdx1, MafA and VDR itself, ultimately increasing expression of Ins1 and Ins2, which might protect β cells against dedifferentiation. VD3 agonist  (LCA) propionate was the most potent candidate molecule for protecting against dedifferentiation, and an e-pharmacophore mapping model confirmed that LCA propionate exhibits a stabilizing conformation within the VDR binding site. This study concluded that treating db/+ islets with a VD3 analogue and/or derivatives can increase VDR activity, preventing the pathological dedifferentiation of β cells and the onset of T2D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we investigated the role of TGR5 in renal water handling and the underlying molecular mechanisms.We used tubule suspensions of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells from rat kidneys to investigate the effect of TGR5 signaling on aquaporin-2 (AQP2) expression, and examined the  effects of TGR5 in mice with lithium-induced nephrogenic  (NDI) and  knockout ( ) mice.Activation of TGR5 by  (LCA), an endogenous TGR5 ligand, or INT-777, a synthetic TGR5-specific agonist, induced AQP2 expression and intracellular trafficking in rat IMCD cells  a cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway. In mice with NDI, dietary supplementation with LCA markedly decreased urine output and increased urine osmolality, which was associated with significantly upregulated AQP2 expression in the kidney inner medulla. Supplementation with endogenous FXR agonist had no effect. In primary IMCD suspensions from lithium-treated rats, treatment with INT-767 (FXR and TGR5 dual agonist) or INT-777, but not INT-747 (FXR agonist), increased AQP2 expression.   mice exhibited an attenuated ability to concentrate urine in response to dehydration, which was associated with decreased AQP2 expression in the kidney inner medulla. In lithium-treated   mice, LCA treatment failed to prevent reduction of AQP2 expression.TGR5 stimulation increases renal AQP2 expression and improves impaired urinary concentration in lithium-induced NDI.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with -induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

When occupied by 1,25D, VDR interacts with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimer that binds to vitamin D responsive elements in the region of genes directly controlled by 1,25D. By recruiting complexes of either coactivators or corepressors, ligand-activated VDR-RXR modulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins that promulgate the traditional functions of vitamin D, including signaling intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption to effect skeletal and calcium homeostasis. Thus, vitamin D action in a particular cell depends upon the metabolic production or delivery of sufficient concentrations of the 1,25D ligand, expression of adequate VDR and RXR coreceptor proteins, and cell-specific programming of transcriptional responses to regulate select genes that encode proteins that function in mediating the effects of vitamin D. For example, 1,25D induces RANKL, SPP1 (osteopontin), and BGP (osteocalcin) to govern bone mineral remodeling; TRPV6, CaBP(9k), and claudin 2 to promote intestinal calcium absorption; and TRPV5, klotho, and Npt2c to regulate renal calcium and phosphate reabsorption. VDR appears to function unliganded by 1,25D in keratinocytes to drive mammalian hair cycling via regulation of genes such as CASP14, S100A8, SOSTDC1, and others affecting Wnt signaling. Finally, alternative, low-affinity, non-vitamin D VDR ligands, e.g., , docosahexaenoic , and curcumin, have been reported. Combined alternative VDR ligand(s) and 1,25D/VDR control of gene expression may delay chronic disorders of aging such as osteoporosis, type 2 , cardiovascular disease, and cancer.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3133222>Altered bile  profiles in duodenal bile and urine in diabetic subjects.</a></h2><p>The bile  composition in duodenal bile was analysed in 22 diet-treated and 11 insulin-treated middle-aged patients with  and in 20 normoglycaemic controls.

As a highly significant finding there was a three-fold increase of the percentage of 12-ketolithocholic  in duodenal bile in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, whereas the bile  composition in insulin-dependent diabetics was similar to that in a control group. The percentage of 12-ketolithocholic  in duodenal bile was positively correlated to the percentage in urine. In nine of the subjects studied, 12-ketolithocholic  was the major individual bile  in urine. It constituted 36.3 +/- 4.4% of the bile acids analysed and the excretion was 6.1 +/- 2.3 mumol 24 h-1. Together with 3 alpha, 12 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic  it was predominantly present in the glycine conjugate fraction, whereas in bile its conjugation was similar to that of the other bile acids.

Mitochondria are the main source of ROS as by-products of electron transport chain. Most of the time the intestine responds adequately against the oxidative stress, but with aging or under conditions that exacerbate the ROS and/or RNS production, the defenses are not enough and contribute to developing intestinal pathologies. The endogenous antioxidant defense system in gut includes glutathione (GSH) and GSH-dependent enzymes as major components. When the ROS and/or RNS production is exacerbated, oxidative stress occurs and the intestinal Ca absorption is inhibited. GSH depleting drugs such as DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, menadione and sodium deoxycholate inhibit the Ca transport from lumen to blood by alteration in the protein expression and/or activity of molecules involved in the Ca transcellular and paracellular pathways through mechanisms of oxidative stress, apoptosis and/or autophagy. Quercetin, melatonin,  and ursodeoxycholic acids block the effect of those drugs in experimental animals by their antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and/or anti-autophagic properties.

The steroidal core of BAs constitutes a saturated cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene skeleton, consisting of three six-membered (A, B, and C) and one five-membered ring (D). Primary BAs are produced in the hepatocytes, while secondary BAs are formed by modifying the primary BAs in the intestinal lumen, i.e., by the reactions of 7α-dehydroxylation and deconjugation of cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The most important secondary BAs are deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA). The BAs realize their effects through nuclear farnesoid X receptors (FXRs) and membrane TGR5 receptors. It has been found that BAs are also associated with other receptors such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR), from which the most significant ligand is calcitriol, as well as with pregnane X receptor (PXR) and potentially with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), whose ligands are numerous, structurally different xenobiotics that show greater affinity to BAs.

Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7018861>Biliary lipid and bile  composition in insulin-dependent .

A major regulator of metabolic processes that gained interest in recent years is the bile  receptor TGR5 (Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). This G protein-coupled membrane receptor can be found predominantly in the intestine, where it is mainly responsible for the secretion of the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). The aim of this study was (i) to identify plant extracts with TGR5-activating potential, (ii) to narrow down their activity to the responsible constituents, and (iii) to assess whether the intestinal microbiota produces transformed metabolites with a different activity profile. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) served as positive control for both, the applied cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay for TGR5 activity and the biotransformation assay using mouse fecal slurry. The suitability of the workflow was demonstrated by the biotransformation of CDCA to  resulting in a distinct increase in TGR5 activity. Based on a traditional Tibetan formula, 19 plant extracts were selected and investigated for TGR5 activation. Extracts from the commonly used spices  (SaroE, clove),  (PdioE, allspice), and  (KgalE, aromatic ginger) significantly increased TGR5 activity. After biotransformation, only KgalE showed significant differences in its metabolite profile, which, however, did not alter its TGR5 activity compared to non-transformed KgalE. UHPLC-HRMS (high-resolution mass spectrometry) analysis revealed triterpene acids (TTAs) as the main constituents of the extracts SaroE and PdioE. Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs. ECs were determined for the main TTAs, i.e., oleanolic  (2.2 ± 1.6 μM), ursolic  (1.1 ± 0.2 μM), as well as for the hitherto unknown TGR5 activators corosolic  (0.5 ± 1.0 μM) and maslinic  (3.7 ± 0.7 μM).
