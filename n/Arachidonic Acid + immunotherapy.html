Prostaglandin E2 (PGE), an  pathway metabolite and mediator of chronic inflammation, has emerged as a powerful immunosuppressor in the TME through engagement with one or more of its 4 receptors (EP1-EP4). We have developed E7046, an orally bioavailable EP4-specific antagonist and show here that E7046 has specific and potent inhibitory activity on PGE-mediated pro-tumor myeloid cell differentiation and activation. E7046 treatment reduced the growth or even rejected established tumors  in a manner dependent on both myeloid and CD8 T cells. Furthermore, co-administration of E7046 and E7777, an IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein that preferentially kills Tregs, synergistically disrupted the myeloid and Treg immunosuppressive networks, resulting in effective and durable anti-tumor immune responses in mouse tumor models. In the TME, E7046 and E7777 markedly increased ratios of CD8granzymeB cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/live Tregs and of M1-like/M2TAM, and converted a chronic inflammation phenotype into acute inflammation, shown by substantial induction of STAT1/IRF-1 and IFNγ-controlled genes. Notably, E7046 also showed synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, which have been reported to diminish intratumoral Tregs. Our studies thus reveal a specific myeloid cell differentiation-modifying activity by EP4 blockade and a novel combination of E7046 and E7777 as a means to synergistically mitigate both myeloid and Treg-derived immunosuppression for cancer treatment in preclinical models.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27538737>Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and current treatment modalities.</a></h2><p>Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) refers to the combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and acute upper and lower respiratory tract reactions to the ingestion of aspirin (acetylsalicylic , ASA) and other cyclooxygenase-1 inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AERD affects 0.3-0.9 % of the general population. AERD generally occurs due to abnormalities in mediators and expression of  biosynthesis. Local IgE responses to staphylococcal enterotoxins may also be responsible for eosinophilic activation in the nasal polyp tissues of AERD patients. Clinical features of AERD include the onset of nasal congestion with anosmia, progressing to chronic pansinusitis and nasal polyps that regrow rapidly after surgery. Aspirin desensitization, Leukotriene-modifying agents, biologic agents, management of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis are recommended as treatment modalities.  is prescribed only to those AERD patients who experience clear seasonal or perennial allergy symptoms in addition to the symptoms attributable to chronic nasal polyposis. There are also investigational and dietary therapies. In this review, the important aspects of AERD will be presented, along with a literature survey.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29808460>The role of lipid signaling in the progression of malignant melanoma.</a></h2><p>In the past decades, a vast amount of data accumulated on the role of lipid signaling pathways in the progression of malignant melanoma, the most metastatic/aggressive human cancer type. Genomic studies identified that PTEN loss is the leading factor behind the activation of the PI3K-signaling pathway in melanoma, mutations of which are one of the main resistance mechanisms behind target therapy failures. On the other hand, illegitimate expressions of megakaryocytic genes p12-lipoxyganse, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphodiestherase-2/autotaxin (ATX) are mostly involved in the regulation of motility signaling in melanoma through various G-protein-coupled bioactive lipid receptors. Furthermore, endocannabinoid signaling can also be a novel paracrine survival factor in melanoma. Last but not least, prenylation inhibitors acting even on mutated small GTP-ases, such as NRAS of melanoma may offer novel therapeutic opportunities. As regards melanoma, the most effective therapy nowadays is , with the resistance mechanisms also possibly involving the lipid signaling activities of melanoma cells, which further supports the idea of their being therapeutic targets.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261990>Aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: New insights into the molecular mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Aspirin desensitization (AD) has been the only available modifying treatment in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). The mechanisms of AD are nonetheless poorly understood. Though very effective, AD is limited by its risks and side-effects.Moving forward to the targeted biologicals era, the aim of this study was to characterize the airway inflammatory response to long-term AD, including TSLP dynamics, in order to assess potential new targets in AERD.Adult patients with aspirin challenge-confirmed AERD underwent an oral AD followed by daily ingestion of aspirin for at least 6 months. Clinical data and inflammatory biomarkers were measured and compared, before and after AD. Induced sputum analyses were performed at baseline, one and six months after AD (differential cell count and levels of sputum supernatant leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2 and E2, and TSLP).AD was followed by significant clinical improvement, as quantified by all monitored parameters. The good clinical outcomes of AD in our study are supported by overall changes observed in the  metabolites (decreased PGD2 over a constant LTC4/PGE2). TSLP increased (mean baseline 0.1 ± 0.03; 1 month 3.68 ± 7; 6 months 212.2 ± 44 pg/ml; p < 0.01).Our findings suggest that new biologicals blocking TSLP might have a clinical benefit in AERD, by cutting down the TSLP-induced PGD2 generation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The numbers of platelet-adherent leukocytes increase in AERD patients, enhancing production of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) via transcellular metabolism of arachidonate. INF-γ released from eosinophils of the sinus tissue of AERD patients promotes eosinophil maturation, increases leukotriene-associated gene expression, and releases CysLTs. The serum periostin level has been suggested to be a useful biomarker predicting the AERD/CRSwNP phenotype. Aspirin desensitization was reported to decrease the levels of CD4⁺ T cell-derived cytokines, including INF-γ and IL-10, in line with the newly defined role of INF-γ in AERD.Recent findings further support the notion that  metabolism is dysregulated in AERD patients. This is reflected by resistance to PGE₂, overproduction of CysLTs by enhanced numbers of platelet-adherent leukocytes, and cellular stimulation by INF-γ released from eosinophils. Aspirin desensitization may be a useful treatment option in AERD patients exhibiting recalcitrant CRSwNP.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658026>Alternative products to treat allergic rhinitis and alternative routes for allergy .</a></h2><p>Some alternative products instead of  are used in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).In this paper, alternative products to treat allergic rhinitis and alternative routes for allergy  are reviewed.Alternative products and methods used instead of  are tea therapy, acupuncture, Nigella sativa, cinnamon bark, Spanish needle, acerola, capsaicin (Capsicum annum), allergen-absorbing ointment, and cellulose powder.

We also assessed ex vivo basophil reactivity to aspirin after desensitization. Cases were patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and documented history of aspirin hypersensitivity who underwent rapid successful oral desensitization to aspirin. Controls were patients with stable CAD without hypersensitivity and receiving aspirin. Among 56 cases, 27 received aspirin for acute coronary syndromes and 29 were treated for stable CAD. Aspirin was effective (defined as light transmission aggregometry induced by  ≤20%) at D1 in 86% of cases (P = 0.045 vs. controls) and in 95% at W6-8, vs. 100% of controls (P = 0.39). Urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 diminished substantially in cases (P < 0.0001, D0 vs. W6-8) but remained higher than in controls (P = 0.03). Platelet reactivity (defined by platelet P-selectin expression, activated glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and platelet-monocyte aggregates) was similar in cases between D0 and D1 but decreased at W6-8. Basophil activation (quantified by upregulation of CD203c in response to aspirin) was higher in cases at W6-8 than in controls (P = 0.0002).Thus, following rapid desensitization, aspirin achieves rapid biological efficacy, which is slightly lower at D1, but becomes indistinguishable from chronically treated patients at W6-8. Persistent basophil activation several weeks after desensitization suggests infraclinical hypersensitivity and the need to continue aspirin to maintain desensitization.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Carcass traits and physicochemical parameters, including fatty  profile, were investigated. The only carcass trait significantly affected by castration was the ham fat thickness, where both immune-spayed and surgically spayed females showed higher values against entire females (57±9.5mm, 62±2.5mm and 51±10.1mm, respectively; p<0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the quality parameters of fresh meat. These results are important regarding animal welfare, since in Europe, there is a plan to voluntarily end the surgical castration of pigs by 2018. Therefore, with an adequate vaccination protocol, immune-spaying might represent a good alternative to surgical spaying. The reliability of immune-spaying over long periods should be evaluated.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing and adult worms are unscathed by the surrounding immune effectors and antibodies because the parasite is protected by a double lipid bilayer armor which allows access of nutrients, while binding of specific antibodies is denied.Fluorescence recovery after bleaching, extraction of surface membrane cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, inhibition and activation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis and hydrolysis, and elastic incoherent and quasi-elastic neutron scattering approaches have helped to clarify the basic mechanism of this immune evasion, and showed that sphingomyelin (SM) molecules in the worm apical lipid bilayer form with surrounding water molecules a tight hydrogen bond barrier. Viability of the parasite and permeability of the outer shield are controlled by equilibrium between SM biosynthesis and activity of a tegument-associated neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase).Excessive nSMase activation by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as  (ARA) leads to disruption of the SM molecules and associated hydrogen bond network, with subsequent access of host antibodies and immune effectors to the outer membrane and eventual parasite death.ARA was predicted and shown to be a potent schistosomicide in vitro and in vivo in experimental animals and in children. Additionally, it was advocated that schistosomiasis vaccine candidates should be selected uniquely among excretory-secretory products of developing worms, as contrary to cytosolic and surface membrane antigens, they are able to activate the effector functions of the host antibodies and toxic molecules.

We performed a systematic review of studies which examined biological mechanisms contributing to the onset of a MDE during IFN-α-based  for HCV.Major electronic databases were searched from inception up until 15th February 2016 for peer-reviewed prospective studies that had enrolled HCV infected patients who received IFN-α treatment. A diagnosis of MDE had to be established by means of a standardized diagnostic interview at baseline and endpoint.Eight unique references met inclusion criteria. A total of 826 participants with HCV (37.3% females, mean age 46.7 years) were included in this systematic review. The overall MDE incidence rate was 34.8%, with follow-up ranging between 4 and 48 weeks. The methodological quality varied across selected studies. It was observed that Interleukin-6, salivary cortisol,  / eicosapentaenoicacid plus docosahexaenoic  ratio, and genetic polymorphisms may present variations which are linked to a predisposition to INF-α-induced depression.A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the diverse biological mechanisms investigated and the lack of replicated evidence.This systematic review indicates that several potential mechanisms may be implicated in the onset of a MDE following IFN-α-based  for chronic HCV. However, replicated evidence is lacking and therefore the mechanisms involved in IFN-α-induced depression in humans remain unclear.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show that exosomes secreted by PDAC cell lines differed in their surface proteins, lipid composition, and efficiency of fusing with THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Exosomes from AsPC-1, an ascites-derived human PDAC cell line, were enriched in ICAM-1, which mediated their docking to macrophages through interactions with surface-exposed CD11c on macrophages. AsPC-1 exosomes also contained much higher levels of  (AA), and they fused at a higher rate with THP-1-derived macrophages than did exosomes from other PDAC cell lines or from an immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) H6c7. Phospholipase A2 enzymatic cleavage of  from AsPC-1 exosomes reduced fusion efficiency. PGE2 secretion was elevated in macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes but not in macrophages treated with exosomes from other cell lines, suggesting a functional role for the AsPC-1 exosome-delivered  in macrophages. Non-polarized (M0) macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had increased levels of surface markers indicative of polarization to an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype (CD14hi CD163hi CD206hi). Furthermore, macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had significantly increased secretion of pro-tumoral, bioactive molecules including VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-9, and TNFα. Together, these results demonstrate that compared to exosomes from other primary tumor-derived PDAC cell lines, AsPC-1 exosomes alter THP-1-derived macrophage phenotype and function. AsPC-1 exosomes mediate communication between tumor cells and TAMs that contributes to tumor progression.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929893>[ASA-intolerance syndrome and persistent rhinosinusitis : Differential diagnosis and treatment].</a></h2><p>A differential diagnosis of persistent chronic rhinosinusitis is ASA-intolerance syndrome (AIS), also known as Aspirin®‑exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), Samter-Trias (Samter's disease, Morbus Widal).

Therefore, regulation of their fate is essential for their effective therapeutic use. Here we report the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in regulating hematopoiesis which has not been explored well so far. Mice were fed daily for 10 days with n-6/n-3 PUFAs, viz. linoleic  (LA),  (AA), alpha-linolenic  and docosahexanoic  (DHA) in four separate test groups with phosphate-buffered saline fed mice as control set. The bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice showed a significantly higher hematopoiesis as assessed using side population, Lin-Sca-1ckit+, colony-forming unit (CFU), long-term culture, CFU-spleen assay and engraftment potential as compared to the control set. Thrombopoiesis was also stimulated in PUFA-fed mice. A combination of DHA and AA was found to be more effective than when either was fed individually. Higher incorporation of PUFAs as well as products of their metabolism was observed in the bone marrow cells of PUFA-fed mice. A stimulation of the Wnt, CXCR4 and Notch1 pathways was observed in PUFA-fed mice. The clinical relevance of this study was evident when bone marrow-transplanted recipient mice, which were fed with PUFAs, showed higher engraftment of donor cells, suggesting that the bone marrow microenvironment may also be stimulated by feeding with PUFAs. These data indicate that oral administration of PUFAs in mice stimulates hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis and could serve as a valuable supplemental therapy in situations of hematopoietic failure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Adipocytes strongly contribute to inflammation by producing inflammatory mediators. In this study we investigated the role of human visceral fat adipocytes in regulating the functions of innate immunity cells. Adipocyte-conditioned media (ACM) from obese (n = 14) and CRC (lean, n = 14; obese, n = 13) subjects released higher levels of pro-inflammatory/immunoregulatory factors as compared to ACM from healthy lean subjects (n = 13). Dendritic cells (DC), differentiated in the presence of ACM from obese and CRC subjects, expressed elevated levels of the inhibitory molecules PD-L1 and PD-L2, and showed a reduced IL-12/IL-10 ratio in response to both TLR ligand- and γδ T lymphocyte-induced maturation. Furthermore, CRC patient-derived ACM inhibited DC-mediated γδ T cell activation. The immunosuppressive signals delivered by ACM from obese and CRC individuals were associated with a pro-inflammatory secretory and ω6 polyunsaturated fatty  profile of adipocytes. Interestingly, STAT3 activation in adipocytes correlated with dihomo-γlinolenic  content and was further induced by , which conversely down-modulated PPARγ.

For their successful use in the clinics, the propagation and functionality of DCs is crucial. We earlier established a two-step method for the large scale generation of DCs from umbilical cord blood derived MNCs/CD34(+) cells. This work aims at improving their functionality based on the following observations: in vitro generated DCs can be less efficient in migration and other functional activities due to lower eicosanoid levels. The production of eicosanoids from  (AA) can be hampered due to suppression of the enzyme phospholipase A2 by IL-4, an essential cytokine required for the differentiation of DCs. We hypothesized that exogenous addition of AA to the culture media during DC generation may result in DCs with improved functionality. DCs were generated with and without AA. The two DC sets were compared by phenotypic analysis, morphology and functional assays like antigen uptake, MLR, CTL assay and in vitro and in vivo migration. Though there were no differences between the two types of DCs in terms of morphology, phenotype and antigen uptake, AA(+) DCs exhibited an enhanced in vitro and in vivo migration, T cell stimulatory capacity, CTL activity and significantly higher transcript levels of COX-2. AA(+) DCs also show a favorable Th1 cytokine profile than AA- DCs. Thus addition of AA to the culture media is skewing the DCs towards the secretion of more IL-12 and less of IL-10 along with the restoration of eicosanoids levels in a COX-2 mediated pathway thereby enhancing the functionality of these cells to be used as a potent cellular vaccine. Taken together, these findings will be helpful in the better contriving of DC based vaccines for cancer .</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193681>Rapid Desensitization of the Patients With Aspirin Hypersensitivity and Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28507038>High-affinity pan-specific monoclonal antibodies that target cysteinyl leukotrienes and show efficacy in an acute model of colitis.</a></h2><p>Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are a small family of biological signaling lipids produced by active leukocytes that contribute to diverse inflammatory disease states as a consequence of their engagement with dedicated G protein-coupled receptors. Immunization of mice with a CysLT-modified hapten carrier protein yielded novel monoclonal antibodies that display variable binding affinity to CysLTs. Solution binding assays indicated differing specificities among the antibodies tested, with antibody 10G4 displaying a preference for leukotriene C (LTC). X-ray crystallography of a humanized 10G4 Fab fragment in complex with LTC revealed that binding induces a hook-like conformation within the hydrocarbon tail of the lipid  moiety. Specific hydrogen bonding to the LTC carboxylate groups further stabilized the complex, while a water molecule mediated a hydrogen bond network that connected the N-terminal arm of l-glutathione to both the arachidonyl carboxylate of LTC and the antibody heavy chain. Prophylactic administration of two anti-CysLT antibodies in mice followed by challenge with LTC demonstrated their in vivo efficacy against acute inflammation in a vascular permeability model. 10G4 ameliorated the effects of acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, suggesting that anti-CysLT antibodies could provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p></html>
