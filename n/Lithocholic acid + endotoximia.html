This study investigated the alterations of hepatocellular transport in a rat sepsis model (LPS i.p.) as well as in a model inducing SIRS by sterile abscess formation (turpentine i.m.). Two bile acids (Cholyltaurine and Chemodeoxycholyltaurine) and one organic anion (Sulfolithocholyltaurine) were used as marker substrates to investigate the time course of hepatocellular transport function. Experiments were performed in isolated perfused rat livers and plasma membrane vesicles. During sepsis, both, the transport of bile acids and that of the organic anion was markedly reduced. In contrast no alteration of transport was detected during SIRS. However, biliary secretion of glutathione (+90%) and bile  independent bile flow (%) were increased. mRNA levels of bile  and organic anion transport proteins were reduced. The lowest values were noted 12 h after injection of LPS or turpentine. Almost unchanged kinetic parameters during SIRS pointed to a normal population of transporters with regard to quantity and substrate affinity. Therefore it seems that transcriptional regulation plays an important role for the expression of transport proteins during sepsis, whereas posttranscriptional regulation may be of importance during SIRS. The clinical phenomenon of septic cholestasis including jaundice implies  and differenciates against SIRS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/717291>Serum bile  levels in protracted diarrhea of infancy.</a></h2><p>Significant elevations in two glycine-conjugated serum bile  levels (cholic and chenodeoxycholic) were detected in a majority of infants with intractable diarrhea of infancy. In contrast, children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease had values of serum bile acids within the normal range. Although intravenous alimentation and constant-infusion elemental diet may alter hepatic function, serum bile  levels were also elevated in other infants with intractable diarrhea not treated by these methods. We hypothesize that  or other unknown mechanisms together with therapy are exerting a detrimental effect on hepatic function.</p></html>
