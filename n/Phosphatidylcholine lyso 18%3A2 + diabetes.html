<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322650>Specific Metabolic Markers Are Associated with Future Waist-Gaining Phenotype in Women.</a></h2><p>Our study aims to identify metabolic markers associated with either a gain in abdominal (measured by waist circumference) or peripheral (measured by hip circumference) body fat mass.Data of 4 126 weight-gaining adults (-75 years) from three population-based, prospective German cohort studies (EPIC, KORA, DEGS) were analysed regarding a waist-gaining (WG) or hip-gaining phenotype (HG). The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing.Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Respective odds ratios (OR) ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 for tryptophan, the diacyl- (PC) C32:3, C36:0, C38:0, C38:1, C42:, C42:5, the acyl-alkyl-PCs C32:, C34:0, C36:0, C36:1, C36:, C38:0, C38:, C40:1, C40:, C40:5, C40:6, 42:, C42:3 and -PC C17:0.Both weight-gaining men and women showed a clear tendency to gain more abdominal than peripheral fat. Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial metabolic state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women. Thus, higher levels of specific PCs may play a protective role in gaining waist circumference.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with  and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of lipid metabolism in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid metabolism at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), - (16:0, :1),  (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant. We concluded that both lipid and triglyceride metabolism were altered at least 10 weeks before diagnosis of GDM. Further investigation is required to determine the functional consequences of these differences and the mechanisms by which they arise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718662>High Spatial Resolution Imaging of Mouse Pancreatic Islets Using Nanospray Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Nanospray Desorption Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano-DESI MSI) enables ambient imaging of biological samples with high sensitivity and minimal sample pretreatment. Recently, we developed an approach for constant-distance mode MSI using shear force microscopy to precisely control the distance between the sample and the nano-DESI probe. Herein, we demonstrate the power of this approach for robust imaging of pancreatic islets with high spatial resolution of ∼11 μm. Pancreatic islets are difficult to characterize using traditional mass spectrometry approaches due to their small size (∼100 μm) and molecular heterogeneity. Nano-DESI MSI was used to examine the spatial localization of several lipid classes including  (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) along with fatty acids and their metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins) in the individual islets and surrounding tissue. Several lipids were found to be substantially enhanced in the islets indicating these lipids may be involved in insulin secretion. Remarkably different distributions were observed for several pairs of  PC (LPC) and PC species differing only by one double bond, such as LPC :1 vs LPC :0, PC 32:1 vs PC 32:0, and PC 34: vs PC 34:1. These findings indicate that minor variations in the fatty acid chain length and saturation have a pronounced effect on the localization of PC and LPC species in pancreatic islets. Interestingly, oxidized PC species observed experimentally were found to be specifically localized to pancreatic islets. These PCs are potential biomarkers for reactive oxygen species in the islets, which could be harmful to pancreatic beta cells. The experimental approach presented in this study will provide valuable information on the heterogeneity of individual pancreatic islets, which is difficult to assess using bulk characterization techniques.</p></html>
