<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15946407>Increasing ursodeoxycholic  in the enterohepatic circulation of pigs through the administration of living bacteria.</a></h2><p>We investigated the feasibility of increasing ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in the enterohepatic circulation of pigs by administering living bacteria capable of epimerising endogenous amidated chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) to UDCA. We first demonstrated that combining Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010, as a bile salt-hydrolysing bacterium, and Clostridium absonum ATCC 27555, as a CDCA to UDCA epimerising bacterium, led to the efficient epimerisation of glyco- and tauro-CDCA in vitro, with respective UDCA yields of 55.8 (SE 2.8) and 36.6 (SE 1.5)%. This strain combination was then administered to hypercholesterolaemic pigs over a 3-week period, as two daily preprandial doses of either viable (six experimental pigs) or heat-inactivated bacteria (six controls). The main effects of treatment were on unconjugated bile acids (P=0.035) and UDCA (P<0.0001) absorbed into the portal vein, which increased 1.6-1.7- and 3.5-7.5-fold, respectively, under administration of living compared with inactivated bacteria. In bile, UDCA did not increase significantly, but the increase in biliary  with time in the controls was not observed in the experimental pigs (P=0.007), and the same trend was observed in faeces. All other variables (biliary lipid equilibrium, plasma lipid levels and partition of cholesterol between the different lipoprotein classes) remained unaffected by treatment throughout the duration of the experiment. In conclusion, it is feasible to increase the bioavailability of UDCA to the intestine and the liver by administering active bacteria. This may represent an interesting new probiotic activity, provided that in future it could be expressed by a safe food micro-organism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464459>Combination of soya pulp and Bacillus coagulans lilac-01 improves intestinal bile  metabolism without impairing the effects of prebiotics in rats fed a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria are involved in bile  (BA) deconjugation and/or dehydroxylation and are responsible for the production of secondary BA. However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291252>Influence of ad Libitum Feeding of Piglets With Bacillus Subtilis Fermented Liquid Feed on Gut Flora, Luminal Contents and Health.</a></h2><p>Some scholars caution that long-term ad libitum feeding with probiotic fermented food poses potential health risks to baby animals. We conducted a feeding experiment to investigate the influence of ad libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet on the gut microbiome, gut metabolomic profiles, bile  metabolism, proinflammatory cytokines and faecal consistency. Compared with piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet, piglets fed the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet had lower intestinal bacterial diversity (P > 0.05), higher intestinal fungal diversity (P > 0.05), more Firmicutes (P > 0.05), fewer Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (P > 0.05), higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic  (P < 0.05), orotic  (P < 0.05), interleukin-6 (P < 0.01), lactic  (P < 0.01), deoxycholic  (P > 0.05) and  (P < 0.01) and a higher incidence of diarrhoea (P > 0.05). The data show that ad libitum feeding of piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet during the suckling and early post-weaning periods promotes the growth of lactic  bacteria, bile salt hydrolase-active bacteria and 7a-dehydroxylase-active bacteria in the intestinal lumen; disturbs the normal production of lactic , orotic  and unconjugated bile acids; and increases circulating interleukin-6 levels and diarrhoea incidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369744>Effect of probiotics on serum bile acids in patients with ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>Evaluation of bile acids (BA) is useful for assessing the changes of intestinal flora in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). During enterohepatic circulation, the intestinal micro flora cause 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), yielding deoxycholic (DCA) and , respectively. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of probiotics in patients with UC by examining changes of the serum BA profile.Twenty-seven patients were divided into the following 2 groups based on endoscopic findings: Fifteen patients with distal UC (dUC group) and 12 patients with pancolitis (pUC group). After treatment with mesalazine or salazosulfapyridine (5-ASA), all patients achieved remission. Then they were given 5-ASA plus the probiotic Clostridium butyricum Miyairi (3.0 g/day) for 4 weeks.After 4 weeks of probiotic treatment, %CDCA was significantly higher and %DCA was significantly lower in the pUC group than in the HV group. In contrast, the dUC group showed no significant differences of %CDCA or %DCA from the HV group after 4 weeks.Probiotic therapy restored intestinal flora involved in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation in the dUC group, but not in the pUC group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18051279>Effect of dietary inclusion of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 on cholesterol metabolism in rats.</a></h2><p>This study examined the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 43121 (LAB) on cholesterol metabolism in hypercholesterolemia-induced rats. Four treatment groups of rats (n = 9) were fed experimental diets: normal diet, normal diet+LAB (2 x 10(6) CFU/day), hypercholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol, w/w), and hypercholesterol diet + LAB. Body weight, feed intake, and feed efficiency did not differ among the four groups. Supplementation with LAB reduced total serum cholesterol (25%) and VLDL + IDL + LDL cholesterol (42%) in hypercholesterol diet groups, although hepatic tissue cholesterol and lipid contents were not changed. In the normal diet group, cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase expression), absorption (LDL receptor expression), and excretion via bile acids (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression) were increased by supplementation with LAB, and increased cholesterol absorption and decreased excretion were found in the hypercholesterol diet group. Total fecal  sterols excretion was increased by supplementation with LAB. With proportional changes in both normal and hypercholesterol diet groups, primary bile acids (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids) were reduced, and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic and  acids) were increased. Fecal neutral sterol excretion was not changed by LAB. In this experiment, the increase in insoluble bile  () reduced blood cholesterol level in rats fed hypercholesterol diets supplemented with LAB. Thus, in the rat, L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 is more likely to affect deconjugation and dehydroxylation during cholesterol metabolism than the assimilation of cholesterol into cell membranes.</p></html>
