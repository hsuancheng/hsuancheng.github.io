In vitro and in experimental animals, it seems to be a mediator of inflammation, and intradermal injection of Paf-acether in man elicits a biphasic inflammatory response, reminiscent of the dual response to allergen in sensitized individuals. In the present study, cutaneous histology was assessed in sequential skin biopsies from six normal volunteers after intradermal injection of 200 or 800 pmol Paf-acether. Paf-acether (200 pmol) induced intravascular accumulation of neutrophils, accompanied by a perivascular mixed cellular infiltrate which was composed predominantly of neutrophils at 4 and 12 hours, and lymphocytes and histiocytes at 24 hours. Control injections of lyso-Paf and normal saline induced no noteworthy histological changes. Paf-acether (800 pmol) resulted in vessel destruction, gross endothelial swelling and a perivascular infiltrate of mononuclear cells and neutrophils, accompanied by occasional evidence of leucocytoclasis. By virtue of its ability to induce inflammatory cell accumulation in human skin, Paf-acether should be considered as a potential mediator of inflammatory disorders such as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2856180>Effect of forskolin on beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in skin.</a></h2><p>beta-Adrenergic receptor hyporesponsiveness has been observed in  and after exposure of epidermis to phorbol esters. It was the purpose of our studies to determine if forskolin, which is known to act synergistically with receptor agonists in elevating endogenous levels of cyclic AMP, could return these responses to those seen under control conditions. It was observed that topical application of phorbol ester to mouse ears in vivo led to a significant reduction in isoproterenol stimulation of cyclic AMP in vitro. Low doses of forskolin (10(-7) M) were able to enhance isoproterenol's effect under these conditions. Similarly, human keratinocyte cell cultures treated with phorbol esters and human psoriatic epidermis in vitro were both hyporesponsive to isoproterenol. Again, pretreatment of these samples with forskolin restored the beta-agonist stimulation to control values. These data indicate that forskolin is still able to act synergistically with beta-agonists in hyporesponsive systems and suggest that forskolin may be a useful probe in defining the mechanism of this decreased responsiveness both in phorbol-ester-treated skin and in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2142172>The effect of triethanolamine application on anthralin-induced inflammation and therapeutic effect in .</a></h2><p>Twenty patients with chronic plaque  were treated with short-contact anthralin followed by 10% triethanolamine application to one side of the body and aqueous cream to the other.

In a normal healthy group (n = 12) PAF level was 25.9 +/- 6.5 pg/0.1 ml plasma (mean +/- standard error of the mean: SEM), and this was elevated in patients with  (68.1 +/- 11.8, n = 25, P < 0.01), without a change in the PAF-AH level. LTB4 showed a similar increase (115.0 +/- 21.6 pg/ml vs. 68.2 +/- 11.8 pg/ml, P < 0.05), while TXB2 and PGE2 showed insignificant (P > 0.05) changes. LTC4 and LTD4/E4 were around the level of the limit of detection. Patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (n = 33) demonstrated similar, but milder and statistically insignificant, increases in PAF, LTB4, TXB2 and PGE2 levels.

Suggestions that PAF is produced by cutaneous cells, and cells infiltrating the skin from the blood, have been reported. PAF has been identified in allergic cutaneous reactions and also in psoriatic lesions. The biological activity of PAF is thought to be mediated by cell membrane receptors. Studies revealed that PAF-antagonists can be active in animal models of cutaneous inflammation. In humans PAF-antagonists showed minimal therapeutic improvement in studies of antigen-induced cutaneous responses in atopic subjects. No data are available on the effects of PAF-antagonists in . The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a potent PAF-antagonist (Ro 24-0238, 10% solution in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether) in 10 patients with chronic plaque , a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Clinical response was evaluated and markers of inflammation, differentiation and proliferation were studied immunohistochemically on punch biopsies taken from actively treated and placebo-treated lesions, before and after treatment. This study demonstrated that a 10% solution of the PAF-antagonist Ro 24-0238 was not effective at the clinical or cell biological level after a 4-week treatment period.

Extracted phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The isolated fractions of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidyl- (PE) were treated with phospholipase A2 to release fatty acids in the sn-2 position. Released MHFAs were separated by reversed-phase and straight-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as the linoleic acid derivatives 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE) and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and as the arachidonic acid derivative 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). These findings are consistent with the presence of unesterified 9-HODE, 13-HODE and 15-HETE. In contrast, 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), although found to be present in high amounts as unesterified 12-HETE, was not detectable in the phospholipids. When compared with non-lesional psoriatic skin, the levels of 9-HODE, 13-HODE and 15-HETE esterified to the sn-2 position of PC, PI and PE in lesional psoriatic skin were significantly decreased (to 28-78% of those in non-lesional skin). This depletion of MHFAs in specific phospholipids may be due to an imbalance between phospholipase and acyltransferase activities. Because the levels of esterified MHFAs may influence signal transduction and eicosanoid metabolism the described changes may be relevant for the inflammatory processes occurring in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16597194>Coleus forskohlii.

Herein we explore the association between choline metabolites and inflammation in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.Thirty-eight patients with PsA, all of whom satisfied the CASPAR classification criteria for PsA, were studied. Outcomes reflecting the activity of peripheral arthritis as well as skin , Disease Activity Score (DAS)28, Clinical Disease Index (CDAI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) were assessed. Serum concentration of choline metabolites (choline, TMA, TMAO, betaine and carnitine) were determined by LC-MS, and metabolite levels associated with disease scores.Among the 38 PsA patients included, the mean DAS28PCR was 2.74±1.29. Twenty-seven patients had active skin disease, with an average BSA of 7.2±16.22. TMAO, but not TMA or choline, significantly correlated with measures of disease activity for both skin and peripheral joints.In our cohort, only TMAO, but not TMA, choline, betaine or carnitine, was associated with inflammation in PsA patients, establishing a mechanistic link between TMAO and PsA phenotypes.

In both phases, the patients were studied in conditions of low sodium (LS) intake followed by a high sodium (HS) diet.Twenty-four-hour mean +/- SD blood pressure during LS and HS intake was, respectively, 86.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg and 85.5 +/- 1.8 mmHg during phase I, and 88.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg and 91.8 +/- 2.2 mmHg (P < 0.001 vs. phase I, HS; P < 0.05 vs. phase II, LS) during phase II.

Because dermal blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerves, the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and the co-transmitter adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) may regulate expression of EC inflammatory factors. We focused on IL-6 regulation because it has many inflammatory and immune functions, including participation in Th17 cell differentiation. Strikingly, NE and ATP synergistically induced release of IL-6 by a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Adrenergic antagonist and agonist studies indicated that the effect of NE on induced IL-6 release is primarily mediated by β2-adrenergic receptors (ARs). By real-time PCR IL-6 mRNA was also synergistically induced in HMEC-1 cells. This synergistic effect of NE and ATP was reproduced in primary human dermal endothelial cells (pHDMECs) and is also primarily mediated by β2-ARs. Under conditions of stress, activation of the symphathetic nervous system may lead to release of ATP and NE by sympathetic nerves surrounding dermal blood vessels with induction of IL-6 production by ECs. IL-6 may then participate in immune and inflammatory processes including generation of Th17 cells. Production of IL-6 in this manner might explain stress-induced exacerbation of , and perhaps, other skin disorders involving Th17-type immunity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, when epidermis from the involved skin of psoriatic patients was incubated under the same experimental conditions, the cyclic AMP level increased only 2-5 times. Even when theophylline, and inhibitor of specific cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase, was omitted from the medium, a clearly demonstrable difference in sensitivity to adrenaline was evident in normal appearing and lesional psoriatic epidermis. These results indicate a faulty adenyl cyclase system in the involved epidermis of psoriatic lesions rather than a defective degradation process by the specific phosphodiesterase. Since the Km for adrenaline activation of adenyl cyclase was approximately the same in both the uninvolved and the involved epidermis and since the cyclic AMP increase by adrenaline was abolished by the addition of propranolol, the basic nature of the beta-receptor (specifically the binding affinity to adrenaline) in the involved epidermis does not appear to be defective. On the other hand, the finding that the Vmax for adrenaline activation is 10-20 times higher in the uninvolved than in the involved epidermis suggests that the poor response in the involved epidermis may be due to fewer available binding sites for adrenaline in the psoriatic lesion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11851887>Hepoxilin B3 and its enzymatically formed derivative trioxilin B3 are incorporated into phospholipids in psoriatic lesions.</a></h2><p>In previous studies we observed that normal human epidermis forms 12-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-oxo-ETE) and hepoxilin B3 (HxB3) as major eicosanoids, both being elevated in . We also observed that normal epidermis, in a reaction probably catalyzed by 12-lipoxygenase, only synthesize one of the two possible 10-hydroxy epimers of HxB3. We have now extended these previous studies investigating further transformation of HxB3 into trioxilin B3 (TrXB3) and esterification of both into phospholipids. Phospholipids were extracted from normal epidermis and from psoriatic scales. A combination of high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated the occurrence of HxB3 and TrXB3 in the phospholipids of psoriatic lesions. Alkaline- and phospholipase-A2-mediated hydrolysis of the phospholipids yielded similar quantities of both HxB3 and TrXB3 indicating their preference for the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. The thin layer chromatography analysis of the phospholipid classes after incubation of epidermal cells with [14C]-labeled HxB3, TrXB3, 12-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 12-oxo-ETE, or 15-HETE showed that 12-HETE was the most esterified (12-HETE >15-HETE > TrXB3 > 12-oxo-ETE > HxB3). HxB3 and TrXB3 were mainly esterified in phosphatidyl-choline and phosphatidyl-. HxB3 was also enzymatically converted into TrXB3 in vitro. HxB3 epoxide hydrolase-like activity was not observed when boiled tissue was incubated with [14C]-HxB3, this activity being located in the cytosol fraction (100,000 x g supernatant) of fresh tissue. These findings suggest that in vivo some part of HxB3 is transformed into TrXB3 and both compounds are partially incorporated into the phospholipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4398162>[Comparative evaluation of the action of 2 vasodilator drugs.

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was stimulated by isoproterenol and inhibited by propranolol. Isoproterenol stimulation also activated phosphorylase a in mouse skin. In normal epidermis and uninvolved and involved epidermis from psoriatic patients no significant differences were found in the activities of cAMP-dependent kinase and phosphorylase a. In all experiments we observed that the unstimulated activity ratios of phosphorylase a/total phosphorylase were around 20-30%; these values were much lower than those hitherto reported and show a preponderance of phosphorylase b rather than a.

AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease mainly triggered by TH(2)-dependent inflammatory processes. The specific goal of the present study was to investigate whether altered HPA axis and SAM system responsiveness to stress can also be found in TH(1)-mediated inflammatory conditions. Patients with  (PSO; n=23), a TH(1)-mediated inflammatory (autoimmune) skin disease and healthy controls (n=25) were exposed to a standardized laboratory stressor (TSST) which mainly consists of a free speech and a mental arithmetic task in front of an audience. To investigate HPA axis and SAM system responsiveness, cortisol, ACTH, and catecholamines were determined before and after the stress test. In addition, cortisol levels after awakening and cortisol levels during the day (short diurnal profile) were determined. In order to test feedback sensitivity of the HPA axis, a dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test (0.5 mg) was performed. Analysis of cortisol and ACTH levels after the stress test yielded no significant differences between PSO subjects and controls indicating no altered HPA axis function in this patient group. Further, no between-group differences were found in cortisol levels after awakening or during the day (short diurnal profile). Additionally, no difference between PSO and healthy subjects in the feedback sensitivity of the system could be found (DEX test). However, PSO patients showed elevated epinephrine (F(3,102)=4.7; p<0.005) and norepinephrine (F(3,135)=2.7; p<0.05) levels in response to the stress test when compared to the controls.

Clear-cut separations of type I and type II isozymes, which were of about equal amounts, could be obtained only when the ischemia effect was avoided by in vivo freezing of skin and homogenization for less than 10 s. Intradermal injections of epinephrine caused dose-dependent activation of type I isozyme, but not of type II. Injections of other skin adenylate cyclase stimulators such as histamine, adenosine, and prostaglandin E2 elevated the local cyclic AMP levels to not more than 5 pmol/mg protein and also stimulated only the type I isozyme. Incubation of keratome-sliced pig skin under various conditions caused both activation by dissociation and inactivation by reassociation of the subunits, which appeared to be dependent on the cyclic AMP content. Epinephrine added to the incubation medium led to complete activation of both type I and type II isozymes (the intraepidermal cyclic AMP contents ranged from 20-50 pmol/mg protein). The isozymes of normal skin and involved skin of psoriatics showed identical peaks of type I and type II isozymes of equal amounts.

In the normal controls, mitogen responsiveness was inhibited by all three pharmacological agents by about 30 to 50%. In cells from psoriatic patients, the response in the presence of histamine was inhibited (as in the controls), but isoprenaline caused no inhibition, and theophylline paradoxically increased the mitogenic responses.

The mean amounts of PAF recovered from lesional and uninvolved psoriatic skin (n = 13) and from healthy skin (n = 14) were not significantly different (range 0.05-2.14 pmol/sample).

Cytochemical studies on psoriatic epidermis with various inhibitory and stimulatory substances showed reduced activities of ATPase and phosphomonoesterase, and a lack of sensitivity of adenyl cyclase to specific stimulators such as isoproterenol and glucagon. Since no differences of basal adenyl cyclase activity were observed between normal and psoriatic human skin without stimulation, it seems likely that in  a latent defect of adenyl cyclase may exist, resulting in a deficient response of this enzyme to regulatory agents.

While the evidence for arachidonate metabolites, especially 12-HETE and the leukotrienes, as major mediators of skin inflammation is persuasive, we wish to draw attention to the potential importance of leukotrienes and prostaglandins as modulators of PAF and IL-1 activity. Phospholipase A2 emerges as a key enzyme in relation to the three above-mentioned mediator classes of human skin. Activation of phospholipase A2 leads to synthesis of both eicosanoids and PAF. Leukotriene products in addition to being pro-inflammatory per se also enhance IL-1 formation whilst cyclo-oxygenase products inhibit IL-1. Prostaglandin E2 also potentiates the actions of PAF. In this scheme it appears improbable that selective inhibition of one component (e.g. a PAF antagonist) or one enzyme (e.g. a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) would do more than create an imbalance in this closely integrated network of mediators which might not necessarily be beneficial. On the other hand phospholipase A2 inhibitors including lipocortin would seem to have a greater chance of clinical usefulness because of the central role this enzyme appears to play in the formation or modulation of all these classes of mediator.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/869575>Electron microscopic cytochemical demonstration of adenyl cyclase activity in psoriatic epidermis.</a></h2><p>Isoproterenol and sodium fluoride stimulated adenyl cyclase activity was detected in epidermal tissue from 2 patients with untreated  by an electron microscopic cytochemical technique.

Modern therapeutic approaches are still not satisfactory and shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure remain the great challenge in intensive care medicine. However, the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or  also represents an unresolved problem. Many factors contribute to the complex course of inflammatory reactions. Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the inflammatory response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of interleukins and lipid-mediators are released and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. Arachidonic acid (AA), the mother substance of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids in the course of inflammatory activation and is metabolised to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Various strategies have been evaluated to control the excessive production of lipid mediators on different levels of biochemical pathways, such as inhibition of phospholipase A2, the trigger enzyme for release of AA, blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and the development of receptor antagonists against platelet activating factor and leukotrienes. Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so. Encouraging results have been obtained by dietary supplementation with long chain omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for enzymatic metabolism inducing the production of less inflammatory and chemotactic derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/957869>Polyamines and platelet aggregation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16287551>Severe anaphylactic reaction during the second infusion of infliximab in a patient with psoriatic arthritis.</a></h2><p>A 33-yer-old woman with no history of atopy, diagnosed of psoriatic arthritis, received 200 mg I.V. infliximab, with previous oral administration of loratadine and betamethasone, that was well tolerated.

Keratinocytes then produce mediators that recruit and activate immune cells and amplify the inflammatory response. These pathophysiological tissue changes are caused by altered gene expression and the proliferation and maturation of dermal and epidermal cells. We recently demonstrated that the glycosidated phospholipid Ino-C2-PAF down-regulates a plethora of gene products associated with innate and acquired immune responses and inflammation in the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line. To further evaluate the influence of Ino-C2-PAF we established an in vitro 2D-model of epidermal inflammation. The induction of inflammation and the impact of Ino-C2-PAF were assessed in this system using a genome-wide microarray analysis. In addition, the expression of selected genes was validated using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Treatment of the keratinocytes with a mix of proinflammatory cytokines resulted in transcriptional effects on a variety of genes involved in cutaneous inflammation and immunity, while additional treatment with Ino-C2-PAF counteracted the induction of many of these genes. Remarkably, Ino-C2-PAF suppressed the expression of a group of targets that are implicated in antigen processing and presentation, including MHC molecules. Thus, it is conceivable that Ino-C2-PAF possess therapeutic potential for inflammatory skin disorders, such as  and allergic contact dermatitis.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Both the histamine concentration and release are increased in lesional skin but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. One hypothesis is that neuropeptides transmitted from thin sensory cutaneous nerves continuously stimulate mast cell release of histamine. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining if topical anaesthesia of these nerves inhibits histamine release in psoriatic skin. The concentration of histamine was measured in microdialysates obtained from lesional and non-lesional skin before and during topical anaesthesia. Concomitantly skin blood flow was measured with scanning laser Doppler (perfusion) and/or 133Xe clearance (flow) techniques in the microdialysis area. The histamine concentrations (mean +/- SEM) were 34 +/- 4 (n = 21), 14 +/- 1.5 (n = 18) (P < 0. 001) and 2.8 +/- 1 nmol/L (n = 10) in lesional and non-lesional skin and plasma, respectively. After anaesthesia of the microdialysis areas the histamine concentration in psoriatic skin increased to 44 +/- 4 nmol/L (n = 19, P < 0.05), but remained unaltered in uninvolved skin. In anaesthetized lesional skin the perfusion decreased from 3.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 V and blood flow decreased from 14 +/- 5 to 9 +/- 1 mL/min per 100 g (P < 0.001, n = 10). The calculated release of dermal histamine in involved skin (198 +/- 30 pmol/min per 100 g, n = 10) remained unchanged after local anaesthesia. The results indicate that neurogenic activation of mast cells is of minor importance for continuous histamine release in psoriatic skin and that the vasodilatation in the psoriatic plaque is not mediated by histamine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6319501>Monocyte function is normal in quiescent .</a></h2><p>We report an investigation of peripheral blood monocytes from untreated patients with mild, quiescent .

WEB2086 also induced PAFR down-regulation which could be blocked by PKC inhibitors and by DN PKCbeta. WEB2086-induced down-regulation was dynamin-dependent but arrestin-independent. Unlike PAF, WEB2086-stimulated intracellular trafficking of PAFR was independent of Rab5. Specific inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and of proteasomes were both effective in reducing WEB2086-induced PAFR down-regulation, indicating the importance of receptor targeting to both lysosomes and proteasomes in long-term cell desensitization to WEB2086. These results indicate that although both agonists and inverse agonists induce receptor PAFR down-regulation, this may be accomplished through different signal transduction and trafficking pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6252939>Cyclic AMP is decreased in mononuclear leukocytes from  patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/228694>Studies on the plasma membrane of normal and psoriatic keratinocytes. 2.

Lesions were evaluated clinically, and tissue biopsies were excised and analyzed by one-dimensional 1H MR spectroscopy. Relative levels were calculated for nine tissue metabolites. Subsequently, relative amounts of epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissue were scored by histopathological evaluation of HES stained sections.Seven out of 10 patients experienced at least 40% reduction in clinical score after corticosteroid treatment. Tissue biopsies from psoriatic skin contained lower levels of the metabolites myo-inositol and glucose, and higher levels of choline and taurine compared to uninvolved skin. In corticosteroid treated psoriatic skin, tissue levels of glucose, myo-inositol, GPC and glycine were increased, whereas choline was reduced, in patients with good therapeutic effect. These tissue levels are becoming more similar to metabolite levels in uninvolved skin.This MR method demonstrates that metabolism in psoriatic skin becomes similar to that of uninvolved skin after effective corticosteroid treatment.

However, the mechanisms by which stress could modulate immune responses in vivo are poorly understood. In this study, we report that application of a psychological stress before immunization exerts an adjuvant effect on dendritic cell (DC), resulting in increased primary and memory Ag-specific T cell immune responses. Acute stress dramatically enhanced the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to haptens, which is mediated by CD8(+) CTLs. This effect was due to increased migration of skin DCs, resulting in augmented CD8(+) T cell priming in draining lymph nodes and enhanced recruitment of CD8(+) T cell effectors in the skin upon challenge. This adjuvant effect of stress was mediated by norepinephrine (NE), but not corticosteroids, as demonstrated by normalization of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and DC migratory properties following selective depletion of NE. These results suggest that release of NE by sympathetic nerve termini during a psychological stress exerts an adjuvant effect on DC by promoting enhanced migration to lymph nodes, resulting in increased Ag-specific T cell responses.

PUVA-induced immune suppression and/or apoptosis are thought to be responsible for the therapeutic action. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PUVA acts are not well understood. We have previously identified platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid mediator, as a crucial substance triggering ultraviolet B radiation-induced immune suppression. In this study, we used PAF receptor knockout mice, a selective PAF receptor antagonist, a COX-2 inhibitor (presumably blocking downstream effects of PAF), and PAF-like molecules to test the role of PAF receptor binding in PUVA treatment. We found that activation of the PAF pathway is crucial for PUVA-induced immune suppression (as measured by suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity to Candida albicans) and that it plays a role in skin inflammation and apoptosis. Downstream of PAF, interleukin-10 was involved in PUVA-induced immune suppression but not inflammation. Better understanding of PUVA's mechanisms may offer the opportunity to dissect the therapeutic from the detrimental (ie, carcinogenic) effects and/or to develop new drugs (eg, using the PAF pathway) that act like PUVA but have fewer side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6204675>Novel in vivo models of human skin pathophysiology.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4070523>Stress and : psychoendocrine and metabolic reactions in psoriatic patients during standardized stressor exposure.</a></h2><p>Psychoendocrine and metabolic reactions during standardized stressor exposure (color-word conflict test and forced mental arithmetics) were studied in ten psoriatic and ten matched healthy subjects. During resting conditions, the groups were similar with regard to psychologic and biochemical variables, except for plasma glucose, which was slightly elevated in the psoriatic group. During stressor exposure, the psoriatic group reported significantly higher strain levels. Blood pressure, pulse rate, plasma glucose, and urinary adrenaline excretion increased in both groups during exposure, with more pronounced increases of the latter two in the psoriatic group. Serum cortisol, prolactin, progesterone and urinary cortisol decreased in both groups during stressor exposure. The decrease in serum cortisol was more pronounced in the psoriatic group. Thus, no psychoendocrine differences were found between the healthy and psoriatic subjects during resting conditions. In contrast, during a standardized stressor exposure, psoriatic subjects reported higher levels of strain, which was accompanied by higher levels of urinary adrenaline and lower levels of plasma cortisol. These results fit the hypothesis that psoriatic patients perceive certain challenging situations as more stressful than do nonpsoriatic controls, and react accordingly in their differential psychoendocrine reaction pattern.

The accumulation of radioactive cyclic AMP was measured as an index of adenyl cyclase activity. The data showed that both the ability to incorporate [3H] into ATP and adenyl cyclase activity were significantly lower in psoriatic plaques than in uninvolved skin of the psoriatic patients, or in normal skin of control subjects. The response of adenyl cyclase to the stimulation of 3.3 muM adrenaline was less than five fold in psoriatic plaques as compared to twelve to thirty-two fold in the uninvolved skin. The response to the stimulation of prostaglandin E2 (5 mug/ml) showed no significant difference between the plaque and normal skin. The adenyl cyclase activity in uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients appeared normal. Propranolol (10 muM) blocked the stimulatory effect of adrenaline but not that of PGE2 in normal skin. These results suggest that the adenyl cyclase system of the skin has different regulatory sites for adrenaline and PGE2 and that the enzyme is defective in the epidermis of the psoriatic plaque, especially at the adrenaline regulatory site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1438589>Effects of Calaguala and an active principle, adenosine, on platelet activating factor.</a></h2><p>Calaguala, an extract from the fern Polypodium decumanum, has been used to treat  and related immunological disorders. In an effort to explain Calaguala's medicinal effects the inhibitory activity of the extract in two platelet activating factor (PAF) related models has been investigated. In the first model, PAF was used to induce release of the proteolytic enzyme elastase in human neutrophils. Calaguala inhibited this effect with an IC50 of 0.1 mg/ml. The known PAF antagonist ginkgolide BN 52021 was used as a positive control and had an IC50 of 0.034 mg/ml. In the second model the inhibition of biosynthesis of PAF in neutrophils using lyso-PAF and labeled acetyl-CoA was studied. Also in this assay Calaguala showed a dose-dependent activity, the IC50 being 0.2 mg/ml. Since recent findings have indicated that PAF might be involved in the pathogenesis of , it is possible that the activity shown by Calaguala in these PAF assays may contribute to the clinical efficacy of the extract. The PAF induced exocytosis assay was further used to guide the fractionation of the crude extract. From the acetone supernatant the nucleoside adenosine was isolated as an active principle. Pure adenosine dose-dependently inhibited the exocytosis induced by PAF (IC50 = 0.024 micrograms/ml) but was inactive in the biosynthesis assay.

Different molecular species of PAF were identified by their negative ion mass spectra and by their elution time from the capillary column. All the molecular species had high abdundance (greater than 90%) of the molecular anion. 1-0-Hexadecyl-2-acetyl-GPC (16:0) was the major PAF species representing 51% of the total PAF. 17:0 and 18:1 were the next abundant species representing 15 and 16%, respectively. Several minor PAF molecular species were also present. The amount of each PAF molecular species was quantitated from 1-0-hexadecyl-2-2H3 acetyl-GPC used as the internal standard.

Both agents activated adenylate cyclase of the uninvolved and involved resulting in the accumulation of cyclic AMP. Without a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, these responses were biphasic and the maximal accumulation was observed in 5 min. With the PDE inhibitor both responses were markedly potentiated and high levels of cyclic AMP were observed for more than 20 min. The response to histamine by the involved skin was much greater than that by the uninvolved. The degree of the response to adenosine was approximately equal. In accordance with our previous work, the response to epinephrine by the involved skin was much less than that by the uninvolved. Thus adenylate cyclases of involved skin from psoriatic patients exhibit a markedly diminished response to epinephrine while at the same time exhibiting a markedly enhanced response to histamine. This precludes the possibility that the unresponsiveness to epinephrine can be due to a generalized inability of the epidermal psoriatic plaque cell to make a functioning cell membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1244187>[Lack of beta-adrenergic stimulation of membrane bound adenyl cyclase in  as compared to normal epidermis (author's transl)].</a></h2><p>Glucagon and beta-adrenergic compounds such as 1-isoproterenol stimulated the low activity of an ATP-utilizing enzyme located on the cell membranes of normal keratinocytes.

The stimulation by prostaglandins E1 and E2 is not additive; hence they probably act on the same site. Concentrations of prostaglandin E above 3X10(-7) M are effective in causing stimulation.

Leukocyte infiltration can be induced by chemotactic factors such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and paf-acether (formerly known as platelet-activating factor) that can be generated within inflammatory lesions. Vascular permeability and increase in blood flow are also affected by LTB4 and paf-acether, as well as by several other substances, including histamine and prostaglandins. Derived from arachidonic acid via the 5 lipo-oxygenase pathway, LTB4 is one of the most potent leukocyte chemotactic substances known. Intradermal injections of LTB4 induce dermal neutrophil infiltration in animal models and in humans. Topical application of LTB4 to human skin induces intraepidermal micro-abscesses containing numerous intact neutrophils. LTB4 has been found to be increased in psoriatic lesions, but its synthesis by epidermal cells remains undecided. Like other leukotrienes, LTB4 can stimulate DNA synthesis in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. However, receptors for LTC4 but not for LTB4 have been found on human keratinocytes in culture. Paf-acether is an ether-linked phospholipid identified as 1-O-alkyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and is considered to be one of the most potent mediators of acute allergic and inflammatory reactions. For instance, intradermal injection of paf-acether induces inflammatory events such as neutrophil infiltration and increase in vascular permeability.

Here, we show that changes in lipid profiles that reflect atherosclerotic disease led to activation of skin murine dendritic cells (DCs) locally, promoted dermal inflammation, and induced lymph node hypertrophy. Paradoxically, DC migration to lymph nodes was impaired, suppressing immunologic priming. Impaired migration resulted from inhibitory signals generated by platelet-activating factor (PAF) or oxidized LDL that acts as a PAF mimetic. Normal DC migration and priming was restored by HDL or HDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase (PAFAH), which mediates inactivation of PAF and oxidized LDL. Thus, atherosclerotic changes can sequester activated DCs in the periphery where they may aggravate local inflammation even as they poorly carry out functions that require their migration to lymph nodes.
