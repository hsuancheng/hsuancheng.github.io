PPARγ activators are known to have potent antihyperglycemic activity and are used to treat insulin resistance associated with . Therefore, many natural and synthetic agonists of PPARγ are used in the treatment of glucose disorders. In the present study, we found that 13-oxo-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic  (13-oxo-OTA),   derivative, is present in the extract of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia). We also found that 13-oxo-OTA activated PPARγ and induced the mRNA expression of PPARγ target genes in adipocytes, thereby promoting differentiation. Furthermore, 13-oxo-OTA induced secretion of adiponectin and stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that 13-oxo-OTA induces adipogenesis through PPARγ activation and to present 13-oxo-OTA as a valuable food-derived compound that may be applied in the management of glucose metabolism disorders.</p><p>Keyword: lipogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ-linolenic  for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty , and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to  and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
