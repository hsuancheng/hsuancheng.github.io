<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28735573>Chemoattractant activity of tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane for Brugia pahangi infective third-stage larvae.</a></h2><p> (UCA) is known as a major chemoattractant for Strongyloides stercoralis infective third-stage larvae (L3). Since Brugia pahangi is a skin-penetrating parasitic nematode similar to S. stercoralis, UCA was expected to be a chemoattractant for B. pahangi L3. Thus, the chemoattractant activity of UCA for B. pahangi L3 was assessed. The chemotactic responses of B. pahangi L3 to UCA or acetic  (CH3COOH) dissolved in amine solutions were assessed using an agar-plate assay. A test solution of 200 mm UCA dissolved in aqueous 270 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) significantly attracted B. pahangi L3 compared with deionized water (DW), while neither a solution of 200 mm UCA dissolved in aqueous 230 mm ammonia (NH3) nor 290 mm triethylamine (TEA) significantly attracted L3. Similarly, a test solution of 200 mm CH3COOH dissolved with 200 mm Tris significantly attracted L3, but neither a test solution of 200 mm CH3COOH plus 200 mm NH3 nor 200 mm TEA attracted L3. Furthermore, L3 were significantly attracted to 200 mm Tris alone, compared with DW, but avoided 200 mm NH3 and 200 mm TEA. Moreover, the chemoattractant activity of Tris for L3 was observed even at a low concentration of 25 mm, and it was observed in a mild alkaline condition but not in an acidic condition. The present study reveals that Tris is a potential chemoattractant for B. pahangi L3 while UCA is not. This finding will contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of skin-penetrating infection of filarial L3.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6124274>Transient-state kinetic analysis of urocanase.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/235308>Catalytic and thermodynamic properties of the urocanate hydratase reaction.</a></h2><p>Urocanate hydratase (4-imidazolone-5-propionate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.49) isolated from Pseudomonas putida contains covalently bound alpha-ketobutyrate as its cofactor. In the process of examining the mechanism by which alpha-ketobutyrate serves in this capacity, various thermodynamic parameters and temperature effects on urocanate hydratase activity were determined. As the equilibrium constant at 15 degrees C for imidazooone propionate formation from urocanate is approximately 69, regardless of whether  or chemically synthesized imidazolone propionate is used as the initial substrate, it is concluded that the reaction is freely reversible. DeltaG degrees ', deltaH degrees ' and deltaS degrees ' were --2.5 kcal/mole, +5.2 kcal/mole and +26 cal/deg mole, respectively. Measurement of first-order reaction rates at various temperatures, in order to calculate the Arrhenius activation energy, showed a sharp break in the Arrhenius plot at 29 degrees C. Further examination of this phenomenon by determining s20,w values of urocanate hydratase as a function of temperature revealed a dramatic change at 31 degrees C. Since the enzyme in both experiments reverts to its original state when the temperature is lowered back below the transition point, it is proposed that urocanate hydratase undergoes a reversible conformational change or partial dissociation which affects its catalytic properties in the range of 29--31 degrees C.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6109547>Substrate-mediated inactivation of urocanase from Pseudomonas putida. Evidence for an essential sulfhydryl group.</a></h2><p>Incubation of urocanase from Pseudomonas putida with either its substrate, , or product, 4'(5')-imidazolone-5'(4')-propionic , resulted in an oxygen-dependent inhibition of enzyme activity. Coincident with the inactivation was the stoichiometric incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]urocanate into the protein. NAD+ which is required for activity or urocanase was not directly involved in the inactivation process. The inactivation of urocanase was irreversible, could be partially blocked by the competitive inhibitor imidazolepropionate, and involved the modification of a single active-site thiol. The inhibition resulted from oxidative decomposition of 4'(5')-imidazolone-5'(4')-propionate but was not due to the formation of the major degradative product, 4-ketoglutaramate, since this compound was not an irreversible inactivator of urocanase although it did produce some inhibition at high concentrations. A mechanism is presented in which a reactive imine intermediate in the decomposition scheme is subject to nucleophilic attack by an active-site thiol, thereby generating a covalent enzyme--thioaminal adduct. These results emphasize the importance of a catalytic center sulfhydryl group for urocanase activity.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207344>Lactobacillus sp. improved  and metabolite profiles of aging rats.</a></h2><p>Aging is closely associated with altered gut function and composition, in which elderly were reported with reduced gut  diversity and increased incidence of age-related diseases. Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut  and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids metabolism such as , citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05). Our study highlights the potential of probiotics as an anti-aging therapy through healthy gut modulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
