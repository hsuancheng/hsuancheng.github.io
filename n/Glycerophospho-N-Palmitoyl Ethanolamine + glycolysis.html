High carbohydrate oxidation rates are necessary for take-off, but, to spare the limited carbohydrate reserves, long-distance flyers, such as locusts, soon switch to lipid as the main fuel. We demonstrate that before a flight, locust muscles are metabolically poised for take-off by the release of octopamine from central modulatory dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, which increases the levels of the potent glycolytic activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in flight muscle. Because DUM neurons innervating the flight muscles are active during rest but selectively inhibited during flight, they stimulate carbohydrate catabolism during take-off but tend to decrease muscle  during prolonged flight. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A is necessary but not sufficient for signal transduction, suggesting parallel control via a calcium-dependent pathway. Locust flight is the first reported instance of a direct and specific involvement of neuronal activity in the control of muscle  in working muscle during exercise.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11827690>Catecholamine stimulation is associated with impaired myocardial O(2) utilization in heart failure.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of alpha,beta(1) and beta(2) adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation on coronary hemodynamics, myocardial oxygen consumption (M(v)O(2)) and metabolic substrate preference in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).We studied 19 conscious, instrumented dogs with pacing-induced DCM. We evaluated systemic, coronary hemodynamics and M(v)O(2) in response to norepinephrine (NOR, 0.05-0.4 microg/kg per min), dobutamine (DOB, 1-10 microg/kg per min), phenylephrine (PHE, 1-5 microg/kg per min) and isoproterenol (ISO, 0.05-0.4 microg/kg per min) alone or in the presence of metoprolol (ISO+MET). Experiments were conducted in control state and in advanced DCM, 4-5 weeks after the initiation of pacing.Contractile responses (LV dP/dt) to catecholamines were desensitized and accompanied by a parallel decrease in heart rate-adjusted myocardial O(2) consumption (M(v)O(2/beat)), when alpha(PHE) or beta(1) (DOB) or both alpha/beta(1) (NOR) AR were stimulated in DCM. This was due to impaired transmyocardial (Ao-Cs) O(2) extraction rather than limitations in CBF responses. There was an associated shift in myocardial metabolism, evidenced by an increased preference for glycolytic substrates (Respiratory Quotient) following administration of any of these three adrenergic agonists in DCM. Combined beta(1)/beta(2) stimulation with ISO or beta(2)-AR stimulation (ISO+MET) in DCM resulted in greater M(v)O(2/beat), [(Ao-Cs) O(2)] extraction, and decreases in myocardial RQ consistent with a shift toward oxidation of FFA.The impairment in contractile responses to dobutamine and norepinephrine in DCM is associated with impaired myocardial O(2) extraction, and a shift toward a preference for . A different myocardial metabolic pattern suggestive of increased oxidation of FFA with increased myocardial O(2) extraction was observed in the presence of combined beta(1)/beta(2) stimulation with isoproterenol or beta(2) stimulation (ISO+MET). These data suggest that beta(2)-AR stimulation in DCM shifts substrate preference toward FFA oxidation associated with greater M(v)O(2) requirements. These findings identify a putative metabolic effect of beta(2) -AR in DCM that may be deleterious.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19273755>Fat metabolism during exercise in patients with mitochondrial disease.</a></h2><p>To determine whether patients with defects of the respiratory chain have metabolic adaptations that promote a preferential use of fats or carbohydrates, similar to what is observed in metabolic myopathies affecting  or fat oxidation.Causation and case-control study. Fat metabolism was determined by means of indirect calorimetry and stable isotope technique in patients and healthy subjects. Patients carried various types and loads (mean [SE], 72% [5%]) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in skeletal muscle. All subjects exercised at the same absolute workload (mean [SE], 65 [10] W), corresponding to 72% (in patients) and 30% (in healthy subjects) of maximum oxygen consumption.Neuromuscular research unit.Ten patients with mtDNA mutations and 10 sex-matched healthy subjects.Fat turnover, plasma concentrations of palmitate and total free fatty acids, glucose mobilization, and total carbohydrate oxidation.Fat turnover and plasma concentrations of palmitate and total free fatty acids were similar in patients and healthy subjects at rest and during exercise. In line with the higher relative workload of the patients, glucose mobilization and total carbohydrate oxidation were higher in the patients compared with the healthy subjects.During moderate-intensity exercise, the balance between fat and carbohydrate use in patients with mtDNA mutations matches that seen in healthy subjects, indicating that manipulating dietary fat and carbohydrate content is not a feasible therapeutic option to improve exercise intolerance in these disorders.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230921>Effect of acute and short-term oral salbutamol treatments on maximal power output in non-asthmatic athletes.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to clarify the controversial effects of acute and short-term salbutamol (SAL) intake on sprint performance in healthy athletes. Based on the results of previous studies, an anabolic effect for the short-term treatment and increased  in both treatments were hypothesized. Eight male recreational athletes completed force-velocity exercise tests after administration of placebo (gelatin), acute oral SAL (6 mg) or short-term oral SAL (12 mg day(-1) for 3 weeks), using a double-blind and randomized protocol. A friction-loaded cycle ergometer fitted with a strain gauge, and an incremental encoder ensured accurate measurement of the force-velocity relationship during sprints. Mechanical data were averaged during each pedal downstroke. Compared with placebo after both acute and 3 weeks of continuous treatment, the force-velocity relationship shifted to the right with power output gains of 14 and 8% (p < 0.001), respectively. This effect was less marked for 3 weeks of continuous treatment compared with acute administration (p < 0.001), suggesting a down-regulation in adrenoceptors. Our first hypothesis thus seems rejected. Significantly higher end-of-exercise and recovery blood lactate concentrations were found under SAL compared with placebo (p < 0.001), supporting our second hypothesis. In conclusion, these data indicate that oral administration of SAL is an effective ergogenic aid for sprint exercise in non-asthmatic athletes. Moreover, an acute treatment seems to be more effective than 3 weeks of continuous treatment.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19826179>Isoproterenol induces in vivo functional and metabolic abnormalities: similar to those found in the infarcted rat heart.</a></h2><p>Chronic isoproterenol administration produces a rapid, highly reproducible rodent model of cardiac hypertrophy. Yet, despite widespread use of this model, the effects of isoproterenol on in vivo cardiac function and substrate metabolism are unknown. Isoproterenol (5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) was infused for 7 days in male Wistar rats (n = 22). In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that left ventricular mass increased by 37% and end-diastolic and systolic volumes increased by 33% and 73%, respectively, following isoproterenol infusion. Cardiac function at the base of the left ventricle was normal, but apical ejection fraction decreased from 90% to 31% and apical free wall thickening decreased by 94%, accompanied by increased fibrosis and inflammation. Myocardial palmitate oxidation rates were 25% lower, and citrate synthase and medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activities were reduced by 25% and 29%, respectively, following isoproterenol infusion. Fatty acid transporter protein levels were 11-52% lower and triglyceride concentrations were 55% lower in isoproterenol-infused rat hearts. Basal  and glycogen concentration were not changed, yet insulin stimulated  was decreased by 32%, accompanied by 33% lower insulin stimulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, protein levels in rat hearts following isoproterenol infusion, compared with controls. In conclusion, isoproterenol infusion impaired in vivo cardiac function, induced hypertrophy, and decreased both fatty acid and glucose metabolism, changes similar in direction and magnitude to those found in the rat heart following moderate severity myocardial infarction.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9018496>Lactate and epinephrine during exercise in altitude natives.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that the reported low blood lactate accumulation ([La]) during exercise in altitude-native humans is refractory to hypoxianormoxia transitions by investigating whether acute changes in inspired O2 fraction (FIo2) affect the [La] vs. power output (W) relationship or, alternatively, as reported for lowlanders, whether changes in [La] vs. W on changes in FIo2 are related to changes in blood epinephrine concentration ([Epi]). Altitude natives [n = 8, age 24 +/- 1 (SE) yr, body mass 62 +/- 3 kg, height 167 +/- 2 cm] in La Paz, Bolivia (3,600 m) performed incremental exercise with two legs and one leg in chronic hypoxia and acute normoxia (AN). Submaximal one- and two-leg O2 uptake (Vo2) vs. W relationships were not altered by FIo2. AN increased two-leg peak Vo2 by 10% and peak W by 7%. AN paradoxically decreased one-leg peak Vo2 by 7%, whereas peak W remained the same. The [La] vs. W relationships were similar to those reported in unacclimatized lowlanders. There was a shift to the right on AN, and maximum [La] was reduced by 7 and 8% for one- and two-leg exercises, respectively. [Epi] and [La] were tightly related (mean r = 0.81) independently of FIo2. Thus normoxia attenuated the increment in both [La] and [Epi] as a function of W, whereas the correlation between [La] and [Epi] was unaffected. These data suggest loose linkage of  to oxidative phosphorylation under influence from [Epi]. In conclusion, high-altitude natives appear to be not fundamentally different from lowlanders with regard to the effect of acute changes in FIo2 on [La] during exercise.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200563>An NMR-based metabolomics study of pork from different crossbreeds and relation to sensory perception.</a></h2><p>Meat extracts from five different pig crossbreeds including Duroc/Landrace/Yorkshire (DLY), Iberian/Duroc (ID), Iberian/Duroc/Landrace (ILY), Mangalitza/Duroc (MD), and Mangalitza/Landrace/Yorkshire (MLY) were analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. The results were compared with technological traits and sensory analyses in order to elucidate the potential of NMR-based metabolomics to highlight meat metabolites of importance for technological and sensory attributes of meat. Amino acids including alanine, carnosine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and valine, as well as lactate, inosine monophosphate (IMP), inosine, glycerol and choline-containing compounds were found to be significantly affected by crossbreed. The breed-specific differences in the metabolome were ascribed to differences in ante mortem metabolism, differences in the membrane properties and glycolytic potential of muscle fibres and differences in lipolysis and proteolysis. A high content of carnosine in the meat was associated with a low value of many sensory attributes related to meat flavor/taste, while IMP and inosine were in general not correlated with sensory attributes related to meat flavor/taste.© 2013.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17620480>Detection of human immunodeficiency virus induced inflammation and oxidative stress in lenticular nuclei with magnetic resonance spectroscopy despite antiretroviral therapy.</a></h2><p>Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine (Cr) are affected in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and neurocognitive impairment. However, these metabolic markers are often normalized in affected central nervous system regions, such as the lenticular nuclei, after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).To examine whether lactate (Lac), a marker of inflammation and anaerobic , and lipid, an indicator of cell membrane turnover resulting from oxidative stress, could serve as surrogate biomarkers within the lenticular nuclei of HIV-positive patients with different degrees of neurocognitive impairment.Three-tesla 2-dimensional-chemical shift imaging magnetic resonance spectroscopy at echo times of 30 milliseconds and 135 milliseconds was performed in voxels overlapping the lenticular nuclei of seronegative controls and a spectrum of HIV-positive patients (neurocognitively normal, mildly impaired, or moderately to severely impaired).University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.Ten seronegative controls and 45 HIV-positive patients with different degrees of neurocognitive impairment (15 neurocognitively normal patients, 12 mildly impaired patients, and 18 moderately to severely impaired patients).In vivo 2-dimensional-chemical shift imaging magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of N-acetyl aspartate:Cr, choline:Cr, Lac:Cr, and (lipid + Lac):Cr ratios among the various groups. In addition, the effect of the degree of HAART central nervous system penetration (high vs low) on these ratios was studied.No significant lenticular nuclei atrophy was detected with volumes similar across all of the groups. Both N-acetyl aspartate:Cr and choline:Cr ratios were similar across all of the groups at either echo time. In contrast, the Lac:Cr ratio was significantly greater in HIV-positive patients with moderate to severe impairment compared with seronegative controls. The (lipid + Lac):Cr ratio was significantly elevated within each HIV-positive subgroup compared with seronegative controls. Within HIV-positive patients receiving HAART, the degree of central nervous system penetration (high vs low) did not affect metabolic ratios.As seen with 2-dimensional-chemical shift imaging magnetic resonance spectroscopy, HIV induces inflammation and oxidative stress in HIV-positive patients despite HAART. Lipid and Lac are more sensitive inflammatory biomarkers that may be used to differentiate HIV-positive subgroups. However, no significant difference in efficacy, as measured by metabolic ratios, exists for high- vs low-central nervous system-penetrating HAART.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7977816>Epinephrine increases ATP production in hearts by preferentially increasing glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Although epinephrine is widely used clinically, its effect on myocardial energy substrate preference in the intact heart has yet to be clearly defined. We determined the effects of epinephrine on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in isolated working rat hearts perfused with 11 mM glucose, 0.4 mM palmitate, and 100 muU/ml insulin at an 11.5-mmHg left atrial preload and a 60-mmHg aortic afterload.  and glucose oxidation were measured in hearts perfused with [5-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose, whereas fatty acid oxidation was measured in hearts perfused with [1-14C]palmitate. Addition of 1 microM epinephrine resulted in a 53% increase in the heart rate-developed pressure product.  increased dramatically following addition of epinephrine (a 272% increase), as did glucose oxidation (a 410% increase). In contrast, fatty acid oxidation increased by only 10%. Epinephrine treatment did not increase the amount of oxygen required to produce an equivalent amount of ATP; however, epinephrine did increase the uncoupling between  and glucose oxidation in these fatty acid-perfused hearts, resulting in a significant increase in H+ production from glucose metabolism. Overall ATP production in epinephrine-treated hearts increased 59%. The contribution of glucose ( and glucose oxidation) to ATP production increased from 13 to 36%, which was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in the contribution of fatty acid oxidation to ATP production from 83 to 63%. The increase in glucose oxidation was accompanied by a significant increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in the active form. We conclude that the increase in ATP required for contractile function following epinephrine treatment occurs through a preferential increase in glucose use.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29681049>Detection of the Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases: Is It Feasible to Compare 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and 99mTc-methyl Diphosphonate Bone Scintigraphy?</a></h2><p>The objective was to compare the efficacy of 99mTc-MDP-BS, 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 18F-FCH-PET/CT in detecting bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.56 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer underwent 99mTc-methylendiphosphonates bone scintigraphy (99mTc-MDP-BS) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) or fluorine-18-fluorocholine PET/CT (18F-FCH-PET/CT) within six weeks.

It is within the context of these communities that disease occurs. We have previously reported whole cell proteomics analyses of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii in early-stage communities with each other and with F. nucleatum, modeled using 18 h pellets. Here, we report the adaptation of F. nucleatum to the same experimental conditions as measured by differential protein expression. About 1210 F. nucleatum proteins were detected in single species F. nucleatum control samples, 1192 in communities with P. gingivalis, 1224 with S. gordonii, and 1135 with all three species. Quantitative comparisons among the proteomes revealed important changes in all mixed samples with distinct responses to P. gingivalis or S. gordonii alone and in combination. The results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using DAVID (Database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery). Extensive changes were detected in energy metabolism. All multispecies comparisons showed reductions in amino acid fermentation and a shift toward butanoate as a metabolic byproduct, although the two organism model community with S. gordonii showed increases in alanine, threonine, methionine, and cysteine pathways, and in the three species samples there were increases in lysine and methionine. The communities with P. gingivalis or all three organisms showed reduced  proteins, but F. nucleatum paired with S. gordonii displayed increased /gluconeogenesis proteins. The S. gordonii containing two organism model also showed increases in the  pathway while the three species sample showed decreases relative to the F. nucleatum single organism control. All of the nascent model communities displayed reduced translation, lipopolysaccharide, and cell wall biosynthesis, DNA replication and DNA repair.© 2014 The Authors.

These effects can be counteracted with β(2)-agonists possibly via activation of the Na(+)-K(+) pumps. Anoxia induces loss of force; however, it is not known whether β(2)-agonists affect force and ion homeostasis in anoxic muscles. In the present study isolated rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles exposed to anoxia showed a considerable loss of force, which was markedly reduced by the β(2)-agonists salbutamol (10(-6) M) and terbutaline (10(-6) M). Intermittent stimulation (15-30 min) clearly increased loss of force during anoxia and reduced force recovery during reoxygenation. The β(2)-agonists salbutamol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and salmeterol (10(-6) M) improved force development during anoxia (25%) and force recovery during reoxygenation (55-262%). The effects of salbutamol on force recovery were prevented by blocking the Na(+)-K(+) pumps with ouabain or by blocking  with 2-deoxyglucose. Dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) or theophylline (1 mM) also improved force recovery remarkably. In anoxic muscles, salbutamol decreased intracellular Na(+) and increased (86)Rb uptake and K(+) content, indicating stimulation of the Na(+)-K(+) pumps. In fatigued muscles salbutamol induced recovery of excitability. Thus β(2)-agonists reduce the anoxia-induced loss of force, leading to partial force recovery. These data strongly suggest that this effect is mediated by cAMP stimulation of the Na(+)-K(+) pumps and that it is not related to recovery of energy status (PCr, ATP, lactate).</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592089>Effects of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) fruit extracts and p-synephrine on metabolic fluxes in the rat liver.</a></h2><p>The fruit extracts of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) are traditionally used as weight-loss products and as appetite supressants. An important fruit component is p-synephrine, which is structurally similar to the adrenergic agents. Weight-loss and adrenergic actions are always related to metabolic changes and this work was designed to investigate a possible action of the C. aurantium extract on liver metabolism. The isolated perfused rat liver was used to measure catabolic and anabolic pathways, including oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure. The C. aurantium extract and p-synephrine increased glycogenolysis, , oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure. These changes were partly sensitive to α- and β-adrenergic antagonists. p-Synephrine (200 μM) produced an increase in glucose output that was only 15% smaller than the increment caused by the extract containing 196 μM p-synephrine. At low concentrations the C. aurantium extract tended to increase gluconeogenesis, but at high concentrations it was inhibitory, opposite to what happened with p-synephrine. The action of the C. aurantium extract on liver metabolism is similar to the well known actions of adrenergic agents and can be partly attributed to its content in p-synephrine.

On the first occasion, subjects were infused with saline throughout exercise (Con). One week later, after determination of plasma epinephrine levels in Con, subjects performed the second trial (Epi) with an epinephrine infusion, which resulted in a twofold higher (P < 0.01) plasma epinephrine concentration in Epi compared with Con.

The toxicological effects of trivalent inorganic arsenic on laboratory mouse Mus musculus after oral administration (3 mg/kg body weight/day) were investigated along 12 days, using a metabolomic approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry to polar and lipophilic extracts from different organs and fluids (liver, kidney, and plasma). Positive and negative acquisition modes (ESI(+)/ESI(-)) were used throughout the experiments. The most significant endogenous metabolites affected by exposure were traced by partial least square-discriminant analysis and confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and gas chromatography coupled to MS. In this work, the toxic effect of arsenic has been related with important metabolic pathways, such as energy metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, Krebs cycle), amino acids metabolism, choline metabolism, methionine cycle, and degradation of membrane phospholipids (cell apoptosis).

Rabbit hearts perfused at 33 degrees C and paced at 2.5-2.8 Hz were used for membrane potential recordings with microelectrodes. Catecholamine depletion was induced with reserpine treatment. The effects of nadolol (10 microM), the stilbenedisulfonic acid derivatives DIDS (10 microM) and SITS (1 mM), and diphenylamine-2 carboxylate (DPC, 100 microM) on action potential characteristics were determined at different times during hypoxia. The effect of chloride transport blockers on the outward currents induced by 200 nM carbonyl cyanide (CCCP) or by 1 microM isoproterenol in isolated cells was also tested. In control hearts, action potential duration (APD) at 25 and 95% repolarization decreased by 50 +/- 9% and 32 +/- 7% respectively after 5 min of hypoxia. This effect was fully antagonized by reserpine pretreatment, by respiratory acidosis, and by nadolol when present from the beginning of hypoxia. None of these agents affected action potential characteristics in normoxia and nadolol had no effect when added after 15 min of hypoxia. Lowering the chloride concentration to 17.5 mM reproduced the effects of nadolol and reserpine. DIDS and SITS lengthened APD in normoxia and attenuated the early APD shortening in hypoxia. DPC had no effect in normoxia but fully counteracted APD shortening produced by isoproterenol or early hypoxia. In isolated cells, DIDS did not affect the glibenclamide sensitive outward current induced by CCCP and DPC blocked the isoproterenol induced current.

Adrenergic hormones are known to stimulate metabolism in adult mammals and are essential for embryonic development, but relatively little is known about their effects on metabolism in the embryonic heart. Here, we show that embryos lacking adrenergic stimulation have ∼10-fold less cardiac ATP compared with littermate controls. Despite this deficit in steady-state ATP, neither the rates of ATP formation nor degradation was affected in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts, suggesting that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms were fully operational. We thus hypothesized that adrenergic hormones stimulate metabolism of glucose to provide chemical substrates for oxidation in mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we employed a metabolomics-based approach using LC/MS. Our results showed glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were not significantly altered, but several downstream metabolites in both glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways were significantly lower compared with controls. Furthermore, we identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as key enzymes in those respective metabolic pathways whose activity was significantly ( < 0.05) and substantially (80 and 40%, respectively) lower in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. Addition of pyruvate and to a lesser extent ribose led to significant recovery of steady-state ATP concentrations. These results demonstrate that without adrenergic stimulation, glucose metabolism in the embryonic heart is severely impaired in multiple pathways, ultimately leading to insufficient metabolic substrate availability for successful transition to aerobic respiration needed for survival.© 2018 Peoples et al.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8635676>Inhibition of muscle glycogen synthase activity and non-oxidative glucose disposal during hypoglycaemia in normal man.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of muscle glycogen synthase activity in the reduction of glucose uptake during hypoglycaemia. Six healthy young men were examined twice; during 120 min of hyperinsulinaemic (1.5 mU.kg-1. min-1) euglycaemia followed by: 1)240 min of graded hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose nadir 2.8 mmol/l) or 2) 240 min of euglycaemia. At 350-360 min a muscle biopsy was taken and indirect calorimetry was performed at 210-240 and 330-350 min. Hypoglycaemia was associated with markedly increased levels of adrenaline, growth hormone and glucagon and also with less hyperinsulinaemia. During hypoglycaemia the fractional velocity for glycogen synthase was markedly reduced; from 29.8 +/- 2.3 to 6.4 +/- 0.9%, p < 0.05. Total glucose disposal was decreased during hypoglycaemia (5.58 +/- 0.55 vs 11.01 +/- 0.75 mg.kg-1. min-1 (euglycaemia); p < 0.05); this was primarily due to a reduction of non-oxidative glucose disposal (2.43 +/- 0.41 vs 7.15 +/- 0.7 mg.kg-1 .min-1 (euglycaemia); p < 0.05), whereas oxidative glucose disposal was only suppressed to a minor degree. In conclusion hypoglycaemia virtually abolishes the effect of insulin on muscle glycogen synthase activity.

To understand the diversity among stages and species, we reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GeMMs) of metabolism for five life cycle stages and five species of Plasmodium spanning the blood, transmission, and mosquito stages. The stage-specific models of Plasmodium falciparum uncovered stage-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism and predicted potential targets that could affect several life cycle stages. The species-specific models further highlight differences between experimental animal models and the human-infecting species. Comparisons between human- and rodent-infecting species revealed differences in thiamine (vitamin B1), choline, and pantothenate (vitamin B5) metabolism. Thus, we show that genome-scale analysis of multiple stages and species of Plasmodium can prioritize potential drug targets that could be both anti-malarials and transmission blocking agents, in addition to guiding translation from non-human experimental disease models.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23186323>Metabolic effects of three different inotropic strategies in the newborn piglet myocardium.</a></h2><p>Neonates undergoing congenital heart surgery frequently need post-operative inotropic support. Knowledge about the effect of inotropes on myocardial metabolism in the newborn heart is limited, and the choice of inotropic therapy is based mainly on evidence from studies in adults. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of three inotropic strategies on the myocardial metabolism in a neonatal pig model.Newborn piglets were randomised to intravenous infusions with: adrenaline and milrinone; dopamine and milrinone; dobutamine in haemodynamically equivalent doses; or isotonic saline, through 3 h. Microdialysis catheters were inserted in the myocardium of the left and right ventricle, and concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, and glucose were measured in the microdialysate. In myocardial biopsies, tissue lactate and intracellular glycogen concentrations were determined, and arterial blood samples were analysed for lactate and glucose.No statistically significant differences were observed in haemodynamics between the three interventions. Metabolic variables demonstrated a consistent increase in lactate concentration in blood, myocardial dialysate, and biopsies in milrinone-adrenaline-treated animals. The lactate concentration remained stable in all other groups in all samples. The myocardial lactate/pyruvate ratio did not increase and was not significantly different between groups.Milrinone and adrenaline induced significantly higher lactate levels in neonatal piglets. The increase was not caused by myocardial ischaemia, but rather due to a beta-stimulation-induced .© 2012 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27457520>Estrogen Receptor α Promotes Breast Cancer by Reprogramming Choline Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a key regulator of breast growth and breast cancer development. Here, we report how ERα impacts these processes by reprogramming metabolism in malignant breast cells. We employed an integrated approach, combining genome-wide mapping of chromatin-bound ERα with estrogen-induced transcript and metabolic profiling, to demonstrate that ERα reprograms metabolism upon estrogen stimulation, including changes in aerobic , nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, and choline (Cho) metabolism. Cho phosphotransferase CHPT1, identified as a direct ERα-regulated gene, was required for estrogen-induced effects on Cho metabolism, including increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis. CHPT1 silencing inhibited anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation, also suppressing early-stage metastasis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model.

In resting muscle, inorganic phosphate (P(i)) and total cellular phosphate concentration are regulated by Na(+)-dependent P(i) transport. Insulin was shown to stimulate P(i) uptake in G-8 muscle cells, in isolated rat soleus muscle, and in human muscle in vivo under conditions of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The relationship between plasma P(i) and intracellular muscle P(i) was examined in a group of patients with elevated plasma P(i) resulting from renal failure. The total creatine content of muscle cells is controlled by an active creatine uptake in which beta 2-receptor stimulation and the activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase play a significant role. Recovery after exercise is entirely oxidative; the rate of ATP synthesis is largely controlled by ADP, the concentration of which is determined by the creatine kinase equilibrium that includes the concentration of H+. At the onset of aerobic dynamic exercise, ATP is maintained largely by , producing lactic acid, and by phosphocreatine breakdown. After vasodilation, ATP synthesis becomes predominantly oxidative.

We explored the role of glycogen as a fuel source for neuromodulation using the noradrenergic stimulation of glia in a computational model of the neural-glial-vasculature ensemble (NGV). The detection of norepinephrine (NE) by the astrocyte and the coupled cAMP signal are rapid and largely insensitive to the distance of the locus coeruleus projection release sites from the glia, implying a diminished impact for volume transmission in high affinity receptor transduction systems. Glucosyl-conjugated units liberated from glial glycogen by NE-elicited cAMP second messenger transduction winds sequentially through the glycolytic cascade, generating robust increases in NADH and ATP before pyruvate is finally transformed into lactate. This astrocytic lactate is rapidly exported by monocarboxylate transporters to the associated neuron, demonstrating that the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle activated by glycogenolysis is a likely fuel source for neuromodulation and enhanced neural activity. Altogether, the energy supply for both astrocytes and neurons can be supplied rapidly by glycogenolysis upon neuromodulatory stimulus.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11953517>Hypoglycemia unawareness.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16385046>Identification of Listeria monocytogenes genes contributing to intracellular replication by expression profiling and mutant screening.</a></h2><p>A successful transition of Listeria monocytogenes from the extracellular to the intracellular environment requires a precise adaptation response to conditions encountered in the host milieu. Although many key steps in the intracellular lifestyle of this gram-positive pathogen are well characterized, our knowledge about the factors required for cytosolic proliferation is still rather limited. We used DNA microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR analyses to investigate the transcriptional profile of intracellular L. monocytogenes following epithelial cell infection. Approximately 19% of the genes were differentially expressed by at least 1.6-fold relative to their level of transcription when grown in brain heart infusion medium, including genes encoding transporter proteins essential for the uptake of carbon and nitrogen sources, factors involved in anabolic pathways, stress proteins, transcriptional regulators, and proteins of unknown function. To validate the biological relevance of the intracellular gene expression profile, a random mutant library of L. monocytogenes was constructed by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and screened for intracellular-growth-deficient strains. By interfacing the results of both approaches, we provide evidence that L. monocytogenes can use alternative carbon sources like phosphorylated glucose and glycerol and nitrogen sources like  during replication in epithelial cells and that the pentose phosphate cycle, but not , is the predominant pathway of sugar metabolism in the host environment.

The evolutionary driving force for maintaining such deleterious mutations in the black population is unknown. Recognizing that vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors mediate cold-induced vasoconstriction and that temperature maintenance is a primary thrust of cellular metabolism, we postulated that vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors contribute significantly to metabolic heat generation in homeotherms such as humans. Using aerobic lactate production as an indicator of thermogenesis, we measured metabolic heat production in HT29 cells that expressed the gene encoding human vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, increased net lactate efflux from 226 +/- 20 to 280 +/- 20 nmol/min (mean +/- SE) (P = .06). Clonidine, a more specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, increased lactate efflux from 110 +/- 6 to 156 +/- 8 nmol/min (P < .01). Similarly, in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose (5.5 mmol/L), insulin increased lactate production from 123 +/- 6 to 175 +/- 10 nmol/min (P < .01). Because differences in aerobic  may also explain the heat intolerance and abnormal fuel homeostasis found in genetically hypertensive rats, we also measured lactate production in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Vascular smooth muscle cells from SHRSP had significantly greater lactate efflux compared with cells from normotensive WKY (296 +/- 4 versus 172 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). These differences were not due to abnormalities in glucose uptake, as lactate efflux was greater in SHRSP cells compared with WKY cells when dextrose was replaced with equimolar concentrations of fructose (230 +/- 6 versus 138 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). alpha 2-Adrenergic agonists increase lactate efflux in HT29 cells, and abnormalities in vascular smooth muscle lactate metabolism in genetically hypertensive rats is independent of altered glucose uptake.

Isoproterenol increased blood flow and lipolysis at both sites and those effects could be returned to baseline values by the addition of Ang II in aSAT but not fSAT.In conclusion, our data indicate that in addition to its well-known vasoconstricting effect, Ang II inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, whereby femoral fat depots seem to be more sensitive to this effect than abdominal depots.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10409142>Stimulation of both aerobic  and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in skeletal muscle by epinephrine or amylin.</a></h2><p>Epinephrine and amylin stimulate glycogenolysis, , and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in skeletal muscle.

Gyk deficiency causes various phenotypic changes ranging from asymptomatic hyperglycerolemia to a severe metabolic disorder with growth and psychomotor retardation. To better understand the potential role of Gyk in tissue lipid metabolism, we determined phospholipid (PL), cholesterol (Chol), and triacylglycerol (TG) mass in a number of tissues from mice lacking Gyk. We report a tissue-dependent response to Gyk gene deletion. Tissues with elevated total PL mass (brain, kidney, muscle) were characterized by the increased mass of  glycerophospholipids (EtnGpl), choline glycerophospholipids, and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). In heart, lipid changes were characterized by a reduction in total PL, including decreased EtnGpl, phosphatidylinositol, and PtdSer mass and decreased TG and FFA mass.

Closely related tumors of extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia are classified as extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Almost all pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas produce catecholamines. The concentrations of catecholamines in pheochromocytoma tissues are enormous, potentially creating a volcano that can erupt at any time. Significant eruptions result in catecholamine storms called "attacks" or "spells". Acute catecholamine crisis can strike unexpectedly, leaving traumatic memories of acute medical disaster that champions any intensive care unit. A very well-defined genotype-biochemical phenotype relationship exists, guiding proper and cost-effective genetic testing of patients with these tumors. Currently, the production of norepinephrine and epinephrine is optimally assessed by the measurement of their O-methylated metabolites, normetanephrine or metanephrine, respectively. Dopamine is a minor component, but some paragangliomas produce only this catecholamine or this together with norepinephrine. Methoxytyramine, the O-methylated metabolite of dopamine, is the best biochemical marker of these tumors. In those patients with equivocal biochemical results, a modified clonidine suppression test coupled with the measurement of plasma normetanephrine has recently been introduced. In addition to differences in catecholamine enzyme expression, the presence of either constitutive or regulated secretory pathways contributes further to the very unique mutation-dependent catecholamine production and release, resulting in various clinical presentations. Oxidative stress results from a significant imbalance between levels of prooxidants, generated during oxidative phosphorylation, and antioxidants. The gradual accumulation of prooxidants due to metabolic oxidative stress results in proto-oncogene activation, tumor suppressor gene inactivation, DNA damage, and genomic instability. Since the mitochondria serves as the main source of prooxidants, any mitochondrial impairment leads to severe oxidative stress, a major outcome of which is tumor development. In terms of cancer pathogenesis, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas represent tumors where the oxidative phosphorylation defect due to the mutation of succinate dehydrogenase is the cause, not a consequence, of tumor development. Any succinate dehydrogenase pathogenic mutation results in the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  in the cytoplasm (also called anaerobic  if hypoxia is the main cause of such a shift). This phenomenon, also called the Warburg effect, is well demonstrated by a positive [18F]-fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography scan. Microarray studies, genome-wide association studies, proteomics and protein arrays, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and bioinformatics approaches will remain powerful tools to further uncover the pathogenesis of these tumors and their unique markers, with the ultimate goal to introduce new therapeutic options for those with metastatic or malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Soon oxidative stress will be tightly linked to a multistep cancer process in which the mutation of various genes (perhaps in a logistic way) ultimately results in uncontrolled growth, proliferation, and metastatic potential of practically any cell. Targeting the mTORC, IGF-1, HIF and other pathways, topoisomerases, protein degradation by proteosomes, balancing the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases or even synchronizing the cell cycle before any exposure to any kind of therapy will soon become a reality. Facing such a reality today will favor our chances to "beat" this disease tomorrow.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21236594>Tumor metabolism and perfusion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: pretreatment multimodality imaging with 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and [18F]FDG-PET.</a></h2><p>To correlate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) of nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for assessment of tumor biology.

This study focused on the relationship between apoptosis and alteration of the energetic metabolism pathways of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was induced by angiotensin II (0.1 mumol/L ) and norepinephrine (1 mumol/L), and the cells were cultured under the condition of hypoxia ( 95% N2 and 5% CO2, the O2 partial pressure was regulated at least lower than 5 mmHg ) for 8 h, then were recovered to normal culture environment. Apoptosis was detected with TUNEL. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), the rate of glycose oxidation and , and fatty acid metabolism were detected by liquid scintillation counting. The results are as follows: (1) The activity of active PDH (PDHa) was slightly higher in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes than that in normal cardiomyocytes, but the activity of CPT-1 was significantly lower in hypertrophic cardiomyoctes than that in normal cardiomyocytes.Compared with the hypertrophic cardiomyocytes cultured with normal oxygen concentration, the activities of PDHa and CPT-1 were decreased significantly after hypoxia for 8 h, and the activity of PDHa were decreased further after reoxygenation for 4 h, but the activity of CPT-1 recovered quickly after reoxygenation. (2) The rate of glucose oxidation in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes increased slightly when cultured under normal O2 partial pressure than that in normal cardiac cells. The rate of glucose oxidation reduced (16 +/- 0.9)% and (48 +/- 1.1)% in normal and hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, respectively, after hypoxia. It reduced further in hypertrophic cardiac cells at 4 h of reoxygenation, then recovered gradually. In normal cardiocytes, it recovered quickly after reoxygenation. (3) The rate of  of hypertrophic cardiocytes increased slightly than that of the normal cardiocytes when cultured in the general O(2) environment. Compared with the normal cardiomyocytes, the rate of  of hypertrophic cardiac cells was the same during hypoxia-reoxygenation culture, i.e., the rate of  decreased slightly after hypoxia for 8 h, but increased rapidly and significantly after reoxygenation. (4) The rate of fatty acid oxidation was slightly lower in hypertrophic cardiocytes than that in normal cardiomyocytes. After hypoxia for 8 h, the rate of fatty acid oxidation decreased significantly in normal and hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, there was no difference between normal and hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. But the alterations of fatty acid oxidation after reoxygenation were different between normal and hypertrophic cardiac cells, namely, the fatty acid oxidation of normal cardiomyocytes were activated slowly and slightly, while the rate of fatty acid oxidation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes increased markedly at the early stage of reoxygenation, and increased further at 8 h of reoxygenation. (5) The rate of apoptosis in hypertrophic cardiocytes increased obviously after hypoxia for 8 h, and increased further and markedly at the early stage of reoxygenation, then gradually decreased to normal level. (6) Dicholoroacetate could inhibit apoptosis of hypertrophic cardiocytes through increasing glucose oxidation and inhibiting the activation of  and fatty acid oxidation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. These data demonstrate that apoptosis in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes after hypoxia-reoxygenation is mainly due to the inhibition of glucose oxidation and the activation of glucolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, increasing glucose oxidation may be a new pharmacotherapeutic target to inhibit apoptosis of hypertrophic cardiac cells.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9630635>TNF-induced modulations of phospholipid metabolism in human breast cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a cytokine that is cytocidal for certain tumor cells and induces necrotic and apoptotic forms of cell death. Flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that in human breast cancer cells (MCF7) TNF induces cell cycle arrest in G0+G1/S, accompanied by apoptosis. 31P and 13C NMR spectroscopy was applied to study cellular metabolism of MCF7 cells during TNF-induced signal to apoptosis. Deuterated choline and 2H NMR spectroscopy were utilized to monitor the kinetics of the rate limiting reactions in phosphocholine metabolism. The NMR measurements revealed that immediately after administration of TNF, choline transport was inhibited by 52+/-6%. Later (approximately 15 h), the activity of phosphocholine:cytidine triphosphate cytidylyltransferase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, was enhanced two-fold. These two opposing changes led to a decrease in the level of phosphocholine. Throughout these changes the energetic state of the cells, determined by the level of nucleoside triphosphates and the rate of glucose metabolism via , remained constant. The results indicate that TNF specifically modulates the kinetics of membrane-bound enzymes of the rate determining steps in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, possibly as part of early events involved in apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073425>Molecular targets of the multifunctional iron-chelating drug, M30, in the brains of mouse models of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are now recognized to be multifunctional, whereby a heterogeneous set of reactions acts independently or cooperatively, leading eventually to the demise of neurons. This has led our group to design and synthesize the multifunctional, nontoxic, brain-permeable, iron chelator compound M30 with a range of pharmacological properties. Here, we have characterized the molecular targets of M30 in the brains of animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Effects of M30 on molecular mechanisms associated with neuroprotection in the CNS were investigated-in the high-fat diet (HFD) and ob/ob transgenic mouse models of T2DM, using real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses. Brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and catecholamine levels, and peripheral glucose tolerance were assayed after treatment in vivo.M30 increased cerebral levels of insulin and insulin receptor and phosphorylated-GSK-3β in HFD mice, compared with vehicle-treated HFD mice. In both T2DM mice models, M30 treatment significantly up-regulated cerebral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein levels and induced the expression of several HIF-1 target genes involved in neuroprotection, , neurogenesis, oxidative stress and anti-inflammation. Additionally, M30 inhibited MAO-A and -B activities in the cerebellum. Accordingly, M30 administration significantly reduced brain levels of dopamine metabolites and increased levels of 5-HT and noradrenaline. Glucose tolerance was also improved after M30 treatment in both models of T2DM.In the brain of HFD and ob/ob transgenic mice, M30 exerted a variety of beneficial neuroprotective regulatory effects that may act synergistically to delay or prevent neurodegenerative processes associated with T2DM.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252379>Phenylephrine protects cardiomyocytes from starvation-induced apoptosis by increasing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity.</a></h2><p>Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is known to be a "housekeeping" protein; studies in non-cardiomyocytic cells have shown that GAPDH plays pro-apoptotic role by translocating from cytoplasm to the nucleus or to the mitochondria. However, the cardiovascular roles of GAPDH are unknown. We observed that phenylephrine (PE) (100 µM) protected against serum and glucose starvation -induced apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes as assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. GAPDH  activity was positively correlated with the antiapoptotic action of PE. GAPDH activity inhibition blunted PE-induced protection of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cardiomyocytes. PE-induced Bcl-2 protein increase, Bax mitochondrial decrease and inhibition of cytochrome C release and Caspase 3 activation, as well as ROS production were blunted by GAPDH activity inhibition. Moreover, GAPDH overexpression provided protection against starvation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro and ischemia-induced cardiac infarction in vivo. Inhibition of Akt prevented PE-induced GAPDH activity increase and cardiomyocytes protection. In conclusion, the present study provides the first direct evidence of an antiapoptotic role of GAPDH in PE-induced cardiomyocytes protection; GAPDH activity elevation mainly affects the mitochondria-induced apoptosis.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524832>Hydrogen sulfide improves glucose metabolism and prevents hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to inhibit myocardial hypertrophy in a cell model of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

SCA3 or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is the commonest dominant inherited ataxia disease, with pathological phenotypes apparent with a CAG triplet repeat length of 61-84. In this study a mouse model of SCA3 has been examined which was produced using a human yeast artificial chromosome containing the MJD gene with a CAG triplet expansion of 84 repeats. These mice have previously been shown to possess a mild progressive cerebellar deficit. NMR-based metabolomics/metabonomics in conjunction with multivariate pattern recognition identified a number of metabolic perturbations in SCA3 mice. These changes included a consistent increase in glutamine concentration in tissue extracts of the cerebellum and cerebrum and spectra obtained from intact tissue using magic angle spinning (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, these profiles demonstrated metabolic abnormalities were present in the cerebrum, a region not previously implicated in SCA3. As well as an increase in glutamine both brain regions demonstrated decreases in GABA, choline, phosphocholine and lactate (representing the summation of lactate in vivo, and postmortem  of glucose and glycogen). The metabolic changes are discussed in terms of the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions associated with SCA3.

In whole cell recordings from submerged slices, with electrodes containing only KMeSO4 and N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, and in the presence of kynurenate and bicuculline (to minimize transmitter actions), hypoxia produced the following changes: under current clamp, 36 cells were hyperpolarized by 2.7 +/- 0.5 (SE) mV and their input resistance (Rin) fell by 23 +/- 2.7%; in 30 cells under voltage clamp, membrane current increased by 114 +/- 22.3 pA and input conductance (Gin) by 4.9 +/- 0.9 nS. These effects are much greater than those seen previously with K gluconate whole cell electrodes, but only half those seen with "sharp" electrodes. The hypoxic hyperpolarizations (or outward currents) were not reduced by intracellular ATP (1-5 mM) or bath-applied glyburide (10 microM): therefore they are unlikely to be mediated by conventional ATP-sensitive K channels. On the other hand, their depression by internally applied ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid (1.1 and 11 mM) and especially 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (11-33 mM) indicated a significant involvement of Ca-dependent K (KCa) channels. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (10 microM) reduced hypoxic hyperpolarizations and decreases in Rin (n = 4) (and in another 11 cells corresponding changes in Gin); and comparable but more variable effects were produced by internally applied 3':5'-adenosine cyclic monophosphate (cAMP, 1 mM, n = 6) and bath-applied 8-bromo-cAMP (n = 8). Thus afterhyperpolarization-type KCa channels probably take part in the hypoxic response. A major involvement of G proteins is indicated by the near total suppression of the hypoxic response by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (0. 1-0.3 mM, n = 23) and especially guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (0.3 mM, n = 26), both applied internally. The adenosine antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (10-50 microM) significantly reduced hypoxic hyperpolarizations and outward currents in whole cell recordings (with KMeSO4 electrodes) from submerged slices but not in intracellular recordings (with KCl electrodes) from slices kept at gas/saline interface. In further intracellular recordings, antagonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid-B or serotonin receptors also had no clear effect. In conclusion, these G-protein-dependent hyperpolarizing changes produced in CA1 neurons by hypoxia are probably initiated by Ca2+ release from internal stores stimulated by enhanced  and a variable synergistic action of adenosine.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29026134>MCT1 and MCT4 Expression and Lactate Flux Activity Increase During White and Brown Adipogenesis and Impact Adipocyte Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue takes up glucose and releases lactate, thereby contributing significantly to systemic glucose and lactate homeostasis. This implies the necessity of upregulation of net acid and lactate flux capacity during adipocyte differentiation and function. However, the regulation of lactate- and acid/base transporters in adipocytes is poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adipocyte thermogenesis, browning and differentiation are associated with an upregulation of plasma membrane lactate and acid/base transport capacity that in turn is important for adipocyte metabolism. The mRNA and protein levels of the lactate-H transporter MCT1 and the Na,HCO cotransporter NBCe1 were upregulated in mouse interscapular brown and inguinal white adipose tissue upon cold induction of thermogenesis and browning. MCT1, MCT4, and NBCe1 were furthermore strongly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level upon differentiation of cultured pre-adipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation was accompanied by increased plasma membrane lactate flux capacity, which was reduced by MCT inhibition and by MCT1 knockdown. Finally, in differentiated brown adipocytes,  (assessed as ECAR), and after noradrenergic stimulation also oxidative metabolism (OCR), was decreased by MCT inhibition. We suggest that upregulation of MCT1- and MCT4-mediated lactate flux capacity and NBCe1-mediated HCO/pH homeostasis are important for the physiological function of mature adipocytes.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641546>Targeting Astrocytes for Treating Neurological Disorders: Carbon Monoxide and Noradrenaline-Induced Increase in Lactate.</a></h2><p>There are at least three reasons why brain astrocytes represent a new target for treating neurological disorders. First, although the human neocortex represents over 80% of brain mass, neurons are outnumbered by non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes, a neuroglial cell type. Second, as in neurons, vesicle-based release of transmitters is present in astrocytes, however with much slower kinetics than in neurons. Third, astrocytes contain glycogen, which can be transformed to L-lactate in glycolysis. L-lactate is considered to be a fuel and a signalling molecule involved in cognition and neuroprotection. The mechanisms of neuroprotection are unclear but may be linked to carbon monoxide, a product of the heme oxygenase, an evolutionarily conserved cellular cytoprotectant. Increased levels of local carbon monoxide arising from heme oxygenase activity may increase L-lactate, but direct measurements of cytosolic L-lactate are lacking. A fluorescence resonance  transfer-based nanosensor selective for L-lactate was used to monitor cytosolic levels of L-lactate while cultured astrocytes were exposed to carbon monoxide. The results revealed that in astrocytes exposed to carbon monoxide there is no significant increase in L-lactate, however, when noradrenaline, a potent glycogenolytic agent, is applied, cytosolic levels of Llactate are increased, but strongly attenuated in astrocytes pretreated with carbon monoxide. These first measurements of carbon monoxide-modulated L-lactate levels in astrocytes provide evidence that the L-lactate and heme oxygenase neuroprotective systems may interact. In conclusion, not only the abundance of astrocytes but their signalling capacity using vesicles and metabolites, such as L-lactate, are valid targets for neurological disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27512079>Quantitative Non-canonical Amino Acid Tagging (QuaNCAT) Proteomics Identifies Distinct Patterns of Protein Synthesis Rapidly Induced by Hypertrophic Agents in Cardiomyocytes, Revealing New Aspects of Metabolic Remodeling.</a></h2><p>Cardiomyocytes undergo growth and remodeling in response to specific pathological or physiological conditions. In the former, myocardial growth is a risk factor for cardiac failure and faster protein synthesis is a major factor driving cardiomyocyte growth. Our goal was to quantify the rapid effects of different pro-hypertrophic stimuli on the synthesis of specific proteins in ARVC and to determine whether such effects are caused by alterations on mRNA abundance or the translation of specific mRNAs. Cardiomyocytes have very low rates of protein synthesis, posing a challenging problem in terms of studying changes in the synthesis of specific proteins, which also applies to other nondividing primary cells. To study the rates of accumulation of specific proteins in these cells, we developed an optimized version of the Quantitative Noncanonical Amino acid Tagging LC/MS proteomic method to label and selectively enrich newly synthesized proteins in these primary cells while eliminating the suppressive effects of pre-existing and highly abundant nonisotope-tagged polypeptides. Our data revealed that a classical pathologic (phenylephrine; PE) and the recently identified insulin stimulus that also contributes to the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (insulin), both increased the synthesis of proteins involved in, e.g. , the Krebs cycle and beta-oxidation, and sarcomeric components. However, insulin increased synthesis of many metabolic enzymes to a greater extent than PE. Using a novel validation method, we confirmed that synthesis of selected candidates is indeed up-regulated by PE and insulin. Synthesis of all proteins studied was up-regulated by signaling through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 without changes in their mRNA levels, showing the key importance of translational control in the rapid effects of hypertrophic stimuli. Expression of PKM2 was up-regulated in rat hearts following TAC. This isoform possesses specific regulatory properties, so this finding indicates it may be involved in metabolic remodeling and also serve as a novel candidate biomarker. Levels of translation factor eEF1 also increased during TAC, likely contributing to faster cell mass accumulation. Interestingly those two candidates were not up-regulated in pregnancy or exercise induced CH, indicating PKM2 and eEF1 were pathological CH specific markers. We anticipate that the methodologies described here will be valuable for other researchers studying protein synthesis in primary cells.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196353>Adrenergic metabolic and hemodynamic effects of octopamine in the liver.</a></h2><p>The fruit extracts of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) are traditionally used as weight-loss products and as appetite suppressants. A component of these extracts is octopamine, which is an adrenergic agent. Weight-loss and adrenergic actions are always related to metabolic changes and this work was designed to investigate a possible action of octopamine on liver metabolism. The isolated perfused rat liver was used to measure catabolic and anabolic pathways and hemodynamics. Octopamine increased glycogenolysis, , oxygen uptake, gluconeogenesis and the portal perfusion pressure. Octopamine also accelerated the oxidation of exogenous fatty acids (octanoate and oleate), as revealed by the increase in ¹⁴CO₂ production derived from ¹⁴C labeled precursors. The changes in glycogenolysis, oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure were almost completely abolished by α₁-adrenergic antagonists. The same changes were partly sensitive to the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It can be concluded that octopamine accelerates both catabolic and anabolic processes in the liver via adrenergic stimulation. Acceleration of oxygen uptake under substrate-free perfusion conditions also means acceleration of the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids, which are derived from lipolysis. All these effects are compatible with an overall stimulating effect of octopamine on metabolism, which is compatible with its reported weight-loss effects in experimental animals.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11015305>Influence of beta-adrenoceptor tone on the cardioprotective efficacy of adenosine A(1) receptor activation in isolated working rat hearts.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the role of beta-adrenoceptors in the cardioprotective and metabolic actions of adenosine A(1) receptor stimulation.

We obtained the specimens in the cortex under microwave fixation. Choline and acetate increased during ischemia and gradually decreased during reperfusion period. These two signals seen in 1H MRS are supposed to represent cell membrane components (products) and the increase of these signals after reperfusion seems to be related to the post ischemic reperfusion injury due to the explosive increase of free radicals. Lactate, which is induced by anaerobic , increased during ischemia and promptly disappeared after reperfusion. The treatment of pre-ischemic administration of MCI-186 significantly suppressed increases of choline and acetate. As far as lactate is concerned, post-ischemic administration of this drug significantly reduced its increase at the point of reperfusion.

All cells were superfused with Tyrode's solution containing glucose and pyruvate (to preserve oxidative metabolism), and  was inhibited by iodoacetate (IAA, 100 microM).

Glycogen turnover is extremely rapid in the brain, especially during sudden increased demand when glucose supplies are insufficient. Previous culture studies have reported on the glycogenolytic effect of noradrenaline on 3--4 week-old primary mouse astrocyte cultures. This effect is believed to be mediated by the beta-adrenergic-cAMP signal transduction system. Recent evidence has shown a drop in forebrain glycogen levels at a specific time point during memory formation for a passive avoidance task in the day-old chick. This 'memory-related' glycogenolysis may be initiated by noradrenaline-induced rises in cAMP occurring around this point, but it is unknown whether astrocytic glycogenolysis is is stimulated by noradrenaline in day-old chicks. This question was approached in the present study and it was shown that noradrenaline is capable of stimulating both cAMP formation and glycogen breakdown in chick primary astrocyte cultures at developmental age (10-14 days in culture) comparable to the newborn chick. In contrast, noradrenaline did not have a corresponding glycogenolytic effect on 10-day-old mouse astrocyte cultures (equivalent to the 1-week mouse), although it induced a considerable amount of glycogen breakdown in older cultures (18 and 24-26 days).</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17038442>Sex differences in energy metabolism and performance of teleost cardiac tissue.</a></h2><p>This study examined the effects of different oxygenation levels and substrate availability on cardiac performance, metabolism, and biochemistry in sexually immature male and female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Ventricle strips were electrically paced (0.5 Hz, 14 degrees C) in hyperoxic or hypoxic Ringer solution. Our results demonstrate that 1) males sustain isometric force production (F) longer than females under hyperoxia (P O2 = 640 mmHg) with exogenous glucose present; 2) contractility is not maintained under moderate (P O2 = 130 mmHg) or severe hypoxia (P O2 = 10-20 mmHg) with glucose in either sex; however, following reoxygenation, F is higher in females compared with males; and 3) female tissue has higher lactate levels, net lactate efflux, and lactate dehydrogenase activity than males, whereas males have higher glycogen, citrate synthase, and beta-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, and greater inotropic responses to exogenous glucose and octanoate. No sex differences were detected in responsiveness to epinephrine and inhibitors of glucose transport or activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. We conclude that sex differences exist in rainbow trout cardiac tissue: females appear to prefer  for ATP production, whereas males have a higher capacity for aerobic and lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8948447>The early stimulation of  by epidermal growth factor in isolated rat hepatocytes is secondary to the glycogenolytic effect.</a></h2><p>We have studied the relationship between the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on glycogen metabolism and its effect on , in rat hepatocyte suspensions. Although 10 nM glucagon or 10 microM adrenaline increased glycogen degradation by more than 120%, 10 nM EGF increased glycogenolysis by less than 20% in hepatocytes incubated in glucose-free medium. Both glucagon and adrenaline increased phosphorylase a activity by more than 130%; EGF increased this activity by about 30%. Under basal conditions, 65% of the glucosyl residues were released as free glucose and about 30% ended up as C3 molecules (lactate and pyruvate). Both glucagon and adrenaline decreased the proportion of glucosyl units that rendered  end-products (to 2% for glucagon and 6% for adrenaline) and increased the proportion that ended up as free glucose (to 94% and 88% of the glucosyl residues for glucagon and adrenaline respectively). EGF increased the production of both free glucose and lactate+pyruvate, but the proportion of glucosyl residues that ended up as free glucose or  end-products was unchanged. In glycogen-depleted hepatocytes incubated in the presence of 25 mM glucose, EGF affected neither glycogen deposition nor . EGF increased cytosolic free Ca2+, and neomycin decreased both the Ca2+ signal and the glycogenolytic effect. In conclusion, our results indicate that the effect of EGF on  is secondary to the Ca(2+)-mediated stimulation of glycogenolysis in rat hepatocyte suspensions.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16228932>Metabolic arrest and its regulation in anoxic eel hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Some vertebrates depress overall metabolism in an abrupt and reversible fashion when challenged with anoxia, ensuring stabilization of cellular [ATP] and long-term survival, but little is known about the eliciting stimuli (e.g., change in O2, adenylates) and downstream effectors responsible for metabolic arrest. Accordingly, eel (Anguilla anguilla) hepatocytes were treated with inhibitors of putative components of the oxygen/metabolite-sensing pathway(s) and exposed to anoxia (Po2=0 mmHg). Anoxia in untreated cells caused a remarkable 85-fold decrease in ATP production rate, but cellular ATP levels stabilized following an initial steep drop. Reoxygenation of cells after 4 h of anoxia caused a fast metabolization of accumulated lactate and reestablishment of preanoxic ATP levels. Unlike physiological anoxia, pharmacological inhibition of the electron transport chain in the presence of oxygen caused extensive cellular ATP depletion, though no loss in viability. In contrast, cellular lactate (i.e., ATP) production rate was affected similarly by either treatment, suggesting that anaerobic  is regulated by a stimulus other than oxygen tension per se, whereas the continuous matching of ATP consumption and a rapidly ceasing mitochondrial ATP supply require a physiological relevant change in oxygen tension. Protein kinases, notably kinase C (PKC) and A (PKA), have been proposed as key downstream regulators of stress-induced defense mechanisms, but anoxic cell viability, metabolic rate, and [ATP] were not significantly affected by inhibitors of PKC and PKA. Likewise, inhibition of the upstream PKC-activating enzymes phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) had no effect on recorded parameters. Anoxic cell survival in complex organisms may, in vivo, also depend on stress hormones released from distant oxygen-sensing cells. Accordingly, adrenaline elevated anaerobic energy production but, apparently, also elevated ATP consumption because cellular ATP levels during oxygen deprivation were slightly lowered by adrenergic stimulation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10481233>Effect of temperature on muscle metabolism during submaximal exercise in humans.</a></h2><p>To study the effect of temperature on muscle metabolism during submaximal exercise, six endurance-trained men had one thigh warmed and the other cooled for 40 min prior to exercise using water-perfused cuffs. One cuff was perfused with water at 50-55 degrees C (HL) with the other being perfused with water at 0 degree C (CL). With the cuffs still in position, subjects performed cycling exercise for 20 min at a work load corresponding to 70% VO2,peak (where VO2,peak is peak pulmonary oxygen uptake) in comfortable ambient conditions (20-22 degrees C). Muscle biopsies were obtained prior to and following exercise and forearm venous blood was collected prior to and throughout the exercise period. Muscle temperature (Tmus) was not different prior to treatment, but treatment resulted in a large difference in pre-exercise Tmus (difference = 6.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C; P < 0.01). Although this difference was reduced following exercise; it was nonetheless significant (difference = 0.4 +/- 0.1 degree C; P < 0.05). Intramuscular [ATP] was not affected by either exercise or muscle temperature. [Phosphocreatine] decreased (P < 0.01) and [creatine] increased (P < 0.01) with exercise but were not different when comparing HL with CL. Muscle lactate concentration was not different prior to treatment nor following exercise when comparing HL with CL. Muscle glycogen concentration was not different when comparing the trials before treatment, but the post-exercise value was lower (P < 0.05) in HL compared with CL. Thus, net muscle glycogen use was greater during exercise with heating (208 +/- 23 vs. 118 +/- 22 mmol kg-1 for HL and CL, respectively; P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that muscle glycogen use is augmented by increases in intramuscular temperature despite no differences in high energy phosphagen metabolism being observed when comparing treatments. This suggests that the increase in carbohydrate utilization occurred as a direct effect of an elevated muscle temperature and was not secondary to allosteric activation of enzymes mediated by a reduced ATP content.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11599032>In vivo single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy in brain lesions with ring-like enhancement.</a></h2><p>It is often difficult to make a correct diagnosis of ring-like enhanced lesions on Gd-enhanced MR brain images. To differentiate these lesions using proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS), we retrospectively evaluated the correlation between the 1H-MR spectra and histopathological findings. We evaluated proton MR spectra obtained from the lesions in 45 patients, including metastasis (n = 19), glioblastoma (n = 10), radiation necrosis (n = 7), brain abscess (n = 5), and cerebral infarction (n = 4). The rate of misdiagnosis was found to be lowest at the threshold level of 2.48 for the (choline containing compounds)/(creatine and phosphocreatine) ratio (Cho/Cr) obtained from the whole lesions, which include the enhanced rim and the non-enhanced inner region. That is, the positively predictive values of a Cho/Cr greater than 2.48 for diagnosing metastasis or glioblastoma was 88.9 and 60.0%, respectively, and the positively predictive value of a Cho/Cr less than 2.48 for diagnosing radiation necrosis or cerebral infarction was 71.4 and 100%, respectively. For further differentiating between metastasis and glioblastoma, information about the presence and absence of an N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) peak and lipid- or lactate-dominant peak was found to be useful. In 73.7% of metastasis cases a lipid-dominant peak was observed in the whole lesion without an NAA peak in the inner region, whereas the same pattern was observed in only 10% of the glioblastoma cases. Correlation with the histopathological findings showed that a high Cho signal is suggestive of neoplasm. Lipid signal in the non-enhanced central region was correlated to necrosis. Lactate signals were often observed in glioblastoma, abscess and sometimes metastasis, presumably reflecting the anaerobic  by the living cells in the ring-like enhanced rim. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy may serve as a potential tool to provide useful information of differentiation of ring-like enhanced lesions that cannot be diagnosed correctly using enhanced MR images alone.Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9515045>Metabolic fate of glucose in vascular smooth muscle during contraction induced by norepinephrine.</a></h2><p>The metabolism of glucose in porcine carotid artery was tracked by isotopic methods during sustained isometric contraction induced by 100 microM norepinephrine (NE).

Lactate production accounted for 69%, pyruvate production for 12%, and glucose oxidation accounted for 14% of glycolytic flux.

Norepinephrine stimulated simultaneous glycogenolysis and glycogen synthesis, with net glycogen synthesis prevailing over 90 min of isometric contraction. Furthermore, NE modified the distribution of glucosyl units throughout the glycogen pool. The steady state rate of oxidation of glucose did not increase during NE contraction, even though O2-consumption increased. In contrast, increased glucose oxidation was demonstrable during contraction induced by 80 mm KCl. Furthermore, oxidation of exogenous fatty acid could be demonstrated during NE-induced contraction. Thus, NE exerts multiple effects on glucose and glycogen metabolism in smooth muscle, but it does not stimulate glucose oxidation.Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10749784>Regulation of glucose production in rainbow trout: role of epinephrine in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The rate of hepatic glucose production (R(a) glucose) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was measured in vivo by continuous infusion of [6-(3)H]glucose and in vitro on isolated hepatocytes to examine the role of epinephrine (Epi) in its regulation. By elevating Epi concentration and/or blocking beta-adrenoreceptors with propranolol (Prop), our goals were to investigate the mechanism for Epi-induced hyperglycemia to determine the possible role played by basal Epi concentration in maintaining resting R(a) glucose and to assess indirect effects of Epi in the intact animal. In vivo infusion of Epi caused hyperglycemia (3.75 +/- 0.16 to 8.75 +/- 0.54 mM) and a twofold increase in R(a) glucose (6.57 +/- 0.79 to 13.30 +/- 1.78 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1), n = 7), whereas Prop infusion decreased R(a) from 7.65 +/- 0.92 to 4.10 +/- 0.56 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) (n = 10). Isolated hepatocytes increased glucose production when treated with Epi, and this response was abolished in the presence of Prop. We conclude that Epi-induced trout hyperglycemia is entirely caused by an increase in R(a) glucose, because the decrease in the rate of glucose disappearance normally seen in mammals does not occur in trout. Basal circulating levels of Epi are involved in maintaining resting R(a) glucose. Epi stimulates in vitro glucose production in a dose-dependent manner, and its effects are mainly mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors. Isolated trout hepatocytes produce glucose at one-half the basal rate measured in vivo, even when diet, temperature, and body size are standardized, and basal circulating Epi is responsible for part of this discrepancy. The relative increase in R(a) glucose after Epi stimulation is similar in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that indirect in vivo effects of Epi, such as changes in hepatic blood flow or in other circulating hormones, do not play an important role in the regulation of glucose production in trout.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10881056>Time sequence of changes in the responsiveness of glycogen breakdown to adrenergic agonists in perfused liver of rats with insulin-induced hypoglycemia.</a></h2><p>The time-course changes of the responsiveness of glycogen breakdown to alpha- and ss-adrenergic agonists during insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) were investigated.

The infusions of cyanide, glucagons, and isoproterenol did not change the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. However, glycogen catabolism was decreased during the infusions of glucagon and isoproterenol in IIH rats, being more intense with isoproterenol (p < 0.05), than glucagon.

Both vanadate and PAO are documented inhibitors of protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatases. The relationship between the inhibition of 'inhibitory' PTPase and 'stimulatory' PTPase has been studied here in primary rat adipocytes. Low concentrations of PAO (IC50 = 0.6-2.0 microM) blocked the stimulating effects of insulin, vanadate and pervanadate on hexose uptake and glucose metabolism. Inhibition of isoproterenol-mediating lipolysis by vanadate and insulin was not blocked by PAO. The activating effects of okadaic acid on hexose uptake and glucose metabolism, which occur at points downstream to tyrosine phosphorylation, were also not blocked by PAO. Subsequent studies suggested that the PAO-sensitive PTPase comprises a minute fraction of the total adipocytic PTPase activity. To identify its location we applied procedures involving fractionations and activation of non-receptor adipocytic protein tyrosine kinase by PAO and vanadate in cell free assays. We found that the 'inhibitory' PTPase is exclusively associated with the membrane fraction whereas the 'stimulatory' PTPases are present in both the cytosolic and plasma membrane compartments. We next searched for markers, possibly associated with PAO-dependent desensitization and found that several proteins became phosphorylated on tyrosine moieties in the supernatant of PAO but not in vanadate pretreated adipocytes. In summary, we propose the presence of a minute, plasma membrane associated PTPase in primary rat adipocytes, inhibition of which arrests the activation of glucose metabolism. In contrast, inhibition of all the other cellular adipose PTPases, ultimately activates rather than inhibits these same bioeffects.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15513952>Epinephrine induces tissue perfusion deficit in porcine endotoxin shock: evaluation by regional CO(2) content gradients and lactate-to-pyruvate ratios.</a></h2><p>Epinephrine is widely used as a vasoconstrictor or inotrope in shock, although it may typically induce or augment lactic acidosis. Ongoing debate addresses the question of whether hyperlactatemia per se is a sign of tissue perfusion deficit or aerobic . We wanted to test the hypothesis that epinephrine has selective detrimental effects on visceral perfusion and metabolism. We performed rigorous regional venous blood gas analyses as well as intraperitoneal microdialysis. We used a mathematical model to calculate regional arteriovenous CO(2) content gradients and estimated the magnitude of the Haldane effect in a porcine model of prolonged hypotensive shock induced by endotoxin infusion (mean arterial blood pressure < 60 mmHg). Subsequently, vasopressors (epinephrine or norepinephrine) were administered and adjusted to maintain systemic mean arterial pressure > 70 mmHg for 4 h. Epinephrine caused systemic hyperlactatemia and acidosis. Importantly, both systemic and regional venous lactate-to-pyruvate ratios increased. Epinephrine was associated with decreasing portal blood flow despite apparently maintained total splanchnic blood flow. Epinephrine increased gastric venous-to-arterial Pco(2) gradients and CO(2) content gradients with decreasing magnitude of the Haldane effect, and the regional gastric respiratory quotient remained higher after epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine infusion. In addition, epinephrine induced intraperitoneal lactate and glycerol release. We did not observe these adverse hemodynamic or metabolic changes related to norepinephrine with the same arterial pressure goal. We conclude that high CO(2) content gradients with decreasing magnitude of the Haldane effect pinpoint the most pronounced perfusion deficiency to the gastric wall when epinephrine, as opposed to norepinephrine, is used in experimental endotoxin shock.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8871301>[Humoral and metabolic changes in cardiogenic shock].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8584073>[Spectroscopic imaging of the brain.

It has been suggested that endogenous fatty acid synthesis is either needed to support the growth of rapidly dividing cells, or to maintain elevated  (the Warburg effect) that is characteristic of cancer cells. Here, we investigate both hypotheses. First, we compared utilization of fatty acids synthesized endogenously from (14)C-labeled acetate to those supplied exogenously as (14)C-labeled palmitate in the culture medium in human breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). We found that cancer cells do not produce fatty acids that are different from those derived from exogenous palmitate, that these fatty acids are esterified to the same lipid and phospholipid classes in the same proportions, and that their distribution within neutral lipids is not different from untransformed cells. These results suggest that endogenously synthesized fatty acids do not fulfill a specific function in cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells excrete endogenously synthesized fatty acids, suggesting that they are produced in excess of requirements. We next investigated whether lipogenic activity is involved in the maintenance of high glycolytic activity by culturing both cancer and non-transformed cells under anoxic conditions. Although anoxia increased  2-3 fold, we observed no concomitant increase in lipogenesis. Our results indicate that breast cancer cells do not have a specific qualitative or quantitative requirement for endogenously synthesized fatty acids and that increased de novo lipogenesis is not required to sustain elevations in glycolytic activity induced by anoxia in these cells.© 2013 The Authors.

Alterations in metabolic pathways are inextricably linked to GC progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We performed NMR-based metabolomic analysis of sera derived from a rat model of gastric carcinogenesis, revealed significantly altered metabolic pathways correlated with the progression of gastric carcinogenesis. Rats were histologically classified into four pathological groups (gastritis, GS; low-grade gastric dysplasia, LGD; high-grade gastric dysplasia, HGD; GC) and the normal control group (CON). The metabolic profiles of the five groups were clearly distinguished from each other. Furthermore, significant inter-metabolite correlations were extracted and used to reconstruct perturbed metabolic networks associated with the four pathological stages compared with the normal stage. Then, significantly altered metabolic pathways were identified by pathway analysis. Our results showed that oxidative stress-related metabolic pathways, choline phosphorylation and fatty acid degradation were continually disturbed during gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, amino acid metabolism was perturbed dramatically in gastric dysplasia and GC. The GC stage showed more changed metabolite levels and more altered metabolic pathways. Two activated pathways (; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism) substantially contributed to the metabolic alterations in GC. These results lay the basis for addressing the molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis and extend our understanding of GC progression.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8002553>High physiological levels of epinephrine do not enhance muscle glycogenolysis during tetanic stimulation.</a></h2><p>This study examined whether high physiological concentrations of epinephrine (EPI) would enhance muscle glycogenolysis during intense muscular contractions.

Changes of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor (alpha 1-AR) and beta 1-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) in 90-day tail-suspended rats was investigated by the method of radioligand binding assay and application of Scatchard's method. The results showed significantly decreased quantity of specific binding of 125I-BE[2-beta-(4-hydroxy-3-[125I]indophenyl)-ethylaminomethyltetralone] to alpha 1-AR present in membrane derived from ventricular myocardium of the suspended animals, despite the affinity of the alpha 1-AR to 125I-Be was unchanged. But neither the quantity nor the affinity of beta-AR binding to 125I-Pindolol was significantly altered. In addition, the spontaneously beating rate of isolated right atria from tail-suspended animals showed little change in sensitivity and reactivity to the stimulations of graded phenylephrine (alpha-agonist, measured in the presence of beta-antagonist propranolol) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist), compared with the control rats. There were also no obvious differences of the effects of the isoproterenol on the contractility of isolated left ventricular papillary muscles between the two groups.

Formoterol, a highly selective β2-adrenoceptor therapeutic drug, gives potential anabolic responses in the context of skeletal muscles and was widely confirmed to possess anti-cachexia effects. However, the possible metabolic pathways and the metabolite changes that initiate and maintain these anabolic responses remain poorly understood. In the present study, a (1)H NMR-metabonomics model was established to investigate the metabolic features of cancer cachexia and the contribution of formoterol to serum metabolites in a mouse model bearing CT26 carcinoma cells. Among the metabolic processes found in serum, the ones associated with cancer are  and lipid lipolysis. However, the citrate cycle and amino acid metabolism are the major metabolic characteristics of cachexia. Furthermore, formoterol stimulated skeletal muscle growth, increased the body weight and altered the metabolic profile.

Accordingly, two different doses of noradrenaline, producing increases in brain NA levels comparable to those occurring in several physiological processes in nature, were selected. In a subsequent set of three different experiments, fish were intracerebroventricularly injected with 1 microL 100 g(-1) body weight of Cortland saline alone (control) or containing NA (5 nmol NA and 10 nmol NA); after 30 min, brain and plasma samples were taken to assess changes in parameters of energy metabolism due to NA treatment. The results obtained clearly show dose-dependent changes in NA-treated fish in several parameters, including decreased glycogen and ATP levels, increased lactate and pyruvate levels, decreased fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity, and increased pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities. Altogether, the present experiments show for the first time in a teleost fish evidence supporting that increased noradrenaline levels in the brain elicit metabolic changes in the brain (enhanced glycogenolysis and ), resulting in an increased energy demand. These metabolic changes may be related to those occurring under several physiological conditions in nature such as hypoxia, in which increased energy demand and increased noradrenaline levels occur in the brain simultaneously.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16988112>Glyceroneogenesis is reduced and glucose uptake is increased in adipose tissue from cafeteria diet-fed rats independently of tissue sympathetic innervation.</a></h2><p>The pathways of glycerol-3-P (G3P) generation were examined in retroperitoneal (RETRO) and epididymal (EPI) adipose tissues from rats fed a cafeteria diet for 3 wk. The cafeteria diet induced marked increases in body fat mass and in the plasma levels of insulin and triacylglycerol (TAG). RETRO and EPI from cafeteria diet-fed rats had increased rates of norepinephrine turnover (143 and 60%, respectively) and of de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis (58 and 98%), compared with controls fed a balanced commercial diet. Cafeteria diet feeding induced marked increases in RETRO and EPI in vivo rates of glucose uptake (52 and 51%, respectively), used to evaluate G3P generation via , as well as in glycerokinase activity (119 and 36%) and TAG-glycerol synthesis from glycerol (56 and 71%, respectively). In contrast, there was a marked reduction of glyceroneogenesis in RETRO and EPI from cafeteria diet-fed rats, which was evidenced by the significant decreases of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) activity (48 and 36%) and TAG-glycerol synthesis from pyruvate (45 and 56%, respectively). Denervation of RETRO from cafeteria diet-fed rats reduced the activity of glycerokinase by 50%, but did not affect glucose uptake or PEPCK-C activity and TAG-glycerol synthesis from pyruvate by the tissue. The data show that glyceroneogenesis can also be inhibited to adjust the supply of G3P to the existing rates of FA esterification and TAG synthesis and suggest that this adjustment is made by reciprocal changes in the generation of G3P from glucose via  and from glyceroneogenesis, independently from G3P production by glycerokinase.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16226229>Idazoxan activates rat forebrain glycogen phosphorylase in vivo: a histochemical study.</a></h2><p>In vitro experiments show norepinephrine activates glycogen phosphorylase and glycogenolysis in forebrain glia. The present study used idazoxan (5 mg/kg) to elevate NE in vivo and examined patterns of active (aGP) and total (tGP) glycogen phosphorylase reactivity in selected neocortical, hippocampal, diencephalic, and striatal sites using a histochemical method. In somatosensory neocortex, aGP reactivity was highest in Layer 4 with consistent reactivity in the barrel fields in vehicle-treated brains. In the hippocampus, the stratum lacunosum moleculare was highly reactive, while cell layers were least reactive. The dentate gyrus and CA3 were more reactive for aGP than CA1. In the diencephalon, the medial habenula was most reactive followed by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. In the striatum, globus pallidus was most reactive. Reactivity patterns for tGP were similar to those for aGP, but more intense. The neocortex had the highest overall reactivity for tGP. An estimate of the percentage of aGP relative to tGP suggested the regions sampled had similar levels of median basal activation (approximately 65%). Idazoxan increased aGP reactivity in all regions of the neocortex assessed (layers 3-6 of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and the barrel fields). The neuropil layers, but not the cell layers, of hippocampus were more reactive following idazoxan treatment. Idazoxan also increased aGP reactivity in the laterodorsal, paraventricular, and reticular nuclei of the thalamus. The largest idazoxan-induced changes, as an estimated percentage of tGP, occurred in the hippocampus (approximately 16% for stratum lacunosum moleculare and for CA1 stratum oriens). Increases ranged from approximately 3 to 6% in neocortex and were less than 3% in the diencephalic and striatal areas. These effects of idazoxan are consistent with a role for norepinephrine in activating forebrain glycogenolyis in vivo and supporting increased brain metabolism. They contrast with earlier evidence showing that idazoxan reduces 2-deoxyglucose uptake in these brain areas. Idazoxan, and norepinephrine, may preferentially recruit glycolytic over oxidative metabolism in the rat forebrain.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28910549>Upregulation of α-enolase protects cardiomyocytes from phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy.</a></h2><p>Cardiac hypertrophy often refers to the abnormal growth of heart muscle through a variety of factors. The mechanisms of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy have been extensively investigated using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with phenylephrine. α-Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme with "multifunctional jobs" beyond its catalytic activity. Its possible contribution to cardiac dysfunction remains to be determined. The present study aimed to investigate the change of α-enolase during cardiac hypertrophy and explore its role in this pathological process. We revealed that mRNA and protein levels of α-enolase were significantly upregulated in hypertrophic rat heart induced by abdominal aortic constriction and in phenylephrine-treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, knockdown of α-enolase by RNA interference in cardiomyocytes mimicked the hypertrophic responses and aggravated phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy without reducing the total glycolytic activity of enolase. In addition, knockdown of α-enolase led to an increase of GATA4 expression in the normal and phenylephrine-treated cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that the elevation of α-enolase during cardiac hypertrophy is compensatory. It exerts a catalytic independent role in protecting cardiomyocytes against pathological hypertrophy.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7808255>Correlation between choline level and Gd-DTPA enhancement in patients with brain metastases of mammary carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Single voxel 1H double spin-echo MR spectroscopy was used to examine 15 cases of brain metastasis of mammary carcinoma (18 lesions) in relation to Gd-DTPA enhanced MR imaging. For lesions larger than 50% of MRS voxel size, there was significant correlation between Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI signal and MRS-detected signal of choline (Cho) containing compounds (r = 0.86, P < 0.01; n = 8). The observed loss of correlation when including the smaller lesions was overcome by correcting for partial volume effects (r = 0.69, P < 0.002; n = 18). Metastasis spectra showed increased Cho compared with control spectra, except for those lesions showing detectable lactate (Lact) signal. The detection of Lact in four of the larger lesions coincided with comparatively low levels of creatine (Cr) and Cho and heterogeneous Gd-DTPA enhancement (Cr) and Cho and heterogeneous Gd-DTPA enhancement (ring-enhancement).

However, there is a need to improve the evaluation of their mechanism of action in tumors. Metabolomics of the response to anti-tumor agents is a tool to reveal candidate biomarkers and metabolic targets. We used two-dimensional high-resolution magic angle spinning proton-NMR spectroscopy-based metabolomics to investigate the response of MCF7 breast cancer cells to ascididemin, a marine alkaloid and lead molecule for anti-cancer treatment. Ascididemin induced severe oxidative stress and apoptosis within 48 h of exposure. Thirty-three metabolites were quantified. Metabolic response involved downregulation of  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and phospholipid metabolism alterations. Candidate metabolic biomarkers of the response of breast cancer cells to ascididemin were proposed including citrate, gluconate, polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospho-choline and -.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate (BrAcNHEtOP), a specific active site-directed inactivator of Fru-6-P,2-kinase, is useful for studies on the role of Fru-6-P,2-kinase in the regulation of  in vivo. BrAcNHEtOP inactivated purified recombinant rat testis-type Fru-6-P,2-kinase as well as Fru-6-P,2-kinase in a rat liver extract, with half maximum inactivation concentrations of 2 and 15 mM, respectively, on 30 min incubation at 30 degrees C. The increases in Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity and the Fru-2,6-P2 concentration in livers, prepared from fasted rats, induced by high glucose (50 mM) perfusion were suppressed in parallel after pre-perfusion with 1 to 10 mM BrAcNHEtOP, dose-dependently. Five hours after intraperitoneal injection of BrAcNHEtOP (50 to 150 mg/kg) into mice, the Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity and Fru-2,6-P2 concentration in livers had decreased in parallel, dose-dependently. These effects continued for 24 h and were accompanied by decreases in the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, triose phosphates, and lactate contents, although the contents of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate did not change. These results suggested that BrAcNHEtOP inactivates Fru-6-P, 2-kinase, resulting in a decrease in the Fru-2,6-P2 level, which causes inactivation of phosphofructokinase and consequently inhibition of  in liver. Furthermore, the suppressed levels of Fru-6-P,2-kinase activity and metabolites in mice livers were sustained by daily injection of BrAcNHEtOP for 4 days, and body weight gain was also suppressed during the administration of BrAcNHEtOP.

In a double-blind crossover study, 13 males [V̇o2 max: 45.0 ± 0.2 (means ± SE) ml·min(-1)·kg(-1)] performed a 30-s cycle ergometer sprint after inhalation of either 54 μg of formoterol (FOR) or placebo (PLA). Before and after the sprint, muscle biopsies were collected from vastus lateralis and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and contractile properties of quadriceps were measured. Oxygen uptake was measured during the sprint. During the sprint, peak power, mean power, and end power were 4.6 ± 0.8, 3.9 ± 1.1, and 9.5 ± 3.2% higher (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA, respectively.

There was no difference in breakdown of phosphocreatine and oxygen uptake between treatments. Before and after the sprint, MVC and peak twitch force were higher (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA. No differences were observed in phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr(287) and FXYD1 between treatments before the sprint, whereas phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr(287) and FXYD1 was greater (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA after the sprint.

Transmitter glutamate is released soon after training and again before memory consolidation 30 min after training. Memory consolidation is abolished by posttraining injection of iodoacetate, which inhibits  and thus not only energy metabolism but also pyruvate carboxylase-dependent glucose conversion to glutamate, needed for consolidation; a similar effect is evoked by the antagonists propranolol acting at beta(2)-adrenoceptors or SR59230A acting at beta(3)-adrenoceptors. This paper shows that the effect of these inhibitors can be overcome by central injection of glutamine, providing an alternate source of transmitter glutamate and compensating for the inhibition of  by iodoacetate or the blockade of adrenergic stimulation of glycogenolysis by propranolol or of glucose uptake by SR59230A. Conversely, inhibition of memory consolidation by methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase and thus of the glutamate-glutamine cycle, essential for neuronal reaccumulation of previously released transmitter glutamate, could be challenged by noradrenaline, stimulating glucose uptake and glycogenolysis and providing glutamate synthesis from glucose to compensate for the lack of return of previously released glutamate. Also, administration of either glutamine or noradrenaline could prevent the spontaneous decay of labile memory 30 min after training on a weakened stimulus, suggesting that direct supply of glutamate from glucose may secure sufficient supplies of transmitter glutamate for release prior to memory consolidation at 30 min.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329570>Tumor growth affects the metabonomic phenotypes of multiple mouse non-involved organs in an A549 lung cancer xenograft model.</a></h2><p>The effects of tumorigenesis and tumor growth on the non-involved organs remain poorly understood although many research efforts have already been made for understanding the metabolic phenotypes of various tumors.

Diabetic subjects are more likely to experience a myocardial infarction compared to nondiabetic subjects. In recent years, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have received increasing attention from basic scientists and clinicians and hold promise for myocardial regeneration due to their unlimited proliferation potential and differentiation capacity. However, cardiomyogenesis of type 1 diabetic donor-derived iPSCs (T1DM-iPSCs) has not been investigated yet. The aim of the study was to comparatively analyze cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation capacity of nondiabetic donor-derived iPSCs (N-iPSCs) and T1DM-iPSCs. The differentiated CMs were confirmed by both expression of cardiac-specific markers and presence of cardiac action potential. Since mitochondrial bioenergetics is vital to every aspect of CM function, extracellular acidification rates and oxygen consumption rates were measured using Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. The results showed that N-iPSCs and T1DM-iPSCs demonstrated similar capacity of differentiation into spontaneously contracting CMs exhibiting nodal-, atrial-, or ventricular-like action potentials. Differentiation efficiency was up to 90%. In addition, the CMs differentiated from N-iPSCs and T1DM-iPSCs (N-iPSC-CMs and T1DM-iPSC-CMs, respectively) showed 1) well-regulated glucose utilization at the level of  and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and 2) the ability to switch metabolic pathways independent of extracellular glucose concentration. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that T1DM-iPSCs can differentiate into functional CMs with well-regulated glucose utilization as shown in N-iPSCs, suggesting that T1DM-iPSC-CMs might be a promising autologous cell source for myocardial regeneration in type 1 diabetes patients.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237652>Impact of Epinephrine Contained in Local Anesthetic Solution on Serum Lactate Level During Orthognathic Surgery.</a></h2><p>There have been many discussions of a relation between endogenous and exogenous epinephrine and hyperlactatemia. This study aimed to identify the impact of epinephrine contained in a local anesthetic solution on serum lactate levels in patients who underwent orthognathic surgery.This study was a retrospective record review of cases of maxillary and mandibular osteotomy at the Tokyo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) from January 2006 through December 2014. One hundred ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study.The maximum intraoperative serum lactate level was 22.3 ± 14.7 mg/dL. Of 193 patients, 91 showed an intraoperative serum lactate level that was higher than the normal maximum of 19.8 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L), and 16 of these had a level that was at least 40 mg/dL (≥4.49 mmol/L). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed 2 factors that could increase the serum lactate level: the amount of epinephrine contained in the local anesthetic solution injected into the oral cavity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.006-1.022; P = .0001) and the absence of intraoperative treatment with propranolol (OR, 0.105; 95% CI, 0.019-0.434; P = .0013). Patients with severe serum lactate concentrations (ie, ≥40 mg/dL [≥4.49 mmol/L]) had slight metabolic acidosis. All patients survived 90 days. The number of postoperative hospitalization days for patients with severe serum lactate concentrations was 12.8 ± 2.6 days and that for patients without severe serum lactate concentration was 16.0 ± 8.6 days.Increases in intraoperative serum lactate levels during orthognathic surgery are associated, at least in part, with increased aerobic glycolysis because of β-adrenergic signaling.

Epinephrine stimulates  in resting muscle largely by stimulating Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity. This study evaluates the effects of hemorrhagic shock, with and without combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, on lactate production, glycogenolysis, Na(+)-K(+) pump activity, and high-energy phosphates in rat skeletal muscle.Male Sprague-Dawley rats in four treatment groups were studied: unhemorrhaged control not receiving blockers (CN), controls receiving blockers (CB), shocked animals not receiving blockers (SN), and shocked rats receiving blockers (SB). Shocked rats (SN and SB) were bled to a MAP of 40 mm Hg, maintained for 60 min. Blocker groups (CB and SB) received propranolol and phenoxybenzamine. Arterial blood was drawn for plasma lactate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and gas analysis. Lactate, glycogen, glucose 6-phosphate, ATP, phosphocreatine, and intracellular Na(+) and K(+) were determined in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. For comparison, muscles were exposed to epinephrine and/or ouabain in vitro.With the exception of P(a)CO(2), HCO(3), and base excess in the SN group, no significant differences in arterial blood gas parameters were noted. Adrenergic blockade significantly reduced plasma lactate concentration. In shocked rats, adrenergic blockade significantly reduced muscle lactate and glucose 6-phosphate accumulation. Intracellular Na(+):K(+) ratio was decreased in SN rats, implying increased Na(+)-K(+) pump activity. Adrenergic blockade raised the intracellular Na(+):K(+) ratio in shocked animals, implying decreased pump activity. Epinephrine exposure in vitro stimulated muscle lactate production, raised glucose 6-phosphate content, and significantly reduced soleus phosphocreatine stores.Neither hypoxia nor defective oxidative metabolism appeared responsible for increased  during hemorrhagic shock. Adrenergic blockade concurrently reduced plasma lactate, muscle levels of lactate and glucose 6-phosphate, and muscle Na(+)-K(+) pump activity during shock. Rapid skeletal muscle aerobic  in response to increased plasma epinephrine levels may be an important contributor to increased  in muscle and increased plasma lactate during hemorrhagic shock.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18323749>Increased aerobic  through beta2 stimulation is a common mechanism involved in lactate formation during shock states.</a></h2><p>During septic shock, muscle produces lactate by way of an exaggerated NaK-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-stimulated aerobic  associated with epinephrine stimulation possibly through beta2 adrenoreceptor involvement. It therefore seems logical that a proportion of hyperlactatemia in low cardiac output states would be also related to this mechanism. Thus, in low-flow and normal-to-high-flow models of shock, we investigate (1) whether muscle produces lactate and (2) whether muscle lactate production is linked to beta2 adrenergic stimulation and Na+K+-ATPase. We locally modulated the adrenergic pathway and Na+K+-ATPase activity in male Wistar rats' skeletal muscle using microdialysis with nonselective and selective beta blockers and ouabain in different models of rodent shock (endotoxin, peritonitis, and hemorrhage). Blood flow at the probe site was evaluated by ethanol clearance. We measured the difference between muscle lactate and blood lactate concentration, with a positive gradient indicating muscle lactate or pyruvate production. Epinephrine levels were elevated in all shock groups. All models were associated with hypotension and marked hyperlactatemia. Muscle lactate concentrations were consistently higher than arterial levels, with a mean gradient of 2.5+/-0.3 in endotoxic shock, 2.1+/-0.2 mM in peritonitis group, and 0.9+/-0.2 mM in hemorrhagic shock (P<0.05 for all groups). Muscle pyruvate concentrations were also always higher than arterial levels, with a mean gradient of 260+/-40 microM in endotoxic shock, 210+/-30 microM in peritonitis group, and 90+/-10 microM in hemorrhagic shock (P<0.05 for all groups). Despite a decrease in blood flow, lactate formation was decreased by all the pharmacological agents studied irrespective of shock mechanism. This demonstrates that lactate production during shock states is related, at least in part, to increased NaK-ATPase activity under beta2 stimulation. In shock state associated with a reduced or maintained blood flow, an important proportion of muscle lactate release is regulated by a beta2 receptor stimulation and not secondary to a reduced oxygen availability.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741686>GPR55 receptor antagonist decreases glycolytic activity in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line and tumor xenografts.</a></h2><p>The Warburg effect is a predominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells characterized by enhanced glucose uptake and its conversion to l-lactate and is associated with upregulated expression of HIF-1α and activation of the EGFR-MEK-ERK, Wnt-β-catenin, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways.

We examined (R,R')-MNF's effect on glycolysis in PANC-1 cells and tumors. Global NMR metabolomics was used to elucidate differences in the metabolome between untreated and (R,R')-MNF-treated cells. LC/MS analysis was used to quantify intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, carnitine, and l-lactate. Changes in target protein expression were determined by Western blot analysis. Data was also obtained from mouse PANC-1 tumor xenografts after administration of (R,R')-MNF. Metabolomics data indicate that (R,R')-MNF altered fatty acid metabolism,  metabolism, and amino acid metabolism and increased intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and carnitine while reducing l-lactate content. The cellular content of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and hexokinase 2 was reduced consistent with diminished PI3K-AKT signaling and glucose metabolism. The presence of the GLUT8 transporter was established and found to be attenuated by (R,R')-MNF. Mice treated with (R,R')-MNF had significant accumulation of l-lactate in tumor tissue relative to vehicle-treated mice, together with reduced levels of the selective l-lactate transporter MCT4. Lower intratumoral levels of EGFR, pyruvate kinase M2, β-catenin, hexokinase 2, and p-glycoprotein were also observed.

Metabolic assessment was based on user-independent determination of absolute brain concentrations at a nominal temporal resolution of 1.6 min. While the concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (neuronal marker), creatines, cholines, and myo-inositol (glial marker) remained constant, ischemia induced a rapid decline of brain glucose. One hour after reperfusion, glucose recovered to 4.1 +/- 2.2 mmol/kg wet weight significantly above the basal value of 2.3 +/- 1.3 mmol/kg wet weight. Mirroring glucose depletion, lactate increased from 1.0 +/- 0.6 to 13.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/kg wet weight 10-15 min after the onset of ischemia. During reperfusion lactate clearance was characterized by a first-order rate constant of 0.03/min.

Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19781035>Liver gene expression in relation to hepatic steatosis and lipid secretion in two duck species.</a></h2><p>The susceptibility to development of hepatic steatosis is known to differ between Muscovy and Pekin ducks. Although some experiments were conducted to decipher these differences, few data have been produced to analyse the role of specific genes in this process. For this purpose, expression levels of genes involved in lipid (ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme 1, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, diacylglycerol O-acyl transferase 2, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, sterol regulatory element binding factor 1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, choline/ phosphotransferase 1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and sterol O-acyltransferase) and carbohydrate (activating transcription factor 4 or cAMP-response element binding protein, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 and carbohydrate responsive element binding protein) metabolism and in other functions were analysed in the liver of Pekin and Muscovy ducks fed ad libitum or overfed. A specific positive effect of feeding was observed on the expression of genes involved mainly in fatty acids and TG synthesis and , and negative effect on genes involved in beta-oxidation. Interestingly, a strong species effect was also observed on stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and to a lesser extent on diacylglycerol O-acyl transferase 2 expression, leading to large differences in expression levels between Pekin and Muscovy overfed ducks, which could explain the difference in lipid metabolism and steatosis ability observed between the two duck species.

This pleiotropic effect is achieved via coupling to different receptor/effector systems. In epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) of Wistar rats, we showed that epinephrine stimulated protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation on Ser(473). Epinephrine further increased the glucose incorporation into glyceride-glycerol without decreasing glucose availability for other metabolic pathways (i.e. lactate production). Wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) treatment significantly decreased glucose incorporation into glyceride-glycerol and elevated the epinephrine-induced release of free fatty acids (FFA) from the adipose tissue without any change in the intensity of lipolysis measured as glycerol release. Using specific cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogs we demonstrated that cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signalling resulted in a strong PKB dephosphorylation and significantly lowered the glucose availability in EWAT. Specific activation of the Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP)-dependent pathway had only a moderately negative effect on PKB phosphorylation and glucose metabolism. In contrast, α(1) agonist methoxamine increased PKB phosphorylation and lactate production. This effect of methoxamine was additive to the effect of insulin and it was abolished by wortmannin treatment. In EWAT of spontaneously dyslipidemic hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats, we demonstrated significantly lower epinephrine-induced glucose utilization but higher sensitivity to its lipolytic effect. We conclude that in EWAT, epinephrine controls two opposite processes (FFA release and FFA retention) via two different effector systems. The impairment of α(1)-dependent, epinephrine-stimulated, -dependent FFA esterification may contribute to the establishment of dyslipidemia in insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12446281>Endotoxemia stimulates skeletal muscle Na+-K+-ATPase and raises blood lactate under aerobic conditions in humans.</a></h2><p>We assessed the hypothesis that the epinephrine surge present during sepsis accelerates aerobic  and lactate production by increasing activity of skeletal muscle Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Healthy volunteers received an intravenous bolus of endotoxin or placebo in a randomized order on two different days. Endotoxemia induced a response resembling sepsis. Endotoxemia increased plasma epinephrine to a maximum at t = 2 h of 0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/l (P < 0.05, n = 6-7). Endotoxemia reduced plasma K(+) reaching a nadir at t = 5 h of 3.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (P < 0.01, n = 6-7), followed by an increase to placebo level at t = 7-8 h. During the declining plasma K(+), a relative accumulation of K(+) was seen reaching a maximum at t = 6 h of 8.7 +/- 3.8 mmol/leg (P < 0.05). Plasma lactate increased to a maximum at t = 1 h of 2.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/l (P < 0.05, n = 8) in association with increased release of lactate from the legs. These changes were not associated with hypoperfusion or hypoxia. During the first 24 h after endotoxin infusion, renal K(+) excretion was 27 +/- 7 mmol, i.e., 58% higher than after placebo. Combination of the well-known stimulatory effect of catecholamines on skeletal muscle Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, with the present confirmation of an expected Na(+)-K(+)- ATPase-induced decline in plasma K(+), suggests that the increased lactate release was due to increased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity, supporting our hypothesis.

Therapy aimed at improving oxygen delivery to tissues often does not correct the hyperlactatemia, suggesting that high blood lactate in sepsis is not due to hypoxia. Various tissues, including skeletal muscle, demonstrate increased lactate production under well-oxygenated conditions when the activity of the Na+-K+ ATPase is stimulated. Although both muscle Na+-K+ ATPase activity and muscle plasma membrane content of Na+, K+-ATPase subunits are increased in sepsis, no studies in vivo have demonstrated correlation between lactate production and changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ resulting from increased Na+-K+ pump activity in sepsis. Plasma concentrations of lactate and epinephrine, a known stimulator of the Na+-K+ pump, were increased in rats made septic by E. coli injection. Muscle lactate content was significantly increased in septic rats, although muscle ATP and phosphocreatine remained normal, suggesting oxygen delivery remained adequate for mitochondrial energy metabolism. In septic rats, muscle intracellular ratio of Na+:K+ was significantly reduced, indicating increased Na+-K+ pump activity. These data thus demonstrate that increased muscle lactate during sepsis correlates with evidence of elevated muscle Na+-K+ ATPase activity, but not with evidence of impaired oxidative metabolism. This study also further supports a role for epinephrine in this process.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11513317>Physiological responses in tennis and running with similar oxygen uptake.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to compare selected physiological responses during singles tennis match play and continuous running at a similar mean oxygen uptake (VO2).

In the first part, 12 nationally ranked senior tennis players [six females and six males; 47.2 (6.6) years old and 47.0 (5.4) years old, respectively] each completed a 2-h singles tennis match (TE). Mean VO2 during TE [23.1 (3.1) ml.kg(-1). min(-1) for the women and 25.6 (2.8) ml.kg(-1).min(-1) for the men] was measured by a portable spirometry-telemetry system and corresponded to 56% (women) or 54% (men) of their respective maximum VO2.

In spite of BAT activation, the diet promoted an increase in the carcass fatty acid content. Plasma insulin levels were markedly increased in cafeteria diet-fed rats. Two insulin-sensitive processes, in vivo fatty acid synthesis and in vivo glucose uptake (which was used to evaluate G3P generation via ) were increased in BAT from rats fed the cafeteria diet. Direct glycerol phosphorylation, evaluated by glycerokinase (GyK) activity and incorporation of [U-14C]glycerol into triacylglycerol (TAG)-glycerol, was also markedly increased in BAT from these rats. In contrast, the cafeteria diet induced a marked reduction of BAT glyceroneogenesis, evaluated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-C activity and incorporation of [1-14C]pyruvate into TAG-glycerol. BAT denervation resulted in an approximately 50% reduction of GyK activity, but did not significantly affect BAT in vivo fatty acid synthesis, in vivo glucose uptake, or glyceroneogenesis.

Postmortem measurements have suggested that Glc content in experimental brain tumors is relatively low. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate this, in vivo, in the brains of seven rats bearing intracerebral C6 gliomas. We combined the high spectral resolution allowed by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance with spatial encoding by magnetic field gradient pulses to obtain in vivo maps of Glc, alanine, hypotaurine, aspartate, phosphoethanolamine, Glu/Gln, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), phosphocreatine/creatine (PCr/Cr), choline-containing compounds, and lactate (Lac) (some of which are involved in energy metabolism). Compared with normal brain tissue, the main differences found in the gliomas were that Glc, NAA, PCr/Cr, and aspartate concentrations were much lower, whereas concentrations of alanine, hypotaurine, phosphoethanolamine, and Lac were higher, whatever the extent of necrosis. A striking observation is the similarity of the NAA and Glc images: the concentrations of both metabolites are lower in the tumor than they are in the contralateral brain. If Glc was completely absent from the tumor tissue, and if the residual Glc level was due only to a partial volume effect like that for NAA, a neuronal marker, the ratio [Glc]tumor/[Glc]contralateral tissue, should be similar to that found for NAA. The ratio for Glc was 0.48 +/- 0.22 (+/- SD; n = 6), a ratio similar to that found for PCr/Cr (0.50 +/- 0.19) but significantly higher than that obtained for NAA (0.29 +/- 0.07). This observation indicates that a measurable Glc concentration is still present in the tumor tissue. Intense  in tumor cells may explain the increased production of Lac and alanine and decreased amount of Glc. These nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of metabolite concentrations are complementary to positron emission tomography, which measures Glc consumption.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15156412>Variable onset determinants and consequences of diabetes (db/db) obesity mutation expression: adrenergic promotion of utero-ovarian dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Expression of the diabetes ( db/db) genotype mutation in female C57BL/KsJ mice induces a complex diabetes-obesity syndrome (DOS) responsible for reproductive tract involution promoted by hypercytolipidemia (HCL). Current studies define the complex and influences of the endometabolic variables that promote reproductive tract involution at the time of initial db/db mutation expression onset in female C57BL/KsJ mice. Littermate-paired, normal ( +/?) and db/db groups were isolated between 2 - 4 weeks of age and tissue samples analyzed for utero-ovarian alterations induced by the systemic, tissue, cellular and structural consequences of mutation expression. Significantly elevated body weights, blood glucose concentrations and serum insulin levels contrasted with atrophic utero-ovarian indices in db/db mutants compared to +/? groups. The onset of the db/db-expression promoted obesity and a mild hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic state. Initial db/db expression was characterized by significantly increased utero-ovarian insulin binding without variation in membrane insulin receptor concentrations. However, significant elevations in tissue glucose sequestration rates, norepinephrine (NE) concentrations and triacylglyceride lipase activity in db/db groups indicated that a complex of endometabolic counter-regulatory influences promoted the metabolic shunting of excess glucose and triglyceride moieties towards hypercytolipidemic storage. The resulting DOS-promoted accumulation of utero-ovarian cytolipidemic pools compromised reproductive tract cytoarchitecture in db/db mice. The results of these studies indicate that the inability of utero-ovarian tissue compartments to exhibit metabolic adaptation to the enhanced availability, transport and cellular imbibition of extracellular glucose-lipid pools promotes the initial cellular compromise recognized to induce reproductive failure in db/db mutants.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20460168>Uncovering the metabolomic fingerprint of breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics, the study of metabolites and small intermediate molecules, may play a key role in further elucidation of breast cancer.

Current evidence is consistent with the conclusion that the hippocampal formation plays an important role in the presentation of depressive symptoms. Eighteen adult patients with major depressive disorder, aged 20 to 60 years, underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the hippocampus during a period of depressive symptomatology and after 7-11 weeks of antidepressant medication with at least 50% reduction in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ()MADRS score. During therapy, we found a significantly decreased Lac/Cr ratio in the left hippocampus. The Ins/Cr ratio showed a significant negative correlation with the severity of depression as assessed by the MADRS at baseline. Moreover, we found a negative association of NAA/Cho with age and a positive association of Cho/Cr with age, both on the left and right sides at baseline. In light of our findings and previous studies results we hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction leading to predominantly anaerobic  in connection with the intracellular signaling pathways disturbances and decreased astrocytic function/number might subsequently lead to decreased brain neuroplasticity in depression. These mechanisms could be positively influenced by antidepressant treatment with selective serotonin or norepineprine reuptake inhibitors, with potential effects on untimely neuronal aging in depression.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The increase in lipid supply augments lipid oxidation. Patients with autonomic failure provide a unique opportunity to further elucidate the role of the adrenergic system in adipose tissue metabolism. In 4 patients with severe pure autonomic failure (PAF), in 3 multiple system atrophy patients (MSA), and in 16 healthy young controls, we inserted a microdialysis catheter in abdominal adipose tissue. The catheter was perfused with incremental concentrations of the nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol. Dialysate glucose, lactate, and glycerol were measured to assess glucose supply, , and lipolysis, respectively. Basal dialysate glycerol concentrations were 84 +/- 28 microM in PAF and 130 +/- 64 microM in MSA patients. The increase in dialysate glycerol with isoproterenol was identical in PAF and in MSA patients. We found an almost complete overlap in dialysate glycerol concentrations during isoproterenol stimulation between PAF and MSA patients and healthy young control subjects. Our findings suggest that adipose tissue metabolism is remarkably well preserved in patients with chronic sympathetic denervation, both at rest and during local adrenergic stimulation.

Using laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy, alternans of electrically evoked [Ca2+]i transients revealed marked differences between atrial and ventricular myocytes. In ventricular myocytes, electrically evoked [Ca2+]i transients during alternans were spatially homogeneous. In atrial cells Ca2+ release started at subsarcolemmal peripheral regions and subsequently spread toward the centre of the myocyte. In contrast to ventricular myocytes, in atrial cells propagation of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the small-amplitude [Ca2+]i transient was incomplete, leading to failures of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in central regions of the cell. The mechanism underlying alternans was explored by evaluating the trigger signal for SR Ca2+ release (voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ current, ICa,L) and SR Ca2+ load during alternans. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that peak ICa,L was not affected during alternans when measured simultaneously with changes of cell shortening. The SR Ca2+ content, evaluated by application of caffeine pulses, was identical following the small-amplitude and the large-amplitude [Ca2+]i transient. These results suggest that the primary mechanism responsible for cardiac alternans does not reside in the trigger signal for Ca2+ release and SR Ca2+ load. beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (isoprenaline) reversed electromechanical alternans, suggesting that under conditions of positive cardiac inotropy and enhanced efficiency of EC coupling alternans is less likely to occur. The occurrence of electromechanical alternans could be elicited by impairment of . Inhibition of glycolytic flux by application of pyruvate, iodoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate induced electromechanical and [Ca2+]i transient alternans in both atrial and ventricular myocytes.

It is the most powerful form of endogenous protection against myocardial infarction and has been demonstrated in all species evaluated to date. However, the cellular mechanisms that drive IPC remain poorly understood. This hypothesis describes an important role for alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors in mediating IPC and discusses the underlying mechanisms by which this is likely achieved. alpha(1)-Adrenoreceptors are present in the myocardium of all mammalian species, and several lines of evidence suggest that they play an important role in mediating IPC. During periods of myocardial hypoxia/ischemia, cardiomyocytes have to rely solely on anaerobic  for energy production; for this, the cells have to depend on increased glucose entry inside the cell as well as increased . Stimulation of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors increases glucose transport inside the cardiomyocytes by translocating glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and GLUT-4 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, enhances glycogenolysis by activating phosphorylase kinase, increases the rate of  by activating the enzyme phosphofructokinase, reduces intracellular acidity produced during excessive  by activating the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and inhibits apoptosis by increasing the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Myocardial ischemia produces an increase in the expression of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors in cardiomyocytes, as well as increases the levels of its agonist norepinephrine by several fold. During ischemic states, upregulation of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors and increase in norepinephrine release could be a powerful adaptive mechanism that drives IPC.

Aerobic  is a widespread phenomenon that underlies energetics of diverse brain activities, such as alerting, sensory processing, cognition, memory, and pathophysiological conditions, but specific cellular functions fulfilled by aerobic  are poorly understood. Evaluation of evidence derived from different disciplines reveals that aerobic  is a complex, regulated phenomenon that is prevented by propranolol, a non-specific β-adrenoceptor antagonist. The metabolic pathways that contribute to excess utilization of glucose compared with oxygen include , the pentose phosphate shunt pathway, the malate-aspartate shuttle, and astrocytic glycogen turnover. Increased lactate production by unidentified cells, and lactate dispersal from activated cells and lactate release from the brain, both facilitated by astrocytes, are major factors underlying aerobic  in subjects with low blood lactate levels. Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttling with local oxidation is minor. Blockade of aerobic  by propranolol implicates adrenergic regulatory processes including adrenal release of epinephrine, signaling to brain via the vagus nerve, and increased norepinephrine release from the locus coeruleus. Norepinephrine has a powerful influence on astrocytic metabolism and glycogen turnover that can stimulate carbohydrate utilization more than oxygen consumption, whereas β-receptor blockade 're-balances' the stoichiometry of oxygen-glucose or -carbohydrate metabolism by suppressing glucose and glycogen utilization more than oxygen consumption. This conceptual framework may be helpful for design of future studies to elucidate functional roles of preferential non-oxidative glucose utilization and glycogen turnover during brain activation. Aerobic , the preferential up-regulation of glucose utilization (CMRglc ) compared with oxygen consumption (CMRO2 ) during brain activation, is blocked by propranolol.

In this study, the changes in flux and intermediate levels that occurred upon addition of either glucagon or adrenaline were measured. From comparison of the fractional changes in fluxes and intermediate levels with the known kinetics of the system, it was possible to determine the primary sites of action of the hormones. The results show that the majority of processes in the cell are responsive to the hormones. The notable exception to this is the failure of adrenaline to have a direct effect on . The activity change of each metabolic block observed in the presence of either hormone was quantified and compared to the indirect effects on each block caused by changes in metabolite levels. The second stage of the analysis was to use the calculated activity changes and the known control pattern of the system to give a semiquantitative analysis of the regulatory pathways employed by the hormones to achieve the changes in fluxes and metabolite levels. This was instructive in analysing, for example, how glucagon caused a decrease in flux through  and an increase in oxidative phosphorylation without large changes in metabolite levels (homeostasis). Conversely, it could be seen that the failure of adrenaline to maintain a constant glucose 6-phosphate concentration was due to the stimulation of glycogen breakdown and inhibition of glucose release.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27002151>Propionate Increases Hepatic Pyruvate Cycling and Anaplerosis and Alters Mitochondrial Metabolism.</a></h2><p>In mammals, pyruvate kinase (PK) plays a key role in regulating the balance between  and gluconeogenesis; however, in vivo regulation of PK flux by gluconeogenic hormones and substrates is poorly understood. To this end, we developed a novel NMR-liquid chromatography/tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to directly assess pyruvate cycling relative to mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism (VPyr-Cyc/VMito) in vivo using [3-(13)C]lactate as a tracer. Using this approach, VPyr-Cyc/VMito was only 6% in overnight fasted rats. In contrast, when propionate was infused simultaneously at doses previously used as a tracer, it increased VPyr-Cyc/VMito by 20-30-fold, increased hepatic TCA metabolite concentrations 2-3-fold, and increased endogenous glucose production rates by 20-100%. The physiologic stimuli, glucagon and epinephrine, both increased hepatic glucose production, but only glucagon suppressed VPyr-Cyc/VMito These data show that under fasting conditions, when hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated, pyruvate recycling is relatively low in liver compared with VMito flux and that liver metabolism, in particular pyruvate cycling, is sensitive to propionate making it an unsuitable tracer to assess hepatic glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and mitochondrial metabolism in vivo.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955643>Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data of early and middle season Hass avocados under heat treatment.</a></h2><p>Ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocados results in inconsistent quality fruit delivered to the triggered and ready to eat markets. This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver energy for the alternative ripening pathways. l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples. Our study provides new insights into the effectiveness of HS in synchronizing ripening of Hass avocados.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We have previously shown that the weight and lipid content of epididymal (EPI) adipose tissue increases in growing rats fed a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet for 15 days. The aim of this work was to study the pathways involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis, which ultimately regulate lipid accumulation in the tissue. De novo fatty acid synthesis was evaluated in vivo and was similar for rats fed an LPHC diet or a control diet; however, the LPHC-fed rats had decreased lipoprotein lipase activity in the EPI adipose tissue, which suggests that there was a decreased uptake of fatty acids from the circulating lipoproteins. The LPHC diet did not affect synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) via  or glyceroneogenesis. Glycerokinase activity - i.e., the phosphorylation of glycerol from the hydrolysis of endogenous TAG to form G3P - was also not affected in LPHC-fed rats. In contrast, adipocytes from LPHC animals had a reduced lipolytic response when stimulated by norepinephrine, even though the basal adipocyte lipolytic rate was similar for both of the groups. Thus, the results suggest that the reduction of lipolytic activity stimulated by norepinephrine seems essential for the TAG increase observed in the EPI adipose tissue of LPHC animals, probably by impairment of the process of activation of lipolysis by norepinephrine.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12008647>Can we "switch" the emphasis please?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21552790>Analysis of isoproterenol-induced changes in gastrocnemius muscle and serum lactate dehydrogenase expression in mice.</a></h2><p>Beta-adrenergic agonists are highly abused by sportspeople for their muscle anabolic and lipolytic effects. Muscle growth effects are thought to result from beta-2 adrenoceptor activation. This study attempted to characterise muscle (gastrocnemius) tissue damage following the administration of isoproterenol.Adult male Balb-C mice were treated with a single oral dose of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg body weight) for 4, 8, 20, 48 and 72 hours. Control mice received equal doses of saline. The animals were killed at the respective stages, followed by the collection of gastrocnemius and blood. Serum was then separated from blood. Histopathology and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed.Beta-adrenoceptor activation-induced histological changes began with structural aberrations, and ultimately resulted in myonecrosis and extensive degeneration within hours of the administration of isoproterenol. The effects of beta-agonist administration on muscle myofibre organisation were visible within four hours and became most prominent at 20 and 48 hours. Augmentation of more than 20 percent in muscle LDH activity was observed at 4, 8 and 72 hour stages, and was accompanied by a significant decline of 19 and 27 percent at 20 and 48 hour time points, respectively. Serum corroborated the above results.Isoproterenol treatment produced considerable histopathological changes, including myonecrosis in mice gastrocnemius, resulting in a leaky sarcolemma and the release of marker enzyme, LDH into the serum (more evident after 20 and 48 hours). This suggests that isoproterenol promotes the process of necrosis in mice gastrocnemius at the concentration employed, which raises a significant question regarding the use and abuse of beta-agonists.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884025>Synergism between prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol in stimulating glucose oxidation in the heart.</a></h2><p>The increase in cardiac contractile function following adrenergic stimulation is accompanied by increased glucose metabolism.

All hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11 mM [5-3H, 14C(U)]glucose, 100 microU/mL insulin, and 3% albumin. In the presence of 0.4 mM palmitate and 1.25 mM free Ca2+, isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) M) increased the heart rate x peak systolic pressure product from 27 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 1 mmHg.beats.min-1.10(3) (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa). This was accompanied by an increase in glycolytic rates from 3564 +/- 231 to 7775 +/- 475 nmol.g-1 dry weight min-1 and an increase in glucose oxidation from 930 +/- 72 to 2591 +/- 239 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1.

In the absence of isoproterenol, 10(-9) M PGE2 had no effect on either  or glucose oxidation. When perfusate [Ca2+] was raised to 2.5 mM, a significant increase in  was seen in control hearts (from 3564 +/- 231 to 5679 +/- 374 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). The effects of isoproterenol and PGE2 on glucose metabolism remained, although the synergistic effects of PGE2 on glucose oxidation were less dramatic. When 1.2 mM palmitate was present in hearts perfused with 2.5 mM Ca2+, a decrease was seen in both  (from 5679 +/- 374 to 3027 +/- 346 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1) and glucose oxidation (from 1056 +/- 170 to 221 +/- 29 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). Even at this high concentration of fatty acid, isoproterenol stimulated glucose oxidation (from 221 +/- 29 to 859 +/- 69 nmol.g-1 dry weight min-1), and addition of PGE2 resulted in a significant further increase (1021 +/- 139 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). These data demonstrate that concentrations of PGE2 that bind to the high affinity cardiac PGE2 receptor have no effect on glucose metabolism in the absence of beta-agonists. In the presence of isoproterenol, which dramatically stimulates both  and glucose oxidation, PGE2 has a synergistic effect on glucose oxidation at lower fatty acid concentrations.

A recently developed cell line, called DI TNC1, displays several characteristic features of astrocytes. Thus, we have investigated in these cells a number of parameters related to energy metabolism. First, glycogen, the major energy reserve in the brain, is present in these cells and its levels are influenced by the glucose content of the growth medium and the presence of serum. Second, several neurotransmitters including noradrenaline and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) induce a glycogenolytic response. Their effect on glycogen is paralleled by a similar effect on the formation of cyclic AMP, which is presumably the second messenger involved. Third, noradrenaline stimulates glucose utilization (as reflected by 2-deoxyglucose uptake) in DI TNC1 cells, an effect which is mimicked by the second messenger arachidonate. Interestingly, two actions of neurotransmitters, which are well characterized in primary astrocytes, are absent in DI TNC1 cells. These are the noradrenaline- and VIP-induced resynthesis of glycogen and the glutamate-stimulated . In summary, the observations reported here lend further support to the concept that astrocytes are important for the control of brain energy metabolism. In addition, DI TNC1 cells might represent an interesting preparation to help decipher some of the astrocytic functions related to energy metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9522181>Responsiveness of glycogen catabolism to adrenergic agonists during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in rat livers.</a></h2><p>1.

The sequence of cytotoxic events with 2 mM cyanide was an immediate inhibition of respiration followed by ATP depletion. Disruption of the plasma membrane occurred when 85-90% of ATP levels had been depleted. Fructose, dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, pyruvate, and alpha-ketoglutarate prevented cyanide-induced cytotoxicity and ATP depletion. Hepatocyte respiration was also restored by all except fructose. Fructose, unlike the others, also did not prevent cytotoxicity if added 30-60 min after cyanide. Fluoride, an inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme enolase, prevented protection by fructose but not dihydroxyacetone or glyceraldehyde, suggesting that dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde are cytoprotective by trapping cyanide, thereby restoring cytochrome oxidase activity and cellular ATP levels. Fructose, on the other hand, may be cytoprotective by supplying ATP through . Hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats were five- to sevenfold more susceptible to cyanide-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, all glycogenic and gluconeogenic amino acids and carbohydrates were cytoprotective against cyanide toxicity toward fasted hepatocytes, suggesting that cellular energy stores determine their resistance to cyanide.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511527>Tissue-specific response to interstitial angiotensin II in humans.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II is synthesized locally in various tissues; however, the role of interstitial angiotensin II in the regulation of regional metabolism and tissue perfusion is not clear. We characterized the effect of interstially applied angiotensin II in skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue of young, normal-weight, healthy subjects by using the microdialysis technique. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of interstitial angiotensin II is modulated by nitric oxide. Tissues were perfused with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 micro mol/L angiotensin II in the presence of the L- or D-isomer of N(G)-nitro-arginine-methyl ester (L- or D-NAME), the effective and noneffective isomer, respectively, for blocking nitric oxide synthase. Dialysate ethanol, glycerol, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations were measured to assess changes in blood flow (ethanol dilution technique), lipolysis, and , respectively. Baseline blood flow and dialysate concentrations of the metabolites were similar with L- and D-NAME in both tissues. Blood flow and dialysate glucose and lactate did not change significantly in both tissues during perfusion with angiotensin II. Dialysate glycerol dose-dependently increased in adipose tissue (P<0.0438) but decreased in muscle (P<0.007). In muscle, dialysate pyruvate increased (P<0.0002), whereas lactate/pyruvate ratio decreased (P<0.001), both dose-dependently. All effects were similar with L- and D-NAME and could be reversed by nitroprusside. We conclude that in contrast to the profound hemodynamic effect of intravascular angiotensin II, interstitial angiotensin II has a minimal acute effect on blood flow in both tissues. However, interstitial angiotensin II modulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in a tissue specific fashion. Thus, the physiology of interstitial angiotensin II cannot be predicted from intravascular studies.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24052031>IL-6 and epinephrine have divergent fiber type effects on intramuscular lipolysis.</a></h2><p>IL-6 is an exercise-regulated myokine that has been suggested to increase lipolysis in fast-twitch skeletal muscle. However, it is not known if a similar effect is present in slow-twitch muscle. Furthermore, epinephrine increases IL-6 secretion from skeletal muscle, suggesting that IL-6 could play a role in mediating the lipolytic effects of catecholamines. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IL-6 stimulates skeletal muscle lipolysis in a fiber type dependent manner and is required for epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis in murine skeletal muscle. Soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from male C57BL/6J wild-type and IL-6(-/-) mice were incubated with 1 μM (183 ng/ml) epinephrine or 75 ng/ml recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) for 60 min. IL-6 treatment increased 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and glycerol release in isolated EDL but not soleus muscles from C57BL/6J mice. Conversely, epinephrine increased glycerol release in soleus but not EDL muscles from C57BL/6J mice. Basal lipolysis was elevated in soleus muscle from IL-6(-/-) mice, and this was associated with increases in adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and its coactivator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58). The increase in ATGL content does not appear to be due to a loss of IL-6's direct effects, because ex vivo treatment with IL-6 failed to alter the expression of ATGL mRNA in soleus muscle. In summary, IL-6 stimulates lipolysis in glycolytic but not oxidative muscle, whereas the opposite fiber type effect is seen with epinephrine. The absence of IL-6 indirectly upregulates lipolysis, and this is associated with increases in ATGL and its coactivator CGI-58.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550523>Fatty acid oxidation and its impact on response of spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts to an adrenergic stress: benefits of a medium-chain fatty acid.</a></h2><p>The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a model of cardiomyopathy characterized by a restricted use of exogenous long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) for energy production.

(13)C-labeled substrates were used to assess substrate selection for energy production. Compared with control Wistar rat hearts, SHR hearts showed an impaired response to the adrenergic stimulation as reflected by 1) a smaller increase in contractility and developed pressure, 2) a faster decline in the aortic flow, and 3) greater cardiac tissue damage (lactate dehydrogenase release: 1,577 +/- 118 vs. 825 +/- 44 mU/min, P < 0.01).

It is modulated on multiple levels by the biogenic amine octopamine. Within the CNS, octopamine acts directly on the flight central pattern generator, and it affects motivational states. In the periphery, octopamine sensitizes sensory receptors, alters muscle contraction kinetics, and enhances flight muscle . This study addresses the roles for octopamine and its precursor tyramine in flight behavior by genetic and pharmacological manipulation in Drosophila. Octopamine is not the natural signal for flight initiation because flies lacking octopamine [tyramine-beta-hydroxylase (TbetaH) null mutants] can fly. However, they show profound differences with respect to flight initiation and flight maintenance compared with wild-type controls. The morphology, kinematics, and development of the flight machinery are not impaired in TbetaH mutants because wing-beat frequencies and amplitudes, flight muscle structure, and overall dendritic structure of flight motoneurons are unaffected in TbetaH mutants. Accordingly, the flight behavior phenotypes can be rescued acutely in adult flies. Flight deficits are rescued by substituting octopamine but also by blocking the receptors for tyramine, which is enriched in TbetaH mutants. Conversely, ablating all neurons containing octopamine or tyramine phenocopies TbetaH mutants. Therefore, both octopamine and tyramine systems are simultaneously involved in regulating flight initiation and maintenance. Different sets of rescue experiments indicate different sites of action for both amines. These findings are consistent with a complex system of multiple amines orchestrating the control of motor behaviors on multiple levels rather than single amines eliciting single behaviors.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28944852>Use of immunoproteomics to identify immunogenic proteins in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and life‑threatening clinical syndrome, and seeking biomarkers of ARDS has been an area of continuing research.

Moreover, when no metabolic stimulant was applied, a compensatory increase in glycolytic activity was seen when the shunt was inhibited by DAB. Actually the labeling in lactate exceeded that obtained when  and glycogen shunt both were operational, i.e. supercompensation. A similar phenomenon was seen when astrocytes were exposed to D-aspartate. In addition to , tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity was monitored, analyzing labeling by mass spectrometry in glutamate which equilibrates with alpha-ketoglutarate. Both an elevated [K+] and D-aspartate induced an increased TCA cycle activity, which was altered when glycogen degradation was inhibited. Thus, the present study provides evidence that manipulation of glycogen metabolism affects both  and TCA cycle metabolism. Altogether, the results reveal a highly complex interaction between glycogenolysis and , with the glycogen shunt playing a significant role in astrocytic energy metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15000446>Effect of tyramine, a dietary amine, on glycerol and lactate release by isolated adipocytes from old rats.</a></h2><p>Amine degradation by adipocyte amine oxidases leads to the production of metabolites that interact with lipid and glucose metabolisms and their hormonal regulations. To further investigate these interactions, we determined the effect of a dietary amine, tyramine (TYR), on glycerol and lactate releases, respectively taken as indices of lipolytic and glycolytic activities of isolated adipocytes. Old male Wistar rats were used to prepare adipocytes by collagenase dissociation of retroperitoneal fat pads. The two tested doses of tyramine (10 microM and 1 mM) had no effect on basal glycerol release. On the other hand, TYR, at the highest dose tested (1 mM), weakly but significantly increased basal lactate release, which was elevated in adipocytes from old rats. Norepinephrine (NE), highly stimulated adipocyte lipolysis with a submaximal effect at 1 microM which was slightly but significantly inhibited by TYR 1 mM. Insulin 1 nM (INS) also poorly inhibited the NE-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes isolated from old rats. TYR was able to potentiate the poor antilipolytic efficiency of INS. Under similar conditions, a high dose of NE greatly reduced lactate production and TYR (1 mM) reversed this inhibition of lactate release. INS was also able to totally reverse the inhibitory effect of NE on lactate release, but there was no potentiation between insulin and tyramine effects. It can be concluded that high doses of TYR interact with norepinephrine and insulin, at least on the control of glycerol and lactate release, by counteracting catecholamine effects and by mimicking insulin actions.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743386>Correlation between three glycometabolic-related hormones and muscle , as well as meat quality, in three pig breeds.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the correlations among muscle concentrations of three glycometabolic-related hormones (insulin, epinephrine and glucagon), muscle  and meat quality in representative muscles of either glycolytic or oxidative types.

One Western crossbreed DLY (Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire)), one crossbreed with half-Chinese native-pig origin DL (Duroc × LiangShan) and one pure Chinese native pig TP (Tibetan pig) were used in the present study.Among the three breeds, DLY had the greatest glucagon and epinephrine (P < 0.01). Compared with DLY, TP and DL had lower lactic acid concentrations, showing lower glycolytic potentials (GP), greater ultimate pH values (P < 0.01) and lower relative expression levels of glycometabolic-related genes (GYS1, PRKAG3 and PKM2). Compared with the glycolytic muscle (musculus longissimus dorsi), oxidative muscle PM (musculus psoas major) had lower glucagon and epinephrine contents, lower GP and better meat quality. The concentration of glycometabolic-related hormones in the muscle had significant correlations with muscle , meat pH and lightness.The results obtained in the present study imply that glucagon and epinephrine levels could be used to indicate early glycolytic metabolism during postmortem.

Relatively little, however, is known about the signaling mechanisms regulating the transition from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism that occurs during the embryonic period. The main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that adrenergic hormones provide critical stimulation of energy metabolism during embryonic/fetal development. We examined ATP and ADP concentrations in mouse embryos lacking adrenergic hormones due to targeted disruption of the essential dopamine β-hydroxylase (Dbh) gene. Embryonic ATP concentrations decreased dramatically, whereas ADP concentrations rose such that the ATP/ADP ratio in the adrenergic-deficient group was nearly 50-fold less than that found in littermate controls by embryonic day 11.5. We also found that cardiac extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption rates were significantly decreased, and mitochondria were significantly larger and more branched in adrenergic-deficient hearts. Notably, however, the mitochondria were intact with well-formed cristae, and there was no significant difference observed in mitochondrial membrane potential. Maternal administration of the adrenergic receptor agonists isoproterenol or l-phenylephrine significantly ameliorated the decreases in ATP observed in Dbh-/- embryos, suggesting that α- and β-adrenergic receptors were effective modulators of ATP concentrations in mouse embryos in vivo. These data demonstrate that adrenergic hormones stimulate cardiac energy metabolism during a critical period of embryonic development.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26390217>Isoproterenol Increases Uncoupling, , and Markers of Beiging in Mature 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Beta-adrenergic activation stimulates uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), enhancing metabolic rate. In vitro, most work has studied brown adipocytes, however, few have investigated more established adipocyte lines such as the murine 3T3-L1 line. To assess the effect of beta-adrenergic activation, mature 3T3-L1s were treated for 6 or 48 hours with or without isoproterenol (10 and 100 μM) following standard differentiation supplemented with thyroid hormone (T3; 1 nM). The highest dose of isoproterenol increased lipid content following 48 hours of treatment. This concentration enhanced UCP1 mRNA and protein expression. The increase in UCP1 following 48 hours of isoproterenol increased oxygen consumption rate. Further, coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain was disturbed and an enhancement of glycolytic rate was measured alongside this, indicating an attempt to meet the energy demands of the cell. Lastly, markers of beige adipocytes (protein content of CD137 and gene transcript of CITED1) were also found to be upregulated at 48 hours of isoproterenol treatment. This data indicates that mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes are responsive to isoproterenol and induce UCP1 expression and activity.

Four vascular spasmogenic agents, methoxamine, acetylcholine, histamine and potassium, each with a different mode of action were used to produce responses in guinea-pig isolated portal vein. In each case the responses were significantly reduced by hypoxia or hypoxia and a substrate-free environment. 3. Pre-incubation of the vein with alpha-tocopherol protected the noradrenaline-induced responses against hypoxia in the substrate-free environment, However, at the EC50 concentration for protection of noradrenaline, alpha-tocopherol failed to protect the responses of each agent from the inhibitory effects of hypoxia, suggesting a mechanism of protection involving noradrenaline. 4. Drugs known to interfere with the disposition of noradrenaline in sympathetically innervated tissues, cocaine, hydrocortisone and tyramine did not affect the response to alpha-tocopherol. 5. Responses to calcium were unaffected by alpha-tocopherol in normoxia and hypoxia. 6. The protective action of alpha-tocopherol was not mimicked by the chromanol ring of the vitamin structure, Trolox C, suggesting that the vascular protection in hypoxia was not dependent on an antioxidant mechanism. 7. However, the glycolytic enzyme inhibitor, iodoacetic acid, prevented the protective action of the vitamin in hypoxia, suggesting that alpha-tocopherol enhanced noradrenaline-mediated activity in hypoxia through an iodoacetic acid-sensitive pathway.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29761924>Decreased hepatic response to glucagon, adrenergic agonists, and cAMP in glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and  in tumor-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>The response to glucagon and adrenaline in cancer cachexia is poorly known.

Nevertheless, epinephrine is widely used around the world and the reported morbidity and mortality rates with it are no different from those observed with other vasopressors. In volunteers, epinephrine increases heart rate, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output. Epinephrine also induces hyperglycemia and hyperlactatemia. In hyperkinetic septic shock, epinephrine consistently increases arterial pressure and cardiac output in a dose dependent manner. Epinephrine transiently increases lactate levels through an increase in aerobic . Epinephrine has no effect on splanchnic circulation in dopamine-sensitive septic shock. On the other hand, in dopamine-resistant septic shock, epinephrine has no effect on tonometric parameters but decreases fractional splanchnic blood flow with an increase in the gradient of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) and hepatic venous oxygen saturation (SHO2). In conclusion, epinephrine has predictable effects on systemic hemodynamics and is as efficient as norepinephrine in correcting hemodynamic disturbances of septic shock. Moreover, epinephrine is cheaper than other commonly used catecholamine regimens in septic shock.

The severity and localization of impaired cerebral blood flow and metabolism are still largely unknown. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy offers the opportunity to investigate cerebral energy metabolism and neuronal damage noninvasively and longitudinally. Previous 1H MR spectroscopy studies have shown an increased lactate resonance that is suggestive of anaerobic . The aim of this study was to assess cerebral damage and energy metabolism in kaolin-induced hydrocephalus in adult rats by using in vivo 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy. The presence of lactate was correlated with high-energy phosphate metabolism and intracellular pH. The measurement of relative concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and total creatine (tCr) served to assess neuronal damage.Hydrocephalus was induced in adult rats by surgical injection of kaolin into the cisterna magna. Magnetic resonance studies, using a 4.7-tesla magnet, were performed longitudinally in hydrocephalic animals at 1 (10 rats), 8 (six rats), and 16 weeks (six rats) thereafter, as well as in eight control animals. To evaluate ventricular size and white matter edema T2-weighted MR imaging was performed. The 1H MR spectra were acquired from a 240-microl voxel, positioned centrally in the brain, followed by localized 31P MR spectroscopy on a two-dimensional column that contained the entire brain but virtually no extracranial muscles. The 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy peak ratios were calculated after fitting the spectra in the time domain, intracellular pH was estimated from the inorganic phosphate (Pi) chemical shift, and T2 relaxation times of 1H metabolites were determined from the signal decay at increasing echo times.In hydrocephalic rats, ventricular expansion stabilized after 8 weeks. White matter edema was most pronounced during acute hydrocephalus. Lactate peaks were increased at all time points, without a decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi and PCr/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) peak ratios, or pH. Possibly lactate production is restricted to periventricular brain tissue, followed by its accumulation in cerebrospinal fluid, which is supported by the long lactate T2 relaxation time. Alternatively, lactate production may precede impairment of ATP homeostasis. The NAA/Cho and tCr/Cho ratios significantly decreased during the acute and chronic stages of hydrocephalus. These changes were not caused by alterations in metabolite T2 relaxation time. The decreases in the NAA/Cho and tCr/Cho ratios implicate neuronal loss/dysfunction or changes in membrane phospholipid metabolism, as in myelin damage or gliosis. It is suggested that 1H MR spectroscopy can be of additional value in the assessment of energy metabolism and cerebral damage in clinical hydrocephalus.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29051371>Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>Nerves closely associate with blood vessels and help to pattern the vasculature during development. Recent work suggests that newly formed nerve fibers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic nerve-derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic  for angiogenesis. We found that the loss of endothelial , the gene encoding the β-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of  and , a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by  deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression. This cross-talk between nerves and endothelial metabolism could potentially be targeted as an anticancer therapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The second intermediate stage is made up of two phases: the initial A phase being susceptible to inhibition of oxidative metabolism in the tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) system with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and a second DNP-insensitive B phase. The studies reported in this paper found that doses of the metabolic toxins fluoroacetate (0.2 mM) and fluorocitrate (0.1 mM) previously reported to disrupt the astrocytic TCA cycle only, also disrupt the A (but not the B) phase of intermediate memory, suggesting an interaction between the astrocytic and neuronal oxidative systems may be required to meet the metabolic demands of this earlier phase. The B phase, on the other hand, was not expressed in the presence of the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate (1 mM), suggesting that  (known to be more efficient in astrocytes) and glycogenolysis (which may be exclusive to astrocytes) may support this second phase of intermediate memory. In this regard, the rise in forebrain noradrenaline levels previously reported to occur before the appearance of the B phase is particularly relevant. Given that noradrenaline has been shown to be capable of enhancing glycogenolysis in astrocyte-enriched cell cultures, it is conceivable that noradrenaline exerts an effect on memory by stimulating the glycolytic system in astrocytes, thereby providing energy or metabolites (e.g. pyruvate) needed to sustain the cellular processes operating during the B phase of intermediate memory.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705769>Agonist-induced hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction are associated with selective reduction in glucose oxidation: a metabolic contribution to heart failure with normal ejection fraction.</a></h2><p>Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems may alter the cardiac energy substrate preference, thereby contributing to the progression of heart failure with normal ejection fraction. We assessed the qualitative and quantitative effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the α-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE), on cardiac energy metabolism in experimental models of hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and the role of the Ang II type 1 receptor.Ang II (1.5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) or PE (40 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) was administered to 9-week-old male C57/BL6 wild-type mice for 14 days via implanted microosmotic pumps. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, with preserved systolic function in Ang II- and PE-treated mice. Ang II induced marked reduction in cardiac glucose oxidation and lactate oxidation, with no change in  and fatty acid β-oxidation. Tricarboxylic acid acetyl coenzyme A production and ATP production were reduced in response to Ang II. Cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression was upregulated by Ang II and PE, resulting in a reduction in the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, the rate-limiting step for carbohydrate oxidation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 upregulation correlated with the activation of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway in response to Ang II. Ang II type 1 receptor blockade normalized the activation of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway and prevented the reduction in glucose oxidation but increased fatty acid oxidation.Ang II- and PE-induced hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction is associated with reduced glucose oxidation because of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase-retinoblastoma protein-E2F-induced upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, and targeting these pathways may provide novel therapy for heart failure with normal ejection fraction.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9038997>Effect of hypoxemia on tissue glycogen content and glycolytic enzyme activities in fetal sheep.</a></h2><p>We have tested the hypothesis that prolonged fetal hypoxemia causes a reduction in glycogenolytic enzyme activities and/or a depletion of fetal glycogen stores. We compared the effects of short (4 h) and prolonged (24 h) periods of reduced maternal uterine blood flow (RUBF) on glycogen content and on the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), glycogen phosphorylase (GPase), and glycogen synthase (GSase) in selected fetal tissues. RUBF was reduced in 10 pregnant sheep at 135 days of gestation (term approximately 146 days) for either 4 h (n = 5) or 24 h (n = 5); 5 other fetuses were used as controls. During RUBF, fetal SaC2 was decreased from 61.6 +/- 3.9 to 22.0 +/- 1.4% at 4 h and to 26.7 +/- 1.2% at 24 h. Hepatic glycogen content was significantly reduced at 4 h of RUBF, but was not reduced further at 24 h. Fetal liver GPase (active and total enzyme activity) and G-6-Pase activities were reduced at 4 h of RUBF but tended to return toward control values at 24 h. Similarly, hepatic GSase activity tended to decrease at 4 h of RUBF, although the reduction was not quite significant (P = 0.08). We conclude that RUBF causes a reduction of fetal glycogen stores and a reduction in G-6-Pase and GPase activity at 4 h. Fetal tissue glycogen contents were not reduced further at 24 h, compared with 4 h of RUBF, which indicates that fetal glycogenolysis is reduced during this time, probably because of the inhibition of GPase and G-6-Pase.

HIF1α represents one of the principal regulators of metabolism and energetic balance in cancer cells through its regulation of , glycogen synthesis, Krebs cycle and the pentose phosphate shunt. However, less is known about the role of HIF1α in modulating lipid metabolism. Lipids serve cancer cells to provide molecules acting as oncogenic signals, energetic reserve, precursors for new membrane synthesis and to balance redox biological reactions.

Metabolism was determined in terms of peak and total release of purines (adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine), lactate and noradrenaline during reperfusion; and myocardial content of nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP), glycogen and noradrenaline at the end of reperfusion. An inverse relationship (r = -0.79) existed between duration of ischemia and developed pressure post-ischemia. Early during reperfusion, after 12 min of ischemia, the purine concentration (peak release) increased 100x (p < 0.01), that of lactate and noradrenaline 10x (p < 0.05). Total purine release rose with progression of the ischemic period (30x after 36 min of ischemia; p < 0.01), concomitant with a reduction in nucleotide content. Lactate release was independent from the duration of ischemia, although glycogen had declined by 30% (p < 0.01) after 36 min of ischemia. The acid insoluble glycogen fraction, which presumably contains proglycogen, increased substantially during short-term ischemia. Peak noradrenaline increased 100x, and 200x, (p < 0.05) after 24 and 36 min of ischemia, respectively. Total noradrenaline release due to various periods of ischemia mirrored its peak release. Function recovery was inversely related to total purine and noradrenaline efflux (both r = -0.81); it correlated with tissue nucleotide content (r = 0.84). In conclusion, larger amounts of noradrenaline are released only after a substantial drop in myocardial ATP. During severe ischemia ATP consumption more than limited ATP production by anaerobic , is a key factor affecting recovery on subsequent reperfusion. In contrast to lactate efflux, purine and noradrenaline release are useful markers of ischemic and reperfusion damage.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046311>Role of beta-adrenoceptors in memory consolidation: beta3-adrenoceptors act on glucose uptake and beta2-adrenoceptors on glycogenolysis.</a></h2><p>Noradrenaline, acting via beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors (AR), enhances memory formation in single trial-discriminated avoidance learning in day-old chicks by mechanisms involving changes in metabolism of glucose and/or glycogen. Earlier studies of memory consolidation in chicks implicated beta(3)- rather than beta(2)-ARs in enhancement of memory consolidation by glucose, but did not elucidate whether stimulation of glucose uptake or of  was responsible. This study examines the role of glucose transport in memory formation using central injection of the nonselective facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor cytochalasin B, the endothelial/astrocytic GLUT-1 inhibitor phloretin and the Na(+)/energy-dependent endothelial glucose transporter (SGLT) inhibitor phlorizin. Cytochalasin B inhibited memory when injected into the mesopallium (avian cortex) either close to or between 25 and 45 min after training, whereas phloretin and phlorizin only inhibited memory at 30 min. This suggested that astrocytic/endothelial (GLUT-1) transport is critical at the time of consolidation, whereas a different transporter, probably the neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT-3), is important at the time of training. Inhibition of glucose transport by cytochalasin B, phloretin, or phlorizin also interfered with beta(3)-AR-mediated memory enhancement 20 min posttraining, whereas inhibition of glycogenolysis interfered with beta(2)-AR agonist enhancement of memory. We conclude that in astrocytes (1) activities of both GLUT-1 and SGLT are essential for memory consolidation 30 min posttraining; (2) neuronal GLUT-3 is essential at the time of training; and (3) beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs consolidate memory by different mechanisms; beta(3)-ARs stimulate central glucose transport, whereas beta(2)-ARs stimulate central glycogenolysis.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570033>In vitro growth environment produces lipidomic and electron transport chain abnormalities in mitochondria from non-tumorigenic astrocytes and brain tumours.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial lipidome influences ETC (electron transport chain) and cellular bioenergetic efficiency.

Ouabain had no apparent effect on local blood flow.Increased Na+-K+ATPase activity during epinephrine treatment or hemorrhage contributes to muscle lactate production.

Thirty minutes of noradrenaline incubation induced a significant increase in the Vo/Vmax ratio of pyruvate kinase. The S0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate of the enzyme significantly increased in the presence of noradrenaline while the Km for ADP decreased. In response to hormonal stimulation the Na +/H+ exchange was activated as was shown by the increase in Na+ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate from the 3rd min of incubation. All these effects were specific to alpha1 and beta antagonists. High concentrations of fructose diphosphate significantly activated the enzyme in the presence of noradrenaline but not in its absence. Furthermore, the presence of noradrenaline partially released the inhibition of the enzyme by adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The results suggest that noradrenaline stimulates  through pyruvate kinase activation. The mechanism of stimulation may is through Na+/H+ exchange activation, cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564527>Exploration of candidate biomarkers for human psoriasis based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry serum metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that dysregulated metabolic pathways are linked to psoriasis pathogenesis. However, an extensive, unbiased metabolic analysis in patients with psoriasis has not been completely explored. The metabolome represents the end products of proteomics or cellular processes that may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis.To determine the differences in serum metabolomic profiles among patients with psoriasis and healthy controls with the goal of identifying potential biomarkers in patients with psoriasis.Serum metabolomic profiles from 29 subjects (14 patients with psoriasis and 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls). The serum metabolites were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on a combined full scan and selected-ion monitoring mode.Multivariate statistical analysis of metabolomics data revealed altered serum metabolites between the patients with psoriasis and healthy individuals. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with psoriasis had higher levels of amino acids including asparagine, aspartic acid, isoleucine, phenylalanine, ornithine and proline; higher levels of lactic acid and urea; and lower levels of crotonic acid, azelaic acid,  and cholesterol.It appears that the  pathway and amino acid metabolic activity are increased in patients with psoriasis. These metabolic perturbations may stem from increased demand for protein biosynthesis and keratinocyte hyperproliferation.

Feeding rats a high-calorie diet resulted in increases in body weight, visceral fat content, cardiac hypertrophy, plasma insulin, nonesterified free fatty acid, and triglyceride concentrations. In the absence of both insulin and fatty acids in the coronary perfusate, the hearts of obese rats developed an increased infarct size (41.9 +/- 1.9% for obese vs. 22.9 +/- 2.3% for control, P < 0.05) and a reduced percent recovery of aortic output (4.2 +/- 4.2% for obese vs. 27.7 +/- 3.4% for controls, P < 0.05) after coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. In the presence of insulin in the coronary perfusate, a cardioprotective effect was noted in both groups, an action that was greater in hearts from obese compared with control rats and which abolished the obesity-induced changes in infarct size (13.8 +/- 1.2% for controls vs. 21.0 +/- 1.6% for obese), and percent recovery of aortic output (60.2 +/- 4.7% for controls vs. 45.7 +/- 9.4% for obese). Fatty acids (0.7 mM, control; and 1.5 mM, obese) added to the coronary perfusate with in vivo concentrations of insulin dramatically increased infarct size (48.2 +/- 3.1% for obese, and 37.5 +/- 2.7% for control; P < 0.05 vs. without fatty acids) and decreased percent aortic output recovery (control, 10.4 +/- 5.2%, and obese 7.8 +/- 3.5%; P < 0.05 vs. without fatty acids) in both groups to similar values. In conclusion, in obesity, the impact of an increased susceptibility of the myocardium to ischemic-reperfusion injury on myocardial injury is likely to be overshadowed by the comparatively greater roles played by predicted increases in circulating insulin and fatty acids found in vivo. These data support the notion that adiposity per se is unlikely to be a valuable predictor of outcomes in ischemic-reperfusion injury.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9107623>Wingate test performance in children with asthma: aerobic or anaerobic limitation?</a></h2><p>To investigate the anaerobic capacity in children with bronchial asthma, eight male children with atopic asthma (age: 12 +/- 1.7 yr) and seven healthy control subjects (age: 12 +/- 1 yr) performed a 30-s all-out exercise test: the Wingate anaerobic test (WanT). Post-exercise plasma epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), venous blood lactate (La), and blood pH levels were determined. Peak power (Ppeak), mean power (Pm), and total energy expenditure (Wtot) during the WanT were assessed. The relative importance of aerobic (WO2) and anaerobic (Wana) energy release during the WanT was also evaluated. In comparison with control subjects, the children with asthma exhibited lower Ppeak (W.kg-1): 6 +/- 1.14 vs 7.3 +/- 0.5, P < 0.05; lower Pm (W.kg-1): 4.7 +/- 0.8 vs 5.9 +/- 0.5, P < 0.05; and lower Wtot (Jg-1): 140.3 +/- 25 vs 176.9 +/- 19, P < 0.05. The relative contribution of WO2 (26%) and Wana (74%) to the Wtot was identical in both groups. Blood lactate and pH kinetics revealed significantly lower La values and less acidosis in the asthmatic group (P < 0.001).

In the liver, C. aurantium (bitter orange) extracts affect hemodynamics, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxygen uptake. The purpose of the present work was to quantify the action of p-synephrine and also to obtain indications about its mechanism of action, a task that would be difficult to accomplish with C. aurantium extracts due to their rather complex composition. The experimental system was the isolated perfused rat liver. p-Synephrine significantly stimulated glycogenolysis, , gluconeogenesis, and oxygen uptake. The compound also increased the portal perfusion pressure and the redox state of the cytosolic NAD(+)/NADH couple. A Ca(2+)-dependency for both the hemodynamic and the metabolic effects of p-synephrine was found. p-Synephrine stimulated both cAMP overflow and the initial Ca(2+) release from the cellular stores previously labeled with (45)Ca(2+). The metabolic and hemodynamic actions of p-synephrine were strongly inhibited by α-adrenergic antagonists and moderately affected by β-adrenergic antagonists. The results allow to conclude that p-synephrine presents important metabolic and hemodynamic effects in the liver. These effects can be considered as both catabolic (glycogenolysis) and anabolic (gluconeogenesis), they are mediated by both α- and β-adrenergic signaling, require the simultaneous participation of both Ca(2+) and cAMP, and could be contributing to the overall stimulation of metabolism that usually occurs during weight loss periods.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666220>Synergistic antiproliferative effects of an mTOR inhibitor (rad001) plus gemcitabine on cholangiocarcinoma by decreasing choline kinase activity.</a></h2><p>Although gemcitabine plus cisplatin is the gold standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced cholangiocarcinoma, the response rate has been disappointing. This study aims to investigate a novel therapeutic regimen [gemcitabine plus everolimus (rad001), an mTOR inhibitor] for cholangiocarcinoma. Gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, cetuximab and rad001 in various combinations were first evaluated  using six cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.  therapeutic efficacies of gemcitabine and rad001 alone and their combination were further evaluated using a xenograft mouse model and a chemically induced orthotopic cholangiocarcinoma rat model. In the  study, gemcitabine plus rad001 exerted a synergistic therapeutic effect on the cholangiocarcinoma cells, irrespective of the  mutation status. In the xenograft study, gemcitabine plus rad001 showed the best therapeutic effect on tumor volume change, and was associated with increased caspase-3 expression, decreased eIF4E expression, as well as overexpression of both death receptor- and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway-related genes. In a chemically induced cholangiocarcinoma-afflicted rat model, the gemcitabine plus rad001 treatment suppressed tumor  as measured by F-fludeoxyglucose micro-positron emission tomography. Also, increased intratumoral free choline, decreased glycerophosphocholine and nearly undetectable phosphocholine levels were demonstrated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, supported by results of decreased choline kinase expression in western blotting. We concluded that gemcitabine plus rad001 has a synergistic antiproliferative effect on cholangiocarcinoma, irrespective of the  mutation status.

We hypothesized that post-traumatic metabolic changes occur early (<24 h) and persist for up to 1 week. Immature rats underwent TBI to the left parietal cortex. Brains were removed at 4 h, 24 h, and 7 days after injury, and separated into ipsilateral (injured) and contralateral (control) hemispheres. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained, and spectra were analyzed for N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), lactate (Lac), creatine (Cr), choline, and alanine, with metabolite ratios determined (NAA/Cr, Lac/Cr). There were no metabolic differences at any time in sham controls between cerebral hemispheres. At 4 and 24 h, there was an increase in Lac/Cr, reflecting increased  and/or decreased oxidative metabolism. At 24 h and 7 days, there was a decrease in NAA/Cr, indicating loss of neuronal integrity.

Rats were treated after 90 min by epinephrine ( n=14), norepinephrine ( n=14), or hydroxyethyl starch ( n=14). Three groups of six rats served as time-matched control groups and received saline, epinephrine, or norepinephrine from 90 to 180 degrees min. Mean arterial pressure, aortic, renal, mesenteric and femoral blood flow, arterial blood gases, lactate, pyruvate, and nitrate were measured at baseline and 90 and 180 min after endotoxin challenge. At the end of experiments biopsy samples were taken from the liver, heart, muscle, kidney, and small intestine for tissue adenine nucleotide and lactate/pyruvate measurements.Endotoxin induced a decrease in mean arterial pressure and in aortic, mesenteric, and renal blood flow. Plasmatic and tissue lactate increased with a high lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio. ATP decreased in liver, kidney, and heart. The ATP/ADP ratio did not change, and phosphocreatinine decreased in all organs. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increased mean arterial pressure to baseline values.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate FNDC5 expression and the functional significance of irisn in skeletal muscle remain unknown. In this study, we explored the potential pathways that induce FNDC5 expression and delineated the metabolic effects of irisin on skeletal muscle.C2C12 myotubes were treated with drugs at various concentrations and durations. The expression and activation of genes were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Oxidative phosphorylation was quantified by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR).We found that the exercise-mimicking treatment (cAMP, forskolin and isoproterenol) increased Fndc5 expression in C2C12 myotubes. CREB over-expressed C2C12 myotubes displayed higher Fndc5 expression. CREB over-expression also promoted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) expression. PGC-1α-induced Fndc5 expression was blocked when the dominant negative form of CREB (S133A) was present. PGC-1α mutation (S570A) also decreased Fndc5 expression. Immunoprecipitation showed that overexpressed PGC-1α complexed with CREB in HEK293 cells. C2C12 myotubes treated with forskolin also increased endogenous CREB and PGC-1α binding. Functionally, irisin treatment increased mitochondrial respiration, enhanced ATP production, promoted fatty acid oxidation but decreased  in myotubes.Our observation indicates that cAMP-mediated PGC-1α/CREB interaction triggers Fndc5 expression, which acts as an autocrine/paracrine to shape the metabolic phenotype of myotubes.© 2018 The Author(s).

An effective model must remain stable during perfusion but respond appropriately to metabolic and vascular stimuli. We describe the design and characterization of a tubed superficial epigastric isolated perfusion flap.Tubed superficial epigastric flaps were created in 20 male Sprague Dawley rats. Forty-eight hours later the femoral vessels were cannulated and the flaps were perfused using a Krebs-Heinseleit buffer containing albumin for a period of 2 h. In five of the flaps norepinephrine and acetylcholine were added sequentially to the perfusate to determine vascular reactivity. In a further four flaps insulin (20 U/liter) and iodoacetate (5 mM) were added to the perfusate to confirm that the flap was metabolically active and reactive. Venous outflow was collected at regular intervals and analyzed for electrolytes, lactate, and glucose content. Vascularity and skin perfusion were characterized using barium microangiography and methylene blue dye injection.This flap model was found to be stable in terms of arterial pressure, electrolyte levels, and lactate production over the perfusion period. Norepinephrine caused a sharp increase in vascular resistance, which was reversed by administration of acetylcholine. Lactate production increased appropriately with the addition of insulin to the perfusate with a rapid decline following addition of the  inhibitor iodoacetate. There was no leakage of perfusate or significant swelling of the flap during the perfusion.The tubed superficial epigastric artery flap makes an effective model for isolated perfusion studies of the skin with a wide range of experimental applications.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8670120>Epidermal growth factor administration decreases liver glycogen and causes mild hyperglycaemia in mice.</a></h2><p>Several laboratories report different effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on glycogen metabolism in hepatocytes. The discrepancies may be attributed to differences in the experimental conditions. It is therefore important to establish the actual effect of EGF in vivo. Because large physiological variations of EGF concentration in plasma occur in mice, we used this species to address this question. In freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes, EGF increased glycogen degradation in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal effect (36% increase over basal glycogenolysis) was smaller than maximal effects of classical glycogenolytic hormones like adrenaline or glucagon (more than 150% increase over basal). This is in keeping with the smaller effect of EGF on phosphorylase a activity. In contrast with these hormones, EGF did not inhibit . Thus these effects of EGF in mouse hepatocytes are similar to those recently described by us in rat hepatocytes [Quintana, Grau, Moreno, Soler, Ramirez and Soley (1995) Biochem J 308, 889-894]. When administered to whole animals, EGF increased phosphorylase a activity, decreased the glycogen content in the liver and caused mild hyperglycaemia. Taking together the results obtained for isolated cells and for whole animals, we suggest that the glucosyl residues released from glycogen are used mostly by the liver rather than released to the circulation. This would be different from the action of the classical glycogenolytic hormones, adrenaline and glucagon.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893408>MRL/lpr mice have alterations in brain metabolism as shown with [1H-13C] NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Cerebral glucose metabolism and cerebral blood flow are altered in patients with lupus who have neuropsychiatric manifestations. However, the dynamics of changes in glucose metabolism remain unclear. The present study was undertaken using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the rates of incorporation of glucose into amino acids and lactate via cell-specific pathways in mice with lupus. In the well-established MRL/lpr lupus mouse model, 24-week-old mice had a significant increase of 30-80% (P<0.001) in total brain glutamine, glutamate and lactate concentrations, while alanine, aspartate, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) remained unchanged as compared to the congenic MRL+/+control mice. Although succinate concentration was increased in lupus brain, it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, 13C isotopomer analysis showed a selective increase of de novo synthesis of lactate from [1-(13)C] glucose through  resulting in 1.5-fold increased fractional 13C enrichments in lactate in MRL/lpr mice. [4-(13)C] Glutamate, which is synthesized mainly by the neuronal pyruvate dehydogenase, was selectively increased, while [2-(13)C] and [3-(13)C] GABA synthesis were decreased by 25% compared to controls. In accordance with the total concentrations, aspartate synthesis remained unaltered in brains of lupus mice, while alanine synthesis was elevated, indicating increased utilization of alanine. Creatine was unchanged in MRL/lpr mice as compared to controls. An interesting finding was a significant increase (158%, P<0.005) in choline concentration in MRL/lpr mice while the myo-inositol concentration remained the same in both groups. Furthermore a significant increase in total brain water content was observed, indicative of possible edema. In conclusion, the cumulative effect of increased brain lactate synthesis, altered glucose metabolism and intracellular glutamine accumulation could be an important mechanism causing brain pathology in SLE. The alteration in metabolites could alter downstream pathways and cause neurological dysfunction.

However, it remains to be determined how methylglyoxal affects the regulatory mechanisms of retinal blood flow. In this study, we examined the effects of methylglyoxal on β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatory mechanisms in rat retinal arterioles. The retinal vasodilator responses were assessed by measuring the diameter of retinal arterioles in the fundus images. Intravitreal injection of methylglyoxal significantly diminished the vasodilation of retinal arterioles induced by the β-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol. The vasodilator effect of BMS-191011, a large-conductance Ca-activated K (BK) channel opener, on retinal arterioles was also attenuated by methylglyoxal. In contrast, methylglyoxal had no significant effect on retinal vasodilator response to forskolin. Methylglyoxal attenuated retinal vasodilator response to salbutamol under blockade of BK channels with iberiotoxin, an inhibitor of the channels. These results suggest that methylglyoxal attenuates β-adrenoceptor-mediated retinal vasodilation by impairing the coupling of the β-adrenoceptor to the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs protein) and the function of the BK channel.

The metabolic differences between these subgroups were reflected in the levels of albumin and acute-phase proteins, the degree of returning to normality for multiple metabolic pathways including , TCA cycle, gut microbiota functions, and metabolisms of lipids, choline and vitamin B3. These findings provided some essential details for the dynamic metabolic changes associated with the carrageenan-induced self-limiting inflammation and demonstrated the combined NMR and GC-FID/MS analysis as a powerful approach for understanding biochemical aspects of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27731374>Exercise Training Alleviates Hypoxia-induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Lymphocytes of Sedentary Males.</a></h2><p>This study elucidates how interval and continuous exercise regimens affect the mitochondrial functionality of lymphocytes under hypoxic stress. Sixty healthy sedentary males were randomly assigned to engage in either high-intensity interval training (HIIT, 3 min intervals at 80% and 40% VO, n = 20) or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT, sustained 60% VO, n = 20) for 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks or were assigned to a control group that did not receive exercise intervention (n = 20). Lymphocyte phenotypes/mitochondrial functionality under hypoxic exercise (HE, 100 W under 12% O) were determined before and after the various interventions. Before the intervention, HE (i) increased the mobilization of senescent (CD57/CD28) lymphocytes into the blood, (ii) decreased the ATP-linked O consumption rate (OCR), the reserve capacity of OCR, and the citrate synthase activity in the mitochondria, and (iii) lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential (MP) and elevated the matrix oxidant burden (MOB) of lymphocytes. However, both HIIT and MICT significantly (i) decreased blood senescent lymphocyte counts, (ii) enhanced the mitochondrial OCR with increased citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, (iii) increased mitochondrial MP and decreased MOB and (iv) increased the ratio of mitofusin to DRP-1 in lymphocytes after HE. Thus, we concluded that either HIIT or MICT effectively improves lymphocyte mitochondrial functionality by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and suppressing oxidative damage under hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22524679>Carvedilol suppresses fatty acid oxidation and stimulates  in C2C12 cells.</a></h2><p>Beta adrenergic receptor blocking drugs (β-blockers) are used chronically in many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Beneficial effects are associated with the inhibition of symphathetic nervous system hyperactivity, reduction of heart rate, and remodeling by blocking the mitogenic activity of catecholamines. A possible effect of β-blockers on substrate metabolism has also been suggested. The direct effects of β-blockers on mouse C2C12 cells were investigated in this study. C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and differentiated into myotubes in the same medium that contained 1% FBS. Palmitic acid oxidation and  were measured by using [9,10-(3)H]palmitate and [5-(3)H]glucose, respectively. The amount of (3)H(2)O was measured as an indicator of substrate usage. Carvedilol (100 µmol/L) inhibited palmitate oxidation and increased  by nearly 50%. Prazosin altered substrate metabolism in a similar fashion as carvedilol, whereas propranolol or bisoprolol were devoid of metabolic effects. When added to mimic sympathetic activation, epinephrine stimulated  but did not alter fatty acid oxidation. Based on these results, carvedilol appears to have direct effects on substrate metabolism that are related to the blockade of α1 adrenergic receptors.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15878678>Free fatty acid metabolism in the air-breathing African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) during asphyxia.</a></h2><p>In several waterbreathing fish species, hypoxia induces a decrease in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels as opposed to an increase in air-breathing mammals. We hypothesised that this change is coupled to the mode of breathing. Therefore, we followed the metabolic response of cannulated air-breathing African catfish to an 8-h asphyxia period. The hematocrit and hemoglobin increased significantly upon asphyxia. However, no change was observed in the mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, indicating that more erythrocytes were brought into circulation. A continuous increase in plasma lactate concentration during asphyxia showed permanent activation of anaerobic , pointing to a persistent oxygen shortage. Plasma glucose levels did not change, but FFA levels decreased significantly upon asphyxia with a concomitant increase in plasma noradrenaline levels.

Thus endogenous ANG II may have a tonic effect on tissue metabolism that could be reversed with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, particularly during adrenergic stimulation. We studied 14 obese men. They were treated for 10 days with the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan or with placebo in a double-blind and crossover fashion. At the end of each treatment period, we assessed skeletal muscle and adipose tissue metabolism using the microdialysis technique. The ethanol dilution technique was applied to follow changes in tissue blood flow. Measurements were obtained at baseline and during application of incremental isoproterenol concentrations through the microdialysis catheter. Blood pressure decreased from 133 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3/79 +/- 2 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood, respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively) with AT1 receptor blockade. Isoproterenol perfusion caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. Irbesartan slightly reduced the isoproterenol-induced glycerol response in adipose tissue (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Ethanol ratio, interstitial glucose supply, and lactate production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were similar with placebo and irbesartan. We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese men does not reveal a major tonic ANG II effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, or  in skeletal muscle, either at rest or during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Endogeneous ANG II may slightly increase adipose tissue lipolysis. The mechanism may promote the redistribution of triglycerides from adipose tissue toward other organs.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22977253>Kinetic modeling of human hepatic glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus predicts higher risk of hypoglycemic events in rigorous insulin therapy.</a></h2><p>A major problem in the insulin therapy of patients with diabetes type 2 (T2DM) is the increased occurrence of hypoglycemic events which, if left untreated, may cause confusion or fainting and in severe cases seizures, coma, and even death. To elucidate the potential contribution of the liver to hypoglycemia in T2DM we applied a detailed kinetic model of human hepatic glucose metabolism to simulate changes in , gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism induced by deviations of the hormones insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine from their normal plasma profiles. Our simulations reveal in line with experimental and clinical data from a multitude of studies in T2DM, (i) significant changes in the relative contribution of , gluconeogenesis, and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization; (ii) decreased postprandial glycogen storage as well as increased glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term fasting; and (iii) a shift of the set point defining the switch between hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization to elevated plasma glucose levels, respectively, in T2DM relative to normal, healthy subjects. Intriguingly, our model simulations predict a restricted gluconeogenic response of the liver under impaired hormonal signals observed in T2DM, resulting in an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The inability of hepatic glucose metabolism to effectively counterbalance a decline of the blood glucose level becomes even more pronounced in case of tightly controlled insulin treatment. Given this Janus face mode of action of insulin, our model simulations underline the great potential that normalization of the plasma glucagon profile may have for the treatment of T2DM.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23227809>The genome of Pelobacter carbinolicus reveals surprising metabolic capabilities and physiological features.</a></h2><p>The bacterium Pelobacter carbinolicus is able to grow by fermentation, syntrophic hydrogen/formate transfer, or electron transfer to sulfur from short-chain alcohols, hydrogen or formate; it does not oxidize acetate and is not known to ferment any sugars or grow autotrophically.

Multiple isozymes of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, ATP synthase and [FeFe]-hydrogenase were differentiated and assigned roles according to their structural properties and genomic contexts. The absence of asparagine synthetase and the presence of a mutant tRNA for asparagine encoded among RNA-active enzymes suggest that P. carbinolicus may make asparaginyl-tRNA in a novel way. Catabolic glutamate dehydrogenases were discovered, implying that the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle can function catabolically. A phosphotransferase system for uptake of sugars was discovered, along with enzymes that function in 2,3-butanediol production. Pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase was identified as a potential bottleneck in both the supply of oxaloacetate for oxidation of acetate by the TCA cycle and the connection of  to production of ethanol.

We hypothesized that patients with sepsis without shock and increased epinephrine levels or an increased muscle-to-serum lactate gradient are likely to evolve towards septic shock. Thus, in sepsis patients, we investigated (1) whether muscle produces lactate and pyruvate, and (2) whether muscle lactate production is linked to epinephrine levels and the severity of the patient's condition.We studied 40 ventilated patients with sepsis without shock or hyperlactatemia and a control group of 10 ICU patients without infection. A microdialysis probe was inserted into the quadriceps muscle. Plasma lactate and pyruvate concentrations were measured in both the dialysate fluid and arterial blood samples every 6 h.There was no gradient between muscle and arterial levels for lactate and pyruvate in the control group. In the sepsis group, muscle lactate and pyruvate concentrations were consistently higher than the arterial levels (P < 0.01). Plasma epinephrine concentrations were also elevated (P < 0.05). A total of 15/40 patients further developed septic shock, and on admission these patients had significantly higher musculo-arterial gradients of lactate (2.9 ± 0.3 vs. 0.7 ± 0.2 mmol/l) (P < 0.05) and pyruvate (740 ± 60 vs. 200 ± 20 μmol/l) (P < 0.05), and higher levels of epinephrine concentrations (6.2 ± 0.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.24 nmol/l) (P < 0.05).

All arteries were precontracted with 80 mM KCl and exposed to hypoxia in the absence of glucose (6 min) to deplete stored glycogen, an alternative substrate for . After depletion, sensitivity to agonists was substantially increased. The concentration of norepinephrine (NE) that induced half-maximal response (EC50) was significantly decreased under glucose-free conditions, and the maximal response was unchanged. The decrease in EC50, or increase in sensitivity, was reversed by glucose, but not by beta-hydroxybutyrate, a substrate for oxidative metabolism. Similar results were obtained in concentration-isometric force responses of histamine and KCl. Importantly, measurements of high-energy phosphagen content in freeze-clamped arteries indicate that these substrate perturbations were not associated with significant changes in global energy stores. Responses to a single dose of NE or histamine in Ca(2+)-free medium were significantly lower if intracellular Ca2+ stores were loaded in the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate than in the presence of glucose, suggesting that normal maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ stores also depends specifically on glucose.

Norepinephrine, the primary neurotransmitter secreted by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, binds to and activates β-adrenergic receptors expressed on the surface of immune cells and regulates the functions of these cells. While it is known that both activated and memory CD8 T-cells primarily express the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and that signaling through this receptor can inhibit CD8 T-cell effector function, the mechanism(s) underlying this suppression is not understood. Under normal activation conditions, T-cells increase glucose uptake and undergo metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we show that treatment of murine CD8 T-cells with the pan β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) was associated with a reduced expression of glucose transporter 1 following activation, as well as decreased glucose uptake and  compared to CD8 T-cells activated in the absence of ISO. The effect of ISO was specifically dependent upon β2-AR, since it was not seen in adrb2 CD8 T-cells and was blocked by the β-AR antagonist propranolol. In addition, we found that mitochondrial function in CD8 T-cells was also impaired by β2-AR signaling. This study demonstrates that one mechanism by which β2-AR signaling can inhibit CD8 T-cell activation is by suppressing the required metabolic reprogramming events which accompany activation of these immune cells and thus reveals a new mechanism by which adrenergic stress can suppress the effector activity of immune cells.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23401921>[Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of metabolic changes in mice brain after 2-deoxy-D-glucose injection].</a></h2><p>In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of ICR male mice was used to study the brain (hippocampus) metabolic response to the acute deficiency of the available energy or to the pro-inflammatory stimulus. Inhibition of  by means of an intraperitoneal injection with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) reduced the levels of gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline compounds, and at the same time increased the levels of glutamate and glutamine.

Prevalence of the excitatory metabolites such as glutamate and glutamine in 2DG treated mice is in good agreement with excitation observed during temporary reduction of the available energy under acute hypoxia or starvation.

TCDD elicited metabolite and gene expression changes associated with lipid metabolism and transport, choline metabolism, bile acid metabolism, , and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism is altered in mice resulting in increased hepatic triacylglycerol as well as mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (FA) levels. Mouse-specific changes included the induction of CD36 and other cell surface receptors as well as lipases- and FA-binding proteins consistent with hepatic triglyceride and FA accumulation. In contrast, there was minimal hepatic fat accumulation in rats and decreased CD36 expression.

Aerobic  reduces pyruvate flux into mitochondria, preventing a complete oxidation of glucose and shunting glucose to anabolic pathways essential for cell proliferation. Here we tested a new strategy, mitochondrial uncoupling, for its potential of antagonizing the anabolic effect of aerobic  and for its potential anticancer activities. Mitochondrial uncoupling is a process that facilitates proton influx across the mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, stimulating a futile cycle of acetyl- CoA oxidation. We tested two safe mitochondrial uncouplers, NEN (niclosamide ) and oxyclozanide, on their metabolic effects and anti-cancer activities. We used metabolomic NMR to examine the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling on glucose metabolism in colon cancer MC38 cells. We further tested the anti-cancer effect of NEN and oxyclozanide in cultured cell models, APC mouse model, and a metastatic colon cancer mouse model. Using a metabolomic NMR approach, we demonstrated that mitochondrial uncoupling promotes pyruvate influx to mitochondria and reduces various anabolic pathway activities. Moreover, mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits cell proliferation and reduces clonogenicity of cultured colon cancer cells. Furthermore, oral treatment with mitochondrial uncouplers reduces intestinal polyp formation in APC mice, and diminishes hepatic metastasis of colon cancer cells transplanted intrasplenically.

Significant issues arose in this patient's history with regards to purchase of medications, compliance and follow-up with respiratory service. Beta-adrenergic receptors when stimulated have been hypothesised to increase lipolysis, producing free fatty acids, which inhibit the conversion of pyruvate to coenzyme A within the Krebs cycle. Additional pyruvate is generated through stimulation of  and glycogenolysis through simultaneous catecholamine surge. This increased pyruvate load is shunted through anaerobic , producing increased lactate. Steroid use during an asthma attack enhances the beta-2 receptor sensitivity, further potentiating lactate production.

Indirect calorimetry and hemodynamic measurements, such as leg blood flow (LBF) and cardiac output, were performed at baseline and maximal insulin stimulation. The content of the glucose transporter GLUT 4 and muscle fiber type were evaluated in three muscle groups: vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius, and biceps. Athletes exhibited 35% higher WBGU and 30% higher LGU than controls. Basal LBF (liters per min) was higher in athletes, but the difference was not statistically significant. After insulin stimulation, LBF was 31% higher in athletes than controls (P = 0.05). Indirect calorimetry revealed that athletes had a 44% higher rate of nonoxidative glucose metabolism than controls (P = 0.01). GLUT 4 levels in vastus were 90% (P < 0.05) greater in athletes, whereas smaller differences were noted between athletes and controls in biceps and gastrocnemius. Importantly, the vastus lateralis GLUT 4 content was correlated with WBGU (r = 0.60; P < 0.05) and LGU (r = 0.62; P < 0.05). Relative numbers of oxidative fibers were increased in vastus from athletes and were positively correlated with maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), but GLUT 4 content could not be correlated with oxidative fiber content in individual controls or athletes. We conclude that in humans 1) endurance training enhances insulin's ability to increase LBF; 2) GLUT 4 is differentially expressed as a function of muscle group and is up-regulated by exercise in a muscle-specific manner; 3) in vastus lateralis, GLUT 4 levels are well correlated with insulin-stimulated rates of both WBGU and LGU; and 4) GLUT 4 content and in vivo insulin sensitivity do not vary as a function of fiber type composition. Thus, blood flow and GLUT 4 expression in muscle are important mechanisms that mediate greater insulin sensitivity in athletes.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8880357>Microcalorimetric and biochemical investigations of thermogenesis and metabolic pathways in human white adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Validation of a novel culture technique for human white adipocytes, facilitating direct microcalorimetry and simultaneously performed biochemistry for 3 days.Subcutaneous adipocytes were cultured in a 3-dimensional matrix of agarose gel. Biochemical measures were obtained every 24 h, while thermogenesis was continuously monitored for 72 h. DNA content of the cultures served as reference.73 men and women undergoing uncomplicated surgery.Cell viability (LDH release), total cellular thermogenesis, oxygen consumption, , lipolysis (basal, catecholamin-stimulated) triglyceride/free fatty acid substrate cycle, adenine nucleotides, insulin-induced thermogenesis.LDH release was 0.4% of total LDH per hour. Cellular ATP, ADP and AMP (3.77, 0.39 and 0.06 nmol/microgramDNA, resp.) were constant. The rates of glucose consumption, lactate and pyruvate production and basal glycerol release (56.4, 43.1, 2.7 and 28.1 nmol/microgramDNA.h, resp.) were stable during 72 h. Isoprenaline (1 microM) enhanced lipolytic rate by the same extent at any time of the study (glycerol release 67.8 nmol/microgramDNA.h). FFA release (initially 26.0 nmol/ microgramDNA.h) declined during the experiment, due to an increase of reesterfication rate. Unstimulated heat production was 6.5 microW/microgramDNA, 68% of which were of oxidative origin. Insulin (0.1 microM) induced thermogenesis was 8.8 microW/ microgramDNA.The results were in accordance with data from human white adipocytes in suspensions. However, in contrast to fat cell suspensions, gel cultured adipocytes were viable for 3 days without metabolic alterations.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422990>The von Hippel-Lindau Chuvash mutation in mice alters cardiac substrate and high-energy phosphate metabolism.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) appears to function as a global master regulator of cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. HIF pathway manipulation is of therapeutic interest; however, global systemic upregulation of HIF may have as yet unknown effects on multiple processes. We used a mouse model of Chuvash polycythemia (CP), a rare genetic disorder that modestly increases expression of HIF target genes in normoxia, to understand what these effects might be within the heart. An integrated in and ex vivo approach was employed. Compared with wild-type controls, CP mice had evidence (using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging) of pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and increased left ventricular ejection fraction. Glycolytic flux (measured using [(3)H]glucose) in the isolated contracting perfused CP heart was 1.8-fold higher. Net lactate efflux was 1.5-fold higher. Furthermore, in vivo (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized [(13)C1]pyruvate revealed a twofold increase in real-time flux through lactate dehydrogenase in the CP hearts and a 1.6-fold increase through pyruvate dehydrogenase. (31)P-MRS of perfused CP hearts under increased workload (isoproterenol infusion) demonstrated increased depletion of phosphocreatine relative to ATP. Intriguingly, no changes in cardiac gene expression were detected. In summary, a modest systemic dysregulation of the HIF pathway resulted in clear alterations in cardiac metabolism and energetics. However, in contrast to studies generating high HIF levels within the heart, the CP mice showed neither the predicted changes in gene expression nor any degree of LV impairment. We conclude that the effects of manipulating HIF on the heart are dose dependent.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12055332>In vivo response to alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor stimulation in human white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Recent studies in rats suggest an important effect of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor stimulation on glucose uptake in white adipocytes. It is not known if alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor stimulation elicits similar metabolic effects in humans.Three microdialysis catheters in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were perfused with 0.00, 0.01, 0.10, 1.00, and 10.00 microM isoproterenol, phenylephrine, or phenylephrine plus 100 microM propranolol. Dialysate concentrations of ethanol, glycerol, glucose, and lactate were measured for estimating blood flow (ethanol-dilution technique), lipolysis, and , respectively.Phenylephrine, with or without propranolol, did not elicit a change in ethanol ratio. In contrast, the ethanol ratio decreased markedly with isoproterenol. Dialysate glucose concentration decreased with phenylephrine with and without propranolol and increased with isoproterenol. Phenylephrine caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol concentration, with a maximal effect similar to that of isoproterenol. The effect was attenuated with propranolol.Our findings suggest that alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor stimulation by phenylephrine increases glucose uptake and metabolism in human abdominal adipose tissue. Furthermore, phenylephrine elicits a marked increase in lipolytic activity in white adipose tissue through beta-adrenoreceptor activation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608652>An adiponectin-like molecule with antidiabetic properties.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin increases glucose transport, reduces inflammation, and controls vascular functions. Hence, we propose that treatment with a recombinant globular domain of adiponectin (rgAd110-244) has significant therapeutic potential to treat insulin resistance. Mice were fed for 3 months on a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce insulin resistance, diabetes, and moderate weight gain. The mice were first infused iv with different doses of rgAd110-244 (0.12, 0.4, and 1.2 microg/kg x min) for 5 h. Basal and insulin-sensitive glucose use rates were assessed by the use of a submaximal rate of insulin in the awake free-moving mouse. rgAd110-244 reduced, with dose dependence, epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and HFD-induced insulin resistance by increasing whole-body glucose use (35% at the highest dose) and  rates. Similarly, the reduction of plasma free fatty acid concentrations by insulin was dramatically improved. Basal hepatic glucose production was unchanged by rgAd110-244 infusion. This acute rgAd110-244 treatment improved glucose homeostasis and was associated with an increased content of muscle phospho-Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, and AMP-activated kinase. Second, HFD mice were chronically treated with sc rgAd110-244 injections (10, 30, and 100 microg/kg). Fasting glycemia and insulin-sensitive glucose use were improved by rgAd110-244 at the highest dose at completion of the treatment, with concomitant reduction in body weight gain. We here show for the first time that a recombinant adiponectin fragment (110-244 amino acids called rgAd110-244) is able to treat insulin-resistant diabetes. Our results strongly suggest further pharmacological investigation of rgAd110-244 with the objective of developing a new treatment of insulin-resistant diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19779479>Mice deficient in phosphofructokinase-M have greatly decreased fat stores.</a></h2><p>Synthesis of triacylglycerol requires the glucose-derived glycerol component, and glucose uptake has been viewed as the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism in adipocytes. Furthermore, adipose tissue contains all three isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK). We here report that mice deficient in the muscle isoform PFK-M have greatly reduced fat stores. Mice with disrupted activity of the PFK-M distal promoter were obtained from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, developed from OmniBank OST#56064. Intra-abdominal fat was measured by magnetic resonance imaging of the methylene proton signal. Lipogenesis from labeled glucose was measured in isolated adipocytes. Lipolysis (glycerol and free fatty acid release) was measured in perifused adipocytes. Intra-abdominal fat in PFK-M-deficient female mice (5-10 months old) was 17 +/- 3% of that of wild-type littermates (n = 4; P < 0.02). Epididymal fat weight in 15 animals (7-9.5 months) was 34 +/- 4% of control littermate (P < 0.002), with 10-30% lower body weight. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in PFK-M-deficient epididymal adipocytes was 40% of the rates in cells from heterozygous littermates (n = 3; P < 0.05). The rate of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in wild-type adipocytes declined approximately 10% after 1 h and 50% after 2 h; in PFK-M-deficient cells it declined much more rapidly, 50% in 1 h and 90% in 2 h, and lipolytic oscillations appeared to be damped (n = 4). These results indicate an important role for PFK-M in adipose metabolism. This may be related to the ability of this isoform to generate glycolytic oscillations, because such oscillations may enhance the production of the triacylglycerol precursor alpha-glycerophosphate.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29118013>Restricting  impairs brown adipocyte glucose and oxygen consumption.</a></h2><p>During thermogenic activation, brown adipocytes take up large amounts of glucose. In addition, cold stimulation leads to an upregulation of glycolytic enzymes. Here we have investigated the importance of  for brown adipocyte glucose consumption and thermogenesis. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown in mature adipocytes, we explored the effect of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes on brown adipocyte functions such as consumption of glucose and oxygen. Basal oxygen consumption in brown adipocytes was equally dependent on glucose and fatty acid oxidation, whereas isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated respiration was fueled mainly by fatty acids, with a significant contribution from glucose oxidation. Knockdown of glucose transporters in brown adipocytes not only impaired ISO-stimulated glycolytic flux but also oxygen consumption. Diminishing glycolytic flux by knockdown of the first and final enzyme of , i.e., hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M (PKM), respectively, decreased glucose uptake and ISO-stimulated oxygen consumption. HK2 knockdown had a more severe effect, which, in contrast to PKM knockdown, could not be rescued by supplementation with pyruvate. Hence, brown adipocytes rely on glucose consumption and glycolytic flux to achieve maximum thermogenic output, with  likely supporting thermogenesis not only by pyruvate formation but also by supplying intermediates for efferent metabolic pathways.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8780175>Metabolic fate of glucose in reversible low-flow ischemia of the isolated working rat heart.</a></h2><p>The acute adaptation of myocardial glucose metabolism in response to low-flow ischemia and reperfusion was investigated in isolated working rat hearts perfused with bicarbonate saline containing glucose (10 mM) and insulin (40 microU/ml). Reversible low-flow ischemia was induced by reducing coronary perfusion pressure from 100 to 35 cmH2O. Tritiated glucose was used to assess rates of glucose transport and phosphorylation, flux from glucose to pyruvate, and oxidation of exogenous glucose. Rates of glycogen synthesis and  were also assessed. With ischemia, cardiac power decreased by more than two-thirds. Rates of glucose uptake and flux from glucose to pyruvate remained unchanged, while glucose oxidation declined by 61%. Rates of lactate release more than doubled, and fractional enrichment of glycogen remained the same. During reperfusion, glucose oxidation returned to the preischemic values. When isoproterenol was added during ischemia, glucose uptake increased, glycogen decreased, and lactate release increased. No effect was seen with pacing. We conclude that during low-flow ischemia and with glucose as the only exogenous substrate, net glucose uptake remains unchanged. There is a reversible redirection between  and glucose oxidation, while glycogen synthesis continues during ischemia and is enhanced with reperfusion.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17093970>Molecular impact of clenbuterol and isometric strength training on rat EDL muscles.</a></h2><p>Clenbuterol, a beta2-adrenergic-receptor agonist, is known to provoke muscle hypertrophy and a slow-to-fast phenotype change. A more glycolytic phenotype should be paralleled by changes in muscle glycolytic metabolism. Two groups (n=16 for each) of 3-month-old male Wistar rats (UCL: untrained clenbuterol, and ECL: exercised clenbuterol) received a chronic administration of clenbuterol (2 mg/kg body weight/day). Two other groups of animals (U: untrained and E: exercised), were given a 0.9% NaCl solution instead of clenbuterol. E and ECL animals followed an 8-week progressive isometric force strength-training program. Both clenbuterol administration and training resulted in an increase in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) mass despite the fact that this muscle was indirectly mobilised during isometric force strength training. Clenbuterol and training induced a consistent slow-to-fast phenotype change without drastically increasing specific activities of glycolytic enzymes. Except for GAPDH and hexokinase, modifications in glycolytic-enzyme-specific activities were not explained by transcriptional changes. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was not affected by clenbuterol but was strongly augmented by training. In EDL of ECL rats, both treatments presented an opposite effect compensating each other. GLUT1 mRNA expression was augmented in EDL of UCL and ECL animals, whereas monocarboxylate transporter 1 mRNA amounts were decreased in EDL of UCL rats. Citrate synthase activity was reduced by clenbuterol treatment but remained unchanged in EDL of E animals. Creatine kinase activity was enhanced only by clenbuterol alone. These data show that clenbuterol-induced muscle hypertrophy and slow-to-fast phenotype changes are not associated with a glycolytic-enzyme-activity increase. They also suggest that in EDL isometric force strength training can reverse clenbuterol-induced molecular adaptations.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27905409>Compound danshen dripping pills modulate the perturbed  metabolism in a rat model of acute myocardial ischemia.</a></h2><p>The continuous administration of compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) showed good efficacy in relieving myocardial ischemia clinically. To probe the underlying mechanism, metabolic features were evaluated in a rat model of acute myocardial ischemia induced by isoproterenol (ISO) and administrated with CDDP using a metabolomics platform. Our data revealed that the ISO-induced animal model showed obvious myocardial injury, decreased  production, and a marked change in metabolomic patterns in plasma and heart tissue. CDDP pretreatment increased  production, ameliorated biochemical indices, modulated the changes and metabolomic pattern induced by ISO, especially in heart tissue. For the first time, we found that ISO induced myocardial ischemia was accomplished with a reduced fatty acids metabolism and an elevated glycolysis for  supply upon the ischemic stress; while CDDP pretreatment prevented the tendency induced by ISO and enhanced a metabolic shift towards fatty acids metabolism that conventionally dominates  supply to cardiac muscle cells. These data suggested that the underlying mechanism of CDDP involved regulating the dominant  production mode and enhancing a metabolic shift toward fatty acids metabolism in ischemic heart. It was further indicated that CDDP had the potential to prevent myocardial ischemia in clinic.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960299>Comparing systemic metabolic responses in mice to single or dual infection with Plasmodium berghei and Heligmosomoides bakeri.</a></h2><p>Concomitant infections with Plasmodium and gastrointestinal nematodes are frequently observed in humans. At the metabolic level, the cross-talk between the host and multiple coexisting pathogens is poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to give a comprehensive insight into the systemic metabolic phenotype of mice with a single or dual infection with Plasmodium berghei and Heligmosomoides bakeri. Four groups of eight NMRI female mice were infected with P. berghei or H. bakeri, or with both species concurrently. An additional group remained uninfected, and served as control. Mice were sacrificed at day 19 of the experiment. We collected samples from the liver, spleen, kidney, three intestinal regions, and four brain regions. All biological samples were subjected to (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, combined with multivariate data analysis, to establish metabolic fingerprints of each tissue from the various infection groups. Compared to uninfected mice, single and dual species infection models showed unique metabolic profiles. P. berghei exerted major effects on , tricarboxylic acid cycle, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism in all studied tissues with the exception of the gut. H. bakeri was characterized by a dysregulation of choline and lipid metabolism in most tissues examined with a particularly strong imprint in the jejunum. Simultaneous co-infection with P. berghei and H. bakeri induced the strongest and most diverse effects in the liver and spleen but led to only minor changes in the intestinal and cerebral parts assessed. Infection with P. berghei showed more pronounced and systemic alterations in the mice metabolic profile than H. bakeri infection. The metabolic fingerprints in the co-infection models were driven by P. berghei infection, whilst the presence of H. bakeri in co-infections had little effect. However, simultaneous co-infection showed indeed the least metabolic disruptions in the peripheral tissues, namely the gut and brain.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p></html>
