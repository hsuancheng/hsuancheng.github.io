Environments compared were standard confinement (CON) and deep-bedded semi-outdoor systems. The deep-bedded method employed in the current study was the use of hoop structures. Hoops are large, tent-like shelters with cornstalks or straw for bedding. Gilts ranging in weight from 59 to 71 kg were randomly assigned to treatments of Hoop (n = 50) and CON (n = 18) environments. Gilts were fed a two-phase dietary sequence, ad libitum for 45 days. Six gilts per treatment were selected for carcass composition and quality evaluation. The experiment was replicated a total of five times. Pigs raised in the Hoop environment gained significantly less and required significantly more feed for growth than pigs raised in the CON environment. Carcasses from CON-finished pigs were significantly fatter at the 10th rib, which lowered carcass percentage fat-free lean(FFL) and they also had greater loin marbling scores compared with carcasses from Hoop-finished pigs (P < 0.05). Significant replication effects were noted on beginning weight, live weight, carcass weight, percentage FFL, backfat, lipid content and adipose firmness. Carcasses from Hoop pigs had lower proportions of  (P < 0.05), and higher proportions of oleic and linoleic  (P < 0.05) in the inner layer of adipose tissue. The proportion of saturated   was lower, and that of mono- and poly-unsaturated   was higher in the inner layer of the adipose tissue of Hoop pigs. Variations in   composition and lipid deposition may have been caused by environmental temperature, since decreases in environmental temperature accompanied compositional variation of the adipose, leading to higher proportions of monounsaturated   and lower proportions of saturated and polyunsaturated   in adipose tissue, regardless of treatment.  profile analysis revealed that adipose tissue of Hoop pigs had significantly higher amounts of 3-butanal and heptanal compared with CON pigs, which may be related to the amount of oleic and linoleic  composing the adipose tissue. These data indicate finishing pigs in hoop structures allows for exposure to fluctuating temperatures, which may influence the growth of pigs, as well as   composition and firmness of pork products.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30263761>Effects of milling on aromatics, lipophilic phytonutrients, and   in unprocessed white rice of scented rice 'Cheonjihyang-1-se.</a></h2><p>To understand effects of milling, scented rice 'Cheonjihyang-1-se' was milled from 10 to 140 s and changes in volatiles, phytonutrients, and   were evaluated. Among 43 identified odor-active compounds, four volatiles, including hexan-3-one, exhibited decreases of up to 78%, while four others including ()-non-2-enal, increased following milling. Levels of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the most distinctive popcorn-flavoring compound in scented rice, were not affected by the degree of milling (DM). Partial least squares discriminant analyses of volatiles were able to differentiate white rice according to the DM. Benzene and 2-pentylfuran showed the highest variable importance in projection scores, which could be applied in estimating the DM of rice. Milling significantly decreased tocopherols, tocotrienols, squalene, phytosterols contents and oleic  composition, while  composition was increased. These results suggest milling-dependent variations in phytonutrient levels and lipid composition, as well as changes in aroma and subsequent market quality, in 'Cheonjihyang-1-se' rice.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471102>  and  Oil Compositions of Allomyrina dichotoma Larvae.</a></h2><p>Thirty-two different  oils were identified from Allomyrina dichotoma (A. dichotoma) larvae by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

Raw milk from organic (>50% of dry matter intake from pasture) and conventional (no access to pasture) farms were adjusted to commercial whole and nonfat milk fat standards, and processed with or without homogenization, and with high-temperature-short-time or UHT pasteurization. The milk then underwent in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Comparison of milk from organic and conventional herds showed that the milks responded to processing in similar ways. General composition was the same among the whole milk samples and among the nonfat milk samples. Protein profiles were similar, with intact caseins and whey proteins predominant and only minor amounts of peptides. Whole milk samples from grazing cows contained higher levels of α-linolenic (C18:3), vaccenic (C18:1 trans), and conjugated linoleic , and lower levels of  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0)  than samples from nongrazing cows. Processing had no effect on conjugated linoleic  and linolenic  levels in milk, although homogenization resulted in higher levels of C8 to C14 saturated  . Of the 9  compounds evaluated, milk from grazing cows contained lower levels of 2-butanone than milk from nongrazing cows, and milk from both farms showed spikes for heptanal in UHT samples and spikes for butanoic, octanoic, nonanoic, and N-decanoic  in homogenized samples. At the start of in vitro digestion, nonfat raw and pasteurized milk samples formed the largest  clots, and organic milk clots were larger than conventional milk clots; UHT whole milk formed the smallest clots. Milk digests from grazing cows had lower levels of free   than digests from nongrazing cows. In vitro proteolysis was similar in milk from both farms and resulted in 85 to 95% digestibility. Overall, milk from organic/grass-fed and conventional herds responded in similar ways to typical homogenization and heat processing used in United States dairy plants and showed only minor differences in chemical traits and in vitro digestion. Findings from this research enhance our knowledge of the effect of processing on the quality traits and digestibility of milk from organic/pasture-fed and confined conventional herds and will help health-conscious consumers make informed decisions about dairy selections.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

The major active form of ghrelin is a 28-amino- peptide containing an n-octanoyl modification at serine that is essential for activity. Studies have identified multiple physiological functions for ghrelin, including GH release, appetite stimulation, and metabolic fuel preference. Until now, there has not been any report detailing the mechanism of ghrelin acyl modification. Here we report that ingestion of either medium-chain   (MCFAs) or medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) increased the stomach concentrations of acylated ghrelin without changing the total (acyl- and des-acyl-) ghrelin amounts. After ingestion of either MCFAs or MCTs, the carbon chain lengths of the acyl groups attached to nascent ghrelin molecules corresponded to that of the ingested MCFAs or MCTs. Ghrelin peptides modified with n-butyryl or n-palmitoyl groups, however, could not be detected after ingestion of the corresponding short-chain or long-chain  , respectively. Moreover, n-heptanoyl ghrelin, an unnatural form of ghrelin, could be detected in the stomach of mice after ingestion of either n-heptanoic  or glyceryl triheptanoate. These findings indicate that ingested medium-chain   are directly used for the acylation of ghrelin.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736905>Lipid metabolism in response to individual short chain   during mixotrophic mode of microalgal cultivation: Influence on biodiesel saturation and protein profile.</a></h2><p>Critical influence of different short chain   as organic carbon source, during growth (GP) and nutrient stress lipogenic phase (NSLP) was investigated on biomass and lipid productivity, in mixotrophic fed-batch microalgae cultivation.

Respiration altered the central metabolism rerouting pyruvate away from lactate accumulation, while Tween 80 had a minor effect on metabolic pathways. VOCs were mainly affected by growth conditions and significant amounts of diacetyl were produced by respiratory cultures. Respiration increased desaturation of membrane lipids and Tween 80 improved the production of essential polyunsaturated FAs.  decreased in Tween-supplemented aerated cultures.Combination of Tween 80 and respiratory growth promoted production of biomass and aroma compounds and affected the composition of membrane FAs in Lact. casei N87.Respiration might be exploited in Lact. casei as a natural strategy for the enhanced production of aroma compounds.© 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23728324>Physico-chemical characterisation of the fat from red-skin rambutan (Nephellium lappaceum L.) seed.</a></h2><p>The seeds (6.9±0.2% by weight of fruit) of the red-skin rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum L.) contain a considerable amount of crude fat (38.0±4.36%) and thus, the aim of the study was to determine the physico-chemical properties of this fat for potential applications.

(FA), phenolic compounds (PC) and  compounds (VC) of flesh and peel from three Prunus persica cultivars were evaluated at the Regional Centre of Agricultural Research--Experimental Farm (Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia) during two maturation stages. , oleic and linoleic  are the most abundant FA in Prunus persica cultivars. A genetic effect on FA composition was observed throughout the two sampling periods. Peel was rich in oleic  with the highest content (31.3% on total FA) in 'O'Henry' cultivar at the commercial ripening date; flesh was rich in linoleic  with the highest content (44.7% on total FA) in 'Sweet Cap' cultivar at the full ripening date. The monounsaturated/polyunsaturated   ratios were higher in the commercial ripe than in the full ripe fruits. The analysis of the composition of the VC led to the characterization of 98 different compounds, showing a very high variability among the cultivars. The full ripe fruit (peel and flesh) exhibited the highest total number of terpenoids. Commercial ripe peels were richest in the percentage of hydrocarbons. Comparing cultivars, 'Sweet Cap' cultivar showed the lowest contents of alcohols in peel and flesh of full ripe fruit but highest in peel of commercial ripe fruit, and lowest content of aldehydes in peel and flesh of commercial ripe fruit but highest in peel of ripe ones and the highest ones of lactones. Among PC, the highest contents were observed for o-diphenols and the values showed varietal influence. Total phenols contents decreased during ripening process (p < 0.05) in both peel and flesh tissues, except found for 'Sweet Cap' cultivar. In conclusion, to achieve better FA composition and greater VC and PC production of the peach fruit, P. persica cultivars should be harvested at the commercial ripening date.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study examined the endogenous ketogenic capacity of astroglia under hypoxia with/without glucose and the possible roles of KBs in neuronal energy metabolism. Cultured neurons and astroglia were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats.  (PAL) and l-carnitine (LC) were added to the assay medium. The 4- to 24-hr production of AA and BHB was measured using the cyclic thio-NADH method. (14)C-labeled -soluble products (KBs) and (14)CO2 produced from [1-(14)C]PAL were also measured. l-[U-(14)C]lactic  ([(14)C]LAC), [1-(14)C]pyruvic  ([(14)C]PYR), or β-[1-(14)C]hydroxybutyric  ([(14)C]BHB) was used to compare the oxidative metabolism of the glycolysis end products with that of the KBs. Some cells were placed in a hypoxic chamber (1% O2). PAL and LC induced a higher production of KBs in astroglia than in neurons, while the CO2 production from PAL was less than 5% of the KB production in both astroglia and neurons. KB production in astroglia was augmented by the AMP-activated protein kinase activators, AICAR and metformin, as well as hypoxia with/without glucose. Neuronal KB production increased under hypoxia in the absence of PAL and LC. In neurons, [(14)C]LAC and [(14)C]PYR oxidation decreased after 24 hr of hypoxia, while [(14)C]BHB oxidation was preserved. Astroglia responds to ischemia in vitro by enhancing KB production, and astroglia-produced KBs derived from   might serve as a neuronal energy substrate for the tricarboxylic  cycle instead of lactate, as pyruvate dehydrogenase is susceptible to ischemia.© The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347999>Downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 by the root extract of Cyathula officinalis Kuan and its constituents in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes.</a></h2><p>The roots of Cyathula officinalis Kuan are widely used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Here, the ability of C. officinalis Kuan to downregulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 was examined since MMP-13 is an important enzyme for the degradation of the cartilage collagen matrix, especially under arthritic conditions. The ethanol extract of C. officinalis Kuan as well as the N-hexane and chloroform soluble fractions were found to potently inhibit MMP-13 induction in IL-1 β-treated SW1353 cells, a human chondrosarcoma cell line, at 50-200 µg/mL.

Four isocaloric diets were prepared, containing 10-11 mol% of   (FA) as linoleic  (LNA) and 2.5 mol% as α-linolenic  (ALA), leading to an identical and well-balanced LNA/ALA ratio. The initial rapeseed oil/corn oil mixture providing ALA and LNA was enriched with olive oil to prepare the olive oil diet. The butterfat diet was supplemented with butterfat, containing short-chain SFA (C4:0-C10:0, 17 mol% of FA), lauric  (C12:0, 3.2 mol%), myristic  (C14:0, 10.5 mol%) and  (C16:0, 14.5 mol%).

The trimyristin diet was enriched with trimyristin only. The results showed that the butterfat diet contributed to specific effects, compared to the olive oil diet and the saturates and trimyristin diets: a decrease in plasma total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, higher tissue storage of ALA and LNA, and a higher level of (n-3) highly unsaturated   in some tissues.

We examined the involvement of the adipocyte hormone adiponectin. Circulating adiponectin levels were significantly elevated by chronic ethanol administration to mice consuming a diet high in saturated fat. The increase in circulating adiponectin was associated with the activation a set of hepatic signaling pathways mediated through AMP-activated protein kinase, PPAR-alpha, and PPAR-gamma coactivator alpha, which in turn led to markedly increased rates of   oxidation, prevention of hepatic steatosis, and alleviation of liver enzyme changes.

Camphene, β-phelandrene, eugenol, β-elemene, bicyclogermacrene, guaiol, tetradecanoic , and hexadecanoic  levels decreased when PPS was biotransformed. Lactic (1575.75 mg/100g), acetic (1234.26 mg/100g), propionic (845.74 mg/100g), and n-butyric (68.56 mg/100g)  were the predominant  (VFAs) in the SSF-PPS oils, which were higher than those found in the PF oil while PF oil contained higher campesterol, Stigmasterol, and 5-avesmasterol. The 2,2- azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic ) (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and nitric oxide radical scavenging potentials of PPS oil at high concentrations after biotransformation were equivalent to the standards and the PF oil.This study has shown that biotransformation involving snail digestive juice and yeasts extensively improves the oil qualities of agricultural residues sufficient enough for poultry nutrition.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489163>Eicosapentaenoic  Potentiates Brown Thermogenesis through FFAR4-dependent Up-regulation of miR-30b and miR-378.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence suggests that n-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) promote brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA promotes brown adipogenesis by modulating miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, murine brown preadipocytes were induced to differentiate the   of , oleate, or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The increases of brown-specific signature genes and oxygen consumption rate by EPA were concurrent with up-regulation of miR-30b and 378 but not by oleate or . Next, we hypothesize that free   receptor 4 (Ffar4), a functional receptor for n-3 PUFA, modulates miR-30b and 378. Treatment of Ffar4 agonist (GW9508) recapitulated the thermogenic activation of EPA by increasing oxygen consumption rate, brown-specific marker genes, and miR-30b and 378, which were abrogated in Ffar4-silenced cells. Intriguingly, addition of the miR-30b mimic was unable to restore EPA-induced Ucp1 expression in Ffar4-depleted cells, implicating that Ffar4 signaling activity is required for up-regulating the brown adipogenic program. Moreover, blockage of miR-30b or 378 by locked nucleic  inhibitors significantly attenuated Ffar4 as well as brown-specific signature gene expression, suggesting the signaling interplay between Ffar4 and miR-30b/378. The association between miR-30b/378 and brown thermogenesis was also confirmed in fish oil-fed C57/BL6 mice. Interestingly, the Ffar4 agonism-mediated signaling axis of Ffar4-miR-30b/378-Ucp1 was linked with an elevation of cAMP in brown adipocytes, similar to cold-exposed or fish oil-fed brown fat. Taken together, our work identifies a novel function of Ffar4 in modulating brown adipogenesis partly through a mechanism involving cAMP activation and up-regulation of miR-30b and miR-378.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18422184>[Headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for analysis of  components from pollen pini].</a></h2><p>Headspace solid-phase microextraction HS-SPME) technique was employed to extract the  compounds from Pollen Pini.

The transferase activities of the fused proteins in microsomal fraction of belladonna markedly increased by the incubation with methyl jasmonate either in Sdrac-1 or Sdrac-2 transformant, while low and constant activities were observed in the untreated control. Recombinant Sdrac-2 protein was found to bind to prenyl chain in the presence of cell extracts prepared from methyl jasmonate-treated S. dulcis, however, Sdrac-1 was palmitoylated by the addition of the cell extracts. These results suggest that both Sdrac-1 and Sdrac-2 translocate to plant membranes by the stimulation with methyl jasmonate, however, targeting of these proteins is triggered by the independent modification mechanisms, palmitoylation for Sdrac-1 and prenylation for Sdrac-2.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923652>An inhibitor of phospholipase A2 group IIA modulates adipocyte signaling and protects against diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h2><p>Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease correlate with infiltration to adipose tissue of different immune cells, with uncertain influences on metabolism. Rats were fed a diet high in carbohydrates and saturated fats to develop diet-induced obesity over 16 weeks. This nutritional overload caused overexpression and secretion of phospholipase A(2) group IIA (pla2g2a) from immune cells in adipose tissue rather than adipocytes, whereas expression of adipose-specific phospholipase A(2) (pla2g16) was unchanged. These immune cells produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which influences adipocyte signaling. We found that a selective inhibitor of human pla2g2a (5-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)-(4S)-(phenyl-heptanoylamino)-pentanoic  [KH064]) attenuated secretion of PGE(2) from human immune cells stimulated with the  , , or with lipopolysaccharide. Oral administration of KH064 (5 mg/kg/day) to rats fed the high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet prevented the overexpression of pla2g2a and the increased macrophage infiltration and elevated PGE(2) concentrations in adipose tissue. The treatment also attenuated visceral adiposity and reversed most characteristics of metabolic syndrome, producing marked improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and cardiovascular abnormalities. We suggest that pla2g2a may have a causal relationship with chronic adiposity and metabolic syndrome and that its inhibition in vivo may be a valuable new approach to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction in humans.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28911650>Time course effects of fermentation on   and  compound profiles of Cheonggukjang using new soybean cultivars.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of the potential probiotic Bacillus subtilis CSY191 on the   profiles of Cheonggukjang, a fermented soybean paste, prepared using new Korean brown soybean cultivars, protein-rich cultivar (Saedanbaek), and oil-rich cultivar (Neulchan). Twelve   were identified in the sample set-myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, vaccenic, linoleic, α-linolenic, arachidic, gondoic, behenic, and lignoceric -yet, no specific changes driven by fermentation were noted in the   profiles. To further explore the effects of fermentation of B. subtilis CSY191, complete profiles of volatiles were monitored. In total, 121, 136, and 127  compounds were detected in the Saedanbaek, Daewon (control cultivar), and Neulchan samples, respectively. Interestingly, the content of pyrazines-compounds responsible for pungent and unpleasant Cheonggukjang flavors-was significantly higher in Neulchan compared to that in Saedanbaek. Although the fermentation period was not a strong factor affecting the observed changes in   profiles, we noted that profiles of volatiles in Cheonggukjang changed significantly over time, and different cultivars represented specific  profiles. Thus, further sensory evaluation might be needed to determine if such differences influence consumers' preferences. Furthermore, additional studies to elucidate the associations between B. subtilis CSY191 fermentation and other nutritional components (e.g., amino ) and their health-promoting potential are warranted.Copyright © 2016.

Less is known regarding the acetate recovery factor for dietary   oxidation. We compiled data from six studies to investigate the determinants of the dietary acetate recovery factor (dARF) at rest and after physical activity interventions and compared the effects of different methods of dARF calculation on both the fat oxidation and its variability. In healthy lean subjects, dARF was 50.6 +/- 5.4% dose (n = 56) with an interindividual coefficient of variation of 10.6% at rest and 9.2% after physical activity modifications. The physical activity interventions did not impact dARF, and the intraindividual coefficient of variation was 4.6%. No major anthropological or physiological determinants were detected except for resting metabolic rate, which explains 7.4% of the dARF variability. Applying an individual or an average group dARF did not affect the mean and the variability of the derived dietary lipid oxidation at rest or after physical activity interventions. Using a mean dARF for a group leads to over- or underestimation of fat oxidation of less than 10% in individual subjects. Moreover, the use of a group or individual correction did not affect the significant relationship found between fasting respiratory exchange ratio and dietary fat oxidation. These data indicate that an average dARF can be applied for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies investigating dietary lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514531>Metabolic signatures and risk of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population: an untargeted metabolomics study using both LC-MS and GC-MS.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics has provided new insight into diabetes risk assessment. In this study we characterised the human serum metabolic profiles of participants in the Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort to identify metabolic signatures associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.In this nested case-control study, baseline serum metabolite profiles were measured using LC-MS and GC-MS during a 6-year follow-up of 197 individuals with type 2 diabetes but without a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer before diabetes diagnosis, and 197 healthy controls matched by age, sex and date of blood collection.A total of 51 differential metabolites were identified between cases and controls. Of these, 35 were significantly associated with diabetes risk in the multivariate analysis after false discovery rate adjustment, such as increased branched-chain amino  (leucine, isoleucine and valine), non-esterified   (, stearic , oleic  and linoleic ) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) species (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, 20:3, 20:4 and 22:6). A combination of six metabolites including proline, glycerol, aminomalonic , LPI (16:1), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic  and urea showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals with high baseline HbA1c levels (≥6.5% [47.5 mmol/mol]) with an AUC of 0.935. Combined lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) (12:0) and LPI (16:1) also showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in individuals with normal baseline HbA1c levels (<6.5% [47.5 mmol/mol]; AUC = 0.781).Our findings show that branched-chain amino  and NEFA are potent predictors of diabetes development in Chinese adults.

Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250gL water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry weight biomass (5.18gL) and total fatty  contents (1.03gg DW). Dominant fatty  methyl esters (FAME) were  - (C-26%); Stearic - (C-17%) and Oleic acids (C-38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139mkg volatile solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the  compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane   showed that co-culture improved the content of  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0)  in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and oleic  (C18:1).

By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy metabolism, and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii.

Concentration of polyunsaturated   (PUFA) was higher (p < 0.05), and PUFA n-6/n-3 ratio lower (p < 0.05), in the milk fat from cows fed ELS compared to WSS. Supplementation of TMR with oilseeds compared to PPF increased the content of CLA in milk fat (p < 0.005) and decreased its atherogenicity, primarily due to a significant reduction of  concentration. Both oilseeds significantly improved the spreadability index of manufactured butter. ELS, but not WSS, increased the susceptibility of milk fat to oxidation (p < 0.05).

Acetate is the major carbon source spared and it may increase lipid synthesis in adipose tissue during MFD. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and the amount of acetate spared during CLA-induced MFD on adipose tissue lipogenesis. Nine multiparous, lactating, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows (244 ± 107 d in milk; 25 ± 8.4 kg of milk/d; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Experimental periods were 4 d followed by a 10-d washout. Treatments were control (CON), ruminal infusion of acetate (AC; continuous infusion of 7 mol/d adjusted to pH 6.1 with sodium hydroxide), or abomasal infusion of CLA (10 g/d of both trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA). Dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein yield and percentage were not affected by treatments. Compared with CON, milk fat yield decreased 23% and fat percent decreased 28% in CLA, and milk fat yield increased 20% in AC. Concentration and yield of milk de novo synthesized   (<C16) were reduced and concentration of preformed   (>C16) was increased by CLA, compared with CON. Yield of de novo synthesized   and  was increased by AC, compared with CON. Lipogenesis capacity of adipose tissue explants was decreased 72% by CLA, but was not affected by AC. Acetate oxidation by adipose explants was not affected by treatments. Treatments had no effect on expression of key lipogenic factors, lipogenic enzymes, and leptin; however, expression of   binding protein 4 was reduced in CLA compared with CON. Additionally, hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin 1 were decreased by CLA and acetate. Plasma glucose and glucagon concentrations were not affected by treatments; however, CLA increased nonesterified   17.7%, β-hydroxybutyrate 16.1%, and insulin 27.8% compared with CON, and AC increased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate 18%. In conclusion, during CLA-induced MFD in low-producing cow adipose tissue was sensitive to the anti-lipogenic effects of CLA, while spared acetate did not stimulate adipose lipogenesis. However, acetate may play an important role in stimulating lipogenesis and improving energy status in the mammary gland under normal conditions.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

However, methane yields as well as  solids removal decreased from 0.54 to 0.47 l per kg of added  solids and 65% to 60% respectively, with the decrease of hydraulic retention time. Despite the fact that the best process performance was achieved for hydraulic retention time of 20 days, the obtained results showed that it is also possible to carry out the co-digestion process at shorter hydraulic retention times with good results. Furthermore, gas production rate as well as biogas production at the shortest hydraulic retention time were approximately 46% higher in comparison to results obtained at the longest hydraulic retention time. In this context, the proposed solution seems to be an interesting option, because it provides an unique opportunity for wastewater treatment plants to improve their profitability by enhancing energy recovery from sludge as well as full utilisation of the existing infrastructure and hence creates a new potential place for alternative treatment of organic industrial waste such as: fat-rich materials or food waste. However, implementation of the solution at wastewater treatment plants is still a big challenge and needs studies including identification of optimal digesting conditions, information about substrate pumping, inhibition thresholds and processing properties. Additionally, due to the characteristics of both co-substrates their introduction to the full-scale digester should be carefully planned due to a potential risk of overloading of the digester. For this reason, a gradual increase of the share of these wastes in the co-digestion mixture is highly recommended, because it will allow for the acclimatization of bacteria as well as prevent overloading. The results of this study show the importance of gradual acclimatization of microorganisms to the changing environmental conditions. It was found that concentration of long chain   in effluents increased with the reduction of hydraulic retention time, but this phenomenon did not significantly influence the performance and stability of the process probably due to changes hydraulic retention time being gradual. Although for  a moderate negative correlation with  solids removal was observed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the discovery of three endogenous PPARα ligands-3-hydroxy-(2,2)-dimethyl butyrate, hexadecanamide, and 9-octadecenamide-in mouse brain hippocampus. Mass spectrometric detection of these compounds in mouse hippocampal nuclear extracts, in silico interaction studies, time-resolved FRET analyses, and thermal shift assay results clearly indicated that these three compounds served as ligands of PPARα. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further revealed that PPARα Y464 and Y314 are involved in binding these hippocampal ligands. Moreover, these ligands activated PPARα and upregulated the synaptic function of hippocampal neurons.

Polish dairy farms in the mountainous region are rather small, animal nutrition there is based on locally produced forages and this, together with the transitional climate zone brings about seasonal changes in FA composition of milk. The aim of the study was to evaluate the composition of FA in bovine milk fat in relation to fat intake in forages and their FA profiles. The study involved 5 herds reared in low-input mountain farms located at an altitude of 670-780 m above sea level (Beskid Mountains). The cows were fed forages produced locally. FAs in forages and milk samples were subjected to gas chromatography. Highest fat intake observed in grazing season (4·2-4·7%) and high amounts of polyunsaturated FA in forages from that period (51·8-64·1 g/100 g FA) resulted in a markedly high content of valuable FAs: t-11 C18:1 (3·22 g/100 g FA), c-9, t-11 C18:2 (CLA; 1·20 g/100 g FA) in milk. Lower fat intake of forages containing high amount of SFA (32·42-38·83 g/100 g FA) in the indoor period resulted in changes in milk composition. The content of total short-chain saturated FA () was highest in winter and early spring samples (14·10 and 13·44 g/100 g FA, respectively), like the amounts of myristic C14:0 and  C16:0  (11·80 and 37·92 g/100 g FA). Total odd- and branched-chain   (OBCFA; 6·58 g/100 g FA) content was highest at the beginning of the grazing period.

However, the exact mechanism of PPARγ regulation on milk fat synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells (DCMECs) remains largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PPARγ regarding milk fat synthesis in DCMECs and to ascertain whether milk fat precursor acetic  and  could interact with PPARγ signaling to regulate milk fat synthesis. For this study, we examined the effects of PPARγ overexpression and gene silencing on cell growth, triacylglycerol synthesis, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in DCMECs. In addition, we investigated the influences of acetic  and  on the mRNA and protein levels of milk lipogenic genes and triacylglycerol synthesis in DCMECs transfected with PPARγ small interfering RNA (siRNA) and PPARγ expression vector. The results showed that when PPARγ was silenced, cell viability, proliferation, and triacylglycerol secretion were obviously reduced. Gene silencing of PPARγ significantly downregulated the expression levels of milk fat synthesis-related genes in DCMECs. PPARγ overexpression improved cell viability, proliferation, and triacylglycerol secretion. The expression levels of milk lipogenic genes were significantly increased when PPARγ was overexpressed. Acetic  and  could markedly improve triacylglycerol synthesis and upregulate the expression levels of PPARγ and other lipogenic genes in DCMECs.

Although the NIR fluorescently labeled glucose analog glucosamine (cypate-glucosamine) has applications in preclinical imaging, the transport pathways and fate of this probe in tissues remain unaddressed. Here, we have synthesized and characterized cypate and cypate-glucosamine conjugate (cy-2-glu), and investigated the probable transport pathways of these probes in vitro and in vivo. We compared uptake of the probes in the presence and absence of excess d-glucose, "saturated cypate" and  in two normal-cancer cell line pairs: lung cancer (A549)-normal (MRC9) and prostate cancer (DU145)-normal (BPH). Breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and liver cancer (HepG2) cell lines were also examined. Results support use of the glucose transport pathway by cy-2-glu and   transport pathway by cypate. Mass spectrometry data on the in vitro extracts revealed deamidation of cy-2-glu in prostate and liver cells, suggesting release of glucosamine. In vivo biodistribution studies in mice engrafted with breast tumors showed a distinct accumulation of cy-2-glu in liver and tumors, and to a lesser extent in kidneys and spleen. A negligible accumulation of cypate alone in tumors was observed. Analysis of urine extracts revealed renal excretion of the cy-2-glu probe in the form of free cypate, indicating deamidation of cy-2-glu in tissues. Thus, investigation of the metabolic pathways used by NIR probes such as cy-2-glu advances their use in the detection and monitoring of tumor progression in preclinical animal studies.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17446068>Nutritional composition of frog (Rana esculanta) waste meal.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the waste obtained from the frozen frog leg industry was used for the production of frog waste meal, and its proximate, amino ,  , mineral and vitamin compositions were evaluated to determine the nutritional quality.

Plants were treated with different concentrations of NaCl treatment: 0, 50, 75, and 125 mmoL. Plant growth was significantly reduced with the severity of saline treatment. This also caused important reductions in the seed yield and yield components. Besides, NaCl treatments affected   composition. Petroselinic and linoleic  proportions diminished consistently with the increase in NaCl concentration, whereas  proportion increased. Furthermore, NaCl enhanced essential oil production in C. cyminum seeds and induced marked changes on the essential oil quality. Essential oil chemotype was modified from γ-terpinene/1-phenyl-1,2 ethanediol in control to γ-terpinene/β-pinene in salt stressed plants. Total polyphenol content was higher in treated seeds, and salinity improved the amount of individual phenolic compounds. Moreover, antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by four different test systems, namely 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, β-carotene/linoleic  chelating, and reducing power assays. The highest antioxidant activities were reveled in severe stressed plants. In this case, cumin seeds produced under saline conditions may function as a potential source of essential oil and antioxidant compounds, which could support the utilization of this plant in a large field of applications such as food industry.Copyright © 2016.

Gay subsp. fontanesii growing wildly in Tunisia, was analyzed using GC and GC-MS techniques. The free radical scavenging capacity and total phenol contents of three crude extracts having different polarities (n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol) were examined. Thus, a total of 35 constituents were identified in the Desfontaine's rupturewort essential oil representing 89.8% of the whole constituents. The oil was dominated by hexadecanoic , caryophyllene oxide, terpin-4-ol, khusimone and trans-sabinene hydrate. The total phenolic contents ranged from 16.91 to 92.27 mg of gallic /g of dry weight and they were found to be significantly higher in methanol than in polar ethyl acetate and hexane extracts. Correlations were observed between the phenolic contents and the antioxidant properties. Thus, the antioxidant activity of the methanol extract was superior to that of all samples tested (IC50 = 0.21 ± 0.04 mg/mL).© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

Cinnamon essential oil exhibits strong in vitro antibacterial activity; however, direct addition of essential oils to animal feed has limited practicality due to their high volatility, odor, fast decomposition, and poor availability in the lower intestines. To solve these problems, we formulated trans-cinnamaldehyde (CIN) with an adsorbent powder and   via a melt-solidification technique. Core granules of an optimized composition contained up to 48% wt/wt CIN. The granules were then coated with an enteric polymer to impart site-specific release of CIN. CIN was mostly retained in simulated gastric fluid and released rapidly (>80% under 2 h) in simulated intestinal fluids. Rapid CIN autoxidation into cinnamic  was inhibited by adding 1% vol/vol eugenol, which maintained CIN stability for at least 1 y. The granule formulation increased the antimicrobial activity of CIN against Escherichia coli K88 slightly with a minimum bactericidal concentration of 450 μg/mL for CIN in lauric -based granules compared with 550-600 μg/mL for -based granules and free CIN, respectively. These results encourage the potential use of encapsulated CIN for control of animal enteric pathogens by oral in-feed administration.Copyright © 2016 American Pharmacists Association®.

The current study was undertaken after obtaining a range of EVOO varieties grown in different countries.

L. pneumophila possesses three proteins, PlaA, PlaC, and PlaD, belonging to the GDSL family of lipases/acyltransferases. We have shown previously that PlaC is the major GCAT secreted by L. pneumophila and that the zinc metalloproteinase ProA is essential for GCAT activity. Here we characterized the mode of PlaC GCAT activation and determined that ProA directly processes PlaC. We further found that not only cholesterol but also ergosterol present in protozoa was palmitoylated by PlaC. Such ester formations were not induced by either PlaA or PlaD. PlaD was shown here to possess lysophospholipase A activity, and interestingly, all three GDSL enzymes transferred short chain   to sterols. The three single putative catalytic amino  (Ser-37, Asp-398, and His-401) proved essential for all PlaC-associated PLA, lysophospholipase A, and GCAT activities. A further four cysteine residues are important for the PLA/GCAT activities as well as their oxidized state, and we therefore conclude that PlaC likely forms at least one disulfide loop. Analysis of cleavage site and loop deletion mutants suggested that for GCAT activation deletion of several amino  within the loop is necessary rather than cleavage at a single site. Our data therefore suggest a novel enzyme inhibition/activation mechanism where a disulfide loop inhibits PlaC GCAT activity until the protein is exported to the external space where it is ProA-activated.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27701827>Beneficial Effects of Co-Ultramicronized Palmitoylethanolamide/Luteolin in a Mouse Model of Autism and in a Case Report of Autism.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition defined by social communication deficits and repetitive restrictive behaviors.

Apiol (81.99 and 74.779%) was found the highest phenylpropanoid constituent followed by m-diaminobenzene (10.446 and 8.778%) in the essential oil and aqueous extract portion. On the other hand, β-butyrolactone (5.13%) and isobutyl acetone (3.73%) were found in the major constituents in the water extract part. The IC value of the essential oil was found to be 3.07 mg/mL by DPPH radical assay methods. The LC value of the brine shrimp cytotoxicity assay of the essential oil was observed at 0.81 μg/mL. The essential oil showed better activity on Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The proximate composition showed that root contained 5.29% ash, 2.01% protein, 54.09% crude fibre, 0.15% essential oil and 1.14% fatty oil for hot extract and 0.23% for cold extract on the dried basis. The  (33.81 & 31.58%) and linoleic  (30.03 & 23.79%) were the major saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the cold and hot extracted root powder respectively. Ca (23,600 mg/kg), Mg (7620.33 mg/kg) and K (1286.15 mg/kg) were the most predominant elements followed by Ni (1187.30 mg/kg), Se (913.79 mg/kg), Li (317.84 mg/kg), Na (288.72 mg/kg) and Fe (206.88 mg/kg). The toxic elements were found to be within the permissible limit. Glutamic  (19.37%), glycine (14.53%) and lysine (17.08%) were found as the major amino acids. The decomposition rates were obtained by TG, DTG and DTA curve of the powder sample at various temperature ranges.The results demonstrated that the root part of Anethum sowa L. is a rich source of mineral elements, essential amino  and fatty acids. The essential oil is the highly potential as bioactive oil for pharmaceuticals and medical applications, possessing antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The thermal analysis suggested as a simple, effective and rapid method to characterize the Anethum sowa L. species as well as to assess for herbal formulation.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19809907>Essential oil composition of lady's mantle (Alchemilla xanthochlora Rothm.) growing wild in Alpine pastures.</a></h2><p>The  fraction from the aerial part of Alchemilla xanthochlora Rothm.

Damara sheep, native to Southern Africa, have recently been exported to other areas of the world, particularly Australia, aiming to produce lamb in semi-arid regions. Damaras have a unique hanging fat tail, a fat depot able to be mobilized under nutritional stress. In this article we perform an in-depth characterization of the   profiles of the fat tail in underfed and control Damara rams. Profiles were very similar between experimental groups, with the exception of  (16:0) that was lower (P = 0.014) in underfed animals. However, the most striking result was the very high proportions of non-terminal branched chain   found in the fat tail adipose tissue, as well as the gastrocnemius muscle of Damara rams. The muscle of Dorper and Merino rams used in the same experiment did not present non-terminal branched chain  , suggesting that Damara rams have a unique lipid metabolism. Herein, we interpret this trait relating it to a higher ability of Damara sheep to digest fibrous fodder and to putative differences in the propionate metabolism by comparison to other sheep breeds.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20055130>[Metabonomic profiling of plasma metabolites in Wistar rats to study the effect of aging by means of GC/TOFMS-based techniques].</a></h2><p>The global metabolite profiles of endogenous compounds of Wistar rats from 12 to 20 weeks old were investigated to take deep insight into and get better understanding of the pathogenesis of development and aging.

Decreased concentrations of citric , cis-aconitic , 9-(z)-hexadecenoic  along with increased levels of hexanedioic , alpha-tocopherol, 3-indole propionic , etc contributed to the separation.

In this study, we have developed a simple model system (Dictyostelium discoideum) to investigate the effects of VPA and related compounds in lipid droplet formation. In mammalian hepatocytes, VPA increases lipid droplet accumulation over a 24-hour period, giving rise to liver cell damage, and we show a similar effect in Dictyostelium following 30 minutes of VPA treatment. Using (3)H-labelled polyunsaturated (arachidonic) or saturated ()  , we shown that VPA treatment of Dictyostelium gives rise to an increased accumulation of both types of   in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and non-polar lipids in this time period, with a similar trend observed in human hepatocytes (Huh7 cells) labelled with [(3)H]arachidonic . In addition, pharmacological inhibition of β-oxidation in Dictyostelium phenocopies   accumulation, in agreement with data reported in mammalian systems. Using Dictyostelium, we then screened a range of VPA-related compounds to identify those with high and low lipid-accumulation potential, and validated these activities for effects on lipid droplet formation by using human hepatocytes. Structure-activity relationships for these VPA-related compounds suggest that lipid accumulation is independent of VPA-catalysed teratogenicity and inositol depletion. These results suggest that Dictyostelium could provide both a novel model system for the analysis of lipid droplet formation in human hepatocytes and a rapid method for identifying VPA-related compounds that show liver toxicology.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27349116>[Lipid synthesis by an acidic  tolerant Rhodotorula glutinis].</a></h2><p>Acetic , as a main by-product generated in the pretreatment process of lignocellulose hydrolysis, significantly affects cell growth and lipid synthesis of oleaginous microorganisms.

Decreased supply of plasmalogen precursors to the brain by the liver, as a result of peroxisomal deficits is a process that probably starts early in the AD disease process. To overcome this metabolic compromise, we have designed an orally bioavailable DHA-containing ether lipid precursor of plasmalogens. PPI-1011 is an alkyl-diacyl plasmalogen precursor with  at sn-1, DHA at sn-2 and lipoic  at sn-3. This study outlines the oral pharmacokinetics of this precursor and its conversion to PlsEtn and phosphatidylethanolamines (PtdEtn).Rabbits were dosed orally with PPI-1011 in hard gelatin capsules for time-course and dose response studies. Incorporation into PlsEtn and PtdEtn was monitored by LC-MS/MS. Metabolism of released lipoic  was monitored by GC-MS. To monitor the metabolic fate of different components of PPI-1011, we labeled the sn-1 , sn-2 DHA and glycerol backbone with (13)C and monitored their metabolic fates by LC-MS/MS.PPI-1011 was not detected in plasma suggesting rapid release of sn-3 lipoic  via gut lipases. This conclusion was supported by peak levels of lipoic  metabolites in the plasma 3 hours after dosing. While PPI-1011 did not gain access to the plasma, it increased circulating levels of DHA-containing PlsEtn and PtdEtn. Labeling experiments demonstrated that the PtdEtn increases resulted from increased availability of DHA released via remodeling at sn-2 of phospholipids derived from PPI-1011. This release of DHA peaked at 6 hrs while increases in phospholipids peaked at 12 hr. Increases in circulating PlsEtn were more complex. Labeling experiments demonstrated that increases in the target PlsEtn, 16:0/22:6, consisted of 2 pools. In one pool, the intact precursor received a sn-3 phosphoethanolamine group and desaturation at sn-1 to generate the target plasmalogen. The second pool, like the PtdEtn, resulted from increased availability of DHA released during remodeling of sn-2. In the case of sn-1 18:0 and 18:1 plasmalogens with [(13)C(3)]DHA at sn-2, labeling was the result of increased availability of [(13)C(3)]DHA from lipid remodeling. Isotope and repeated dosing (2 weeks) experiments also demonstrated that plasmalogens and/or plasmalogen precursors derived from PPI-1011 are able to cross both the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers.Our data demonstrate that PPI-1011, an ether lipid precursor of plasmalogens is orally bioavailable in the rabbit, augmenting the circulating levels of unesterified DHA and DHA-containing PlsEtn and PtdEtn. Other ethanolamine plasmalogens were generated from the precursor via lipid remodeling (de-acylation/re-acylation reactions at sn-2) and phosphatidylethanolamines were generated via de-alkylation/re-acylation reactions at sn-1. Repeated oral dosing for 2 weeks with PPI-1011 resulted in dose-dependent increases in circulating DHA and DHA-containing plasmalogens. These products and/or precursors were also able to cross the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589513>Suppression of monosodium urate crystal-induced cytokine production by butyrate is mediated by the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases.</a></h2><p>Acute gouty arthritis is caused by endogenously formed monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which are potent activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, to induce the release of active interleukin (IL)-1β, an additional stimulus is needed. Saturated long-chain free   (FFAs) can provide such a signal and stimulate transcription of pro-IL-1β. In contrast, the short-chain   butyrate possesses anti-inflammatory effects. One of the mechanisms involved is inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we explored the effects of butyrate on MSU+FFA-induced cytokine production and its inhibition of specific HDACs.Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were stimulated with MSU and  (C16.0) in the presence or absence of butyrate or a synthetic HDAC inhibitor. Cytokine responses were measured with ELISA and quantitative PCR. HDAC activity was measured with fluorimetric assays.Butyrate decreased C16.0+MSU-induced production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β mRNA in PBMCs from healthy donors. Similar results were obtained in PBMCs isolated from patients with gout. Butyrate specifically inhibited class I HDACs. The HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat and the potent HDAC inhibitor, ITF-B, also decreased ex vivo C16.0+MSU-induced IL-1β production.In agreement with the reported low inhibitory potency of butyrate, a high concentration was needed for cytokine suppression, whereas synthetic HDAC inhibitors showed potent anti-inflammatory effects at nanomolar concentrations. These novel HDAC inhibitors could be effective in the treatment of acute gout. Moreover, the use of specific HDAC inhibitors could even improve the efficacy and reduce any potential adverse effects.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Because extractables include a large number of diverse compounds that are typically present in plastic extracts at low levels, the LC-MS methods must be broad scope and sensitive. To accomplish these objectives, screening studies typically couple gradient reversed-phase separations with electrospray MS detection (both positive and negative ion modes). While such methods are generally applicable for a number of extractables, they are not optimal for some commonly encountered extractables due to either poor chromatographic performance (e.g., peak tailing) or poor MS response. Modifications to mobile phase composition (e.g., pH adjustment) were examined to improve the performance of an LC-MS screening method. The use of 0.1% acetic  with 1 mM ammonium acetate (pH 3.6) as the aqueous portion of the mobile phase provided favorable sensitivities for a number of extractables both in positive and negative ion modes. In positive ion mode, the acidic mobile phase improved responses for moderately weak basic compounds by increasing their degree of protonation. For very weak basic compounds such as amides, ammonium ions in the mobile phase promoted proton adduct responses. In negative ion mode, an acidic mobile phase containing acetate anion improved ESI responses for acidic compounds, primarily due to gas phase effects.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20632939>Acetoacetate as regulator of -induced uncoupling involving liver mitochondrial ADP/ATP antiporter and aspartate/glutamate antiporter.</a></h2><p>The effect of acetoacetate on palmitate-induced uncoupling with the involvement of ADP/ATP antiporter and aspartate/glutamate antiporter has been studied in liver mitochondria. The incubation of mitochondria with acetoacetate during succinate oxidation in the presence of rotenone, oligomycin, and EGTA suppresses the accumulation of conjugated dienes. This is considered as a display of antioxidant effect of acetoacetate. Under these conditions, acetoacetate does not influence the respiration of mitochondria in the absence or presence of palmitate but eliminates the ability of carboxyatractylate or aspartate separately to suppress the uncoupling effect of this  . The action of acetoacetate is eliminated by beta-hydroxybutyrate or thiourea, but not by the antioxidant Trolox. In the absence of acetoacetate, the palmitate-induced uncoupling is limited by a stage sensitive to carboxyatractylate (ADP/ATP antiporter) or aspartate (aspartate/glutamate antiporter); in its presence, it is limited by a stage insensitive to the effect of these agents. In the presence of Trolox, ADP suppresses the uncoupling action of palmitate to the same degree as carboxyatractylate. Under these conditions, acetoacetate eliminates the recoupling effects of ADP and aspartate, including their joint action. This effect of acetoacetate is eliminated by beta-hydroxybutyrate or thiourea. It is supposed that the stimulating effect of acetoacetate is caused both by increase in the rate of transfer of   anion from the inner monolayer of the membrane to the outer one, which involves the ADP/ATP antiporter and aspartate/glutamate antiporter, and by elimination of the ability of ADP to inhibit this transport.

The results showed that propyl acetate and total esters were very low when the endogenous ethylene formation of the fruit was very low. At the stage of the increase in ethylene production, the rate of formation of propyl acetate and total esters increased. Butyl acetate appeared at the beginning of ethylene rise and increased thereafter. Ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate was produced at the beginning of climacteric stage and then increased sharply (Figs.1). These facts suggest that the aroma production is closely related to ethylene production. Among the 14 free amino  detected in fruit, isoleucine which is considered to be the biosynthetic precursor of some branched chain esters showed a great increase during fruit ripening while the others decreased or remained stable (Table 1). The accumulation of isoleucine suggested that isoleucine supply in fruit may not limit the biosynthesis of esters with branched chain alkyl groups.

In this study, different Pecorino cheeses obtained using calf, kid and pig rennets were compared in terms of  molecule profile, texture and sensory properties during ripening.The rennet type influenced the   composition of cheeses, though , myristic and oleic  were always predominant. The analysis of volatiles by SPME-GC/MS showed that Pecorino from calf rennet, at the end of ripening, was the least 'evolved' in terms of  profile. SPME-GC/MS analysis revealed that cheeses from calf rennet showed the slowest accumulation of free   over ripening time.  data permitted the differentiation of cheese samples ripened from 30 to 180 days according to the rennet used. Texture analysis differentiated cheeses made with pig and calf rennet from those made with kid rennet, which were less hard and more elastic than the former. Also sensory analysis differentiated cheese samples on the basis of rennet type, and cheeses made with pig rennet showed the lowest elasticity, bitter taste and fruity and hay flavour intensities.Pig rennet is fundamental to determine the quality parameters of Pecorino di Farindola cheese and could be used to impart peculiar quality features to ewe's milk cheeses.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21943200>Antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of tualang honey on human keloid fibroblasts.</a></h2><p>Keloid is a type of scar which extends beyond the boundaries of the original wound. It can spread to the surrounding skin by invasion. The use of Tualang honey is a possible approach for keloid treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extraction of Tualang honey to primary human keloid fibroblasts and to identify the  compounds in methanol extraction of Tualang honey.Crude Tualang honey was extracted with methanol and then dried using rota vapor to remove remaining methanol from honey.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring lipid amide that, when administered as a drug, inhibits inflammatory responses by engaging peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). PEA is preferentially hydrolyzed by the cysteine amidase N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing  amidase (NAAA), which is highly expressed in macrophages. Here we report the discovery of a potent and selective NAAA inhibitor, N-[(3S)-2-oxo-3-oxetanyl]-3-phenylpropanamide [(S)-OOPP], and show that this inhibitor increases PEA levels in activated leukocytes and blunts responses induced by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. These effects are stereoselective, mimicked by exogenous PEA, and abolished by PPAR-alpha deletion. (S)-OOPP also attenuates inflammation and tissue damage and improves recovery of motor function in mice subjected to spinal cord trauma. The results suggest that PEA activation of PPAR-alpha in leukocytes serves as an early stop signal that contrasts the progress of inflammation.

For occasional increase in the oil concentration up to 7.7gCOD(oil)/L(reactor) (55% Oil(COD)/Total(COD)) no statistical differences were detected between the reactors, in terms of methane production, effluent soluble COD, effluent  and total and  solids removal. Therefore this experiment allowed to conclude that cow manure-food waste co-digestion presents sufficient buffer capacity to endure solid-associated LCFA concentration up to 20-25gCOD-LCFA/kgTS. In a second experiment higher concentrations of oil were added, raising occasionally the concentration in the reactors to 9, 12, 15 and 18gCOD(oil)/L(reactor). All pulses had a positive effect in methane production, with the exception of the highest oil pulse concentration, that persistently impaired the reactor performance. This experiment demonstrates that threshold values for LCFA and C16:0 accumulation onto the solid matrix, of about 180-220gCOD-LCFA/kgTS and 120-150gCOD-C16:0/kgTS, should not be surpassed in order to prevent persistent reactor failure, as occurs in some full scale co-digestion plants.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594773>Simultaneous Determination of Essential Oil Components and   in Fennel using Gas Chromatography with a Polar Capillary Column.</a></h2><p>Cultivated and wild growing samples of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Apiaceae) from R.

In the present study, we identified the molecular mechanism of VPA-mediated suppression of adipogenesis in adipocytes. VPA suppressed the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerol. The expression levels of PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) and C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α), which are key regulators of adipogenesis, as well as the expression of SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), were decreased by the treatment with VPA. Moreover, glycerol release was decreased in the VPA-treated cells, even though the transcription levels of ATGL (adipose triacylglycerol lipase), HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) and MGL (monoacylglycerol lipase), all of which are involved in lipolysis, were elevated by the treatment with VPA. It is noteworthy that the expression level of FAS (  synthase) was significantly suppressed when the cells were cultured in medium containing VPA. Furthermore, VPA-mediated suppression of the accumulation of the intracellular triacylglycerols was prevented by the treatment with , a major product of FAS. The results of promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that USF1(upstream stimulating factor 1) bound to the E-box of the promoter region of the FAS gene. In addition, the expression of USF1 was decreased by the treatment with VPA. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of the USF1 gene repressed adipogenesis along with the decreased expression of the FAS gene. The overexpression of USF1 enhanced both adipogenesis and the expression of FAS in VPA-treated cells. These results indicate that VPA suppressed adipogenesis through the down-regulation of USF1-activated   synthesis in adipocytes.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404779>Transformation of raw ewes' milk applying "Grana" type pressed cheese technology: Development of extra-hard "Gran Ovino" cheese.</a></h2><p>This work was carried out to pursue a double objective: to improve the hygienic safety of cheeses produced from raw ewes' milk; and to produce a new typology of raw ewes' milk through the application of "Grana" technology for which the name "Gran Ovino" was chosen. With this in mind, raw milk from an individual farm was transformed under controlled conditions at a dairy pilot plant. The production technology included the partial skimming of the evening and morning milk mixture by cream surfacing and the addition of a natural whey starter cultures (NWSC) prepared with four selected Streptococcus thermophilus strains (PON6, PON244, PON261 e PON413). Ten microbial groups were investigated by plate counts from raw milk until ripened cheeses. Lactic  bacteria (LAB) were in the range 10-10 CFU/ml before NWSC addition. After curdling, this group increased by 3 log cycles and was counted at 10 CFU/g after curd cooking. A rapid pH drop (to 6.05) was registered after almost 3 h from NWSC addition. The levels of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were at about 10 CFU/ml in raw milk and decreased after curd cooking to 1 log cycle. A similar behavior was shown by the other undesired microbial groups and a complete disappearance of staphylococci was registered. The microbiological counts of 9-month ripened cheeses showed the dominance of LAB and undetectable levels of the undesired bacteria. MiSeq Illumina was applied to better investigate the bacterial composition of ripened cheeses and this technique evidenced that the majority of OTUs belonged to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera. The final cheeses were characterized by 67.65% dry matter of which 41.85% of fats and 47.02% of proteins. The main cheese   were , oleic and myristic  and the saturated  /unsaturated   ratio was 2.17. Forty-one  compounds, including , esters, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols and one terpene were emitted from the cheese.

It is still being exploited by pharmaceutical companies for its potential remedial effects.In this study, the effects of E. spinosa (L.) Campd. against acute inflammation, pain and oxidative damage were evaluated.Total phenols and flavonoids were evaluated. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities the E. spinosa ethyl acetate fractions of the aerial (Es EtOAc-AP) and underground (Es EtOAc-R) parts were assessed on carrageenan-induced paw oedema (100 mg/kg BW) and acetic -induced writhing response (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg BW), respectively. The E. spinosa fractions effects on oxidative stress markers and inflammatory parameters were determined. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed to identify various chemical components.The ethyl acetate fractions were shown to be the most active thanks to their phenolic and flavonoid contents richness. Intraperitoneal administration of E. spinosa ethyl acetate fractions at 100 mg/kg BW, one hour before carrageenan injection, significantly inhibited the oedema formation by 89.31% and 97.7% for the aerial and underground parts respectively when compared to the reference drug "dexamethasone" (51.9%). Besides, a significant increase (p ≤ 0.001) of the dermal antioxidant enzymes (the superoxide dismutase (SOD)), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed five hours after carrageenan administration. The best restoration was obtained with Es EtOAc-R (82.04%, 93.55% and 93.55% respectively for SOD, CAT and GPx activities). Moreover, EtOAc-fractions treated mice proved their ability to restore both of CRP and fibrinogen (p < 0.001).

Cows with a wide range of milk production (38 to 65 kg/d) were used to determine if response to fat supplementation varied according to production level. Thirty-two Holstein cows (143 ± 61 d in milk) were assigned randomly to a treatment sequence within level of milk production. Treatments were diets supplemented (2% of diet dry matter) with  (PA; 97.9% C16:0) or stearic  (SA; 97.4% C18:0). Treatment periods were 21 d and cows were fed a nonfat supplemented diet for 14 d immediately before the first treatment period. The final 4d of each period were used for sample and data collection. Milk production measured during the covariate period (preliminary milk yield) was used as the covariate. No interactions were detected between treatment and preliminary milk yield for the production response variables measured. Compared with SA, the PA treatment increased milk fat concentration (3.66 vs. 3.55%) and yield (1.68 vs. 1.59 kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield (47.5 vs. 45.6 kg/d). Treatment did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, milk protein yield, body weight, or body condition score. Milk protein concentration was lower for PA compared with SA treatment (3.24 vs. 3.29%). The PA treatment increased feed efficiency (3.5% fat-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) compared with SA (1.48 vs. 1.40). The increase in milk fat yield by PA was entirely accounted for by a 24% increase in 16-carbon   output into milk. Yields of de novo (3.2%) and preformed   (2.9%) were only slightly decreased by PA relative to SA. The PA treatment increased plasma concentration of nonesterified   (96.3 vs. 88.2 μEq/L) and glucose (56.6 vs. 55.7 mg/dL) compared with SA, but insulin and β-hydroxybutyrate were not altered by the treatments. Results demonstrate that  is more effective than stearic  in improving milk fat concentration and yield as well as efficiency of feed conversion to milk. Responses were independent of production level and without changes in body condition score or body weight. Further studies are required to test the consistency of these responses across different types of diets.Copyright © 2014 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although chronic valproic  produces similar effects on brain arachidonic  and docosahexaenoic  turnover, it does not alter phospholipase A(2) activity, suggesting that it targets a different enzyme in the turnover pathway.By isolating rat brain microsomal long-chain  acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl), we show in vitro that valproic  is a non-competitive inhibitor of Acsl, as it reduces the maximal velocity of the reaction without changing the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. While valproic  inhibited the synthesis of arachidonoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and docosahexaenoyl-CoA, the K (i )for inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA synthesis (14.1 mM) was approximately one fifth the K (i) for inhibiting palmitoyl-CoA (85.4 mM) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (78.2 mM) synthesis. As chronic administration of valproic  in bipolar disorder achieves whole-brain levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mM, inhibition of arachidonoyl-CoA formation can occur at brain concentrations that are therapeutically relevant to this disease. Furthermore, brain microsomal Acsl did not produce valproyl-CoA.This study shows that valproic  acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of brain microsomal Acsl, and that inhibition is substrate-selective.

Since it is not clear whether modulation of one step in the lipogenic pathway is more important than another, the use of tracer methods can provide a deeper level of insight regarding the control of metabolic activity. Although [H]water is generally considered a reliable tracer for quantifying DNL in vivo (it yields a homogenous and quantifiable precursor labeling), the relatively long half-life of body water is thought to limit the ability of performing repeat studies in the same subjects; this can create a bottleneck in the development and evaluation of novel therapeutics for inhibiting DNL. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to perform back-to-back studies of DNL using [H]water. However, this work uncovered special circumstances that affect the data interpretation, i.e., it is possible to obtain seemingly negative values for DNL.

The reasons for this sex difference are not completely understood, but hepatic   metabolism may play a role. The present study aimed to investigate the utilisation of plasma NEFA by the liver and to determine whether they are partitioned differently into ketone bodies and VLDL-TAG in healthy, lean young men and women. Volunteers were studied during a prolonged overnight fast (12-19 h) using an intravenous infusion of [U-¹³C]palmitate. After 12 h fasting, the women had a more advantageous metabolic profile with lower plasma glucose (P < 0·05) and TAG (P < 0·05) but higher plasma NEFA (P < 0·05) concentrations. Plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) concentrations rose more in women than in men, and the transfer of ¹³C from [U-¹³C]palmitate to plasma [¹³C]3-OHB reached a plateau 6-7 h after the start of the infusion in women but was still increasing at 6 h in men. This implies a slower 3-OHB production rate and/or dilution by other precursor pools in men. In women, the high isotopic enrichment of plasma 3-OHB suggested that systemic plasma   were the major source of 3-OHB production. However, in men, this was not observed during the course of the study (P < 0·01). There were no sex differences for the incorporation of ¹³C into VLDL1- or VLDL2-TAG.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a member of the - ethanolamide family, acts peripherally as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist, exerting analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Both PPAR-alpha and PEA are present in the CNS, but the specific functions of this lipid and its receptor remain to be clarified. Using the carrageenan-induced paw model of hyperalgesia in mice, we report here that intracerebroventricular administration of PEA (0.1-1 microg) 30 min before carrageenan injection markedly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia up to 24 h following inflammatory insult. This effect was mimicked by GW7647 (1 microg), a synthetic PPAR-alpha agonist. The obligatory role of PPAR-alpha in mediating PEA's actions was confirmed by the lack of anti-hyperalgesic effects in mutant mice lacking PPAR-alpha. PEA significantly reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in sciatic nerves and restored carrageenan-induced reductions of PPAR-alpha in the L4-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To investigate the mechanism by which PEA attenuated hyperalgesia, we evaluated inhibitory kB-alpha (IkB-alpha) degradation and p65 nuclear factor kB (NF-kappaB) activation in DRG. PEA prevented IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, confirming the involvement of this transcriptional factor in the control of peripheral hyperalgesia.

Control ESI-MS binding measurements performed on the Lg-PA interaction revealed that both the protonated and deprotonated gas phase ions of the (Lg + PA) complex are prone to dissociate in the ion source, which leads to artificially small association constants (K (a)). The addition of imidazole, a stabilizing solution additive, at high concentration (10 mM) increased the relative abundance of (Lg + PA) complex measured by ESI-MS in both positive and negative ion modes. The K(a) value measured in negative ion mode and using sampling conditions that minimize in-source dissociation is in good agreement with a value determined using a competitive fluorescence assay. The K (a) values measured by ESI-MS for the Lg interactions with MA and SA are also consistent with values expected based on the fluorescence measurements. However, the K (a) values measured using optimal sampling conditions in positive ion mode are significantly lower than those measured in negative ion mode for all of the FAs investigated. It is concluded that the protonated gaseous ions of the (Lg + FA) complexes are kinetically less stable than the deprotonated ions.

The affinities of Lg for CpA, CA, and LA determined using the reference ligand ESI-MS assay, a method for quantifying labile protein-ligand complexes that are prone to in-source dissociation, were found to be in good agreement with reported values.© American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2011</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20415420>Expression of genes associated with aroma formation derived from the   pathway during peach fruit ripening.</a></h2><p>Changes in characteristic aroma volatiles, levels of   as aroma precursors, and expression patterns of related genes, including lipoxygenase (LOX), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), and   desaturase (FAD), were studied in peach ( Prunus persica L.

Concentrations of n-hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenol decreased, whereas the production of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, gamma-hexalactone, gamma-octalactone, gamma-decalactone, and delta-decalactone increased with fruit ripening. Lactones showed a clear pattern concomitant with the climacteric rise in ethylene production, with gamma-decalactone being the principal  compound at the late ripening stage. Of the LOX family genes, PpLOX2 and PpLOX3 had relatively high transcript levels initially followed by a decline with fruit ripening, while levels of PpLOX1 and PpLOX4 transcripts were upregulated by accumulated ethylene production. Expression of PpHPL1, PpADH1, PpADH2, and PpADH3 showed similar decreasing patterns during ripening. Expression levels of PpAAT1 showed a rapid increase during the first 2 days of postharvest ripening followed by a gradual decrease. Contents of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic  increased, and saturated  levels tended to decline as the fruit ripened. The increased levels of unsaturated   closely paralleled increasing expression of PpFAD1 and PpFAD2.

Data from 3 previous experiments were used to address the study objectives, accounting for a total of 95 multiparous Holstein cows. Liver slices from biopsies on d -21, 1, and 21 relative to parturition were used to determine conversion of [1-(14)C]palmitate to CO2 and esterified products (EP) and the conversion of [1-(14)C]propionate to CO2 and glucose. Hepatic glycogen content was highest on d -21 and was 26.9 and 36.5% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. Liver triglyceride content was lowest at d -21 and was 271 and 446% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. We detected no difference in the capacity for the liver to oxidize [1-(14)C]palmitate to CO2 between d -21 and d 1; however, on d 21, oxidation was 84% of prepartum values. The capacity of the liver to convert [1-(14)C]palmitate to EP was 148 and 139% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. The capacity of liver to convert [1-(14)C]propionate to CO2 was 127 and 83% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, and the capacity of liver to convert [1-(14)C]propionate to glucose was 126 and 85% of prepartum values on d 1 and 21, respectively. Correlation relationships suggest that overall, cows with elevated prepartum liver triglyceride content had elevated triglycerides throughout the transition period along with increased [1-(14)C]palmitate oxidation and conversion to EP and a decreased propensity to convert [1-(14)C]propionate to glucose. Cows with increased [1-(14)C]propionate oxidation had increased conversion of [1-(14)C]propionate to glucose throughout the transition period. Overall, conditions that lead to impairments in   metabolism during the transition period appear to be associated with impaired postpartum hepatic propionate metabolism.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The conversion between oleic and  was linked to the biological activity. When  was fed to an EGSB reactor it represented also the main LCFA that accumulated onto the sludge. The way of  accumulation was different in the oleic and in the  fed reactors. When oleic  was fed, the biomass-associated LCFA (83% as ) were mainly adsorbed and entrapped in the sludge that became "encapsulated" by an LCFA layer. However, when  was fed, the biomass-associated LCFA (the totality as ) was mainly precipitated in white spots like precipitates in between the sludge, which remained "non-encapsulated." The two sludges were compared in terms of the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) in the presence of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and H(2)CO(2), before and after the mineralization of similar amounts of biomass-associated LCFA (4.6 and 5.2 g COD-LCFA/g of  suspended solids (VSS), for the oleic and  fed sludge, respectively). The "non-encapsulated," sludge exhibited a considerable initial methanogenic activity on all the tested substrates, with the single exception of butyrate. However, with the "encapsulated" sludge only methane production from ethanol and H(2)/CO(2) was detected, after a lag phase of about 50 h. After mineralization of the biomass-associated LCFA, both sludges exhibited activities of similar order of magnitude in the presence of the same individual substrates and significantly higher than before. The results evidenced that LCFA accumulation onto the sludge can create a physical barrier and hinder the transfer of substrates and products, inducing a delay on the initial methane production. Whatever the mechanism, metabolic or physical, that is behind this inhibition, it is reversible, being eliminated after the depletion of the biomass-associated LCFA.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17568062>Oleic  is a potent inhibitor of   and cholesterol synthesis in C6 glioma cells.</a></h2><p>Glial cells play a pivotal role in brain   metabolism and membrane biogenesis.

ACC activity was strongly reduced ( approximately 80%) by oleic , whereas no significant change in FAS activity was observed. Oleic  also reduced the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). The inhibition of ACC and HMGCR activities is corroborated by the decreases in ACC and HMGCR mRNA abundance and protein levels.

However, the effect of SFAs upon vascular inflammation is less clear. Endothelial cells (EC) play an important role in the acute inflammatory responses. We, therefore, evaluated the acute effects of different chain-length SFAs upon EC functions.Endothelial cells were cultured with various SFAs. Growth and cytotoxicity were determined by WST-1 assay. Apoptosis and pro-inflammatory adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression was assayed using flow cytometry. Activation of NF-kappaB was analyzed using western blot analysis.Long-chain SFAs (C14:0-C20:0) inhibited EC growth in a chain-length dependent manner. Medium-chain SFAs (C6:0-C12:0) did not significantly affect EC growth. In contrast, the short-chain SFA (C4:0) stimulated cellular growth. Stearic  induced significantly more EC apoptosis and necrosis than  or myristic . Stearic  (>10muM) treatment also significantly increased ICAM-1 expression. Stearic 's pro-inflammatory response was confirmed by phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and NF-kappaB in a dose dependent manner.Long-chain SFAs can induce pro-inflammatory responses and significantly impact growth and viability of EC. Our data suggest that the presence of long-chain SFAs in parenteral formulations may have harmful effects on the vascular system.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Earlier experiments in rodents show that a diet with a higher proportion of palmitate at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerols improves dietary fat and calcium absorption compared with a diet with a lower sn-2 palmitate content. A high-sn-2 palmitate diet increased fecal short-chain fatty acids, reduced gut inflammation in a colitis model, and altered tissue endocannabinoid concentrations in laboratory rodents. Recent studies in infants confirm that formula with a high sn-2 palmitate content reduces stool fat, , fat soaps, palmitate soaps, and calcium compared with formula with a low sn-2 palmitate content. These effects have been associated with improved bone strength, increased fecal bifidobacteria, and reduced crying in infants. In some studies, findings with formula high in sn-2 palmitate match those seen in breast-fed infants. However, in many studies, high sn-2 palmitate formula remains inferior to breast-feeding. It is concluded that infant formula high in sn-2 palmitate is superior to formula with low sn-2 palmitate but does not fully match human breast milk. Recent studies showing altered gut  (human infants) and tissue endocannabinoids (rodent model) suggest the potential for marked physiological impact of high sn-2 palmitate that needs to be explored further in human trials.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Mean values for the gross composition varied especially due to moisture, fat, total protein and nitrate concentration which reflected differences in the ingredients and some technological parameters. Cell numbers of the major microbial groups were almost similar among sausages. The major differences were found for Brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococci and moulds. Apart from their use as starters, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were the dominant lactic  bacteria and, as well as Staphylococcus xylosus, dominated the population of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Sausages differed for the hydrolysis of myofibrillar proteins and secondary proteolysis. Varzi, the sausage subjected to prolonged fermentation at 23-25°C for 10 days before ripening, showed the highest degree of secondary proteolysis. Varzi and Brianza, the two fermented sausages manufactured by using microbial starters, showed the highest concentration and similar profiles of free amino . The peptidase activities contained in the aqueous extracts agreed with the above findings. A total of 52  components, mainly alcohols, aldehydes and terpenes, were identified by solid-phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The  profiles of the three Italian PDO fermented sausages differed in part and, except for terpenes, the highest levels of the other chemical classes were found in Varzi and Brianza sausages. The composition of free   of the three Italian PDO sausages was rather similar. Monounsaturated   (MUFA) were found at the highest relative percentage followed by saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA)  . Oleic, , linoleic and stearic were the main free   found in all fermented sausages.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24035021>Milk  organic compounds and   profile in cows fed timothy as hay, pasture, or silage.</a></h2><p>Nutrient composition and organoleptic properties of milk can be influenced by cow diets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the forage type effects on  organic compounds,   (FA) profile, and organoleptic properties of milk. Timothy grass was fed as hay, pasture, or silage during a period of 27 d to a group of 21 cows in a complete block design based on days in milk. Each cow also received 7.2 kg/d of a concentrate mix to meet their nutrient requirements. Forage dry matter intake averaged 13.9 kg/d and was not different among treatments. Milk yield was higher for cows fed pasture, intermediate for cows fed silage, and lowest for cows fed hay. However, milk fat content was higher for cows fed hay and silage, compared with cows fed pasture. As a result, fat-corrected milk and fat yield were not different among treatments. Increasing the supply of dietary cis-9,cis-12 18:2 (linoleic ) and cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3 (α-linolenic ) when feeding pasture enhanced the concentration of these 2 essential FA in milk fat compared with feeding hay or silage. Moreover, the ratio of 16:0 () to cis-9 18:1 (oleic ), which is closely related to the melting properties of milk fat, was lower in milk from cows on pasture than in milk from cows fed hay or silage. Cows fed hay produced milk with higher levels of several free FA and γ-lactones, but less pentanal and 1-pentanol. More dimethyl sulfone and toluene were found in milk of cows on pasture. Cows fed silage produced milk with higher levels of acetone, 2-butanone, and α-pinene. Results from a sensory evaluation showed that panelists could not detect a difference in flavor between milk from cows fed hay compared with silage. However, a significant number of assessors perceived a difference between milk from cows fed hay compared with milk from cows fed pasture. In a sensory ranking test, the percentage of assessors ranking for the intensity of total (raw milk, fresh milk, and farm milk), sweet (empyreumatic, vanilla, caramel, and sugar), and grassy (grass, leafy vegetable, and plant) flavors was higher for milk from cows fed pasture compared with hay and silage. Using timothy hay, pasture, or silage harvested at a similar stage of development, the current study shows that the taste of milk is affected by the forage type fed to cows. More research is, however, needed to establish a link between the sensory attributes of milk and the observed changes in  organic compounds and FA profile.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

The pH increased during the last stages of processing but gradually declined over the curing period. TBARS values, hardness and chewiness increased with processing time from 0.14, 2.74 and 0.83 to 3.49 mg malonaldehyde/kg, 20.33 kg and 5.05 kg∗mm, respectively. Ripening time also affected the colour parameters: lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) (P<0.001). The total average content of free   (FFA) increased significantly from 433.7 mg/100 g of fat in the raw pieces to 2655.5 mg/100 g of fat at the end of the drying-ripening stage. The main FFA at the end of the manufacturing process was  (C16:0), followed by oleic (C18:1cis9), stearic (C18:0) and linoleic (C18:2n-6). A total of fifty five  compounds were identified during the manufacture of dry-cured foal "cecina", including esters, aldehydes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, branched hydrocarbons, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, furans, ketones. Aldehydes reached their maximum level at the end of the post-salting stage. In the final product, esters became the dominant chemical compounds.© 2013.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23992533>Sleep symptoms associated with intake of specific dietary nutrients.</a></h2><p>Sleep symptoms are associated with weight gain and cardiometabolic disease. The potential role of diet has been largely unexplored. Data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used (n = 4552) to determine which nutrients were associated with sleep symptoms in a nationally representative sample. Survey items assessed difficulty falling asleep, sleep maintenance difficulties, non-restorative sleep and daytime sleepiness. Analyses were adjusted for energy intake, other dietary factors, exercise, body mass index (BMI) and sociodemographics. Population-weighted, logistic regression, with backwards-stepwise selection, examined which nutrients were associated with sleep symptoms. Odds ratios (ORs) reflect the difference in odds of sleep symptoms associated with a doubling in nutrient. Nutrients that were associated independently with difficulty falling asleep included (in order): alpha-carotene (OR = 0.96), selenium (OR = 0.80), dodecanoic  (OR = 0.91), calcium (OR = 0.83) and hexadecanoic  (OR = 1.10). Nutrients that were associated independently with sleep maintenance difficulties included: salt (OR = 1.19), butanoic  (0.81), carbohydrate (OR = 0.71), dodecanoic  (OR = 0.90), vitamin D (OR = 0.84), lycopene (OR = 0.98), hexanoic  (OR = 1.25) and moisture (OR = 1.27). Nutrients that were associated independently with non-restorative sleep included butanoic  (OR = 1.09), calcium (OR = 0.81), vitamin C (OR = 0.92), water (OR = 0.98), moisture (OR = 1.41) and cholesterol (OR = 1.10). Nutrients that were associated independently with sleepiness included: moisture (OR = 1.20), theobromine (OR = 1.04), potassium (OR = 0.70) and water (OR = 0.97). These results suggest novel associations between sleep symptoms and diet/metabolism, potentially explaining associations between sleep and cardiometabolic diseases.© 2013 European Sleep Research Society.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28597159>Metabolite analysis of endophytic fungi from cultivars of Zingiber officinale Rosc. identifies myriad of bioactive compounds including tyrosol.</a></h2><p>Endophytic fungi associated with rhizomes of four cultivars of Zingiber officinale were identified by molecular and morphological methods and evaluated for their activity against soft rot pathogen Pythium myriotylum and clinical pathogens. The  bioactive metabolites produced by these isolates were identified by GC-MS analysis of the fungal crude extracts. Understanding of the metabolites produced by endophytes is also important in the context of raw consumption of ginger as medicine and spice. A total of fifteen isolates were identified from the four varieties studied. The various genera identified were Acremonium sp., Gliocladiopsis sp., Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus sp., Phlebia sp., Earliella sp., and Pseudolagarobasidium sp. The endophytic community was unique to each variety, which could be due to the varying host genotype. Fungi from phylum Basidiomycota were identified for the first time from ginger. Seven isolates showed activity against Pythium, while only two showed antibacterial activity. The bioactive metabolites identified in the fungal crude extracts include tyrosol, benzene acetic , ergone, dehydromevalonic lactone, N-aminopyrrolidine, and many bioactive   and their derivatives which included linoleic , oleic , myristic , n-hexadecanoic ,  methyl ester, and methyl linoleate. The presence of these varying bioactive endophytic fungi may be one of the reasons for the differences in the performance of the different ginger varieties.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23255443>Essential-oil and - composition, and antioxidant activity of extracts of Ficaria kochii.</a></h2><p>The essential-oil and - composition of the aerial parts of Ficaria kochii (Ledeb.) Iranshahr & Rech.f. native to Iran, and the antioxidant activity of various extracts of this plant were examined. The study by GC-FID and GC/MS analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 61 compounds, representing 86.01% of the total oil composition. Phytol (10.49%), farnesol (7.72%), methyl linoleate (5.57%), and α-farnesene (4.96%) were the main components. The - composition of the aerial parts of F. kochii was also analyzed by GC/MS. The major components were  (25.9%), linolenic  (25.3%), and linoleic  (17.5%). Polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) were found in higher amounts than saturated  . The possible antioxidant activity of various extracts (prepared by using solvents with different polarity) of the F. kochii aerial parts was evaluated by screening for their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity, Fe(III) -reducing power, total antioxidant activity, and inhibitory activity in the linoleic -peroxidation system. H(2) O proved to be the most efficient solvent for the extraction of antioxidants, as the H(2) O extract contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds (2.78±0.23 GAE/g dry matter) and also exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity in all the assays used. The results of the present investigation demonstrated that the aerial parts of F. kochii can be used as natural and safe nutrition supplement in place of synthetic ones.Copyright © 2012 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zürich.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26995125>Physicochemical evaluation of sheep milk yogurts containing different levels of inulin.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical parameters of sheep milk yogurt smoothies (SMY) containing inulin at different levels (0, 2, 4, and 6%). Titratable acidity and pH, yogurt bacteria counts,   profile, and healthy lipid indices were evaluated during 28 d of refrigerated storage. As expected for yogurts, Streptococcus thermophilus counts decreased 1 to 3 log cycles and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus counts decreased 1 to 2 cycles from d 1 to 28. The protective effect of inulin on bacteria survival and viability in the food matrix was not verified in the prebiotic SMY during storage, regardless of inulin level. Although lower post-acidification was observed in prebiotic SMY due to inulin addition, no changes were verified in short-chain   () or polyunsaturated   (PUFA). In contrast, an increase in medium- and long-chain   (MCFA and LCFA) and monounsaturated   (MUFA) was observed during storage in all SMY. The most significant levels of   in SMY were oleic , followed by  and myristic . A high positive correlation between conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and oleic  (r=0.978) was observed. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer represented approximately 78% of total PUFA and 2% of total  , whereas α-linoleic  comprised about 22% PUFA and 1% of total   in SMY. The   changes during storage were associated with the metabolic activity of the starter bacteria, especially for oleic  and cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer. Thus, the SMY represented a great source of these compounds. We observed that inulin levels did not affect  . A nonsignificant decrease in atherogenic index was observed during storage in all SMY, and a positive correlation (r=0.973) was found between atherogenic index and thrombogenic index of SMY. High correlations were observed between lauric and myristic  and saturated   (r=0.907 and r=0.894, respectively), providing evidence of their atherogenic and thrombogenic potential. A negative correlation was observed between stearic  and atherogenic index (r=-0.612) and between oleic  and atherogenic index. Sheep milk yogurt could be characterized as a food with low atherogenic and thrombogenic risk because of its healthy lipid composition. Therefore, addition of inulin to SMY could be a good option to improve functionality of this food matrix for dairy companies wishing to enter the functional food market.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.
