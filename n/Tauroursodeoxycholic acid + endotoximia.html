<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12620498>Inhibitory effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the induction of nitric oxide synthase in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the resultant increased nitric oxide production are associated with  and atherosclerotic lesions observed in transplant hearts or balloon-injured artery. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to have cardiovascular protective effects, such as inhibition of the development of transplant arteriosclerosis, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on nitric oxide production and the expression of iNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from adult rat aorta and rabbit coronary artery. Nitrite released from cells in the culture medium was measured with the Griess reaction. iNOS mRNA and protein were measured by Northern and Western blot analyses. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (30-1000 microM) significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production in a concentration-dependent manner, but ursodeoxycholic acid showed only small inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production that had already been induced by lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma. Ursodeoxycholic acid by itself did not affect basal nitric oxide production. Ursodeoxycholic acid also suppressed lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma-induced expression of iNOS mRNA and protein. Ursodeoxycholic acid had the most potent inhibitory effect among various kinds of bile acids examined, i.e. chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, cholic acid and conjugated bile acids such as . These results suggest that ursodeoxycholic acid inhibits the induction of iNOS and then nitric oxide production in aortic and coronary artery smooth muscle cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the cardiovascular protective effect of ursodeoxycholic acid under various pathophysiological conditions such as  and atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8743917>Differential effects between tauroursodeoxycholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acids in hepatic fibrosis: an assessment by primary cultured Ito and Kupffer cells from the rat liver.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in cholestasis is still unknown, except for . There is a possibility that the elevation of serum bile acids in cholestasis may play an important role in hepatic fibrogenesis due to a reaction to perisinusoidal cells, such as Ito or Kupffer cells. To assess the effects of bile acids, we investigated the cell proliferation and collagen formation of primary cultured Ito cells that were incubated with a Kupffer cell conditioned medium (KCCM) treated with either taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) or  (TUDCA) in short-term (8 h) or long-term (48 h) cultures. KCCM treated with TCDCA (100 mumol/L) but not with TUDCA increased cell proliferation of Ito cells in short-term cultures and also partially elevated collagen formation by Ito cells in long-term cultures. The release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) from Kupffer cells was increased by TCDCA in short-term cultures, but not in long-term cultures. The release of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) from Kupffer cells was increased by TCDCA in long-term cultures, but not in the short-term cultures. TUDCA showed no significant effect on the release of TNF alpha and TGF beta 1 from Kupffer cells. TUDCA or TCDCA itself showed no direct effect on the cell proliferation and collagen formation of Ito cells. In conclusion, these findings are thus considered to show the potentially important role of TCDCA on the development of hepatic fibrosis in the early phase of cholestasis without .</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p></html>
