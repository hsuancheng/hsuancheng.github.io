Ingenuity pathways analysis of proteomics data showed bacterially induced inflammation was associated with reduced expression of proteins from pathways of metabolism and digestion/absorption/excretion of nutrients/ions, and increased expression of cellular stress and immune response proteins. Both PUFA treatments showed anti-inflammatory activity; EPA appeared to act via the PPARα pathway, whereas AA appeared to increase energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization and reduce cellular stress responses, possibly enabling a more robust response to inflammation. While there was agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data with respect to pathways, there was limited concordance between individual gene and protein data, reflecting the importance of having both gene and protein data to better understand complex diseases such as .</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15662752>[Cytokines, prostaglandins, nutritive and non-nuitritive factors in inflammatory bowel diseases].</a></h2><p>Therapeutic interventions in the case of gastrointestinal disease are based on the understanding of the role of different inflammatory mediators. Reactive O2 and N2 metabolites are involved in . Pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis signalling and redox-response transcription factors are depended on free radicals. NO activates COX enzymes. PGE2 negatively modulates induction of NO synthase by interleukins and therefore regulation of gastric mucosal integrity by endogenous NO depends on  cascade. PG-s have pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system. Dietary PUFA-s and eicosanoids have potential effects on the modulation of inflammatory processes and immune cells. The cholesterol level lowering activity of several cytokines and colony stimulating factor can be observed. Therapeutic efficacy of N-3 PUFA is described in cases of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders, but N-3 PUFA-s only delay early relapse of ulcerative colitis in remission. TNF is known as a pleiotropic cytokine. Strategies for TNF in  is very important part of therapeutical approaches. Therapy with infliximab and related ones are encouraging in critical cases. It is also believed recently, that NF-kappaB also may be a target of  treatment. It became known, that oxidized LDL can inhibit LPS-induced binding of the NF-kappaB to DNA and the subsequent expression of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta in macrophages as well as oxidized LDL modulates activation of NF-kappaB in mononuclear phagocytes by altering the degradation of I-kappaBs. 15-d-PGJ2 inhibits multiple steps in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. 15-d-PGJ2 metabolite binds PPAR-gamma promotes adipocyte differentiation. PPAR-gamma ligand inhibits growth of cells through induction of apoptosis. Several nutritional polyphenols (the secondary metabolites of plants) are COX2 and/or LOX inhibitors and iNOS activators.

These fatty acids are able to inhibit partly a number of aspects of inflammation including leucocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leucocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty  , production of inflammatory cytokines and T cell reactivity. In parallel, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from arachidonioc  and EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving resolvins and protectins. Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty  composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of inflammatory genes, activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NR1C3 (i.e. peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked. In adult humans, an EPA plus DHA intake greater than 2 g day⁻¹ seems to be required to elicit anti-inflammatory actions, but few dose finding studies have been performed. Animal models demonstrate benefit from n-3 fatty acids in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease () and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in patients with RA demonstrate benefit supported by meta-analyses of the data. Clinical trails of fish oil in patients with  and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy.© 2012 The Author.

Surgically resected specimens from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and colrectal cancer (non-cancerous tissue; as a control) were submitted to phospholipid analysis and a PLase A2 assay, which measures the degradation of endogenous mucosal phospholipids. A high percentage of plasmenylethanolamine (plas.E) was detected in the glycerophospholipid fraction of CD mucosa. The  content of the phosphatidylethanolamine plus plas.E subfraction was higher in inflamed than in intact mucosa in CD. PLaseA2 activity, resulting in lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine production, was detected only in inflamed mucosa from CD and UC patients, but not in normal mucosa from controls. PLaseA2 activity was highest in moderately inflamed mucosa adjacent to a severely ulcerated area.

The present study demonstrates that TNF-alpha potentiates release and metabolism of 14C-labeled  (14C-AA) in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407). Although TNF-alpha on its own was but a weak stimulator of cellular 14C-AA turnover, it significantly potentiated the release of 14C-AA and 14C-labeled prostaglandin E2(14C-PGE2) after stimulation with three known phospholipase A2 activators: phospholipase. C from Clostridium perfringens, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine significantly reduced both AA and PGE2 release after combined stimulation with phospholipase C and TNF-alpha. In contrast to its effect on the AA turnover, TNF-alpha did not affect the phospholipase C-stimulated production of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether). Taken together, these findings indicate that a) TNF-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated AA release from cultured intestinal epithelial cells; b) TNF-alpha may stimulate phospholipase A2-dependent AA release without affecting the formation of PAF-acether and c) pretreatment with TNF-alpha potentiates the formation of PGE2 after stimulation with phospholipase A2 activators. In summary, the present investigation points to the possibility that TNF-alpha may stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce biologically active AA metabolites and that this stimulation may be modulated by components of the intestinal luminal content, like bacterial toxins.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048478>5-Lipoxygenase-derived lipid mediators are not required for the development of NSAID-induced inflammatory bowel disease in IL-10-/- mice.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are potent lipid mediators derived from the metabolism of  by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO).

We then evaluated the extent to which absence of 5-LO would alter the development of NSAID-induced colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. Absence of 5-LO did not delay the onset or alter the severity of inflammation in NSAID-treated IL-10(-/-) mice. At an early time point, 3 days after NSAID treatment was initiated, a qualitative increase in the number of dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells was noted in the colons of IL-10(-/-)/5-LO(-/-); however, this difference was no longer present after 14 days of NSAID treatment. Absence of 5-LO did not alter the degree of neutrophil infiltration into the in this model. Absence of 5-LO does not alter the development of IFN-gamma producing Th1-type CD4(+) T cells or IL-17 producing CD4(+) T cells. Absence of 5-LO-derived mediators did not alter the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Development of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice was associated with increased levels of the 5-LO-derived anti-inflammatory lipoxin LXA(4).

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino  composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, , and linoleic . In the same way, differences in the amino  composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic , leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, tyrosine, methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino  fragments. In this case, human colonic inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed and is a critical housekeeping gene, whereas COX-2 is rapidly upregulated by growth factors and cytokines and thus responsible for inflammation. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in colonic adenoma and carcinoma. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 have been shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and to inhibit tumor growth in animal models and in humans. Long-standing  patients have increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to general population. -associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably promoted by chronic inflammation and closely related to COX-2. In a recent study, powerful chemopreventive ability of selective COX-2 inhibitor was observed in colitis-related colon carcinogenesis in mouse model. But it was reported that even selective COX inhibitors aggravated the DSS-induced colonic inflammation. It is assumed that endogenous PGs are involved in the mucosal defense against DSS-induced colonic ulcerations which are produced by COX-1 at early phase and by COX-2 at late phase.

We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the IEB.We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer (controls). EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was measured.EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of 15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues. Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in colon tissues.

Enteral diet therapy has long been known to be efficacious in inflammatory bowel disease (), particularly in childhood Crohn's disease. However, the mechanisms of action of these diets are not clear. Nutritional repletion, direct effects on the gut mucosa or decreased intestinal permeability have all been postulated as being important in nutritional therapy. There is some evidence that the enteral diet has a direct effect on the gut mucosa by reducing cytokine production and the accompanying inflammation, thus leading to decreased intestinal permeability. Modifications of enteral diet composition have been evaluated in many studies. Such modifications include fat and/or protein content and the addition of bioactive peptides. The fatty  composition of the enteral diet seems to have a much greater impact on its efficacy than modification of the N source. As specific fatty acids are precursors of inflammatory mediators derived from , the reduction in these components may be beneficial in nutritional therapy for . Addition of bioactive peptides to enteral diet formulas may also have a role; such peptides may have specific growth factor or anti-inflammatory actions.

General recommendations of vitamin and mineral supplements are usually made for these patients. Diet may have a more fundamental role in the aetiology and treatment of Crohn's disease, although this is not certain. Several controlled studies have confirmed that an elemental diet is as effective as steroids in inducing a remission in patients with acute Crohn's disease.

The events induced by inflammatory mediators lead to dysregulated activation and induction of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 is involved in the conversion of  to biologically active prostanoids and is highly upregulated in colon cancer. Since inflammation-induced changes to the extracellular matrix could affect integrin activities, we here investigated the effect of integrin signalling on the level of COX-2 expression in the non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell lines, Int 407 and IEC-6. Adhesion of these cells to a collagen I- or IV-coated surface, increased surface expression of alpha2beta1 integrin. Activation of integrins with collagen caused an increased cox-2 promoter activity, with a subsequent increase in COX-2 expression. The signalling cascade leading to this increased expression and promoter activity of cox-2, involves PKCalpha, the small GTPase Ras and NFkappaB but not Erk1/2 or Src activity. The integrin-induced increase in cellular COX-2 activity is responsible for an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased cell migration.

A potentially important regulator of the production of these mediators is a protein activator of PLA2, referred to as PLA2 activating protein (PLAP).The purpose of this investigation was to discover if PLAP values might be increased in the inflamed intestinal tissue of patients with  and in intestinal tissue of mice with colitis.Biopsy specimens were taken from patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy, and normal colonic mucosa was obtained from patients without  after surgical resection.Immunocytochemistry with affinity purified antibodies to PLAP synthetic peptides was used to locate PLAP antigen in sections of intestinal biopsy specimens from  patients compared with that of normal intestinal tissue. Northern blot analysis with a murine [32P] labelled plap cDNA probe was performed on RNA extracted from the colons of mice fed dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) and cultured HT-29 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).PLAP antigen was localised predominantly within monocytes and granulocytes in intestinal tissue sections from  patients, and additional deposition of extracellular PLAP antigen was associated with blood vessels and oedema fluid in the inflamed tissues. In contrast, tissue sections from normal human intestine were devoid of PLAP reactive antigen, except for some weak cytoplasmic reaction of luminal intestinal epithelial cells. Similarly, colonic tissue from DSS treated mice contained an increased amount of PLAP antigen compared with controls. The stroma of the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa from the DSS treated mice reacted intensely with antibodies to PLAP synthetic peptides, while no reaction was observed with control mouse colons. These data were supported by northern analysis which showed that PLAP mRNA was increased in the colons of DSS treated mice and cultured HT-29 cells exposed to LPS.As PLAP values were increased in the intestinal mucosa of  patients and mice with colitis, as well as in LPS treated cultured HT-29 cells, a role was postulated for PLAP in increasing PLA2 activity, which leads to the increased synthesis of eicosanoids in intestinal tissues of patients with these inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427966>Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Bioactive Metabolites in Gastrointestinal Malignancies Related to Unresolved Inflammation. A Review.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative colitis patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors. Studies using animal models of inflammatory bowel disease have confirmed that exogenous administration of active metabolites derived from PUFAs called pro-resolving mediators like lipoxin A4, -derived, resolvins derived from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and docosapentaenoic (DPA) acids as well as maresin 1 and protectins DHA- and DPA-derived improve disease and inflammatory outcomes without causing immunosuppression or other side effects.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24201219>Pharmacology and therapeutics of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in chronic inflammatory disease.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have well documented anti-inflammatory properties, and consequently therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Thus, it has been postulated that control of lipid mediators production by inhibition of PLA2 would be useful for the treatment of . This hypothesis has been tested in the present study by examining the therapeutic effect of a novel natural probitic Bacillus subtilis PB6 (ATCC- PTA 6737). B. subtilis PB6 is found to secrete surfactins (cyclic lipopeptides) which have anti-bacterial potential. These surfactins inhibit PLA2, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the  associated inflammatory pathway and could downregulate the inflammatory response by regulating the eicosanoid and cytokine pathways. With this concept, an experimental animal trial has been conducted in a rat model of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis. The oral administration of PB6 suppresses the colitis as measured by mortality rate, changes in the weight gain, colon morphology and the levels of plasma cytokines. The animals treated orally with PB6 at 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/kg thrice daily from day 4 to 10 significantly improve gross pathology of the colon and regain the colon weight to normal (p < 0.05), compared to TNBS-induced positive control. The plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, 1L-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) are also significantly lowered (p < 0.05) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-I0 and TGF-beta) significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the oral administration of PB6 on day 11. The present study supports the concept that PB6 inhibits PLA2 by the secreting surfactins.

Its main manifestations are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The lipid and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the lipid metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the lipid profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found.

In subjects without , Ach constricted (-52%+/-10%) arterioles devoid of endothelium. Indomethacin (INDO) (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) had no effect.

The rationale for using 5-LO inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease () is based on the increased generation of LTs in the inflamed mucosa, LTB4 being the most potent chemotactic and chemokinetic metabolite of . Furthermore, conventional drugs, such as corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, and 5-aminosalicylic , inhibit LT production and specific 5-LO inhibition accelerates healing in animal models of acute colitis. The compounds identified as 5-LO inhibitors can be divided into antioxidants, substrate-analogous, and a large miscellaneous group of inhibitors, where hydroxamic acids are potent and more selective inhibitors of 5-LO. The benzothiophene hydroxyurea, zileuton, is the first selective 5-LO inhibitor evaluated for the treatment of patients with . An 800-mg oral dose of zileuton was shown to reduce LTB4, but not prostaglandin E2, concentrations by 75-85% in rectal dialysates from patients with active ulcerative colitis. The clinical efficacy of zileuton 800 mg b.i.d. has also been tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in similar patients. Zileuton significantly improved the symptom scores and the histology score, but not the sigmoidoscopy score, compared to pretreatment conditions and with response to placebo, the beneficial effects being most pronounced in patients not receiving concomitant sulphasalazine treatment. The mean inhibition of LTB4 in the target tissue of inflammation was 70%. The proof that any putative 5-LO inhibitor is blocking LT production is an important stage in assessing any such drug. The main disadvantage of existing new LT inhibitors relates to the high potency of LTs, and unless a higher level of inhibition can be achieved, endogenous LTs may still be present in sufficient amounts to produce their effects.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21471961>The endogenous cannabinoid system in the gut of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBs) by endocannabinoids impacts on a number of gastrointestinal functions.

TRPV1 is a member of a distinct subgroup of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels. The neuronally expressed TRPV1 is a non-selective, Ca(2+)-preferring, cation channel. In addition to capsaicin, this channel is activated by a number of different stimuli including heat, , certain  derivatives and direct phosphorylation via protein kinase C (PKC). Moreover, there is also evidence that various inflammatory mediators such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), bradykinin, nerve growth factor (NGF) or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) may indirectly lead to activation of the TRPV1 channel via activation of their respective receptors. There is strong experimental evidence that the combination of direct and indirect mechanisms finely tune the TRPV1 activity. Each of the different known modes of direct TRPV1 activation (protons, heat and vanilloids) is capable of sensitising the channel to other agonists. Similarly, inflammatory mediators from the external milieu found in disease conditions can indirectly sensitise the receptor. It is this sensitisation of the TRPV1 receptor in inflammatory disease that could hold the key and contribute to the transduction of noxious signalling for normally innocuous stimuli, i.e. either hyperalgesia in the case of chronic pain or airway hyperresponsivness/hypertussive responses in patients with chronic cough. It seems reasonable to suggest that the various mechanisms for sensitisation provide a scenario for TRPV1 to be tonically active and this activity may contribute to the underlying pathology -- providing an important convergence point of multiple pain producing stimuli in the somatosensory system and multiple cough-evoking irritants in the airways. The complex mechanisms and pathways that contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic pain and chronic cough have made it difficult for clinicians to treat patients with current therapies. There is an increasing amount of evidence supporting the hypothesis that the expression, activation and modulation of TRPV1 in sensory neurones appears to be an integral component of pain and cough pathways, although the precise contribution of TRPV1 to human disease has yet to be determined. So the question remains open as to whether TRPV1 therapeutics will be efficacious and safe in man and represent a much needed novel pain and cough therapeutic.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27990120>Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Their Derivatives: Therapeutic Value for Inflammatory, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are bioactive lipids which modulate inflammation and immunity.

Several studies have pinpointed the initiating role of longstanding/relapsing inflammatory insult on the intestinal mucosa, with the activation of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ), chemokines and metabolites of  resulting in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB. Longstanding inflammation may also modify the intestinal microbiota, prompting the overgrowth of genotoxic microorganisms, which may act as further cancer promoters. Most of the molecular dysregulation occurring in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis is documented in colitis-associated adenocarcinoma too, but marked differences have been established in both their timing and prevalence. Unlike sporadic cancers, TP53 alterations occur early in -related carcinogenesis, while APC dysregulation emerges mainly in the most advanced stages of the oncogenic cascade. From the therapeutic standpoint, colitis-associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, are significantly involved in colitis-associated cancer development and progression. The focus now is on identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, with a view to ultimately designing patient-tailored therapies.Copyright © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

The disease is characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gut. Because of the localization of the endocannabinoid system in the gastrointestinal tract, it may be a potential pharmacologic target for the treatment of  and other diseases. Fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a potential candidate because it is upregulated in . FAAH hydrolyzes and, as a consequence, inactivates anandamide (AEA), a prominent endocannabinoid. Inhibition of FAAH would lead to increases in the amount of AEA oxidized by cytochrome P450s (P450s). CYP2J2, the major P450 epoxygenase expressed in the heart, is also expressed in the intestine and has previously been reported to oxidize AEA. We have investigated the possibility that it may play a role in AEA metabolism in the gut and have demonstrated that purified human CYP2J2 metabolizes AEA to form the 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  ethanolamide (HETE-EA) and several epoxygenated products, including the 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic  ethanolamides (EET-EAs), in the reconstituted system. Kinetic studies suggest that the KM values for these products range from approximately 10 to 468 μM and the kcat values from 0.2 to 23.3 pmol/min per picomole of P450.

Acute colitis was induced using 4% dextran sodium sulfate in wild-type mice maintained on Se-deficient (<0.01 ppm Se), Se-adequate (0.08 ppm; sodium selenite), and two supraphysiological levels in the form of Se-supplemented (0.4 ppm; sodium selenite) and high Se (1.0 ppm; sodium selenite) diets. Selenocysteinyl transfer RNA knockout mice (Trsp(fl/fl)LysM(Cre)) were used to examine the role of selenoproteins in macrophages on disease progression and severity using histopathological evaluation, expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes, and modulation of PG metabolites in urine and plasma. Whereas Se-deficient and Se-adequate mice showed increased colitis and exhibited poor survival, Se supplementation at 0.4 and 1.0 ppm increased survival of mice and decreased colitis-associated inflammation with an upregulation of expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. Metabolomic profiling of urine suggested increased oxidation of PGE2 at supraphysiological levels of Se that also correlated well with Se-dependent upregulation of 15-hydroxy-PG dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of 15-PGDH, lack of selenoprotein expression in macrophages, and depletion of infiltrating macrophages indicated that macrophage-specific selenoproteins and upregulation of 15-PGDH expression were key for Se-dependent anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects.

However, inappropriate inflammation contributes to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease () and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both conditions are characterized by the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines,  (AA)-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory agents (e.g., reactive oxygen species, adhesion molecules). By virtue of their anti-inflammatory action, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be beneficial in inflammatory diseases. A large body of evidence supports a protective effect of omega-3 PUFA in experimental animal and ex-vivo models of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although fish oil supplementation in patients with  results in omega-3 PUFA incorporation into gut mucosal tissue and modification of inflammatory mediator profiles, the evidence of clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFA is weak. On the other hand, more convincing data support the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA in reducing pain, number of tender joints, duration of morning stiffness, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and improving physical performance in RA patients.

The recent development of ultrasensitive methods has made it possible to detect these epsilon-adducts in vivo and to study their formation and role in experimental and human carcinogenesis. The promutagenic epsilon-DNA modifications can be detected by immunoaffinity/32P-postlabelling or by immunohistochemistry. When epsilon-adducts are excised from tissue DNA, the modified nucleosides can be quantified in urine by an immunoaffinity-HPLC-fluorescence method. Highly variable background levels of epsilon-adducts were detected in tissues from unexposed humans and rodents, suggesting an endogenous pathway of formation from reaction of trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (via its 2,3-epoxide) with DNA bases. Several known cancer risk factors increased the level of these DNA lesions: Elevated epsilon-adducts were found in hepatic DNA from patients with excess metal storage (haemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), resulting in oxidative stress and high risk of liver cancer. Reactive O/N-intermediates generated during inflammatory processes, for example in patients with inflammatory bowel disease () and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) led to the formation of epsilon-adducts likely through peroxynitrite-mediated LPO and/or increased oxidative  metabolism. A high omega-6-polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) diet increased epsilon-DNA adducts in white blood cells (WBC), particularly in female subjects (about 40-fold), while the level of adducted malondialdehyde in deoxyguanosine of WBC-DNA was only moderately elevated. In conclusion, there is now growing evidence that epsilon-adducts were elevated in cancer-prone patients and in rodents (liver, pancreas, colon, skin), suggesting that promutagenic epsilon-adducts, when formed as a consequence of persistent oxidative stress, can drive cells to malignancy.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and tight-junction permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and oleic  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT.

Once these animals have been carefully evaluated, understanding of the role of various pathways of eicosanoid formation in gastrointestinal function, development, and epithelial growth regulation might be improved. Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of  metabolism and in eicosanoid receptor biology. The identification and characterization of an inducible cyclooxygenase isoform has led to important studies evaluating the role of this enzyme in inflammation, neoplasia, and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury. The demonstration that COX-2 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells leads to specific phenotypic changes, such as increased adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis, indicates that this enzyme may alter the tumorigenic potential of epithelial cells and offers hope for the future development of improved chemopreventive agents.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8214069>Mechanism of leukotriene D4 stimulation of Cl- secretion in rat distal colon in vitro.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase metabolites of  have been implicated as mediators of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (). To assess their role in regulation of electrolyte transport, we investigated the effect of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) on ion transport across isolated rat colonic mucosa under voltage-clamp conditions. Serosal addition of LTD4 caused a dose-dependent rapid and transient increase in both short-circuit current (Isc) and potential difference, with maximal response at 1 microM. Pretreatment of the tissue with a specific LTD4 receptor antagonist (SKF-104353) inhibited these LTD4 effects. The effect of LTD4 on Isc and potential difference was also abolished by the absence of Cl- from both bathing solutions or by the presence of a Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport inhibitor (bumetanide). A cyclooxygenase inhibitor (piroxicam) completely prevented the LTD4-induced increase in Isc. In addition, the effect of LTD4 on Isc was inhibited by either 5-hydroxytryptamine2 or 5-hydroxytryptamine3 antagonists (ketanserin and ICS-205-930, respectively). These results are consistent with a model in which LTD4 initially stimulates the synthesis from lamina propria cells of cyclooxygenase metabolites that induce electrogenic Cl- secretion, most likely via serotonergic receptors.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25747113>Zileuton, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, acts as a chemopreventive agent in intestinal polyposis, by modulating polyp and systemic inflammation.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes and prostaglandins, products of  metabolism, sustain both systemic and lesion-localized inflammation. Tumor-associated Inflammation can also contribute to the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease () have increased risk of developing colon cancer. The levels of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the key enzyme for leukotrienes production, are increased in colon cancer specimens and colonic dysplastic lesions. Here we report that Zileuton, a specific 5-LO inhibitor, can prevent polyp formation by efficiently reducing the tumor-associated and systemic inflammation in APCΔ468 mice.In the current study, we inhibited 5-LO by dietary administration of Zileuton in the APCΔ468 mouse model of polyposis and analyzed the effect of in vivo 5-LO inhibition on tumor-associated and systemic inflammation.Zileuton-fed mice developed fewer polyps and displayed marked reduction in systemic and polyp-associated inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive immunity cells were reduced both in the lesions and systemically. As part of tumor-associated inflammation Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), product of 5-LO activity, is increased focally in human dysplastic lesions. The 5-LO enzymatic activity was reduced in the serum of Zileuton treated polyposis mice.This study demonstrates that dietary administration of 5-LO specific inhibitor in the polyposis mouse model decreases polyp burden, and suggests that Zileuton may be a potential chemo-preventive agent in patients that are high-risk of developing colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12442911>Polyunsaturated fatty acids and inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is overall a protective response, whose main goal is to liberate the human being of cellular lesions caused by micro-organisms, toxins, allergens, etc., as well as its consequences, and of death cells and necrotic tissues. Chronic inflammation, which is detrimental to tissues, is the basic pathogenic mechanism of hypersensitivity reactions against xenobiotics. Other frequent pathologies, for instance atherosclerosis, chronic hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease (), liver cirrhosis, lung fibrosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis are also chronic inflammatory diseases. Chemical mediators of inflammation are derived from blood plasma or different cell-type activity. Biogenic amines, eicosanoids and cytokines are within the most important mediators of inflammatory processes. The different activities of eicosanoids derived from  (20:4 n-6) versus those derived from eicosapentaenoic  (20:5 n-3) are one of the most important mechanisms to explain why n-3, or omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in many inflammatory diseases. Dietary supplements ranging 1-8 g per day of n-3 PUFA have been reportedly beneficial in the treatment of , eczema, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, recent experimental studies in rats with experimental ulcerative colitis, induced by intrarectal injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic , have documented that treatment with n-3 long-chain PUFA reduces mucosal damage as assessed by biochemical and histological markers of inflammation. Moreover, the defence antioxidant system in this model is enhanced in treated animals, provided that the n-3 PUFA supply is adequately preserved from oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784429>Drug discovery approaches targeting 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) for inhibition of cellular leukotriene biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are proinflammatory lipid mediators associated with diverse chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, COPD, , arthritis, atherosclerosis, dermatitis and cancer. Cellular leukotrienes are produced from  via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in which the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, also named as FLAP, plays a critical role by operating as a regulatory protein for efficient transfer of  to 5-lipoxygenase. By blocking leukotriene production, FLAP inhibitors may behave as broad-spectrum leukotriene modulators, which might be of therapeutic use for chronic inflammatory diseases requiring anti-leukotriene therapy. The early development of FLAP inhibitors (i.e. MK-886, MK-591, BAY-X-1005) mostly concentrated on asthma cure, and resulted in promising readouts in preclinical and clinical studies with asthma patients. Following the recent elucidation of the 3D-structure of FLAP, development of new inhibitor chemotypes is highly accelerated, eventually leading to the evolution of many un-drug-like structures into more drug-like entities such as AZD6642 and BI665915 as development candidates. The most clinically advanced FLAP inhibitor to date is GSK2190918 (formerly AM803) that has successfully completed phase II clinical trials in asthmatics. Concluding, although there are no FLAP inhibitors reached to the drug approval phase yet, due to the rising number of indications for anti-LT therapy such as atherosclerosis, FLAP inhibitor development remains a significant research field. FLAP inhibitors reviewed herein are classified into four sub-classes as the first-generation FLAP inhibitors (indole and quinoline derivatives), the second-generation FLAP inhibitors (diaryl-alkanes and biaryl amino-heteroarenes), the benzimidazole-containing FLAP inhibitors and other FLAP inhibitors with polypharmacology for easiness of the reader. Hence, we meticulously summarize how FLAP inhibitors historically developed from scratch to their current advanced state, and leave the reader with a positive view that a FLAP inhibitor might soon reach to the need of patients who may require anti-LT therapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, the underlying mechanism of CP was explored by the metabolic profiling analysis and correlated signaling pathways. TNBS/ethanol induced colitis was used to investigate the intervention efficacy following oral administration of CP. The levels of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-1β, and the activities of SOD, MPO, and MDA were determined. We also performed western-blot for p65, TLR4, p-JAK2, and STAT3 protein expression in the colon tissue to probe their mechanisms of correlated signaling pathways. What's more, the metabolic changes in plasma and urine from colitis rats were investigated based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS combined with Metabolynx software. The potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways were also tentatively confirmed. The metabolic profiles of plasma and urine were clearly improved in model rats after oral administration of CP. Thirty-two (17 in serum and 15 in urine) potential biomarkers were identified. The endogenous metabolites were mainly involved in linoleic , retinol, , glycerophospholipid and primary bile  metabolism in plasma, and nicotinate and nicotinamide, ascorbate and aldarate, histidine and β-alanine metabolism in urine. After polysaccharides intervention, these markers turned back to normal level at some extent.

Genetic and pharmacological data point to a protective role of CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptor activation in  experimental models. Therefore, increasing the endogenous levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the main full agonist of these receptors, should have beneficial effects on colitis. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were raised in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis mouse model by inhibiting monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, using the selective inhibitor JZL184. MAGL inhibition in diseased mice increased 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels, leading to a reduction of macroscopic and histological colon alterations, as well as of colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The restored integrity of the intestinal barrier function after MAGL inhibition resulted in reduced endotoxemia as well as reduced peripheral and brain inflammation. Coadministration of either CB(1) (SR141716A) or CB(2) (AM630) selective antagonists with JZL184 completely abolished the protective effect of MAGL inhibition on TNBS-induced colon alterations, thus demonstrating the involvement of both cannabinoid receptors.

Rag mice were reconstituted by intraperitoneal injection with splenocytes from wild-type (WT) or IL-10(-/-) animals. Colitis was induced by using piroxicam and was graded histologically. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC), lamina propria T cells, and LPMC depleted of T cells from reconstituted Rag mice were studied for cytokine production. Only animals reconstituted with IL-10(-/-) CD4(+) T cells and administered piroxicam developed severe colitis. LPMC from these colitic animals made IFN-gamma, whose production was dependent on T cells. Some IL-10 was produced but only from non-T cells. LPMC from the healthy Rag mice that were reconstituted with WT T cells and were piroxicam resistant made much more IL-10. This was mostly T cell dependent. In conclusion, only CD4(+) T cells from IL-10(-/-) animals leave Rag mice susceptible to NSAID-induced, Th1 colitis. Lamina propria T cells normally make large quantities of IL-10, suggesting that IL-10 from T cells may be protective.</p><p>Keyword: IBD</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149823>Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a condition which contributes to a range of human diseases. It involves a multitude of cell types, chemical mediators, and interactions. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. These fatty acids are able to partly inhibit a number of aspects of inflammation including leukocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty  , production of inflammatory cytokines, and T-helper 1 lymphocyte reactivity. In addition, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from  and EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving mediators called resolvins, protectins and maresins. Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of marine n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty  composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of inflammatory genes, activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked, although the full extent of this is not yet elucidated. Animal experiments demonstrate benefit from marine n-3 fatty acids in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease () and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in RA demonstrate benefit, but clinical trials of fish oil in  and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy.
