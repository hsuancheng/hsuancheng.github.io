We first demonstrated that combining Bifidobacterium animalis DN-173 010, as a bile salt-hydrolysing bacterium, and Clostridium absonum ATCC 27555, as a CDCA to UDCA epimerising bacterium, led to the efficient epimerisation of glyco- and tauro-CDCA in vitro, with respective UDCA yields of 55.8 (SE 2.8) and 36.6 (SE 1.5)%. This strain combination was then administered to hypercholesterolaemic pigs over a 3-week period, as two daily preprandial doses of either viable (six experimental pigs) or heat-inactivated bacteria (six controls). The main effects of treatment were on unconjugated bile acids (P=0.035) and UDCA (P<0.0001) absorbed into the portal vein, which increased 1.6-1.7- and 3.5-7.5-fold, respectively, under administration of living compared with inactivated bacteria. In bile, UDCA did not increase significantly, but the increase in biliary  with time in the controls was not observed in the experimental pigs (P=0.007), and the same trend was observed in faeces. All other variables (biliary lipid equilibrium, plasma lipid levels and partition of cholesterol between the different lipoprotein classes) remained unaffected by treatment throughout the duration of the experiment. In conclusion, it is feasible to increase the bioavailability of UDCA to the intestine and the liver by administering active bacteria. This may represent an interesting new probiotic activity, provided that in future it could be expressed by a safe food micro-organism.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5858718>Lipogenesis and cholesterol turnover in the chick as influenced by dietary .</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409294>Cafestol, the cholesterol-raising factor in boiled coffee, suppresses bile  synthesis by downregulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Consumption of boiled coffee raises serum cholesterol levels in humans. The diterpenes cafestol and kahweol in boiled coffee have been found to be responsible for the increase. To investigate the biochemical background of this effect, we studied the effects of cafestol and a mixture of cafestol/kahweol/isokahweol (48:47:5 w/w) on bile  synthesis and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase in cultured rat hepatocytes. Dose-dependent decreases of bile  mass production and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase activity were found, showing a maximal reduction of -91%, -79%, and -49% respectively, at a concentration of 20 micrograms/mL cafestol. The decrease in 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 27-hydroxylase activity paralleled well the suppression of the respective mRNAs, being -79% and -77%, and -49% and -46%, respectively, at 20 micrograms/mL cafestol. Run-on data showed a reduction in 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 27-hydroxylase gene transcriptional activity after incubation with cafestol. The mixture of cafestol/kahweol/isokahweol was less potent in suppression of bile  synthesis and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Cafestol (20 micrograms/mL) had no effect on  6 beta-hydroxylase mRNA, another enzyme involved in bile  synthesis. LDL-receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase mRNAs were significantly decreased by cafestol (-18%, -20%, and -43%, respectively). We conclude that cafestol suppresses bile  synthesis by downregulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and of, to a lesser extent, sterol 27-hydroxylase in cultured rat hepatocytes, whereas kahweol and isokahweol are less active. We suggest that suppression of bile  synthesis may provide an explanation for the cholesterol-raising effect of cafestol in humans.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872803>Barley β-glucan increases fecal bile  excretion and short chain fatty  levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals.</a></h2><p>The cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan has been proposed to be the result of a pleiotropic effect, which involves several biological mechanisms such as gut fermentation, inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased bile  excretion and its synthesis. However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular weight promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/842535>Cholestatic liver disease associated with diphenylhydantoin therapy. Possible pathogenic importance of altered bile salt metabolism.</a></h2><p>A ten-year-old boy persented with a prolonged cholestatic liver disease 5 weeks after starting diphenylhydantoin therapy. The initial phase of his illness was characterized by hepatocellular damage with swollen liver cells and centrilobular cholestasis. Severe hyperlipoproteinemia with eruptive xanthomata developed within 3 weeks of his initial jaundice. The second phase of his illness was characterized by portal tract inflammation with bile ductular proliferation and chronic cholestasis gradually resolving over a period of 15 months. It is postulated that diphenylhydantoin sensitivity produced swollen hepatocytes with hypertrophy of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, reducing hepatic sinusoidal blood flow and the clearance of secondary bile salts. A fall in clearance of lipoproteins, including the cholesterol precursor of primary bile  synthesis, may have been responsible for a reduction in serum bile  concentration. High levels of serum , largely unsulfated presumably due to decreased hepatic uptake, may have produced the prolonged second phase of this illness when histological changes resembled that seen in experimental animals following  administration.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3396774>Fecal and biliary bile  composition after partial ileal bypass operation.</a></h2><p>Biliary and fecal bile  composition was studied in 13 patients 3-12 years after a partial ileal bypass operation and in 10 unoperated controls, all with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Three operated patients were taking cholestyramine. The relative amount of cholic  in the bile was decreased at the expense of chenodeoxycholic  in the operated subjects. Chenodeoxycholic  content of the bile correlated negatively with the fractional cholesterol absorption, suggesting that in compromised absorption chenodeoxycholic  is absorbed more efficiently than cholic . Despite a ninefold increase in total bile  synthesis the cholic/chenodeoxycholic  synthesis ratio was not significantly different in the operated and control subjects. However, the lower the chenodeoxycholic  synthesis the higher was the proportion of deoxycholic  in the bile and feces, suggesting regulation of chenodeoxycholic  synthesis by deoxycholic . Ileal exclusion had increased the proportion of primary bile acids in the feces from below 10 to over 50%. Despite increased fecal water excretion the concentration of fecal total and dihydroxy bile acids was higher in the operated than in control subjects. However, the fecal concentration of the potentially cancer-promoting bile acids, deoxycholic  and , was not increased in the operated subjects. In the operated subjects, fecal water output was positively correlated with total bile  and chenodeoxycholic  synthesis. It is concluded that the severe bile  malabsorption caused by ileal exclusion activates the synthesis of both primary bile acids in similar amount. However, after ileal exclusion the relative amount of cholic  in the bile is decreased, obviously because loss of ileal absorption predominantly affects the absorption of cholic .</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2242032>Effects of novel bile salts on cholesterol metabolism in rats and guinea-pigs.</a></h2><p>Novel bile salts (quaternary ammonium conjugates) inhibited cholic  binding and transport in everted ileal sacs in vitro. The cationic piperazine conjugate of  (di-iodide salt, compound 8, BRL 39924A) appeared most active, inhibiting binding by 29% and transport by 59% in guinea-pig ileum (200 microM). BRL 39924A also inhibited taurocholate uptake into guinea-pig ileal sacs and cholate uptake into rat ileal sacs and was selected for further study in vivo. In hyperlipidaemic rats, BRL 39924A significantly raised cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and decreased hepatic accumulation of exogenous cholic . HDL cholesterol concentration in the serum increased and the level of VLDL plus LDL cholesterol decreased. In hyperlipidaemic guinea-pigs. BRL 39924A lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Although metabolic changes were less than those achieved with the bile  sequestrant, cholestyramine, the doses of BRL 39924A used were much lower (100-500 mg/kg body wt).

Serum PSA, free testosterone and estradiol, and fecal bile  and neutral sterol excretion were evaluated.Mean serum PSA was lower with the soluble than the insoluble fiber diet (0.07+/-0.03 ng./ml., p = 0.035). No treatment difference was seen in free testosterone or estradiol, although the latter decreased significantly with the insoluble fiber diet (9+/-3 pmol./l., p = 0.004). After 16 weeks total fecal bile  output was greater with the soluble (341+/-56 mg. daily) compared to the insoluble (203+/-35, p = 0.001) fiber diet but no differences were seen in fecal neutral sterol elimination. The treatment difference in fecal  output related to the difference in serum PSA (r = 0.57, p = 0.035).A small but statistically significantly lower serum PSA was seen in healthy men consuming soluble fiber, which was not related to changes in serum sex hormones but was related to the increased  output as a possible marker of increased fecal steroid elimination.

The lipid levels in serum very low density and low density lipoproteins were elevated but those in high density lipoprotein were not. Bile flow was not changed but biliary secretion of cholesterol, phospholipid and bile acids markedly increased.

Fecal excretion of deoxycholic  increased but that of  and hyodeoxycholic acids decreased, and alpha, beta- and omega-muricholic acids did not change, thus, the total amount of fecal bile acids remained unchanged. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis was markedly depressed, while cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity did not change and cytochrome P-450 content was elevated by about 40%. From such evidence, it was apparent that synthesis of cholic  increased while that of chenodeoxycholic  decreased and the total amount of bile acids synthesized did not change in the diabetic rats. Furthermore, marked increase of the pool size of cholic  and hepatic secretion of cholic  stimulated the absorption of lipids and produced a hyperlipidemia in the diabetic rats.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9862274>Studies of cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early atherogenesis in hamsters fed GT16-239, a novel bile  sequestrant (BAS).</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of GT16-239, an alkylated, cross-linked poly(allylamine) bile  sequestrant with cholestyramine on cholesterol and bile  metabolism, and early aortic atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic male F1B Golden Syrian hamsters. In this controlled study, 42 hamsters were divided into six groups and were fed a chow-based hypercholesterolemic diet supplemented with a 10% oil blend (55% coconut/45% corn), 0.1% cholesterol (w/w) (control) and either 0.9 or 1.2% cholestyramine or 0.2, 0.4 or 0.6% GT16-239 for 13 weeks. Laboratory analyses included evaluating plasma lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities, fecal excretion of bile acids and neutral sterols, hepatic cholesterol concentrations, and early atherosclerosis (aortic fatty streak area). Relative to the control diet, the 0.6% GT16-239 versus the 1.2% cholestyramine significantly inhibited the elevation of plasma lipoprotein total cholesterol (TC) (-69% vs -40%), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (-49% vs -30%), and non-HDL-C (-81 vs -48%) concentrations; increased the activities of both HMG-CoA reductase (1492% vs 62%) and 7 alpha-hydroxylase (175% vs 86%); lowered the concentration of hepatic cholesteryl ester (-94% vs -59%); increased fecal cholesterol concentration (+28% vs -10%); and decreased aortic fatty streak area (-100% vs -86%).

Composition and amounts of bile acids were modified in the gastrointestinal tract of hamsters receiving 10% BCD as compared to the control group. The total bile  content of the gallbladder of treated hamsters was fourfold higher than in the control group, and the bile contained a large amount of hydrophilic bile acids. This trend was also observed in the small intestine, in which percentages and total quantities of cholic plus deoxycholic acids (cholic pathway) were higher than those of chenodeoxycholic plus ursodeoxycholic plus  acids (chenodeoxycholic pathway).

The plasma cholesterol concentration of normal rabbits increases dramatically from about 30 mg/dl to > 300 mg/dl after they are fed a 0.1% cholesterol-enriched diet for 3-4 months. Cholesterol-fed CRT/mlo animals, however, maintain a cholesterol level of about 30 mg/dl during the entire cholesterol feeding period. In addition to the low plasma cholesterol level, measurements of cellular cholesterol indicate that the hepatic cholesterol content of the cholesterol-fed resistant rabbit remains markedly lower than it does in normal animals fed the same diet. The only mechanism for removal of significant quantities of cholesterol carbon from the body is via the fecal excretion of cholesterol, neutral sterol metabolites, and bile acids. In comparison to the basal, low-cholesterol diet, we observed that cholesterol-fed resistant rabbits had increased excretion of , while excretion of this bile  by cholesterol-fed normal rabbit remained similar to basal diet levels. Deoxycholic  excretion, the other main bile  excreted in the feces of rabbits, was decreased in response to cholesterol challenge in animals with either resistant or normal phenotypes, but the decrease was significantly less in the resistant rabbits. Thus, the resistant rabbits excreted relatively more  and deoxycholic  than did the cholesterol-fed normal rabbit. The difference in bile  excretion was also manifest by a higher than normal level of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA in the livers from resistant versus normal rabbits. As cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is the putative rate-limiting step of bile  synthesis, we believe that the increased excretion of bile acids by resistant animals is due, at least in part, to increased levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4745517>Hypercholesterolemic effect in the female rat of egg yolk versus crystalline cholesterol dissolved in lard.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4703225>The different effects on the serum lipids and fecal steroids of high carbohydrate diets given orally or intravenously.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis that diets high in carbohydrate produce  in man was tested in new experiments which provided all calories either by the intravenous route or orally. After a base-line general diet, eight healthy men were fed fat-free diets consisting of 80% of the calories from glucose and 20% from an amino  hydrolysate. The calories were adequate to maintain body weight. The solutions (1 cal/ml) were infused by constant drip over a 24 h period through either a superior vena cava catheter or a nasogastric tube. Each feeding was for 12 days in sequence but assigned in random order. The high CHO diet given orally, as expected, increased the mean base-line serum triglyceride level from 176+/-29 (SE) to 274+/-47. The identical diet given intravenously (i.v.) failed to produce hypertriglyceridemia; triglyceride levels were not significantly changed, 154+/-37, nor were blood glucose levels. Serum insulin levels were higher during the intravenous feeding. In contrast, both i.v. and oral feedings greatly lowered mean serum cholesterol concentration from the base-line value of 220+/-13 mg/100 ml to 135+/-11 and 151+/-13, respectively. However, the serum cholesterol level was significantly lower (P < 0.01) with the intravenous feeding than with the oral feeding. In addition, the fecal excretion of both neutral sterols and bile acids diminished greatly during the period of intravenous feeding. The fecal mass was likewise decreased. The bacterial conversion of cholesterol to conprostanol did not occur with either intravenous or oral feeding, but with both regimens secondary bile acids predominated, as usual, in the bile  fraction of the stool. These results emphasize the key role of the intestinal mucosa in the etiology of carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia and as a direct or indirect contributor to plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the absence of dietary lipids. When the gut mucosa was bypassed, carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia did not occur and both serum triglyceride and serum cholesterol levels decreased greatly at a time when the excretion of steroids in the stool was also reduced.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/879078>Effects of acute caloric restriction on cholesterol metabolism in man.</a></h2><p>The effects of acute caloric restriction on cholesterol balance and kinetics of plasma cholesterol specific activity were investigated in five hyperlipemic subjects with varying degrees of obesity.
