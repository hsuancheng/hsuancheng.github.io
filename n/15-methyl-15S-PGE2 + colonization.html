Despite trials for GBS vaccines already being underway, the factors influencing vaginal GBS  and clearance are currently poorly understood.Within this study, we investigated the host immune responses to GBS infections in mice that affect GBS vaginal  and clearance. Cervicovaginal swabs were used to measure vaginal GBS persistence, and vaginal cytokine responses were measured using the Bio-Plex® system. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens were stimulated with UV-killed GBS to examine systemic cellular responses. Additional in vitro cellular experiments using human vaginal epithelial cells were also performed, examining the effect pregnancy level hormones had on GBS adhesion, invasion and cytokine responses.We observed significant differences in the ability of GBS serotype V infections to persist, compared to GBS serotype Ia vaginal infections. Vaginal cytokine response examination identified temporal changes in cytokine production (IL10, IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, TNFα) in relation to GBS serotype and clearance or . Lymphocyte proliferation assays also revealed robust cellular immune responses to GBS vaginal infections irrespective of clearance or . In vitro human cellular analyses also identified that vaginal epithelial cell line cytokine production was suppressed in the presence of hormones despite no alteration in adhesion/invasion.Here, we establish previously unknown, serotype specific, temporal immune responses which may be associated with vaginal GBS  or clearance in the female genital tract.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In view of this, the present study was initiated to understand the interaction effect of native Glomerales species application in rice plants (cv. Naveen) under elevated CO concentrations (400 ± 10, 550 ± 20, and 700 ± 20 ppm) in open-top chambers. Three different modes of application of the AMF inoculum were evaluated, of which, combined application of AMF at the seedling production and transplanting stages showed increased AMF , which significantly improved grain yield by 25.08% and also increased uptake of phosphorus by 18.2% and nitrogen by 49.5%, as observed at 700-ppm CO concentration. Organic acids secretion in rice root increased in AMF-inoculated plants exposed to 700-ppm CO concentration. To understand the overall effect of CO elevation on AMF interaction with the rice plant, principal component and partial least square regression analysis were performed, which found both positive and negative responses under elevated CO concentration.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Knowledge on when and where MRSA  is acquired and what clones are involved is necessary, to focus efforts for prevention of hospital-acquired MRSA-infections.A prospective/longitudinal cohort study was performed in eight Argentina hospitals (Cordoba/October-December/2014). Surveillance cultures for MRSA (nose-throat-inguinal) were obtained on admission and at discharge. MRSA strains were genetically typed as CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA genotypes.Overall, 1419 patients were screened and 534 stayed at hospital for ≥3 days. S. aureus admission prevalence was 30.9% and 4.2% for MRSA. Overall MRSA acquisition rate was 2.3/1000 patient-days-at-risk with a MRSA acquisition prevalence of 1.96% (95%CI: 1.0%-3.4%); 3.2% of patients were discharged back to community with MRSA. CA-MRSA accounted for 84.6% of imported, 100.0% of hospital-acquired and 94% of discharged MRSA strains. Most imported and acquired MRSA strains belonged to two major epidemic CA-MRSA clones spread in Argentina: PFGEtypeI-ST5-IVa-t311-PVL and PFGEtypeN/ST30-IVc-t019-PVL.CA-MRSA clones, particularly ST5-IV-PVL and ST30-IV-PVL, with main reservoir in the community, not only enter but also are truly acquired within hospital, causing healthcare-associated-hospital-onset infections, having a transmission capacity greater or similar than HA-MRSA. This information is essential to develop appropriate MRSA infection prevention-control programs, considering hospital and community.Copyright © 2019.

Its genome contains 177 unique O islands (OIs), which contribute largely to the high virulence and pathogenicity although most OI genes remain uncharacterized. In the current study, we demonstrated that OI-19 is required for EHEC O157:H7 adherence to host cells. Z0442 (OI-encoded virulence regulator A [OvrA]) encoded in OI-19 positively regulated bacterial adherence by activating locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) gene expression through direct OvrA binding to the gene promoter region of the LEE gene master regulator Ler. Mouse  experiments revealed that OvrA promotes EHEC O157:H7 adherence in mouse intestine, preferentially the colon. Finally, OvrA also regulated virulence in other non-O157 pathogenic E. coli, including EHEC strains O145:H28 and O157:H16 and enteropathogenic E. coli strain O55:H7. Our work markedly enriches the understanding of bacterial adherence control and provides another example of laterally acquired regulators that mediate LEE gene expression.© The Author(s) 2019.

Amongst the most remarkable of these are the so-called root endosymbioses, resulting from the intracellular  of host tissues by either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or nitrogen-fixing bacteria that both provide key nutrients to the host in exchange for energy-rich photosynthates. Actinorhizal host plants, members of the Eurosid 1 clade, are able to associate with both AM fungi and nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes known as Frankia. Currently, little is known about the molecular signaling that allows these plants to recognize their fungal and bacterial partners. In this article, we describe the use of an in vivo Ca2+ reporter to identify symbiotic signaling responses to AM fungi in roots of both Casuarina glauca and Discaria trinervis, actinorhizal species with contrasting modes of Frankia . This approach has revealed that, for both actinorhizal hosts, the short-chain chitin oligomer chitotetraose is able to mimic AM fungal exudates in activating the conserved symbiosis signaling pathway (CSSP) in epidermal root cells targeted by AM fungi. These results mirror findings in other AM host plants including legumes and the monocot rice. In addition, we show that chitotetraose is a more efficient elicitor of CSSP activation compared to AM fungal lipo-chitooligosaccharides. These findings reinforce the likely role of short-chain chitin oligomers during the initial stages of the AM association, and are discussed in relation to both our current knowledge about molecular signaling during Frankia recognition as well as the different microsymbiont root  mechanisms employed by actinorhizal hosts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630386>Concealed Penis after Circumcision: Is It Beneficial in Lowering Uropathogenic  in Penile Skin and Preventing Recurrence of Febrile Urinary Tract Infections?</a></h2><p>  To  discuss  whether  concealed  penis  after  circumcision  lowers  perimeatal  urethral  and  glanular  sulcus  uropathogenic  bacterial    in  healthy  boys  with  no  urinary  tract  problems  and  prevents  attacks  of  febrile  urinary  tract  infections  in  non-healthy  boys  with  defined  urinary  tract  abnormalities. Materials and Methods:  This  case-control  study  was  conducted  in  Ibn-i  Sina  Hospital  and  retrospectively  collected  data  of   471 boys  were  analyzed.  All  patients  were  scanned  for  any  urinary  tract  abnormality  and  those  with  any  defined  abnormalities  were  classified  as  non-healthy  group.

Combinatorial inactivation of these integrins on prostate cancer cells was assessed. Monospecific antibodies to α5β1 and αv integrins alone (MAbs) and in combination (cMAbs), and a bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets α5β1and αv integrins (BsAbα5β1/αv) were compared in assays of chemotaxis, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration. Cellular expression of integrins, their transcription, translation and degradation fate was compared. The BsAbα5β1/αv was superior to MAbs and cMAbs in abrogating adhesion, migration, clonogenic survival and induction of endothelial migration responses by prostate cancer cells. Integrin upregulation observed with MAbs or cMAbs was abrogated with the BsAbα5β1/αv. Loss of integrin expression was uniquely induced by the BsAbα5β1/αv and blocked by lysosomal inhibition.

The establishment of mycorrhizae is mainly based on the bidirectional nutrient exchanges between the symbiotic partners. Mycorrhizal fungi can absorb mineral nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from soil and transport them to the host plants for their growth. As an exchange, host plants supply mycorrhizal fungi with the carbohydrates in the form of lipids or sugars, which are essential for fungal growth. In recent years, the mechanism of nutrient exchange between the mycorrhizal fungi and host plants has been a hot research topic. Important progresses have been achieved in mechanisms of host plants nutrient uptake and transport mediated by the mycorrhizal fungi. In this review, recent advances in nutrient exchange between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, ectomycorrhizal fungi and host plants were summarized, especially in the absorption and bidirectional transfer mechanisms of important nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The potential regulatory effects of nutrient exchange in the mycorrhizal development were also reviewed. In addition, key problems and prospects of related researches were analyzed.

We treated C57BL/6NTac Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) mice with antibiotics and subsequently we inoculated these with GM from donor mice of the same strain by either the oral or the rectal inoculation method. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the colon microbiota showed no difference in microbial community on account of inoculation method as determined by unweighted UniFrac distance metrics in C57BL/6NTac SPF mice. In addition, qPCR analysis on colon tissue revealed no difference in mRNA expression between the inoculation methods. Next, the SPF mice were compared to germ-free (GF)-mice to identify differences in inoculation efficacy. Whether the mice were antibiotic treated SPF or GF clearly influenced GM determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing where the SPF mice experienced up-regulation of S24-7 (p = .0001) and a decrease in Rikenellaceae (p = .016) compared to GF mice. qPCR analysis on colon tissue revealed up-regulation in mRNA gene expression of Il6, Il10, Reg3g and transcription factor RORγt (Rorc) in GF mice compared to SPF mice on a significant level (p < .05). This gene expression profile is consistent with post  development of the intestinal barrier in GF mice.Copyright © 2018.

While the frequency of infection following elective orthopedic surgery is low, rates of reinfection are disturbingly high.  is responsible for the majority of chronic osteomyelitis cases and is often considered to be incurable due to bacterial persistence deep within bone. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on clinical classifications of osteomyelitis and the ensuing treatment algorithm. Given the high patient morbidity, mortality, and economic burden caused by osteomyelitis, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of bone infection to inform novel strategies for prevention and curative treatment. Recent discoveries in this field have identified three distinct reservoirs of bacterial biofilm including:  abscess communities in the local soft tissue and bone marrow, glycocalyx formation on implant hardware and necrotic tissue, and  of the osteocyte-lacuno canalicular network (OLCN) of cortical bone. In contrast,  intracellular persistence in bone cells has not been substantiated in vivo, which challenges this mode of chronic osteomyelitis. There have also been major advances in our understanding of the immune proteome against , from clinical studies of serum antibodies and media enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA), which may provide new opportunities for osteomyelitis diagnosis, prognosis, and vaccine development. Finally, novel therapies such as antimicrobial implant coatings and antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed scaffolds represent promising strategies for preventing and managing this devastating disease.

In the present study, we investigated the immune response to  infection in the IM and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in cyclophosphamide (Cy) immunosuppressed mice, to mimic an immunocompromised condition. Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic enteritis at 7 and 14 days-post-infection (dpi) in all infected groups, however, inflammation diminished at 21 and 28 dpi. Cy treatment also led to a higher number of  spores and lesions, which reduced at 28 dpi. In addition, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated CD4 and CD8 T cells to be predominant immune cells, with up-regulation in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines at 7 and 14 dpi, as demonstrated by histopathology.

Thus, the prevention and inhibition of Salmonella enteritidis infection are of great concern. Lactic acid bacteria have anti-pathogenic activity; however, their underlying mechanisms and modes of action have not yet been clarified. In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of Lactobacillus reuteri S5 (L. reuteri S5) against Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076 (S. enteritidis ATCC13076) was studied by different methods. We found that L. reuteri S5 was able to form a stable biofilm formation, colonizing the entire intestinal tract of chickens. In addition, bacterial cultures and the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of L. reuteri S5 inhibited SE ATCC13076 growth, and this growth inhibition was also observed in the co-culture assay. This effect may be predominantly caused by antimicrobial metabolites produced by L. reuteri S5. Furthermore, treatment with the CFS of L. reuteri S5 resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of Salmonella virulence, motility and adhesion genes and a significant reduction in the motility ability and inhibitory effect on biofilm formation. In addition, the damage to the membrane structure and intracellular structure induced by the CFS of L. reuteri S5 could be observed on Transmission electron microscopy images and dodecyl sulfate, sodium salt (SDS)-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the disruptive action of the CFS of L. reuteri S5 on the cytoplasmic membrane. Our findings demonstrate that L. reuteri S5, an intestinal Lactobacillus species associated with chicken health, is able to form biofilm and stably colonize chicken intestines. It also possesses anti-SE activity, preventing SE growth, inhibits the expression of SE genes involved in adhesion and invasion, virulence and cell membrane integrity, inhibits SE biofilm formation and motility, damages or destroys bacterial structures, and inhibits intracellular protein synthesis. L. reuteri S5 therefore has potential applications as a probiotic agent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This indicates that pine trees could be accessing a hidden nitrogen source to fulfill their nitrogen requirements-possibly via endophytic nitrogen-fixation. Endophytic bacteria originally isolated from native pine trees growing at gravel sites were selected (n = 14) for in vitro nitrogen-fixation assays and a yearlong greenhouse study to test the overall hypothesis that naturally-occurring endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria sustain pine tree growth under nitrogen-limited conditions. Each of the 14 bacteria colonized the internal tissues of pine trees in the greenhouse study and fixed significant amounts of nitrogen from atmosphere (23-53%) after one year as estimated through 15N isotope dilution assay. Bacterial inoculation also significantly enhanced the length (31-64%) and biomass (100-311%) of pine seedlings as compared to the non-inoculated control treatment. In addition, presence of the nifH gene was confirmed in all 14 bacteria. Our results support the possibility that pine trees associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, capable of endophytic , to survive at unreclaimed gravel mining pits and this association could potentially be utilized for effective reclamation of highly disturbed sites in a sustainable manner.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622031>Can Helicobacter pylori  affect the phosphate binder pill burden in dialysis patients?</a></h2><p>Phosphate binder pill (PBP) burden is a significant problem in dialysis patients.

In AD-like skin lesions in BALB/c mice model, these two polymers displayed significant potency in suppressing dermal and epidermal thickness, mast cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Moreover, these polymers exhibited remarkable efficacy over the allergies caused by the imbalance of Th1/Th2 by regulating total IgE and IgG2a. Finally, the impact of treatment effects of these polymers was examined through analyzing the weights and sizes of spleen and lymph node of AD-induced mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660968>Bacitracin resistance and enhanced virulence of Streptococcus suis via a novel efflux pump.</a></h2><p>Streptococcus suis is a prominent pathogen causing septicemia and meningitis in swine and humans. Bacitracin is used widely as a growth promoter in animal feed and to control the spread of necrotic enteritis in most developing countries. This study aimed to characterize a novel membrane transporter module Sst comprising SstE, SstF, and SstG for bacitracin resistance.Comparative genomics and protein homology analysis found a potential efflux pump SstFEG encoded upstream of well-known bacitracin-resistance genes bceAB and bceRS. A four-fold decrease in bacitracin susceptibility was observed in sstFEG deletion mutant comparing with S. suis wildtype strain CZ130302. Further studies indicated that the bacitracin tolerance mediated by SstFEG is not only independent of the BceAB transporter, but also regulated by the two-component system BceSR. Given that SstFEG are harbored by almost all virulent strains, but not in the avirulent strains, we managed to explore its potential role in bacterial pathogencity. Indeed, our results showed that SstFEG is involved in S. suis  and virulence in animal infection model by its potential competitive survival advantage against host bactericidal effect.To our knowledge, this is the first study to functionally characterize the bacitracin efflux pump in S. suis to provide evidence regarding the important roles of the novel ABC transporter system SstFEG with respect to drug resistance and virulence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616626>4T1 Mammary Carcinoma  of Metastatic Niches Is Accelerated by Obesity.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, and the chances to develop it are duplicated by obesity. Still, the impact of obesity during BC progression remains less understood. We investigated the role of obesity in tumor progression using the murine model of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in BALB/c female mice, previously high-fat-diet (HFD) fed. HFD induced obesity, metabolic impairment, and high serum and fat leptin levels. After injection of 4T1-cells, HFD-mice accelerated tumor progression and metastasis. 4T1-cells found within HFD-mice metastatic niches presented higher clonogenic potential. 4T1-cells treated  with fat-conditioned medium derived from HFD-mice, increased migration capacity through CXCL12 and CCL25 gradients. In HFD-mice, the infiltration and activation of immune cells into tumor-sentinel lymph nodes was overall reduced, except for activated CD4 T cells expressing low CD25 levels. Within the bone marrow, the levels of haematopoiesis-related IL-6 and TNF-α decreased after 4T1-cells injection in HFD-mice whereas increased in the controls, suggesting that upregulation of both cytokines, regardless of the tumor, is disrupted by obesity. Finally, the expression of genes for leptin, CXCR4, and CCR9 (receptors of CXCL12 and CCL25, respectively) was negatively correlated with the infiltration of CD8 T cells in human triple-negative BC tumors from obese patients compared to non-obese. Together, our data present early evidence of systemic networks triggered by obesity that promote BC progression to the metastatic niches. Targeting these pathways might be useful to prevent the rapid BC progression observed among obese patients.Copyright © 2019 Evangelista, Salvador, Soares, Barros, Xavier, Abdo, Gualberto, Macedo, Clavijo-Salomon and Gameiro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618810>Influence of Laminin Coating on the Autologous In Vivo Recellularization of Decellularized Vascular Protheses.</a></h2><p>Decellularization of non-autologous biological implants reduces the immune response against foreign tissue. Striving for in vivo repopulation of aortic prostheses with autologous cells, thereby improving the graft biocompatibility, we examined surface coating with laminin in a standardized rat implantation model. Detergent-decellularized aortic grafts from donor rats (n = 37) were coated with laminin and systemically implanted into Wistar rats. Uncoated implants served as controls. Implant re- and remodeling were examined by scanning electron microscopy (n = 10), histology and immunohistology (n = 18). Laminin coating persisted over eight weeks. Two weeks after implantation, no relevant neoendothelium formation was observed, whereas it was covering the whole grafts after eight weeks, with a significant acceleration in the laminin group (p = 0.0048). Remarkably, the intima-to-media ratio, indicating adverse hyperplasia, was significantly diminished in the laminin group (p = 0.0149). No intergroup difference was detected in terms of medial recellularization (p = 0.2577). Alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells originating from the adventitial surface invaded the media in both groups to a similar extent. The amount of calcifying hydroxyapatite deposition in the intima and the media did not differ between the groups. Inflammatory cell markers (CD3 and CD68) proved negative in coated as well as uncoated decellularized implants. The coating of decellularized aortic implants with bioactive laminin caused an acceleration of the autologous recellularization and a reduction of the intima hyperplasia. Thereby, laminin coating seems to be a promising strategy to enhance the biocompatibility of tissue-engineered vascular implants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630178>Persistent  of non-lymphoid tissue-resident macrophages by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence has revealed that lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria (e.g., Alcaligenes spp.) survive within dendritic cells. We extended our previous study by investigating microbes that persistently colonize colonic macrophages. 16S rRNA-based metagenome analysis using DNA purified from murine colonic macrophages revealed the presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The in situ intracellular  by S. maltophilia was recapitulated in vitro by using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Co-culture of BMDMs with clinically isolated S. maltophilia led to increased mitochondrial respiration and robust IL-10 production. We further identified a 25-kDa protein encoded by the gene assigned as smlt2713 (recently renamed as SMLT_RS12935) and secreted by S. maltophilia as the factor responsible for enhanced IL-10 production by BMDMs. IL-10 production is critical for maintenance of the symbiotic condition, because intracellular  by S. maltophilia was impaired in IL-10-deficient BMDMs, and smlt2713-deficient S. maltophilia failed to persistently colonize IL-10-competent BMDMs. These findings indicate a novel commensal network between colonic macrophages and S. maltophilia that is mediated by IL-10 and smlt2713.© The Author(s) 2019.

In particular, children with life-limiting conditions have a significantly increased risk of multidrug resistant pathogen . Official hygiene requirements recommend children, who are colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, to be isolated. In the context of pediatric palliative care, such isolation adversely affects the aim of social participation. To overcome this challenge of conflicting interests on a pediatric palliative care inpatient unit, a hygiene concept for patients colonized with multidrug resistant pathogens, called PALLINI, was implemented.The aim of this study was to identify the nurses' attitudes and opinions toward PALLINI.Nurses ( = 14) from the pediatric palliative care unit were queried in guideline-oriented interviews. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively by means of content analysis.The following four categories were identified: (1) safety, (2) effort, (3) quality of care, and (4) participation. All categories demonstrated ambivalence by nursing staff regarding PALLINI. Ambivalence arose from guaranteeing infection control versus noncompliance by the families, additional workload for patients with multidrug resistant pathogens versus lack of resources, impaired relationship with the parents versus enabling better care for the child, as well as enabling some limited contact versus the larger goal of genuine social participation. Despite this, nurses reported the importance of arranging everyday-life for the patients so that they experience as much social participation as possible.The implementation of a new hygiene concept is challenging. Despite positive reception of PALLINI from the nurses, ambivalence remained. Addressing these ambivalences may be critical to best implement the new hygiene concept.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632380>Pneumococcal VncR Strain-Specifically Regulates Capsule Polysaccharide Synthesis.</a></h2><p>Capsular polysaccharides (CPS), a major virulence factor in , become thicker during blood invasion while not during asymptomatic nasopharyngeal . However, the underlying mechanism controlling this differential pneumococcal CPS regulation remain unclear. Here, we show how VncR, the response regulator of the vancomycin resistance locus ( operon), regulates CPS expression in  mutants in three serotype (type 2, 3, and 6B) backgrounds upon exposure to serum lactoferrin (LF). Comparative analysis of CPS levels in the wild type (WT) of three strains and their isogenic  mutants after LF exposure revealed a strain-specific alteration in CPS production. Consistently, VncR-mediated strain-specific CPS production is correlated with pneumococcal virulence, . Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between VncR and the  promoter () in the presence of serum. In addition,  analysis uncovered this protein-DNA interaction, suggesting that VncR binds with the , and recognizes the strain-specific significance of the tandem repeats in . Taken together, the interaction of VncR and  after serum exposure plays an essential role in regulating differential strain-specific CPS production, which subsequently determines strain-specific systemic virulence. This study highlights how host protein LF contributes to pneumococcal VncR-mediated CPS production. As CPS plays a significant role in immune evasion, these findings suggest that drugs designed to interrupt the VncR-mediated CPS production could help to combat pneumococcal infections.Copyright © 2019 Ghosh, Shah, Ravichandran, Park, Iqbal, Choi, Kim and Rhee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600332>Vancomycin-resistance gene cluster, vanC, in the gut microbiome of acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy.</a></h2><p>Two recent reports suggested that the less common, less virulent enterococcal species, Enterococcus gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, with low-level vancomycin resistance due to chromosomally encoded vanC1 and vanC2/3, may influence host immunity. We reported that peri-transplant gut  with E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus is associated with lower mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Because most acute leukemia patients undergoing HCT have received intensive chemotherapy (usually requiring prolonged hospitalization) for their underlying disease before HCT, we hypothesized that some may have acquired vanC-positive enterococci during chemotherapy. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of the vanC gene cluster using vanC1 and vanC2/3 qPCR in thrice-weekly collected stool samples from 20 acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. We found that an unexpectedly large proportion of patients have detectable vanC1 and vanC2/3 (15% and 35%, respectively) in at least one stool sample. Comparing qPCR results with 16S rRNA gene sequencing results suggested that E. gallinarum may reach high abundances, potentially persisting into HCT and influencing transplant outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603613>A bacterium against the tiger: preliminary evidence of fertility reduction after release of Aedes albopictus males with manipulated Wolbachia infection in an Italian urban area.</a></h2><p>Novel tools are needed to reduce nuisance and risk of exotic arbovirus transmission associated with the  of temperate regions by Aedes albopictus. Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) is a population suppression approach based on cytoplasmic incompatibility between males with manipulated endosymbionts and wild females. Here we present the results of the first field experiment in Europe to assess the capacity of an Ae. albopictus line (ARwP) deprived of its natural endosymbiont Wolbachia and transinfected with a Wolbachia strain from the mosquito Culex pipiens - to sterilize wild females.We released ~4500 ARwP males weekly for 6 weeks in a green area within urban Rome (Italy) and carried out egg (N = 13 442), female (N = 128) and male (N = 352) collections. Egg (N = 13 783) and female (N = 48) collections were also carried out in two untreated Control Sites. The percentage of viable eggs during releases was on average significantly lower in Treated than in Control Sites, with the highest difference (16%) after the fourth release. The ARwP/wild male ratio in the release spots between day-3 from the first ARwP male release and day-7 after the last release was on average 7:10. Released males survived up to two weeks. About 30% of the females collected in the release spots showed 100% sterility and 20% a strongly reduced fertility compared to Control Sites.Results support the potential of IIT as a tool to contribute to Ae. albopictus control in the urban context and stress the need of larger field trials to evaluate the cost-efficacy of the approach in suppressing wild populations.

A shortage of a resource essential for reproduction of one sex can affect OSR and lead to competition within the opposite sex for resource-holding mates. In the sand goby (), a fish with paternal care, male readiness to mate depends on acquiring a nest-site, whereas food abundance primarily impacts female egg production. Comparing body condition and gonadal investment of fish from two populations with different availability in resources (Baltic Sea: few nest-sites, more food; North Sea: many nest-sites, less food), we predicted females carrying more mature eggs in the Baltic Sea than in the North Sea. As predicted, ovaries were larger in Baltic Sea females, and so was the liver (storage of energy reserves and vitellogenic compounds) for both sexes, but particularly for females. More females were judged (based on roundness scores) to be ready to spawn in the Baltic Sea. Together with a nest  experiment confirming a previously documented difference between the two areas in nest-site availability, these results indicate a more female-biased OSR in the Baltic Sea population, compared to the North Sea, and generates a prediction that female-female competition for mating opportunities is stronger in the Baltic population. To our knowledge, this is the first time that female reproductive investment is discussed in relation to OSR using field data.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633059>Endophyte  evade plant defense by producing lantibiotic subtilomycin to mask self-produced flagellin.</a></h2><p>Microbes can enter into healthy plants as endophytes and confer beneficial functions.

Whether this phenomenon exists in cattle is largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate the impact of maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-pregnancy in dairy cows on fecal microbiota and metabolome in neonatal calves, and their association with body development and growth performance during the preweaning period. To achieve this, heifer calves, i.e., neonatal female offspring, born to Holstein cows receiving either a control (CON) diet ( = 13) or CON plus rumen-protected methionine (MET; Evonik Nutrition & Care GmbH) during the last 28 days of pregnancy were used. Fecal samples from heifers were collected from birth until 6 weeks of age, i.e., the preweaning period. Fecal microbiota was analyzed with QIIME 2 whereas fecal metabolites were measured using an untargeted LC-MS approach. At birth, MET heifers had greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH, and WH. During the preweaning period, no differences between groups were detected for starter intake ( = 0.77). However, MET heifers maintained greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW, HH and tended ( = 0.06) to have greater WH and average daily gain (ADG) ( = 0.10). Fecal microbiota and metabolome profiles through 42 days of age in MET heifers indicated greater capacity for hindgut production of endogenous antibiotics and enhanced hindgut functionality and health. Enhancing maternal post-ruminal supply of methionine during late-gestation in dairy cows has a positive effect on hindgut functionality and health in their offspring through alterations in the fecal microbiota and metabolome without affecting feed intake. Those alterations could limit pathogen  of the hindgut while providing essential nutrients to the neonate. Together, such responses contribute to the ability of young calves to achieve better rates of nutrient utilization for growth.Copyright © 2019 Elolimy, Alharthi, Zeineldin, Parys, Helmbrecht and Loor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603617>Arctic shrub  lagged peak postglacial warmth: Molecular evidence in lake sediment from Arctic Canada.</a></h2><p>Arctic shrubification is an observable consequence of climate change, already resulting in ecological shifts and global-scale climate feedbacks including changes in land surface albedo and enhanced evapotranspiration. However, the rate at which shrubs can colonize previously glaciated terrain in a warming world is largely unknown. Reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics in conjunction with climate records can provide critical insights into shrubification rates and controls on plant migration, but paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on pollen may be biased by the influx of exotic pollen to tundra settings. Here, we reconstruct past plant communities using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), which has a more local source area than pollen. We additionally reconstruct past temperature variability using bacterial cell membrane lipids (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and an aquatic productivity indicator (biogenic silica) to evaluate the relative timing of postglacial ecological and climate changes at a lake on southern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. The sedaDNA record tightly constrains the  of dwarf birch (Betula, a thermophilous shrub) to 5.9 ± 0.1 ka, ~3 ka after local deglaciation as determined by cosmogenic  Be moraine dating and >2 ka later than Betula pollen is recorded in nearby lake sediment. We then assess the paleovegetation history within the context of summer temperature and find that paleotemperatures were highest prior to 6.3 ka, followed by cooling in the centuries preceding Betula establishment. Together, these molecular proxies reveal that Betula  lagged peak summer temperatures, suggesting that inefficient dispersal, rather than climate, may have limited Arctic shrub migration in this region. In addition, these data suggest that pollen-based climate reconstructions from high latitudes, which rely heavily on the presence and abundance of pollen from thermophilous taxa like Betula, can be compromised by both exotic pollen fluxes and vegetation migration lags.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607511>Segmented Filamentous Bacteria Prevent and Cure Rotavirus Infection.</a></h2><p>Rotavirus (RV) encounters intestinal epithelial cells amidst diverse microbiota, opening possibilities of microbes influencing RV infection.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the microbiome. The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of  of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal  model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

Recent studies indicate that lipid transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal ; however, the role of lipid transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of lipid accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4.5 vs. pH 6.5), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity, and lipid accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport, lipid biosynthesis and transfer, and sugar metabolism; and visualized the lipid dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding lipid biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced lipid transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation. This article is protected by copyright.

Higher adherence was associated with glove use before patient care (odds ratio [OR], 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-4.54) and after patient care (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.77-5.48). Compared with nurses, certified nurse assistants had lower hand hygiene adherence (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.67) before patient care and physical/occupational therapists (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.44) after patient care. Hand hygiene varied by activity performed and time in the room. HCP hands were contaminated with AROs in 35 of 385 cultures of hands before patient care (0.9%) and 22 of 350 cultures of hands after patient care (6.3%).Hand hygiene adherence in NFs remain low; it is influenced by job title, type of care activity, and glove use. Hand hygiene programs should incorporate these unique care and staffing factors to reduce ARO transmission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605701>Thoracic Injury in Patients Injured by Explosions on the Battlefield and in Terrorist Incidents.</a></h2><p>Thoracic injury is common on the battlefield and in terrorist attacks, occurring in 10% to 70% of patients depending on the type of weapons used. Typical injuries seen include bullet, blast, and fragment injuries to the thorax, which are often associated with injuries to other parts of the body. Initial treatment prehospital and in the ED is carried out according to the principles of Tactical Combat Casualty Care or other standard trauma management systems. Immediately life-threatening problems including catastrophic hemorrhage are dealt with rapidly, and early consideration is given to CT scanning or rapid surgical intervention where appropriate. All patients should be given lung-protective ventilation. Treatment of these patients in the critical care unit is complicated by the severity of associated injuries and by features specific to combat trauma including blast lung injury, a high incidence of delirium, unusual infections such as  with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex, and sometimes invasive fungal infections. A minority of patients with blast lung injury in published series have been successfully treated with prolonged respiratory support with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The role of newer treatment options such as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta is not yet known. In this article we review the relatively sparse literature on this group of patients and provide practical advice based on the literature and our institution's extensive experience of managing battlefield casualties.Copyright © 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

The purpose of this study was firstly to determine the prevalence of pneumococcus carriage in a population of febrile infants in Marrakesh and secondly, to investigate the risk factors for carriage and the distribution of circulating serotypes.This prospective study was conducted from February to June 2017, in the pediatric emergency department of the Mother and Child Hospital of Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre (UHC) in Marrakesh. At total of 183febrile infants, aged 2-18months, were enrolled in this study and were swabbed for nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified, serotyped, and tested for penicillin susceptibility. Demographic data and risk factors for carriage were collected. The statistical analyses performed were the following: the analysis of the risk factors using logistic regression, the estimation of serotype diversity with the Simpson index, and the Chi test to compare serotype distribution in the prevaccination (a cohort of 660 healthy children, less than 2years old, in the Marrakesh region, in 2008-2009) and postvaccination periods.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was 68.3%. Of the 183infants enrolled in this study, 111 had received at least one dose of PCV-10.  by vaccine serotype among febrile children was related to incomplete vaccination status. In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=2), 1 (n=2) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.2% and 23.2%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (5.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.2%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.2% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged. These results underscore the importance of maintaining close and prolonged surveillance of serotype distribution to monitor the dynamics of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage.Copyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory abilities and effects of  RS-25,  MG-4,  Z-14, and  Pnf-4 and their culture filtrates and extracts against the gray mold caused by  on postharvest tomato, strawberry, and grapefruit. The results revealed that the cells of Z-14, culture filtrate of RS-25, and cells of Z-14 showed the strongest biocontrol activity against the gray mold on the strawberry, grape, and tomato fruit, respectively. All the strains produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the VOCs of Pnf-4 displayed the highest inhibition values. Based on headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, esters accounted for the largest percentage of the VOCs produced by RS-25, MG-4, Z-14, and Pnf-4 (36.80%, 29.58%, 30.78%, and 36.26%, respectively). All the strains showed potent cellulase and protease activities, but no chitinase activity. RS-25, Z-14, and MG-4, but not Pnf-4, grew on chrome azurol S agar, and an orange halo was formed around the colonies. All the strains showed biofilm formation, fruit , and lipopeptide production, which may be the main modes of action of the antagonists against  on the fruit.

Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal microbiome, there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal microbiome and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida . In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida . 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida . In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The microbiome, race and Candida  co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida  more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and 2 from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC  in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals. Given the rise of NDM-EC in community and hospital infections, combating NDM-EC transmission in backyard farm systems is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5251.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613567>Acne Vulgaris: Diagnosis and Treatment.</a></h2><p>Acne vulgaris is the most prevalent chronic skin disease in the United States, affecting nearly 50 million people per year, mostly adolescents and young adults. Potential sequelae of acne, such as scarring, dyspigmentation, and low self-esteem, may result in significant morbidity. Typical acne lesions involve the pilosebaceous follicles and the interrelated processes of sebum production, Cutibacterium acnes (previously called Propionibacterium acnes) , and inflammation. Acne may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and type of skin lesions. Multiple treatment agents and formulations are available, with each agent targeting a specific area within acne pathogenesis. Treatment selection is based on disease severity, patient preference, and tolerability. Topical retinoids are indicated for acne of any severity and for maintenance therapy. Systemic and topical antibiotics should be used only in combination with benzoyl peroxide and retinoids and for a maximum of 12 weeks. Isotretinoin is used for severe, recalcitrant acne. Because of the risk of teratogenicity, patients, pharmacists, and prescribers must register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated risk management program, iPledge, before implementing isotretinoin therapy.

For many years, the lung was considered a sterile environment, and only recently, with the use of more sophisticated techniques, has it been demonstrated that  by a complex population of microorganisms in lower airways also occurs in healthy subjects; a predominance of some species of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla and with a peculiar composition in some disease conditions, such as asthma, have been noted. Lung microbiota derives mainly from the higher airways microbiota. Although we have some information about the role of gut microbiota in modulation of immune system, less it is known about the connection between lung microbiota and local and systemic immunity. There is a correlation between altered microbiota composition and some diseases or chronic states; however, despite this correlation, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether the lung microbiota dysbiosis could be a consequence or a cause of these diseases. We are far from a scientific approach to the therapeutic use of probiotics in airway diseases, but we are only at the starting point of a knowledge process in this fascinating field that could reveal important surprises, and randomized prospective studies in future could reveal more about the clinical possibilities for controlling lung microbiota.

Among various factors, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway has been documented being able to target genes associated with tumor progression and up-regulate the expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and survival genes in several human solid tumors. Feline injection sites sarcomas (FISS) are malignant entities derived from the mesenchymal origin. The disease has been considered to be associated with vaccine adjuvant, aluminum, which serves as a stimulus continuously inducing overzealous inflammatory and immunologic reactions. To understand the contribution of NF-κB in FISS, detection of activated NF-κB in paraffin-embedded specimens, in vitro establishment of primary cells derived from FISS, and evaluation of the effects of the NF-κB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on primary tumor cells were conducted.In this study, nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 was detected in 83.3% of FISS cases and not correlated with tumor grading, sex, and age. Primary cells derived from FISS in three cats exhibiting same immunohistochemical characteristics as their original tumor were successfully established. The NF-κB inhibitor, DHMEQ, was able to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and  in dosage-dependent manners, and induce cell apoptosis in these primary FISS cells.High expression rate of nuclear NF-κB p65 in FISS cases and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the growth of FISS primary cells treated with NF-κB inhibitor suggested that NF-κB might be a potential molecular therapeutic target for FISS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619301>Sequential use of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Cutaneous antisepsis with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine, usually with alcohol, has been extensively studied.

In this study, we showed that RcsB and OmpR have the ability to function differently in modulating a diverse array of physiological processes in Y. enterocolitica. The rcsB mutant stimulated flagella biosynthesis and increased motility, biofilm formation and c-di-GMP production by upregulating flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT. However, mutation in ompR exhibited a non-motile phenotype due to the lack of flagella. Biofilm formation was reduced and less c-di-GMP was produced through the downregulation of flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT expression when Y. enterocolitica was exposed to low osmolarity conditions. Furthermore, OmpR was identified to be important for Y. enterocolitica to grow in extreme temperature conditions. Importantly, ompR mutation in Y. enterocolitica were more sensitive to polymyxin B and SDS than rcsB mutation were. Since motility, biofilm formation and environmental tolerance are critical for bacterial  of the host, these findings indicated that OmpR is more critical than RcsB in shaping the pathogenic phenotype of Y. enterocolitica.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640923>Sub-Inhibitory concentrations of SOS-Response inducing antibiotics stimulate integrase expression and excision of pathogenicity islands in uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536.</a></h2><p>Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections and a major public health problem. The predominant causative agents are uropathogenic Escherichia coli. These strains differ from commensal E. coli by the presence of additional horizontally acquired chromosomal material, so-called pathogenicity islands, which encode traits that promote efficient bacterial  of the urinary tract. Uropathogenic model strain E. coli 536 possesses six archetypal pathogenicity islands. Bacteriophage-like integrases encoded by each pathogenicity island contribute to island instability. To learn more about the stability of these six islands and factors controlling their stability we constructed two chromosomal reporter systems for the measurement of island loss, as well as for the measurement of the promoter activity of the six island-associated integrase genes at the population level. We used these reporter gene modules to analyze the role of SOS response in island instability. Tests with subinhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics, including many drugs commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infection, indicated that only SOS response-inducing antibiotics led to an increased loss of islands which was always associated with an increase in the bacterial subpopulations showing high integrase promoter activity. This suggests that island excision correlates with the expression of the cognate integrase. Our reporter modules are valuable tools to investigate the impact of various growth conditions on genome plasticity. Furthermore, a better understanding of the conditions, which affect bacterial integrase expression may open ways to specifically manipulate the genome content of bacterial pathogens by increasing pathogenicity island deletion rates in infecting or colonizing bacteria, thus leading to the attenuation of bacterial pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

As a motile bacterium approaches and adheres to a surface from the bulk fluid, the mechanical forces that act on it change. Bacteria are able to sense these changes in the mechanical load through a process termed mechanosensing. Bacterial mechanosensing has featured prominently in recent literature as playing a key role in surface sensing. However, the changes in mechanical loads on different parts of the cell at a surface vary in magnitudes as well as in signs. This confounds the determination of a causal relationship between the activation of specific mechanosensors and surface sensing. Here, we explain how contrasting mechanical stimuli arise on a surface-adherent cell and how known mechanosensors respond to these stimuli. The evidence for mechanosensing in select bacterial species is re-interpreted, with a focus on mechanosensitive molecular motors. We conclude with proposed criteria that bacterial mechanosensors must satisfy to successfully mediate surface sensing.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

This early stage soil is then colonized by microbes and vegetation in a process of primary succession. It is rarely experimentally examined whether this  process is linear or not at the ecosystem scale. Thus, to improve our understanding of the variables involved in the carbon accumulation in the different stages of primary succession, we conducted this research in three transects on the Matsch glacier forefield (Alps, N Italy) at an altitude between 2,350 and 2,800 m a.s.l.In three field campaigns (July, August and September 2014) a closed transparent chamber was used to quantify the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between the natural vegetation and the atmosphere. On the five plots established in each of the three transects, shading nets were used to determine ecosystem response function to variable light conditions. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was partitioned from NEE. Following the final flux measurements, biometric sampling was conducted to establish soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content and the biomass components for each transect.A clear difference was found between the earlier and the later successional stage. The older successional stages in the lower altitudes acted as a stronger C sink, where NEE, GEE and Reco were significantly higher than in the earlier successional stage. Of the two lower transects, the sink capacity of intermediate-succession plots exceeded that of the plots of older formation, in spite of the more developed soil. Total biomass (above- and belowground) approached its maximum value in the intermediate ecosystem, whilst the later stage of succession predominated in the corresponding belowground organic mass (biomass, N and C).We found that the process of carbon accumulation along a glacier retreat chronosequence is not linear, and after a quite rapid increase in carbon accumulation capacity in the first 150 years, in average 9 g C m year, it slows down, taking place mainly in the belowground biomass components. Concurrently, the photosynthetic capacity peaks in the intermediate stage of ecosystem development. If confirmed by further studies on a larger scale, this study would provide evidence for a predominant effect of plant physiology over soil physical characteristics in the green-up phase after glacier retreat, which has to be taken into account in the creation of scenarios related to climate change and future land use.© 2019 Montagnani et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615004>Crystal Structure-Based Exploration of Arginine-Containing Peptide Binding in the ADP-Ribosyltransferase Domain of the Type III Effector XopAI Protein.</a></h2><p>Plant pathogens secrete proteins called effectors into the cells of their host to modulate the host immune response against . Effectors can either modify or arrest host target proteins to sabotage the signaling pathway, and therefore are considered potential drug targets for crop disease control. In earlier research, the  type III effector XopAI was predicted to be a member of the arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family. However, the crystal structure of XopAI revealed an altered active site that is unsuitable to bind the cofactor NAD+, but with the capability to capture an arginine-containing peptide from XopAI itself. The arginine peptide consists of residues 60 through 69 of XopAI, and residue 62 (R62) is key to determining the protein-peptide interaction. The crystal structure and the molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that specific arginine recognition is mediated by hydrogen bonds provided by the backbone oxygen atoms from residues W154, T155, and T156, and a salt bridge provided by the E265 sidechain. In addition, a protruding loop of XopAI adopts dynamic conformations in response to arginine peptide binding and is probably involved in target protein recognition. These data suggest that XopAI binds to its target protein by the peptide-binding ability, and therefore, it promotes disease progression. Our findings reveal an unexpected and intriguing function of XopAI and pave the way for further investigation on the role of XopAI in pathogen invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633202>Population history of southern Italy during Greek  inferred from dental remains.</a></h2><p>We are testing competing scenarios regarding the population history of the ancient Greek  of southern Italy using dental phenotypic evidence.We collected dental metric and nonmetric trait data for 481 human skeletons from six archaeological sites along the Gulf of Taranto, dating to pre-colonial (900-700 BC) and post-colonial periods (700-200 BC). We are evaluating scenarios through an individual-level biodistance analysis using a three-pronged approach: (a) by analyzing levels of mobility in pre- and post-colonial periods under a model of isolation-by-distance; (b) by quantifying differences in group means and variances in pre- and post-colonial periods utilizing permutational multivariate analysis of variance and Betadisper analyses; and (c) by identifying ancestries of post-colonial individuals using naïve Bayes classification.Southern Italy during pre-colonial times was characterized by low levels of mobility and marked differences in group means and variances. During post-colonial times, mobility increased and there were no differences in group means and variances. About 18% of the people in post-colonial times were of Greek ancestry and lived equally distributed across Greek colonies and indigenous villages. Nevertheless, the overall biological composition and variability of southern Italy remained relatively unchanged across pre- and post-colonial periods.Our results support a scenario in which only few Greek colonists migrated to southern Italy and lived in smaller numbers alongside indigenous people in Greek colonies as well as in indigenous villages. Our results contradict a scenario in which large numbers of Greek invaders founded biologically isolated and substantially homogeneous colonial enclaves within conquered territories.© 2019 The Authors.

Whole-genome sequencing and construction of an isogenic mutant of  and  1330 revealed that the R-phenotype was due to a deletion in a single gene, namely  (BMI_I539), encoding a putative glycosyltransferase involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-polysaccharide biosynthesis. Complementation of the R-strains with the  gene restored the smooth phenotype and the ability of  to kill infected mice. LPS with an intact O-polysaccharide is therefore essential for lethal  infections in the murine model, demonstrating its importance in pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614508>A Multiplex Analysis of Potentially Toxic Cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg during the 2013 Bloom Season.</a></h2><p>Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), the world's 12th largest lake by area, is host to yearly cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by  and . cHABs in Lake Winnipeg are primarily a result of eutrophication but may be exacerbated by the recent introduction of dreissenid mussels.

Surface water samples were collected in 2013 from 23 sites during summer and from 18 sites in fall. Genetic data and mass spectrometry cyanotoxin profiles identified microcystins (MC) as the most abundant cyanotoxin across all stations, with MC concentrations highest in the north basin. In the fall,  genes were sequenced to determine which species had the potential to produce MCs, and 12 of the 18 sites were a mix of both  and . Current blooms in Lake Winnipeg produce low levels of MCs, but the capacity to produce cyanotoxins is widespread across both basins.

Bacterial twitching is important for initial bacterial  and biofilm formation. The existing research about bacteria twitching is largely experimental orientated. There is a lack of models of twitching motility of bacteria in shear flows, which could provide fundamental understanding about how bacterial twitching would be affected by bacteria associated properties such as number of pili and their distribution on the cell body and environmental factors such as flow and surface patterns. In this work, a three-dimensional modelling approach of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) proposed to study bacterial twitching on flat and groove surfaces under shear flow conditions. Rod-shaped bacteria are modelled as groups of spherical particles and Type IV pili attached to bacteria are modelled as dynamic springs which can elongate, retract, attach and detach. The CFD-DEM model of rod-shape bacteria is validated against orbiting of immotile bacteria in shear flows. The effects of fluid flow rate and surface topography on twitching motility are studied. The model can successfully predict upstream twitching motility of rod-shaped bacteria in shear flows. Our model can predict that there would be an optimal range of wall shear stress in which bacterial upstream twitching is most efficient. The results also indicate that when bacteria twitch on groove surfaces, they are likely to accumulate around the downstream side of the groove walls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601676>Modulation of the fungal mycobiome is regulated by the chitin-binding receptor FIBCD1.</a></h2><p>Host-microbiota interactions are critical in regulating mammalian health and disease. In addition to bacteria, parasites, and viruses, beneficial communities of fungi (the mycobiome) are important modulators of immune- and tissue-homeostasis. Chitin is a major component of the fungal cell wall, and fibrinogen C containing domain 1 (FIBCD1) is a chitin-binding protein; however, the role of this molecule in influencing host-mycobiome interactions in vivo has never been examined. Here, we identify direct binding of FIBCD1 to intestinal-derived fungi and demonstrate that epithelial-specific expression of FIBCD1 results in significantly reduced fungal  and amelioration of fungal-driven intestinal inflammation. Collectively, these results identify FIBCD1 as a previously unrecognized microbial pattern recognition receptor through which intestinal epithelial cells can recognize and control fungal , limit fungal dysbiosis, and dampen intestinal inflammation.© 2019 Moeller et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601845>In vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Acne Drugs Against Skin-Associated Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Acne is a common skin affliction that involves excess sebum production and modified lipid composition, duct blockage,  by bacteria, and inflammation. Acne drugs target one or more of these steps, with antibiotics commonly used to treat the microbial infection for moderate to severe cases. Whilst a number of other acne therapies are purported to possess antimicrobial activity, this has been poorly documented in many cases. We conducted a comparative analysis of the activity of common topical acne drugs against the principal etiological agent associated with acne: the aerotolerant anaerobic Gram-positive organism Propionibacterium acnes (recently renamed as Cutibacterium acnes). We also assessed their impact on other bacteria that could also be affected by topical treatments, including both antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant strains, using broth microdilution assay conditions. Drugs designated specifically as antibiotics had the greatest potency, but lost activity against resistant strains. The non-antibiotic acne agents did possess widespread antimicrobial activity, including against resistant strains, but at substantially higher concentrations. Hence, the antimicrobial activity of non-antibiotic acne agents may provide protection against a background of increased drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613070>PREVALENCE OF POTENTIALLY PATHOGENIC MICROBIOLOGICAL AGENTS IN VAGINAL EXUDATES OF ASYMPTOMATIC PREGNANT WOMEN, BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA, 2014-2015.</a></h2><p>To determine the prevalence of potentially pathogenic microbiological agents in vaginal exudates in a sample of asymptomatic pregnant women in the Department of Atlantico, Colombia.Descriptive cross-sectional study of a sample of asymptomatic pregnant women who attended a private primary healthcare institution in Barranquilla, Colombia, between 2014 and 2015.

Following an integrative approach, we combined genetic data analysis with Environmental Niche Models (ENMs) to assess a possible post-glacial range expansion of Mojave yucca, (Yucca schidigera), a long-lived desert perennial native to the BC peninsula.We used seven nuclear microsatellite markers to investigate population genetic diversity and differentiation in 240 individuals sampled from 13 populations in the Baja California Peninsula. We used Environmental Niche Models to investigate the changes on the distribution of suitable climatic conditions for this species during the LIG (~120 ka), LGM (~21.5 ka) and Mid Holocene (~6 ka).We detected high genetic diversity across Y. schidigera populations (A = 9.94 ± 0.38 SE; H = 0.791 ± 0.011 SE) with genetic variation decreasing significantly with latitude (allelic richness: R =0.38, P =0.023; expected heterocigosity: R =0.32, P =0.042). We observed low, but significant genetic differentiation (F =0.0678; P < 0.001) which was consistent with the three genetic groupings detected by the Bayesian clustering algorithm (Structure). Geographic distance was significantly correlated with genetic differentiation among populations (r =0.38; P=0.004; partial Mantel test). The ENMs suggest that suitable habitat for this species increased during the LGM.Our results support a range expansion of Y. schidigera across northwestern Baja California during the late Quaternary. Genetic data suggest that  of the current distribution followed a southward directionality as suitable climatic conditions became widely available in northern Baja California.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the microbiome, in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and colon contents (feces, distal colon, and tumor) were collected. Colon tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures. Colon tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the colon microbiome.We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by colon cancer cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin . The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs.

What has hardly been considered so far is that this concept is also relevant for future astrobiological research, since in artificial extraterrestrial habitats ( plants and insects in martian greenhouses) novel environmental conditions will also affect the survival and performance of organisms. The question therefore arises whether and how space-relevant organisms can be artificially adapted to the desired circumstances in advance. Based on several adaptation and acclimatization strategies in wild ecosystems of Earth, I discuss which methods can be considered for assisted evolution in the context of astrobiological research. This includes enhanced selective breeding, induction of epigenetic inheritance, and genetic engineering, as well as possible problems of these applications.

The intestinal microbiota has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or  by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal microbiota leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal microbiota of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host microbiota during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established  by resistant microorganisms. Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal microbiota in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human microbiota from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625844>Nasopharyngeal Pneumococcal Density during Asymptomatic Respiratory Virus Infection and Risk for Subsequent Acute Respiratory Illness.</a></h2><p>Increased nasopharyngeal pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae)  density has been associated with invasive pneumococcal disease, but factors that increase pneumococcal density are poorly understood. We evaluated pneumococcal densities in nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic young children from Peru and their association with subsequent acute respiratory illness (ARI). Total pneumococcal densities (encompassing all present serotypes) during asymptomatic periods were significantly higher when a respiratory virus was detected versus when no virus was detected (p<0.001). In adjusted analyses, increased pneumococcal density was significantly associated with the risk for a subsequent ARI (p<0.001), whereas asymptomatic viral detection alone was associated with lower risk for subsequent ARI. These findings suggest that interactions between viruses and pneumococci in the nasopharynx during asymptomatic periods might have a role in onset of subsequent ARI. The mechanisms for these interactions, along with other potentially associated host and environmental factors, and their role in ARI pathogenesis and pneumococcal transmission require further elucidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611277> Requires Lipid Metabolism Genes to Replicate in Pro-inflammatory Macrophages and Mice.</a></h2><p>To survive and replicate during infection, pathogens utilize different carbon and energy sources depending on the nutritional landscape of their host microenvironment.  serovar Typhimurium () is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that occupies diverse cellular niches. While it is clear that  requires access to glucose during systemic infection, data on the need for lipid metabolism are mixed. We report that  strains lacking lipid metabolism genes were defective for systemic infection of mice. Bacterial lipid import, β-oxidation and glyoxylate shunt genes were required for tissue  upon oral or intraperitoneal inoculation. In cultured macrophages, lipid import and β-oxidation genes were required for bacterial replication and/or survival only when the cell culture medium was supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Removal of glucose from tissue culture medium further enhanced these phenotypes and, in addition, conferred a requirement for glyoxylate shunt genes. We also observed that  needs lipid metabolism genes in pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory macrophages. These results suggest that during systemic infection, the  that rely upon host lipids to replicate are within pro-inflammatory macrophages that have access to amino acids, but not glucose. An improved understanding of the host microenvironments in which pathogens have specific metabolic requirements may facilitate the development of targeted approaches to treatment.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651121>Serum zinc levels in seborrheic dermatitis: a case-control study</a></h2><p>Malassezia  ,  sebaceous  gland  activity,  hormones,  immune  system  defects,  environmental  factors,  and  the interactions between these factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

To elucidate the mechanism of this promotion, we performed transcriptomic analyses using a cohort of 23 lambs to evaluate the effects of starter diets plus alfalfa on the development of the rumen wall from the pre- to the postweaning period. The quantitative PCR analyses were used to validate selected genes that were differentially expressed in the transcriptome mapping. We found that several metabolic processes associated with rumen tissue development were affected by solid feed intake, with genes linked to the calcium signaling transduction pathway and the metabolism of pteridine-containing compounds and homocysteine metabolic process being upregulated in the group with alfalfa intervention. The results suggest that the pteridine-containing compounds and calcium signaling are targets for precise regulation of rumen development.Copyright © 2019 Yang, Chen, Cao, He, Wang, Luo and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606047>Growth parameters of Liberibacter crescens suggest ammonium and phosphate as essential molecules in the Liberibacter-plant host interface.</a></h2><p>Liberibacter crescens is the closest cultured relative of four important uncultured crop pathogens. Candidatus. L. asiaticus, L. americanus, L. africanus cause citrus greening disease, while Ca. L. solanacearum causes potato Zebra chip disease. None of the pathogens grows in axenic culture. L. crescens grows in three media: a BM-7, a serum-free Hi® Grace's Insect Medium (Hi-GI), and a chemically-defined medium called M15. To date, no optimal growth parameters of the model species L. crescens have been reported. Studying the main growth parameters of L. crescens in axenic culture will give us insights into the lifestyle of the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens.The evaluation of the growth parameters-pH, aeration, temperature, and buffering capacity-reflects the optimal living conditions of L. crescens. These variables revealed that L. crescens is an aerobic, neutrophilic bacterium, that grows optimally in broth in a pH range of 5.8 to 6.8, in a fully oxygenated environment (250 rpm), at 28 °C, and with monosodium phosphate (10 mM or 11.69 mM) as the preferred buffer for growth. The increase of pH in the external media likely results from the deamination activity within the cell, with the concomitant over-production of ammonium in the external medium.L. crescens and the Ca. Liberibacter pathogens are metabolically similar and grow in similar environments-the phloem and the gut of their insect vectors. The evaluation of the growth parameters of L. crescens reveals the lifestyle of Liberibacter, elucidating ammonium and phosphate as essential molecules for  within the hosts. Ammonium is the main driver of pH modulation by active deamination of amino acids in the L. crescens amino acid rich media. In plants, excess ammonium induces ionic imbalances, oxidative stress, and pH disturbances across cell membranes, causing stunted root and shoot growth and chlorosis-the common symptoms of HLB-disease. Phosphate, which is also present in Ca. L. asiaticus hosts, is the preferred buffer for the growth of L. crescens. The interplay between ammonium, sucrose, potassium (K), phosphate, nitrate (NO), light and other photosynthates might lead to develop better strategies for disease management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632651>Historical faunal exchange between the Pontocaspian Basin and North America.</a></h2><p> is a genus of small brackish-water mud snails with an amphi-Atlantic distribution. Interestingly, the species occurring in the northwestern Atlantic, , is more closely related to the Pontocaspian taxa,  and , than to the species occurring in the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. At least three  scenarios may account for this peculiar biogeographical pattern: (1) a recent human-mediated dispersal, (2) a historical transatlantic interchange, and (3) a historical transpolar interchange. To test these three scenarios, we used five operational criteria-time of species divergence, first appearance in the fossil record, dispersal limitation as well as environmental filtering and biotic interactions along the potential migration routes. Specifically, we inferred a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny for  and reconstructed a paleogeographical map of the Arctic Ocean at 2.5 million years ago (Mya). Based on the five operational criteria, scenarios 1 and 2 can likely be rejected. In contrast, all criteria support scenario 3 (historical transpolar interchange). It is therefore suggested that a bird-mediated and/or ocean current-mediated faunal interchange via the Arctic Ocean occurred during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. This dispersal was likely facilitated by reduced distances between the Eurasian and North American/Greenland landmasses, marine introgressions, and/or a stepping-stone system of brackish-water habitats in northern Siberia, as well as a lack of competition along the migration route. As for the direction of dispersal, the scientific data presented are not conclusive. However, there is clearly more support for the scenario of dispersal from the Pontocaspian Basin to North America than vice versa. This is the first study providing evidence for a natural faunal exchange between the Pontocaspian Basin and North America via the Arctic Ocean.© 2019 The Authors.

When macroalgae are physically detached due to storms or erosion, their fragments can accumulate in seabed hollows, where they can be grazed upon by herbivores or be degraded microbially or be sequestered. To understand the fate of the increasing amount of macroalgal detritus in Antarctic shallow subtidal sediments, a mesocosm experiment was conducted to track C- and N-labeled macroalgal detritus into the benthic bacterial, meiofaunal, and macrofaunal biomass and respiration of sediments from Potter Cove (King George Island). We compared the degradation pathways of two macroalgae species: one considered palatable for herbivores (the red algae Palmaria decipiens) and other considered nonpalatable for herbivores (the brown algae Desmarestia anceps). The carbon from Palmaria was recycled at a higher rate than that of , with herbivores such as amphipods playing a stronger role in the early degradation process of the  fragments and the microbial community taking over at a later stage. In contrast,  was more buried in the subsurface sediments, stimulating subsurface bacterial degradation. Macrofauna probably relied indirectly on  carbon, recycled by bacteria and microphytobenthos. The efficient cycling of the nutrients and carbon from the macroalgae supports a positive feedback loop among bacteria, microphytobenthos, and meiofaunal and macrofaunal grazers, resulting in longer term retention of macroalgal nutrients in the sediment, hence creating a food bank for the benthos.© 2019 The Authors.

However, AM fungi possess common fungal cell wall components such as chitin which can be recognized by plant chitin receptors to trigger immune responses, raising the question how AM fungi effectively evade chitin-triggered immune responses during symbiosis. In this study, we characterize a secreted LysM (Lysin motif) effector identified from the model AM fungal species Rhizophagus irregularis, called RiSLM. RiSLM is one of the highest expressed effector proteins in intraradical mycelium during the symbiosis. In vitro binding assays show that RiSLM binds chitin-oligosaccharides and can protect fungal cell walls from chitinases. Moreover, RiSLM efficiently interferes with chitin-triggered immune responses, such as defence gene induction and reactive oxygen species production in Medicago truncatula. Although RiSLM also binds to symbiotic (lipo-)chitooligosaccharides it does not interfere significantly with symbiotic signalling in Medicago. Host-induced gene silencing of RiSLM greatly reduces fungal  levels. Taken together, our results reveal a key role for AM fungal LysM effectors to subvert chitin-triggered immunity in symbiosis, pointing to a common role for LysM effectors in both symbiotic and pathogenic fungi.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630683>Evaluation of the safety, tolerance and efficacy of 1-year consumption of infant formula supplemented with Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The microorganism present in breast milk, added to other factors, determine the  of infants. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group).

In the context of HSCT, bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic treatment of bloodstream infections with carbapenem-resistant (CR) GNB presents a particular challenge. As a part of our infection control management, the admission of a patient who was known to be colonized with a CR  triggered an active weekly screening of all patients to determine the prevalence and potential transmission of CR GNB and CR  in particular. Over a 3 month period a total of 71 patients were regularly screened for  with CR GNB. Including the index patient, a total of three patients showed CR GNB  representing a prevalence of 4.2%. Nosocomial transmission of CR  or other CR GNB was not observed. However, the index patient developed a subsequent bloodstream infection with the CR , therefore empiric antibiotic therapy based on the known resistance profile was initiated. A weekly prevalence screening for CR GNB might be an effective monitoring tool for potential transmission, may enhance existing infection control management concepts and may support the decision making for empiric antibiotic therapy.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648274>Relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining dynamic rates of boreal birds at the edge of their range.</a></h2><p>The Adirondack Park in New York State contains a unique and limited distribution of boreal ecosystem types, providing habitat for a number of birds at the southern edge of their range. Species are projected to shift poleward in a warming climate, and the limited boreal forest of the Adirondacks is expected to undergo significant change in response to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Here we expand upon a previous analysis to examine changes in occupancy patterns for eight species of boreal birds over a decade (2007-2016), and we assess the relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining  and extinction rates. Our analysis identifies patterns of declining occupancy for six of eight species, including some declines which appear to have become more pronounced since a prior analysis. Although non-climate drivers such as wetland area, connectivity, and human footprint continue to influence  and extinction rates, we find that for most species, occupancy patterns are best described by climate drivers. We modeled both average and annual temperature and precipitation characteristics and find stronger support for species' responses to average climate conditions, rather than interannual climate variability. In general, boreal birds appear most likely to colonize sites that have lower levels of precipitation and a high degree of connectivity, and they tend to persist in sites that are warmer in the breeding season and have low and less variable precipitation in the winter. It is likely that these responses reflect interactions between broader habitat conditions and temperature and precipitation variables. Indirect climate influences as mediated through altered species interactions may also be important in this context. Given climate change predictions for both temperature and precipitation, it is likely that habitat structural changes over the long term may alter these relationships in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644315>Association between  Complex Pulmonary Disease and Mycobacteria in Home Water and Soil: A Case-Control Study.</a></h2><p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), are emerging pathogens that can opportunistically cause debilitating pulmonary disease in susceptible human hosts. Potential sources of exposure in homes include point-of-use water sources such as taps and showerheads, as well as gardening soils. The relative human health impacts of NTM in these home environments remain poorly understood.This study tested associations between MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and NTM  of five potential point-of-use sources of pathogen exposure in homes.A case-control study was conducted of Washington and Oregon residents who had been diagnosed with MAC-PD, and population controls matched by age, gender, and geography. Samples were collected from bathroom faucets, kitchen faucets, shower aerosols, indoor soil, and outdoor soil. Mycobacteria in environmental samples were identified in a blinded fashion by using bacteriological culture combined with PCR. The isolation of NTM from case homes (N = 56) vs. control homes (N = 51) was quantitatively compared using conditional logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.NTM were isolated from shower aerosols collected in case homes more often than in control homes. An adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NTM isolation from shower aerosols had a high odds ratio associated with disease (OR, 4.0., 95% CI, 1.2-13). Other home environmental samples (tap water, soils) did not exhibit this association.The results implicate shower aerosols as uniquely significant sources of NTM exposure in homes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604057>Identification and characterization of primordial germ cells in a vocal learning Neoaves species, the zebra finch.</a></h2><p>The zebra finch has been used as a valuable vocal learning animal model for human spoken language. It is representative of vocal learning songbirds specifically, which comprise half of all bird species, and of Neoaves broadly, which comprise 95% of all bird species. Although transgenesis in the zebra finch has been accomplished, it is with a very low efficiency of germ-line transmission and far from the efficiency with a more genetically tractable but vocal nonlearning species, the chicken (a Galloanseriformes). To improve germ-line transmission in the zebra finch, we identified and characterized its primordial germ cells (PGCs) and compared them with chicken. We found striking differences between the 2 species, including that zebra finch PGCs were more numerous, more widely distributed in early embryos before  into the gonads, had slower timing of , and had a different developmental gene-expression program. We improved conditions for isolating and culturing zebra finch PGCs  and were able to transfect them with gene-expression vectors and incorporate them into the gonads of host embryos.

Hijacking specific host molecular factors and/or pathways is necessary for pathogens to successfully establish an intracellular infection. In this study, we employed an unbiased shRNA screening coupled with ultra-fast sequencing to screen 16,000 human genes during S. aureus infection and we identified several host genes important for this intracellular pathogen. In addition, we interrogated our screening results to find novel host-targeted therapeutics against intracellular S. aureus. We found that silencing the human gene TRAM2 resulted in a significant reduction of intracellular bacterial load while host cell viability was restored, showing its importance during intracellular infection. Furthermore, TRAM2 is an interactive partner of the endoplasmic reticulum SERCA pumps and treatment with the SERCA-inhibitor Thapsigargin halted intracellular MRSA survival. Our results suggest that Thapsigargin could be repurposed to tackle S. aureus host cell infection in combination with conventional antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641084>Clustering as a Means To Control Nitrate Respiration Efficiency and Toxicity in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Respiration is a fundamental process that has to optimally respond to metabolic demand and environmental changes. We previously showed that nitrate respiration, crucial for gut  by enterobacteria, is controlled by polar clustering of the nitrate reductase increasing the electron flux through the complex. Here, we show that the formate dehydrogenase electron-donating complex, FdnGHI, also clusters at the cell poles under nitrate-respiring conditions. Its proximity to the nitrate reductase complex was confirmed by its identification in the interactome of the latter, which appears to be specific to the nitrate-respiring condition. Interestingly, we have identified a multiprotein complex dedicated to handle nitric oxide resulting from the enhanced activity of the electron transport chain terminated by nitrate reductase. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent nitrite reductase NirBD and the hybrid cluster protein Hcp are key contributors to regulation of the nitric oxide level during nitrate respiration. Thus, gathering of actors involved in respiration and NO homeostasis seems to be critical to balancing maximization of electron flux and the resulting toxicity. Most bacteria rely on the redox activity of respiratory complexes embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane to gain energy in the form of ATP and of an electrochemical gradient established across the membrane. Nevertheless, production of harmful and toxic nitric oxide by actively growing bacteria as either an intermediate or side-product of nitrate respiration challenges how homeostasis control is exerted. Here, we show that components of the nitrate electron transport chain are clustered, likely influencing the kinetics of the process. Nitric oxide production from this respiratory chain is controlled and handled through a multiprotein complex, including detoxifying systems. These findings point to an essential role of compartmentalization of respiratory components in bacterial cell growth.Copyright © 2019 Bulot et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621176>At the nexus of three kingdoms: the genome of the mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita provides insights into plant, endobacterial and fungal interactions.</a></h2><p>As members of the plant microbiota, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF, Glomeromycotina) symbiotically colonize plant roots. AMF also possess their own microbiota, hosting some uncultivable endobacteria. Ongoing research has revealed the genetics underlying plant responses to  by AMF, but the fungal side of the relationship remains in the dark. Here, we sequenced the genome of Gigaspora margarita, a member of the Gigasporaceae in an early diverging group of the Glomeromycotina. In contrast to other AMF, G. margarita may host distinct endobacterial populations and possesses the largest fungal genome so far annotated (773.104 Mbp), with more than 64% transposable elements. Other unique traits of the G. margarita genome include: the expansion of genes for inorganic phosphate metabolism, the presence of genes for production of secondary metabolites and a considerable number of potential horizontal gene transfer events.

The subspecies  originated in Africa and was introduced to the Americas in 1956. For the last 60 years, it hybridized successfully with European subspecies, previous residents in the area. The result of this hybridization was called Africanized honey bee (AHB). AHB has spread since then, arriving to Puerto Rico (PR) in 1994. The honey bee population on the island acquired a mosaic of features from AHB or the European honey bee (EHB). AHB in Puerto Rico shows a major distinctive characteristic, docile behavior, and is called gentle Africanized honey bees (gAHB). We used 917 SNPs to examine the population structure, genetic differentiation, origin, and history of range expansion and  of gAHB in PR. We compared gAHB to populations that span the current distribution of  worldwide. The gAHB population is shown to be a single population that differs genetically from the examined populations of AHB.

Climatological factors may also alter the dynamics of the interactions between plant pathogens and their hosts.  (=) , the causal agent of Swiss needle cast (SNC) of Douglas-fir, is endemic to western North America where it exists as two sympatric, reproductively isolated lineages. The abundance of this fungus and the severity of SNC are strongly influenced by climate. We used statistical and population genetic analyses to examine relationships between environment, pathogen population structure, and SNC severity. Although  Lineage 2 in western Oregon and Washington was most abundant where SNC symptoms were most severe, we did not detect a significant relationship between Lineage 2 and disease severity. Warmer winter temperatures were inversely correlated with foliage retention () and positively correlated with the relative abundance of Lineage 2 (). However when distance inland, which was strongly correlated with both  and , was included in the model, there was no significant relationship between Lineage 2 and . Spring/early summer dew point temperatures also were positively associated with total  abundance ( index ()) and inversely correlated with . Warmer summer mean temperatures were associated with lower  and higher . Our results suggest that the two lineages have overlapping environmental optima, but slightly different tolerance ranges. Lineage 2 was absent from more inland sites where winters are colder and summers are warm and dry, while Lineage 1 occurred at most sites across an environmental gradient suggesting broader environmental tolerance. These relationships suggest that climate influences the abundance and distribution of this ecologically important plant pathogen and may have played a role in the evolutionary divergence of these two cryptic fungal lineages.© 2019 The Authors.

Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but if this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal  during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation.

Results indicated that mother spores asymbiotically and pre-symbiotically produced daughter spores singly or in pairs. Compared with symbiotically produced spores, pre-symbiotically produced spores were significantly smaller (43.1 μm vs. 89.2 μm in diameter). Exogenous ABA applied to mother spores significantly increased the number of daughter spores, and root volatiles also significantly promoted pre-symbiotic sporulation.

Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall microbiome development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome.

Here, we studied the population genetics of a recently established island population of Eurasian blackbirds (Aves: ) located on the island of Heligoland in the German North Sea. Using microsatellites, we genotyped the majority of the island population, including the nestlings, over a 4-year period between 2004 and 2007. We also genotyped high numbers of migrants on stopover and mainland individuals, as they are potential founders of the island population. We identified two genetic clusters that comply with the migrating and mainland birds. While most of the island birds belong to the mainland cluster, some breeding individuals and a low fraction of the offspring belong to the genetic cluster found in migrating individuals with almost no admixture between the two, pointing to assortative mating acting on the island population. We did not find any evidence for founder events and detected deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium that disappeared in cohorts of older age that coincide with a lower number of siblings in older cohorts. The observed genetic patterns unravel a complex  history to which migratory and mainland birds have contributed and which is characterized by assortative mating.

However, it remains unclear how ancient lakes play roles in genetic and phenotypic diversity of freshwater mollusks. In the present study, we focus on viviparid freshwater snails in the ancient lakes of East and Southeast Asia (Japan and China) to address this question. Using molecular phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear genes (18S, 28S, H3), we show that patterns of species diversification in viviparid lineages.  to ancient lake occurred independently in China and Japan at least four times, with subsequent diversification into more than two species within each lake group. Morphological analyses of fossil related viviparids suggest parallel phenotypic evolution occurred in the different lakes and ages. Each lake contained a single lineage, which was phenotypically diversified relative to those from other sites. Using genome-wide SNPs obtained by MIG-seq, we also examined the genetic structure of three Japanese viviparids, including two endemic species of ancient Lake Biwa. The results suggest that these two species diversified from the population of the third species living in wetlands surrounding the lake. These findings suggest that rapid diversification of lineages and phenotypic divergence can occur in ancient lakes compared to other habitats. Formation of large lakes likely promotes speciation and phenotypic divergence as a result of adaptation into different microhabitats. High numbers of ancient lakes could be a driver of species diversity in Asian viviparid snails.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604126>Transmission of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria from colonized mothers to their infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To review the molecular evidence supporting transmission of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) from colonized mothers to their infants and the risk factors for MDR-GNB transmission.We searched PubMed and Scopus for studies investigating the mechanisms, risk factors for and/or scale of transmission of MDR-GNB from colonized mothers to their infants.

We examined whether there was evidence for this trade-off among tree species in a subtropical forest and how it correlated with eight functional traits. We developed and estimated a metric for  ability that incorporates both fecundity and seed dispersal based on seed trap data and the sizes and distributions of adult trees. Competitive ability was estimated as survival probability under high crowding conditions based on neighborhood models. Although we found no significant relationship between  and competitive abilities, there was a significant negative correlation between long distance dispersal ability and competitive ability at the 5 cm size class. Colonizers had traits associated with faster growth, such as large leaves and low leaf lamina density, whereas competitors had traits associated with higher survival, such as dense wood. Our results imply that any trade-off between competition and  may be more determined by dispersal ability than by fecundity, suggesting that seed dispersal is an important contributor to diversity maintenance. Future work should test how competitive ability covaries with the components of  ability, as we did here.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608044>Tal6 From  Is a LysM Effector Involved in Mycoparasitism and Plant Association.</a></h2><p>LysM effectors play a relevant role during the plant  by successful phytopathogenic fungi, since they enable them to avoid either the triggering of plant defense mechanisms or their attack effects. Tal6, a LysM protein from , is capable of binding to complex chitin. However, until now its biological function is not completely known, particularly its participation in plant- interactions. We obtained  null mutant and  overexpressing strains and determined the role played by this protein during -plant interaction and mycoparasitism. LysM effector Tal6 from  protects the hyphae from chitinases by binding to chitin of the fungal cell wall, increases the fungus mycoparasitic capacity, and modulates the activation of the plant defense system. These results show that beneficial fungi also employ LysM effectors to improve their association with plants.Copyright © 2019 Romero-Contreras, Ramírez-Valdespino, Guzmán-Guzmán, Macías-Segoviano, Villagómez-Castro and Olmedo-Monfil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660878>Prevalence of and risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in the West of Iran: a population-based cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Several reports designate the recent increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) nasal carriage. Because of the scanty information regarding the nasal carriage sate of MRSA in the west of Iran, the purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of CA-MRSA in Sanandaj city.Swabs collected from anterior nares of 600 volunteers were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. The isolates were further investigated for methicillin resistance by using the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, followed by PCR-amplification of the mecA gene. SCCmec types and the presence of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (pvl) encoding genes were determined through PCR. Finally, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the agar diffusion method.Nasal screening identified 181 S. aureus, of which 55 isolates were MRSA. SCCmec types IV and V were detected in MRSA at frequencies of 80 and 20%, respectively. The overall frequency of pvl genes among the MRSA isolates was 14.54%. MRSA isolates were highly susceptible (98.18%) to mupirocin, gentamicin, and fusidic acid.The high prevalence of CA-MRSA carriage in the population could pose a serious public health concern for the region. Additionally, advent of drug-resistant pvl-positive strains demands continuous surveillance on the  state of CA-MRSA in order to prevent dissemination of the bacterium in the community.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606257>Assessment of a novel antimicrobial surface disinfectant on inert surfaces in the intensive care unit environment using ATP-bioluminesence assay.</a></h2><p>Cross-contamination from inanimate surfaces can play a significant role in intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired  and infection. This study assessed an innovative isopropyl alcohol/organofunctional silane solution (IOS) to reduce microbial contamination on inert surfaces in a medical ICU.Baseline adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence testing (ABT)-measurements (N = 200) were obtained on designated inert ICU surfaces followed by IOS treatment. At 1 and 6 weeks, selective surfaces were randomized to either IOS-treated or nontreated controls for comparison using ABT (N = 400) and RODAC colony counts (N = 400). An ABT value of ≤45 relative light units (RLU) was designated as "clean," whereas >45 was assessed as "dirty."Mean RLU baseline values ranged from 870.3 (computer keyboard) to 201.6 (bed table), and 97.5% of surfaces were assessed as "dirty." At 6 weeks, the mean RLU of surfaces treated with IOS ranged from 31.7 (physician workstation) to 51.5 (telephone handpiece), whereas values on comparative control surfaces were 717.3 and 643.7, respectively (P < .001). Some 95.5% of RODAC cultures from IOS-treated sites at 6 weeks were negative, whereas 90.5% of nontreated sites were culture-positive, yielding multiple isolates including multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.IOS-treated surfaces recorded significantly lower RLU and RODAC colony counts compared with controls (P < .001). A single application of IOS resulted in a persistent antimicrobial activity on inert ICU surfaces over the 6-week study interval.Copyright © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

These adhesive interactions are most effectively engendered via binding of the endothelial lectin E-selectin (CD62E) to its cognate ligand, sialyl Lewis-X (sLe), displayed on circulating cells. Though CAR T-cell immunotherapy holds promise for treatment of various hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, there is essentially no information regarding the efficiency of CAR T-cell homing. Accordingly, we performed integrated biochemical studies and adhesion assays to examine the capacity of human CAR T-cells to engage E-selectin. Our data indicate that CAR T-cells do not express sLe and do not bind E-selectin. However, enforced sLe display can be achieved on human CAR T-cells by surface fucosylation, with resultant robust E-selectin binding under hemodynamic shear. Importantly, following intravascular administration into mice, fucosylated human CAR-T cells infiltrate marrow with 10-fold higher efficiency than do unfucosylated cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that custom-installation of sLe programs tissue  of vascularly administered human CAR T-cells, offering a readily translatable strategy to augment tissue delivery, thereby lowering the pertinent cell dosing and attendant cell production burden, for CAR T-cell immunotherapy applications.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614257>Novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives containing indole fragment as potent and selective anticancer agent.</a></h2><p>Potent and safe anticancer drugs research and development are still on the way to human health. In this report, a series of novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives containing indole fragment were designed and synthesized. Most compounds exhibited excellent antiproliferative activity against PC3, MGC803 and EC109 cell lines with low micromolar IC (0.14-12μM). Especially, compound 5j can selectively inhibit PC3 cells in three tested tumor cells with IC value of 0.14 μM, which may be attributed to a synergistic effect after introducing indole fragment into the TSC structure. Meanwhile, compound 5j displayed more selectivity in PC3 cells toward two normal WPMY-1 and GES-1 cell lines, compared to those of 3-AP and DPC. We also found that 5j can effectively inhibit PC3 cell proliferation,  and induce apoptosis. What's more, 5j may significantly suppress migration and invasion by blocking the EMT process but had no effect on cell cycle. Collectively, our findings indicate that 5j with structure of thiosemicarbazone containing indole may serve as a useful anticancer lead for further optimization and development.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal . Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596574>Antimicrobial Peptide-Conjugated Hierarchical Antifouling Polymer Brushes for Functionalized Catheter Surfaces.</a></h2><p>Catheter-related infection is a great challenge to modern medicine, which causes significant economic burden and increases patient morbidity. Hence, there is a great requirement for functionalized surfaces with inherently antibacterial properties and biocompatibility that prevent bacterial  and attachment of blood cells. Herein, we developed a strategy for constructing polymer brushes with hierarchical architecture on polyurethane (PU) via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Surface-functionalized PU (PU-DMH) was readily prepared, which comprised of poly(3-[dimethyl-[2-(2-methylprop-2-enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane-1-sulfonate) (PDMAPS) brushes as the lower layer and antimicrobial peptide-conjugated poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) brushes as the upper layer. The PU-DMH surface showed excellent bactericidal property against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and could prevent accumulation of bacterial debris on surfaces. Simultaneously, the PU-DMH samples possessed good hemocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the integrated antifouling and bactericidal properties of PU-DMH under hydrodynamic conditions were confirmed by an in vitro circulating model. The functionalized surface possessed persistent antifouling and bactericidal performances both under static and hydrodynamic conditions. The microbiological and histological results of animal experiments also verified the in vivo anti-infection performance. The present work might find promising clinical applications for preventing catheter-related infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644663>High-resolution computed tomography findings in young infants with cystic fibrosis detected by newborn screening.</a></h2><p>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) allows the early detection of pathological changes in the lung structure, and reproducible scoring systems can be used to quantify chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of the study was to describe early HRCT findings according to a validated scoring system in infants with CF diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS).This cross-sectional study included infants with CF diagnosed by NBS who were born between January 2013 and January 2017 and who underwent HRCT scanning within the first year after diagnosis when they were clinically stable. The CT scans were evaluated using the modified Bhalla score.Thirty-two subjects underwent HRCT scanning. The mean total-modified Bhalla score was 3.6±2.1, and 93.8% of the scans were abnormal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway  was associated with increased modified Bhalla score values. Bronchial wall thickening was the most common feature (90.6%), followed by bronchial collapse/consolidation (59.4%), mosaic attenuation/perfusion (50%), bronchiectasis (37.5%) and mucus plugging (15.6%). Bronchial wall thickening was diffuse in most of the patients.A substantial proportion of infants diagnosed with CF after detection by NBS already showed evidence of lung disease. P. aeruginosa  was associated with increased Bhalla scores, highlighting the importance of this CF pathogen in early structural lung disease. The presence of bronchial wall thickening at such a young age may reflect the presence of airway inflammatory processes. The detection and quantification of structural abnormalities with the modified Bhalla score may aid in the identification of lung disease before it is clinically apparent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599337>Identification of the general stress stimulon related to  in Enterococcus faecalis.</a></h2><p>Enterococcus faecalis has to cope with major stress conditions during . To understand the effects of stress encountered during infection, the present study assessed the transcriptomic response of the bacteria facing exposure to serum, urine, bile salts, acid pH, or oxidative stress. Compared to non-stressed culture, 30% of the E. faecalis genes were differentially expressed. The transcriptome analysis reveals common but also specific responses, depending on stresses encountered: thus, urine exposure has the most important impact, and the highest number of genes with modified expression is involved in transport and metabolism. The results also pinpoint many stress-related sRNA or intergenic regions not yet characterized. This study identified the general stress stimulon related to infection: when the commensal bacterium initiates its response to stress related to infection, it increases its ability to survive to rough conditions for , rather than promoting expression of virulence factors, and becomes this opportunistic pathogen that thrives in hospital settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655829>Evaluation the oral hygiene conditions, oral Candida  and salivary Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli density in a group of β-thalassemic children and adolescence.</a></h2><p>In this study, the prevalence and distribution of dental caries and oral hygiene conditions in a group of patients with β-TM are evaluated and the results compared to age-and gender-matched healthy patients.

Previous research has shown that when human pathogens co-exist with plant pathogens, they have improved growth and survival rates. In this study, we have assessed whether  O157:H7 benefits in the existence of a phytopathogenic bacterium and the underlying mechanisms were further investigated. When  pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and  O157:H7 were co-inoculated by either dipping or infiltration methods, the populations of  O157:H7 increased; however, no effect was observed when type three secretion system (T3SS) mutants were used instead, suggesting that  O157:H7 benefits from the presence of Pst DC3000. In addition, this study confirmed that the  O157:H7 populations increased when they occupied the tomato leaf intercellular space; this  of the interior of the leaves was possible due to the suppression of the PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) by Pst DC3000, in particular with the AvrPto effector.

The microbial profile of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed a persistent infection with  and other bacterial taxa such as  and . In addition, taxonomic and functional analysis by whole metagenome sequencing in the endometrial fluid sample collected before one clinical miscarriage suggested the presence of multiple  clades with a greater abundance of clade 4, usually associated with metronidazole resistance.

They both cause genital herpes, occasionally severe disease in the immunocompromised, and facilitate much HIV acquisition globally. Despite more than 60 years of research, there is no licensed prophylactic HSV vaccine and some doubt as to whether this can be achieved. Nevertheless, a previous HSV vaccine candidate did have partial success in preventing genital herpes and HSV acquisition and another immunotherapeutic candidate reduced viral shedding and recurrent lesions, inspiring further research. However, the entry pathway of HSV into the anogenital mucosa and the subsequent cascade of immune responses need further elucidation so that these responses could be mimicked or improved by a vaccine, to prevent viral entry and  of the neuronal ganglia. For an effective novel vaccine against genital herpes the choice of antigen and adjuvant may be critical. The incorporation of adjuvants of the vaccine candidates in the past, may account for their partial efficacy. It is likely that they can be improved by understanding the mechanisms of immune responses elicited by different adjuvants and comparing these to natural immune responses. Here we review the history of vaccines for HSV, those in development and compare them to successful vaccines for chicken pox or herpes zoster. We also review what is known of the natural immune control of herpes lesions, via interacting innate immunity and CD4 and CD8 T cells and the lessons they provide for development of new, more effective vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636183>Host-symbiont specificity determined by microbe-microbe competition in an insect gut.</a></h2><p>Despite the omnipresence of specific host-symbiont associations with acquisition of the microbial symbiont from the environment, little is known about how the specificity of the interaction evolved and is maintained. The bean bug  acquires a specific bacterial symbiont of the genus  from environmental soil and harbors it in midgut crypts. The genus  consists of over 100 species, showing ecologically diverse lifestyles, and including serious human pathogens, plant pathogens, and nodule-forming plant mutualists, as well as insect mutualists. Through infection tests of 34  species and 18 taxonomically diverse bacterial species, we demonstrate here that nonsymbiotic  and even its outgroup  could stably colonize the gut symbiotic organ and provide beneficial effects to the bean bug when inoculated on aposymbiotic hosts. However, coinoculation revealed that the native symbiont always outcompeted the nonnative bacteria inside the gut symbiotic organ, explaining the predominance of the native  symbiont in natural bean bug populations. Hence, the abilities for  and cooperation, usually thought of as specific traits of mutualists, are not unique to the native  symbiont but, to the contrary, competitiveness inside the gut is a derived trait of the native symbiont lineage only and was thus critical in the evolution of the insect gut symbiont.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603531>When sinks become sources: Adaptive  in asexuals.</a></h2><p>The establishment of a population into a new empty habitat outside of its initial niche is a phenomenon akin to evolutionary rescue in the presence of immigration. It underlies a wide range of processes, such as biological invasions by alien organisms, host shifts in pathogens or the emergence of resistance to pesticides or antibiotics from untreated areas. We derive an analytically tractable framework to describe the evolutionary and demographic dynamics of asexual populations in a source-sink system. We analyze the influence of several factors on the establishment success in the sink, and on the time until establishment. To this aim, we use a classic phenotype-fitness landscape (Fisher's geometrical model in n dimensions) where the source and sink habitats have different phenotypic optima. In case of successful establishment, the mean fitness in the sink follows a typical four-phases trajectory. The waiting time to establishment is independent of the immigration rate and has a "U-shaped" dependence on the mutation rate, until some threshold where lethal mutagenesis impedes establishment and the sink population remains so.

Several PCR methods have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of PCP. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a real-time PCR in the diagnosis of PCP, in patients with various underlying diseases.Ninety-seven BAL samples and 94 sputum samples from 191 patients were used in the study. Patients were classified as PCP (121 patients) or non-PCP (70 patients) based on their clinical and radiological presentations.Real time PCR amplified the P. jirovecii mitochondrial large-subunit rRNA gene with a detection limit of 68 copies of DNA per reaction. Non-PCP pathogens including 32 different fungi and bacteria were also evaluated. Overall, 71.9% of the samples from PCP patients and 14.5% of those from non-PCP patients were positive for the PCR test with a C value of the real-time PCR below 45. The main underlying diseases of the patients were hematological or solid malignancies (47.1%) and HIV infection (8.9%). The C values of the test were significantly lower in BAL samples from PCP patients than those from non-PCP patients (p = 0.024). No non-PCP patient had a C value below 30, whereas samples from 24.8% of PCP patients with underlying diseases had a C value below 30.Since false positive PCR results were obtained, perhaps due to , we suggest that the diagnosis of PCP should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, and PCR results.Copyright © 2019.

Confocal microscopy, molecular and classical microbiology were used to investigate microaspiration and pneumococcal presence in the lower airways. AM opsonophagocytic capacity was assessed by functional assays in vitro, whereas flow cytometry and transcriptomic analysis were used to assess further changes on the lung cellular populations.AM from Spn-colonized exhibited increased opsonophagocytosis to pneumococcus (11.4% median increase) for four months after clearance of experimental pneumococcal . AM had also increased responses against other bacterial pathogens. Pneumococcal DNA detected in the BAL samples of Spn-colonized were positively correlated with nasal pneumococcal density (r=0.71, p=0.029). Similarly, AM heightened opsonophagocytic capacity was correlated with nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density (r=0.61, p=0.025).Our findings demonstrate that nasal  with pneumococcus and microaspiration prime AM, leading to brisker responsiveness to both pneumococcus and unrelated bacterial pathogens.

To investigate the early response of oilseed rape to the fungal infection, we determined transcriptomic changes in oilseed rape roots at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) by RNA-Seq analysis, in which non-infected roots served as a control. Strikingly, a subset of genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis was found to be down-regulated and the ABA level was accordingly attenuated in 6 dpi oilseed rape as compared with the control. Gene expression analysis revealed that this was mainly attributed to the suppression of BnNCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, involving, for example, BnWRKY57. However, this down-regulation of ABA biosynthesis could not be observed in infected Arabidopsis roots. Arabidopsis ABA- defective mutants nced3 and aao3 displayed pronounced tolerance to the fungal infection with delayed and impeded symptom development, even though fungal  was not affected in both mutants. These data suggest that ABA appears to be required for full susceptibility of Arabidopsis to the fungal infection. Furthermore, we found that in both 6 dpi oilseed rape and the Arabidopsis nced3 mutant, the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway was induced while the jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) signalling pathway was concomitantly mitigated. Following these data, we conclude that in oilseed rape the V. longisporum infection triggers a host-specific suppression of the NCED3-mediated ABA biosynthesis, consequently increasing plant tolerance to the fungal infection. We believe that this might be part of the virulence strategy of V. longisporum to initiate/establish a long-lasting compatible interaction with oilseed rape (coexistence), which appears to be different from the infection process in Arabidopsis.© 2019 The Authors.

This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) , its symbiotic endophyte , and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646536>Calcium Regulation of Bacterial Virulence.</a></h2><p>Calcium (Ca) is a universal signaling ion, whose major informational role shaped the evolution of signaling pathways, enabling cellular communications and responsiveness to both the intracellular and extracellular environments. Elaborate Ca regulatory networks have been well characterized in eukaryotic cells, where Ca regulates a number of essential cellular processes, ranging from cell division, transport and motility, to apoptosis and pathogenesis. However, in bacteria, the knowledge on Ca signaling is still fragmentary. This is complicated by the large variability of environments that bacteria inhabit with diverse levels of Ca. Yet another complication arises when bacterial pathogens invade a host and become exposed to different levels of Ca that (1) are tightly regulated by the host, (2) control host defenses including immune responses to bacterial infections, and (3) become impaired during diseases. The invading pathogens evolved to recognize and respond to the host Ca, triggering the molecular mechanisms of adhesion, biofilm formation, host cellular damage, and host-defense resistance, processes enabling the development of persistent infections. In this review, we discuss: (1) Ca as a determinant of a host environment for invading bacterial pathogens, (2) the role of Ca in regulating main events of host  and bacterial virulence, and (3) the molecular mechanisms of Ca signaling in bacterial pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636946>Infection in patchy populations: Contrasting pathogen invasion success and dispersal at varying times since host .</a></h2><p>Repeated extinction and recolonization events generate a landscape of host populations that vary in their time since . Within this dynamic landscape, pathogens that excel at invading recently colonized host populations are not necessarily those that perform best in host populations at or near their carrying capacity, potentially giving rise to divergent selection for pathogen traits that mediate the invasion process. Rarely, however, has this contention been empirically tested. Using , we explored how differences in the  history of a host population influence the invasion success of different genotypes of the pathogen . By partitioning the pathogen invasion process into a series of individual steps, we show that each pathogen optimizes invasion differently when encountering host populations that vary in their time since . All pathogen genotypes were more likely to establish successfully in recently colonized host populations, but the production of transmission spores was typically maximized in either the subsequent growth or stationary phase of host . Integrating across the first three pathogen invasion steps (initial establishment, proliferation, and secondary infection) revealed that overall pathogen invasion success (and its variance) was, nonetheless, highest in recently colonized host populations. However, only pathogens that were slow to kill their host were able to maximize host-facilitated dispersal. This suggests that only a subset of pathogen genotypes-the less virulent and more dispersive-are more likely to encounter newly colonized host populations at the front of a range expansion or in metapopulations with high extinction rates. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off for a pathogen between dispersal and virulence, and evidence for higher invasion success in younger host populations, a finding with clear implications for pathogen evolution in spatiotemporally dynamic settings.© 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, the strain's ability to induce three pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (PR-1a, GLUA, and CHI3) in tomato, was studied using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The genes PR-1a and GLUA were up-regulated after 120 h exposure to P. chororaphis ToZa7 (15.22- and 13.11-fold, respectively), as compared to the untreated control, without challenge inoculation by the pathogen. To study the effects of individual or combined application of P. chororaphis ToZa7 and the compatible biocontrol fungus Clonostachys rosea IK726, challenged with the pathogen, the expression patterns of the above three PR genes were monitored, in tomato roots. Expression of PR1-a was noteworthy, especially 48 h after challenge inoculation, when C. rosea IK726 alone or in combination with P. chororaphis, ToZa7 was pre-inoculated on tomato roots (38.53-fold and 53.74-fold, respectively). Expression of PR1-a, 72 h after challenge inoculation, was the highest in P. chororaphis ToZa7, among biocontrol treatments. Expression of CHI3 was much lower, while up-regulation of GLUA was overall not observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of intact tomato roots and bacterial counts of superficially disinfected roots revealed, for the first time, that P. chororaphis ToZa7 colonizes the exterior as well as the internal tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624173>Genome Sequence of Oxalobacter formigenes Strain SSYG-15.</a></h2><p> of the intestine with  reduces urinary oxalate excretion and lowers the risk of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones.

The most common methods use microscopic estimates of the relative proportion of root length colonized by fungal structures. These methods typically examine root subsamples. While such methods are inexpensive and relatively simple, significant variation within single root system means there is opportunity for sampling bias. We evaluated the two most common methods of percent root length  for AM fungi both as a subsample and for the entire root system of flax plants. We compared these measures to a novel technique that returns projected fungal surface area (fungal coverage), by using microphotography and imaging analysis.

However, it is not the case for non-mutualistic beneficial interactions or associative symbiosis with plants. Particularly, little is known about the transcriptional regulations associated with the immune tolerance of plants towards beneficial microbes. In this context, the study of the  rice model is very promising to describe the molecular mechanisms involved in associative symbiosis. Indeed, several species of the  () genus can colonize rice tissues and have beneficial effects; particularly, two species have been thoroughly studied:  and . This study aims to compare the interaction of these species with rice and especially to identify common or specific plant responses. Therefore, we analyzed root  of the rice cultivar Nipponbare using DsRed-tagged bacterial strains and produced the transcriptomes of both roots and leaves 7 days after root inoculation. This led us to the identification of a co-expression jasmonic acid (JA)-related network exhibiting opposite regulation in response to the two strains in the leaves of inoculated plants. We then monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) the expression of JA-related genes during time course  by each strain. Our results reveal a temporal shift in this JA systemic response, which can be related to different  strategies of both strains.Copyright © 2019 King, Wallner, Rimbault, Barrachina, Klonowska, Moulin and Czernic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611279> serovar Typhimurium use PbgA/YejM to regulate lipopolysaccharide assembly during bacteremia.</a></h2><p> serovar Typhimurium ( Typhimurium) rely upon the inner-membrane protein, PbgA, to enhance outer-membrane (OM) integrity and promote virulence in mice. The PbgA transmembrane domain (residues 1-190) is essential for viability, while the periplasmic domain (191-586) is dispensable.

Complementation and substitution mutations in LapB and LpxC generally restored the phospholipid and LPS assembly defects for the  mutants. During bacteremia, mice infected with  mutants survived and cleared the bacteria, while animals infected with wild-type salmonellae succumbed within one week.

Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist.

However, work in recent years has brought to light the importance of inter-host transmission and its influence on microbiome composition and dynamics. We now appreciate that microbiomes do not exist in isolation, but exchange constituents with the microbial communities of other hosts and the environment. Moving forward, fully understanding the role of transmission in microbiome assembly and dynamics will require a high-resolution view of the  and persistence patterns of particular microbial lineages (i.e. strains) across individuals and the environment. Yet, accomplishing this level of resolution will be an immense challenge, requiring improved sampling and bioinformatics approaches as well as employment of tractable experimental models.

However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic B lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+B lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic B lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP  and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP  and promote B lymphocyte-suppression and reduction. Eventually, the pneumonia worsened.Copyright 2019 Biolife Sas. www.biolifesas.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618711>Enhanced dissolution of silver nanoparticles in a physical mixture with platinum nanoparticles based on the sacrificial anode effect.</a></h2><p>A strategy to reduce implant-related infections is the inhibition of the initial bacterial implant  by biomaterials containing silver (Ag). The antimicrobial efficacy of such biomaterials can be increased by surface enhancement (nanosilver) or by creating a sacrificial anode system for Ag. Such a system will lead to an electrochemically driven enhanced Ag ion release due to the presence of a more noble metal. Here we combined the enlarged surface of nanoparticles (NP) with a possible sacrificial anode effect for Ag induced by the presence of the electrochemically more noble platinum (Pt) in physical mixtures of Ag NP and Pt NP dispersions. These Ag NP / Pt NP mixtures were compared to same amounts of pure Ag NP in terms of cell biological responses, i.e. the antimicrobial activity against  and  as well as the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). In addition, Ag NP was analyzed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). It was found that the dissolution rate of Ag NP was enhanced in the presence of Pt NP within the physical mixture compared to a dispersion of pure Ag NP. Dissolution experiments revealed a fourfold increased Ag ion release from physical mixtures due to enhanced electrochemical activity, which resulted in a significantly increased toxicity towards both bacteria and hMSC. Thus, our results provide evidence for an underlying sacrificial anode mechanism induced by the presence of Pt NP within physical mixtures with Ag NP. Such physical mixtures have a high potential for various applications, for example as antimicrobial implant coatings in the biomedicine or as bactericidal systems for water and surface purification in the technical area.© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651305>Comparing methods to estimate incremental inpatient costs and length of stay due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta, Canada.</a></h2><p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic bacterial organism resistant to first line antibiotics. Acquisition of MRSA is often classified as either healthcare-associated or community-acquired. It has been shown that both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections contribute to the spread of MRSA within healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental inpatient cost and length of stay for individuals colonized or infected with MRSA. Common analytical methods were compared to ensure the quality of the estimate generated. This study was performed at Alberta Ministry of Health (Edmonton, Alberta), with access to clinical MRSA data collected at two Edmonton hospitals, and ministerial administrative data holdings.A retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA was identified using a provincial infection prevention and control database. A coarsened exact matching algorithm, and two regression models (semilogarithmic ordinary least squares model and log linked generalized linear model) were evaluated. A MRSA-free cohort from the same facilities and care units was identified for the matched method; all records were used for the regression models. Records span from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015, for individuals 18 or older at discharge.Of the models evaluated, the generalized linear model was found to perform the best. Based on this model, the incremental inpatient costs associated with hospital-acquired cases were the most costly at $31,686 (14,169 - 60,158) and $47,016 (23,125 - 86,332) for  and infection, respectively. Community-acquired MRSA cases also represent a significant burden, with incremental inpatient costs of $7397 (2924 - 13,180) and $14,847 (8445 - 23,207) for  and infection, respectively. All costs are adjusted to 2016 Canadian dollars. Incremental length of stay followed a similar pattern, where hospital-acquired infections had the longest incremental stays of 35.2 (16.3-69.5) days and community-acquired  had the shortest incremental stays of 3.0 (0.6-6.3) days.MRSA, and in particular, hospital-acquired MRSA, places a significant but preventable cost burden on the Alberta healthcare system. Estimates of cost and length of stay varied by the method of analysis and source of infection, highlighting the importance of selecting the most appropriate method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654686>Spray-drying of inhalable, multifunctional formulations for the treatment of biofilms formed in cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious lung disease, commonly susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The dense mucus together with biofilm formation limit drug permeability and prevent the drug from reaching the site of action, causing treatment failure of the bacterial infection. Besides the use of antibiotics, the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is recommended to be co-administered in the treatment of CF. Although several formulations have been developed for inhalation therapy to improve the pulmonary condition in CF patients, there is still no comprehensive study on a combined multifunctional dry powder formulation of antibiotics with NAC. In this work, we developed an innovative multifunctional dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation based on salt formation between NAC and antibiotics and characterized their solid state properties and physical stability. NAC could be spray dried together with three different antibiotics, azithromycin (Azi), tobramycin (Tobra) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), without the use of organic solvents to form Azi/NAC, Tobra/NAC and Cipro/NAC DPI formulations. Solid-state characterization of these DPI formulations showed that they were amorphous after spray drying. Azi/NAC and Tobra/NAC form co-amorphous salt systems that were physically stable under storage at stress conditions. For particle characterization, the obtained mass median aerodynamic diameters were in a suitable range for inhalation (< 5.0 µm). The multifunctional antibiotic/NAC formulations conserved or improved the antibiotic susceptibility and showed promising results regarding the inhibition of P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm formation.Copyright © 2019.

It plays roles in various processes, including cell adhesion, migration, growth, proliferation, and tissue repair. Fibronectin exists in 2 forms: a soluble, inactive molecule, called plasma FN (pFN), which is synthesized by hepatocytes in the liver, and an insoluble cellular form (cFN), which is produced locally by different types of cells and is a key component of the ECM. Fibrinogen fibrils ensure structural support for cell adhesion and promote cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, FN controls the availability of growth factors. The plasma form of FN is a crucial component of the fibrin clot in the early wound-healing response, while the cellular form of FN supports efficient platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation, and procoagulant activity. Alternative splicing of the FN gene results in the generation of protein variants which contain the additional isoforms - extra domain A of FN (EDA) and extra domain A of FN (EDB); these are associated with, e.g., tissue remodeling, fibroblast differentiation, inflammation, and tumor progression. Fibronectin also serves as a target for a large number of bacterial proteins, and as part of a 3-component bridge (FN, integrin and FN-binding proteins - FnBPs) it contributes to bacterial  of endothelial and epithelial cells. Fibronectin has been identified in sepsis in humans as a negative acute-phase protein, and a low level of FN seems to be a marker of a poor prognosis for a patient. Here, the role of FN in inflammatory processes and sepsis is presented.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649166>MAIT cells are imprinted by the microbiota in early life and promote tissue repair.</a></h2><p>How early-life  and subsequent exposure to the microbiota affect long-term tissue immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the microbiota and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This process can promote the evolution of self-fertilization, but implicating historical processes as drivers of trait evolution is often difficult and requires an explicit model of biogeographic history. In plants, contemporary limits to outcrossing are often invoked as evolutionary drivers of self-fertilization, but historical expansions may shape mating system diversity, with leading-edge populations evolving elevated selfing ability. In a widespread plant, , we identified a glacial refugium in the southern Appalachian Mountains from spatial patterns of genetic drift among 24 populations. Populations farther from this refugium have smaller effective sizes and fewer rare alleles. They also displayed elevated heterosis in among-population crosses, reflecting the accumulation of deleterious mutations during range expansion. Although populations with elevated heterosis had reduced segregating mutation load, the magnitude of inbreeding depression lacked geographic pattern. The ability to self-fertilize was strongly positively correlated with the distance from the refugium and mutation accumulation-a pattern that contrasts sharply with contemporary mate and pollinator limitation. In this and other species, diversity in sexual systems may reflect the legacy of evolution in small, colonizing populations, with little or no relation to the ecology of modern populations.© 2019 The Author(s).

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut , facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic.

Although mutations in genes of the head ontogenetic program have been reported, many cases remain unexplained. Head dysgenesis has also been related to trisomy or amplification of the chromosomal region overlapping the CDX2 homeobox gene, a master element of the trunk ontogenetic program. Hence, we investigated the repercussion on head morphogenesis of the imbalance between the head and trunk ontogenetic programs, by means of ectopic rostral expression of CDX2 at gastrulation. This caused severe malformations affecting the forebrain and optic structures, and also the frontonasal process associated with defects in neural crest cells . These malformations are the result of the downregulation of genes of the head program together with the abnormal induction of trunk program genes.

While diadromy may promote gene flow leading to a lack of genetic differentiation among populations, resident populations tend to be affected by local adaptation and/or plasticity. Studies on these effects on genomic divergence in non-model amphidromous species are scarce. Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widespread fish species in the Southern Hemisphere, exhibits two life histories, an ancestral diadromous, specifically, amphidromous form and a derived freshwater resident form. We examined the genetic diversity and divergence among 20 estuarine and resident populations across the Chilean distribution of G. maculatus and assessed the extent to which selection is involved in the differentiation among resident populations. We obtained nearly 4400 SNP markers using a RADcap approach for 224 individuals. As expected, collections from estuarine locations typically consist of diadromous individuals. Diadromous populations are highly differentiated from their resident counterparts by both neutral and putative adaptive markers. While diadromous populations exhibit high gene flow and lack site fidelity, resident populations appear to be the product of different  events with relatively low genetic diversity and varying levels of gene flow. In particular, the northernmost resident populations were clearly genetically distinct and reproductively isolated from each other suggesting local adaptation.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various  conditions such as bacterial concentrations,  time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations,  time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate,  efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses.

Recently, these natural approaches, which are based on surface nanotopography, have been mimicked to fabricate a modern antibacterial surface.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial  was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Antibiotic resistant infections disproportionately affect those with immunocompromising conditions, chronic , and frequent antibiotic use such as transplant patients or those with cystic fibrosis. However, clinicians lack the diagnostic tools to confidently diagnose and treat infections, leading to widespread use of empiric broad spectrum antimicrobials, often for prolonged duration.A 22 year-old Caucasian female with cystic fibrosis received a bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation 5 months prior to the index hospitalization. She underwent routine surveillance bronchoscopy and was admitted for post-procedure fever. A clear cause of infection was not identified by routine methods. Imaging and bronchoscopic lung biopsy did not identify an infectious agent or rejection. She was treated with a prolonged course of antimicrobials targeting known colonizing organisms from prior bronchoalveolar lavage cultures (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus). However, we identified Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in two independent whole blood samples using direct-pathogen sequencing, which was not identified by other methods.This case represents a common clinical conundrum: identification of infection in a high-risk, complex patient. Here, direct-pathogen sequencing identified a pathogen that would not otherwise have been identified by common techniques. Had results been clinically available, treatment could have been customized, avoiding a prolonged course of broad spectrum antimicrobials that would only exacerbate resistance.

Despite increasing isolation of degradative microorganisms from e-waste contaminated environments, the mechanisms underlying their adaptive evolution in such habitats remain unclear. Sphingomonads generally have xenobiotic-degrading ability and may play important roles in bioremediation.  C1, characterized with superior cell surface hydrophobicity, was recently isolated from e-waste contaminated river sediment. To dissect the mechanisms driving its adaptive evolution, we evaluated its stress resistance, sequenced its genome and performed comparative genomic analysis with 19 other  strains. Strain C1 can feed on several kinds of e-waste-derived xenobiotics, exhibits a great resistance to heavy metals and possesses a high  ability. It harbors abundant genes involved in environmental adaptation, some of which are intrinsic prior to experiencing e-waste contamination. The extensive genomic variations between strain C1 and other  strains, numerous C1-unique genes, massive mobile elements and frequent genome rearrangements reflect a high genome plasticity. Positive selection, gene duplication, and especially horizontal gene transfer drive the adaptive evolution of strain C1. Moreover, presence of type IV secretion systems may allow strain C1 to be a source of beneficial genes for surrounding microorganisms.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AM fungi isolated from naturally occurring Al acidic soils in conferring host tolerance to Al toxicity in 3 wheat cultivars differing in Al sensitivity. The experiment was conducted in a soil-less substrate (vermiculite/perlite, 2:1, v/v) using two Al -tolerant genotypes and one Al -sensitive wheat genotype. The wheat was colonized with a consortium of AM fungi isolated from an andisol, with or without Al at a concentration of 200 μM.The wheat response to Al in the medium was dependent on both the plant genotype and AM . The benefits of the AM fungi to the wheat cultivars included an increased P concentration and relatively low Al accumulation in the plants. This was achieved through two mechanisms. First, the metal chelating capacity of the AM fungi was clear in some cultivars ('Tukan' and 'Porfiado'), in which the enhanced extraradical mycelium development was able to retain Al in the glomalin and hyphae. Second, the increased AM-induced acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of the other cultivar ('Atlas 66') increased host nutrition possibly by hyphae-mediated nutrient uptake and GRSP CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the role of AM fungi in cultivar-specific Al detoxification can be achieved by increased extraradical mycelial filters and enhanced bioavailability of the host rhizosphere P.

In the moss, Physcomitrella patens, a 3D leafy gametophore originates from filamentous cells that grow in a two-dimensional (2D) plane through a series of asymmetric cell divisions. Asymmetric cell divisions that coincide with different cell division planes and growth directions enable the developmental switch from 2D to 3D, but insights into the underlying mechanisms coordinating this switch are still incomplete. Using 2D-, 3D-imaging and image segmentation, we characterized two geometric cues, the width of the initial cell and the angle of the transition division plane, which sufficiently distinguished a gametophore initial cell from a branch initial cell. These identified cues were further confirmed in gametophore formation mutants. The identification of a fluorescent marker allowed us to successfully predict the gametophore initial cell with more than 90% accuracy before morphological changes, supporting our hypothesis that, before the transition division, parental cells of the gametophore initials possess different properties compared to branch initials.

Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner microbiota through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial  necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts? How much and by what practices and strategies can these symbioses be managed, applied, and directed to achieve the goal of a better sustainable viticulture? By thoroughly reviewing the available literature in the field and critically examining the data and perspectives, the above issues are discussed.Copyright © 2019 Pacifico, Squartini, Crucitti, Barizza, Lo Schiavo, Muresu, Carimi and Zottini.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650733>Prevalence and Risk Factors for Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase-Producing   in Intensive Care Units.</a></h2><p>Active surveillance culture (ASC) can help detect hidden reservoirs, but the routine use of ASC for extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing  is controversial in an endemic situation. We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing  (EBSL-Kpn)  among intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients. Prospective screening of ESBL-Kpn  was performed for ICU-admitted patients within 48 hours for two months. A perirectal swab sample was inoculated on MacConkey agar supplemented with 2 μg/mL ceftazidime. ESBL genotype was determined by PCR-sequencing, and clonal relatedness was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The risk factors of ESBL-Kpn  were evaluated. The ESBL-Kpn  rate among the 281 patients at ICU admission was 6.4% (18/281), and  was detected in all isolates. ESBL producers also showed resistance to fluoroquinolone (38.9%, 7/18). All isolates had the same ESBL genotype () and a highly clustered PFGE pattern, suggesting cross-transmission without a documented outbreak. In univariate analysis, the risk factor for ESBL-Kpn  over the control was the length of hospital stay (odds ratio=1.062; =0.019). Routine use of ASC could help control endemic ESBL-Kpn for ICU patients.© The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605691>Predominantly Antibiotic-resistant Intestinal Microbiome Persists in Patients With Pouchitis Who Respond to Antibiotic Therapy.</a></h2><p>Pouchitis that develops in patients with ulcerative colitis after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis is usually treated with antibiotics. Some patients have recurrence of flares, or become antibiotic dependent, and require repeated courses or prolonged periods of antibiotic therapy. We investigated microbial factors associated with response to antibiotic treatment and development of antibiotic dependence in patients with pouchitis.We performed a prospective study of 49 patients who had undergone pouch surgery at a tertiary center in Israel. Disease activity was determined based on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. Pouch phenotype was defined as recurrent acute pouchitis (n=6), chronic pouchitis and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (n=27), normal pouch from patient with ulcerative colitis (n=10), and normal pouch from patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (n=6). Fecal samples (n=234) were collected over time during or in the absence of antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole). Thirty-three patients were treated with antibiotics, for a median of 425 days of cumulative antibiotic therapy, during follow up. Calprotectin was measured and fecal DNA was sequenced using shotgun metagenomics and analyzed with specifically designed bioinformatic pipelines. Bacterial strains were isolated from fecal samples. We assessed their ciprofloxacin resistance and ability to induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by human intestinal epithelial cells HT-29.Most antibiotic-treated patients (79%) had a clinical response to each course of antibiotics. However, 89% of those who completed a 4-weeks course relapsed within 3 months. Median calprotectin levels decreased by 40% in response to antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment reduced disease-associated bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but also beneficial species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The microbiomes of antibiotic-responsive patients were dominated by facultative anaerobic genera (Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus), with multiple ciprofloxacin-resistance mutations in drug target genes and confirmed drug resistance. However, these strains had lower potential for virulence and did not induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells. After antibiotic cessation, patients had an abrupt shift in microbiome composition, with blooms of oral and disease-associated bacteria. In addition, antibiotic treatment enriched for strains that acquired multidrug resistance loci, encoding enzymes that confer resistance to non-related antibiotics including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of pouchitis might be attributed to the establishment of antibiotic-resistant microbiome with low inflammatory potential. This microbiome might provide resistance against  by bacteria that promote inflammation. To avoid progression to antibiotic-dependent disease and its consequences, strategies such as short-term alternating antibiotics and nutrition- and microbiome-based interventions should be considered.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with  mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with  are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of  lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of  interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in  lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts  spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial  of the xylem network and consequent wilting. Though apparently unrelated to the resistance phenotype of  lines, we also demonstrate that the effector WtsE is essential for  xylem dissemination, show evidence for a nutritional immunity response to  that alters xylem sap composition, and present the first analysis of maize transcriptional responses to  infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600299>Synbiotic supplementation to decrease Salmonella  in the intestine and carcass contamination in broiler birds.</a></h2><p>In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to study the effects of synbiotic supplementation on Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis (SE) proliferation, cecal content load, and broiler carcass contamination. Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici culture supernatants decreased (P < 0.05) the in vitro proliferation of SE at 1:1 supernatant: pathogen dilution. A total of 240 Cobb-500 broiler chicks were randomly allotted to three treatment groups (8 replicates/group with 10 birds/replicate): control (basal diet), antibiotic (Virginiamycin at 20 mg/kg feed), synbiotic (PoultryStar® ME at 0.5 g/kg feed containing L. reuteri, E. faecium, B. animalis, P. acidilactici and a Fructooligosaccharide) from day of hatch. At 21 d of age, all birds in experimental groups were orally inoculated with 250 μl of 1 X 109 CFU SE. Antibiotic supplementation increased (P < 0.05) body weight and feed consumption, compared to the control group. Birds in the synbiotic supplementation had intermediate body weight and feed consumption that were not significantly different from both the control and antibiotic group at 42 d of age in SE infected birds. No significant effects were observed in feed efficiency at 42 d of age among the groups. Antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) SE load in cecal contents by 0.90 and 0.85 log units/ g and carcass SE load by 1.4 and 1.5 log units/mL of rinsate compared to the control group at 42 d of age (21 dpi). The relative abundance of IL-10, IL-1, TLR-4, and IFNγ mRNA was decreased (P < 0.05) in the antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation groups compared to the control birds at 42 d of age (21 dpi). It can be concluded that synbiotic supplementation decreased SE proliferation in vitro and decreased SE load in the cecal contents and broiler carcass.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617040>Dual  of Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycotina fungi in the basal liverwort, Haplomitrium mnioides (Haplomitriopsida).</a></h2><p>In general, Glomeromycotina was thought to be the earliest fungi forming mycorrhiza-like structure (MLS) in land plant evolution. In contrast, because the earliest divergent lineage of extant land plants, i.e. Haplomitriopsida liverworts, associates only with Mucoromycotina mycobionts, recent studies suggested that those fungi are novel candidates for the earliest mycobionts. Therefore, Mucoromycotina-Haplomitriopsida association currently attracts attention as an ancient mycorrhiza-like association. However, mycobionts were identified in only 7 of 16 Haplomitriopsida species and the mycobionts diversity of this lineage is largely unclarified. To clarify the taxonomic composition of mycobionts in Haplomitriopsida, we observed MLSs in the rhizome of Haplomitrium mnioides (Haplomitriopsida), the Asian representative Haplomitriopsida species, and conducted molecular identification of mycobionts. It was recorded for the first time that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina co-occur in Haplomitriopsida as mycobionts. Significantly, the arbuscule-like branching (ALB) of Glomeromycotina was newly described. As the Mucoromycotina fungi forming MLSs in H. mnioides, Endogonaceae and Densosporaceae were detected, in which size differences of hyphal swelling (HS) were found between the fungal families. This study provides a novel evidence in the MLS of Haplomitriopsida, i.e. the existence of Glomeromycotina association as well as the dominant Mucoromycotina association. In addition, since hyphal characteristics of the HS-type MLS were quite similar to those of fine endophytes (FE) of Endogonales in other bryophytes and vascular plants previously described, this MLS is suggested to be included in FE. These results suggest that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina were acquired concurrently as the mycobionts by the earliest land plants evolved into arbuscular mycorrhizae and FE. Therefore, dual association of Haplomitriopsida, with Endogonales and Glomeromycotina will provide us novel insight on how the earliest land plants adapted to terrestrial habitats with fungi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615871>Bone Tropism in Cancer Metastases.</a></h2><p>Bone is a frequent site of metastases in many cancers.

The use of autologous tissues or cells will reduce immune rejection and increase the stability of the fillers, while increasing the absorbability of filling materials. To establish a durable and safe filling material, we herein combined acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with autologous dermal cells and tested the performance of this matrix in wound healing and shaping.To prepare the ADM, stratified skin was obtained from the back of two New Zealand rabbits and decellularized to obtain ADM. The ADM was ultrasonically mixed with as-prepared autologous dermis in vitro. The mixture was injected as a subcutaneous filler into the back area of 20 New Zealand rabbits. In this procedure, different concentration ratios of the mixture were injected, and the volume change of the filler was measured and categorized into five groups. At 4 months and 8 months after filling, samples were obtained for quantitative evaluation of the thickness and vessel density, as well as qualitative evaluation of .Examination of the ADM conformed that the matrix had no cells. ADM and the prepared autologous dermis were evenly mixed, and the filler was gradually absorbed. The comprehensive evaluation of ADM and autologous dermis mixture showed that group C had the best filling effect with the least infiltration of inflammatory cells and the highest vascular density compared to A, B, D and E groups in the study.When combined at the ratio of 50%:50%, the autologous dermis combined and acellular dermal matrix showed better performance compared to the other four different ratios in this study. This implies that this combination is potentially safer, effective and stable as a filling material compared to ADM or dermal matrix alone.This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The development of infection-resistant, osteoblast-compatible biomaterials could represent an effective strategy to prevent bacterial  of implants, reducing the need for antibiotics. In this study, the widely used biomaterial titanium was functionalized with BMAP27(1-18), an α-helical cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that retains potent staphylocidal activity when immobilized on agarose beads. A derivative bearing a short spacer with a free thiol at the N-terminus was coupled to silanized titanium disks via thiol-maleimide chemistry. Tethering was successful, as assessed by Contact angle, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with an average surface mass density of 456 ng/cm and a layer thickness of 3 nm. The functionalized titanium displayed antimicrobial properties against a reference strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis with well-known biofilm forming capability. Reduction of bacterial counts and morphological alterations of adhering bacteria, upon 2 h incubation, indicate a rapid contact-killing effect. The immobilized peptide was not toxic to osteoblasts, which adhered and spread better on functionalized titanium when co-cultured with bacteria, compared to non-coated surfaces. Results suggest that functionalization of titanium with BMAP27(1-18) could be promising for prevention of bacterial  in bone graft applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Group 1 was defined as the control group and group 2 was defined as the infected control group. Groups 3 and 4 were defined as Dacron grafted and MRSE infected groups, treated with tigecycline and MSCs, respectively. Groups 5 and 6 were performed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft and infected with MRSE. These groups were also administered tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Groups 7 and 8 were infected with MRSE without graft administration and were also performed tigecycline and MSC treatment, respectively. Grafts and soft tissue specimens were collected at 13 days postoperatively. Colony counts of peri-graft tissue were performed. All samples were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the markers that determine stem cell activity.The overall success of the treatments was assessed by the number of rats with MRSE recurrence, regardless of graft used. The difference between the untreated group 2, tigecycline groups (3, 5 and 7) and MSCs groups (4, 6 and 8) were statistically significant. Success of MSC and tigecycline treatments was similar in Dacron, PTFE, and non-grafted groups. There was a resistance of MRSE infection in Dacron groups to MSC and tigecycline treatments. This was considered to be indicative of the susceptibility of the Dacron grafts to infection. However, there was no significant difference between group 2 and Dacron groups in terms of bacterial .

Further, fruit waxing is a common practice in wholesale cucumber to preserve the water content of fruit and prolong shelf-life, but its impact on epiphytic microbiota is not well studied. This study investigated the survival of Salmonella Newport and S. Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen . Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During pregnancy, the female body undergoes unique hormonal changes that contribute to weight gain as well as modulations in immune function that can affect microbiota composition. Several studies have described the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women from the USA, Europe and Mexico. Here we expand our knowledge about the vaginal microbial communities during the third trimester to healthy expectant Brazilian mothers. Vaginal samples were collected from patients delivering at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Microbial DNA was isolated from samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the PGM Ion Torrent. Brazilian pregnant women presented three distinct types of microbial community at the time of labor. Two microbial communities, Cluster 1 and Cluster 3, presented an overall dominance of Lactobacillus while Cluster 2 tended to present higher diversity and richness, with the presence of Pseudomonas, Prevotella and other vaginosis related bacteria. About half of the Brazilian mothers sampled here had dominance of L. iners. The proportion of mothers without dominance of any Lactobacillus was higher in Brazil (22%) compared to UK (2.4%) and USA, where this community type was not detected. The vaginal microbiota showed significant correlation with the composition of the babies' gut microbiota (p-value = 0.002 with a R of 15.8%).

We prospectively recruited 177 adult patients undergoing LT at a single tertiary care center. 16 S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing was performed on 723 fecal samples collected pre-LT and periodically until one-year post-LT to test whether MDRB  was associated with decreased microbiome diversity. In multivariate linear mixed-effect models, MDRB  predicts reduced Shannon α-diversity, after controlling for underlying liver disease, antibiotic exposures, and clinical complications. Importantly, pre-LT microbial markers predict subsequent  by MDRB. Our results suggest MDRB  as a major, previously unrecognized, marker of persistent dysbiosis.

Sixteen supergroups have been described from different host taxa. Four supergroups A, B, M, and N were found in aphids according to prior studies. The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, are typical polyphagous species with global distributions. We conducted an extensive and systematic survey of Wolbachia infections in these aphids from China. High incidences of Wolbachia infection were detected. The total infection incidence was 60% in A. gossypii and 88% in M. persicae. Both aphid species were infected with supergroups A, B and M. Different incidences of infection were observed among the seven geographical regions in China, which suggested a positive relationship between Wolbachia infections and the geographical distribution of aphid species. Furthermore, multiple infection patterns (M, B, A&M, B&M, and A&B&M) were observed. Infection patterns M and B&M were detected in almost all populations. Patterns A&B&M and B showed geographical restriction in North China. Three factors can possibly influence the Wolbachia infection incidences and patterns: the geographical distribution, aphid species, and different supergroup types.© The Author(s) 2019.

Deletion of gL detargets the virus from Eph family receptors. The ability of this gL-minus Gag recombinant RRV to infect, persist, and elicit immune responses was evaluated after intravenous inoculation of two  RRV-naïve rhesus monkeys. Both monkeys responded with an anti-RRV antibody response, and quantitation of RRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by real time PCR revealed levels similar to those in monkeys infected with recombinant gL+ RRV. Comparison of RRV DNA levels in sorted CD3+ vs. CD20+ vs. CD14+ PBMC subpopulations indicated infection of the CD20+ subpopulation by the gL-minus RRV. This contrasts with results obtained with transformed B cell lines  where deletion of gL resulted in markedly reduced infectivity. Over a period of 20 weeks Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses were documented by major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) tetramer staining. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses, which were predominantly directed against the Mamu-A*01-restricted Gag(181-189)CM9 epitope, could be inhibited by blockade of MHC-I presentation. Our results indicate that gL and the interaction with Eph family receptors is dispensable for the  of the B cell compartment following high-dose infection by the intravenous route, which suggests the existence of alternative receptors. Further, gL-minus RRV elicits cellular immune responses that are predominantly canonical in nature. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with a substantial disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, often in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) has shown potential as a vector to immunize monkeys with antigens from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the macaque model for HIV. KSHV and RRV engage cellular receptors from the Eph family via the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex. We have now generated a recombinant RRV that expresses the SIV Gag antigen and does not express gL. This recombinant RRV was infectious by the intravenous route, established persistent infection in the B cell compartment, and elicited strong immune responses to the SIV Gag antigen. These results argue against a role of gL and Eph family receptors for B cell infection by RRV  and have implications for the development of a live-attenuated KSHV vaccine or vaccine vector.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595388>Breast cancer cells expressing cancer-associated sialyl-Tn antigen have less capacity to develop osteolytic lesions in a mouse model of skeletal .</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in women, and approximately 75-80% of patients with advanced breast cancer develop bone metastasis. Expression of the cancer-associated carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (STn) in breast cancer is associated with a poor prognosis; however, involvement of STn in the development of metastatic bone lesions remains unclear. We investigated whether STn expression on breast cancer cells influences intraosseous tumor growth and bone response in mice models of skeletal . STn-positive (STn) breast cancer cells were generated by stable transfection of an expression vector encoding ST6GaLNAc I into the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Parental MDA-MB-231 cells not expressing STn antigen were used as STn-negative (STn) breast cancer cells. Contrary to expectations, STn expression attenuated the development of destructive bone lesions in the in vivo mice models. An in vitro study demonstrated that STn expression impaired adhesion of MDA-MB-231cells to bone marrow stromal cells. This finding in vitro was also confirmed by another breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen was also impaired in STn MDA-MB-231 cells compared to that in STn MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting integrin dysfunction. Given that the integrin β1 subunit is the main carrier of the STn epitope, it is likely that changes in glycan structure impaired the adhesive capacity of β1 integrin in the bone environment, leading to attenuation of tumor cell engraftment. In conclusion, breast cancer cells expressing STn antigen had less capacity for skeletal , possibly due to impaired adhesive capability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642093>HCN-producing Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 affects intraradical viability of Rhizophagus irregularis in Sorghum vulgare roots.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria inhabit the plant rhizosphere.

As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut microbiota via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal  ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut microbiota include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods. Further studies and reviews are needed regarding the effects of glutamine supplementation on other conditions in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602460>Laboratory Rearing of Culicoides stellifer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), a Suspected Vector of Orbiviruses in the United States.</a></h2><p>Laboratory rearing procedures of Culicoides stellifer Coquillett (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were evaluated with an aim towards  of this species. Eggs collected from field-collected gravid females were placed on 0.25% agar slants and given a diet of 1) nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus Linnaeus), 2) nematodes + lactalbumin and yeast (LY), 3) microbes from nematode medium, and 4) tap water (autoclaved). Complete larval development to adult stage occurred only in two treatments: 1) nematodes and 2) nematodes + LY. Culicoides stellifer larvae could not survive beyond 1 wk on a diet of microbes alone or in the sterile water treatment. Larval survival rates were high using nematode diet (79.2 ± 11.3% [mean ± SE]) but were slightly lower in the nematode + LY group (66.5 ± 19.6%). Larval stage lasted ~21 d in both treatments. Sex ratio of F1 adults was ~1:1 (M:F) using nematode diet but was male biased (~2:1) with nematode + LY diet. These findings collectively suggest that a microbial community is required for midge larvae, either to support invertebrate prey base or as a potential food source. But in the present study, the supplied microbes alone were not sufficient to support midge survival/development. It appears that other nutritional components may also be essential to support the larval survival/development of C. stellifer. Overall, a simple diet of bacterial feeding nematodes and their associated microorganisms can be used to rear C. stellifer larvae under laboratory conditions. However, captive mating in F1 adults poses a major obstacle for successful  of this species currently.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, these processes have not been studied and linked in the microevolutionary context of breeding for improved disease resistance. We hypothesized that broad-spectrum disease resistance alleles also affect  by non-pathogenic symbionts. ●Quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to multiple fungal pathogens were introgressed into a disease-susceptible maize inbred line. Bacterial and fungal leaf microbiomes of the resulting near-isogenic lines were compared to the microbiome of the disease-susceptible parent line at two timepoints in multiple fields. ●Introgression of QTL from disease-resistant lines strongly shifted the relative abundance of diverse fungal and bacterial taxa in both 3-week-old and 7-week-old plants. Nevertheless, the effects on overall community structure and diversity were minor and varied among fields and years. Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and microbiome succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. ●These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf microbiome in maize.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611409>  and persistence in a primate model.</a></h2><p> is associated with aggressive periodontitis resulting in premature tooth loss in adolescents.

The deterioration of a given material often incurs irreparable losses in terms of uniqueness and historical value. Hence preventive actions should be taken. One important challenge is to identify microbes involved in the biodeterioration process. In this study, we analyzed the microbial diversity of an ancient architectonical structure of the Rotunda of Sts. Felix and Adauctus, which is a part of the Wawel Royal Castle located in Krakow, Poland. The Rotunda is unavailable to tourists and could be treated as an extreme habitat due to the low content of nutrients coming either from sandstone plates bound with lime mortar or air movement. Microbial diversity was analyzed with the use of the high-throughput sequencing of marker genes corresponding to fragments of 16S rDNA (for Bacteria) and ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2) (for Fungi). The results showed that the microbial community adhered to wall surfaces is, to a large extent, endemic. Furthermore, alongside many microorganisms that could be destructive to masonry and mortar (e.g., , ), there were also bacteria, such as species of genera , , and , that can positively affect wall surface properties by reducing the damage caused by the presence of other microorganisms. We also showed that airborne microorganisms probably have little impact on the biodeterioration process as their abundance in the microbial community adhered to the ancient walls was very low.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652281>Shift in trophic niches of soil microarthropods with conversion of tropical rainforest into plantations as indicated by stable isotopes (15N, 13C).</a></h2><p>Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide, affecting above and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches. However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (δ15N values), to changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that  of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647840>Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and expression of GFP in Ascochyta lentis to characterize ascochyta blight disease progression in lentil.</a></h2><p>The plant immune system is made up of a complex response network that involves several lines of defense to fight invading pathogens. Fungal plant pathogens on the other hand, have evolved a range of ways to infect their host. The interaction between Ascochyta lentis and two lentil genotypes was explored to investigate the progression of ascochyta blight (AB) in lentils. In this study, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for A. lentis by constructing a new binary vector, pATMT-GpdGFP, for the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Green fluorescence was used as a highly efficient vital marker to study the developmental changes in A. lentis during AB disease progression on the susceptible and resistant lentil accessions, ILL6002 and ILL7537, respectively. The initial infection stages were similar in both the resistant and susceptible accessions where A. lentis uses infection structures such as germ tubes and appressoria to gain entry into the host while the host uses defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen entry. Penetration was observed at the junctions between neighbouring epidermal cells and occasionally, through the stomata. The pathogen attempted to penetrate and colonize ILL7537, but further fungal advancement appeared to be halted, and A. lentis did not enter the mesophyll. Successful entry and  of ILL6002 coincided with structural changes in A. lentis and the onset of necrotic lesions 5-7 days post inoculation. Once inside the leaf, A. lentis continued to grow, colonizing all parts of the leaf followed by plant cell collapse. Pycnidia-bearing spores appeared 14 days post inoculation, which marks the completion of the infection cycle. The use of fluorescent proteins in plant pathogenic fungi together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, provide a valuable tool to study the intracellular dynamics,  strategy and infection mechanisms during plant-pathogen interaction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624854>Short-term dialysis catheter versus central venous catheter infections in ICU patients: a post hoc analysis of individual data of 4 multi-centric randomized trials.</a></h2><p>Little is known on catheter-related infections associated with short-term dialysis catheters (DC). Recommendations for infection prevention are mostly derived from those related to central venous catheters (CVC). A comparison of infectious risk of DCs and CVCs would be instrumental for improving infection control prevention strategies. This study aimed to describe differences in infectious risk between DC and CVC.We used individual data from 4 multicenter randomized controlled trials in intensive care units (ICUs) that evaluated various prevention strategies regarding , major catheter-related infections (MCRI) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI). We selected only catheters with non-chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated dressings. A marginal Cox model for clustered data was used for the evaluation of the daily hazard rate for catheter-tip , MCRI and CR-BSI.We included 3029 patients and 4148 catheters (31,547 catheter-days) which comprised 1872 DCs and 2276 CVCs. After adjustment on confounders, we identified an increased risk in DC compared to CVC for  (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03-2.04, p = 0.04) and for MCRI (HR 2.97, 95% CI 1.03-8.51, p = 0.04) in the first 7 days of catheter maintenance. The daily hazard rate for  and MCRI was generally higher for DC in the first catheter-days, whereas it was similar between DC and CVC for longer catheterizations.The daily risk of  and MCRI was significantly higher in DC compared to CVC within the first 7 days of catheter maintenance.

Isolated germinated spores did not colonize pear roots. Inoculum composed of R. irregularis spores/mycelium associated with chicory root fragments was used to inoculate Medicago truncatula which became thereafter the MDP of pear plantlets. Typical intraradical structures (hyphae, arbuscules, spores/vesicles) and appressoria were observed in the pear roots. During acclimatization, the pear plants formed a densely branched root system.

Despite the excellent microbe-inhibitory effect of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based coatings, marine bacteria could still attach to surfaces and form natural biofilms. However, there is little information available on the common structural features of pioneer surface-biofilm bacteria (PSB) communities on different PDMS-based coatings with regard to their compositions, distributions and diversity. Herein, the present study aims to explore the compositional and structural features of the PSB communities on different PDMS-based coatings using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in terms of the taxonomic structures at phylum, family and genus level. The results revealed the PSB communities on different PDMS-based coatings possessed high similarities in compositional, structural and diversity features, but varied greatly in relative abundance and distributions. Proteobacteria was the most diverse and overwhelming phylum in biofilms formed on all PDMS-based coatings, followed by Cyanobacteria. In addition, the decreased abundance of Proteobacteria and the increased abundance of Cyanobacteria on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-modifed PDMS composites (CPCs) may contribute to their differential anti-biofouling effect against the  of juvenile macrofoulers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we propose a model approach to evaluate environmental conditions and species features to predict niche changes in non-equilibrium contexts. It incorporates potentially range-limiting processes (fundamental niche), hence allowing for better predictions of range shifts, differentiation of analog and non-analog conditions between the native and non-native (invaded) ranges, and identification of environmental conditions not currently available but likely in the future. We apply our approach with the worldwide invasive slider-turtle .We estimated the native and non-native realized niches of  and built its fundamental niche based on key features of the turtle's temperature physiological tolerance limits and survival-associated factors. We next estimated response functions adjusted to the physiological predictor variables and estimated habitat suitability values, followed by a comprehensive set of analyses and simulations to compare the environmental conditions occupied by  (at its native and non-native ranges).Climatic space analysis showed that the 's non-native realized niche is 28.6% greater than the native one. Response curves showed that it does not use its entire range of temperature tolerances (density curves for native: 5.3-23.7 °C and non-native: 1.7-28.4 °C ranges). Whether considering the mean temperature of the warmest or the coldest quarter, it occupies a wider range of temperatures along its non-native distribution. Results of the response curves for worldwide (global) and across Mexico (regional) comparisons showed it occupies analog and non-analog conditions between its native and invaded ranges, exhibiting also unoccupied suitable climatic conditions.We demonstrate that  occupies a wider subset of its fundamental niche along its non-native range (within its physiological tolerances), revealing that the species observed niche shift corresponds to a different subset of its fundamental niche (niche unfilling). We also identified suitable environmental conditions, globally and regionally, where the slider turtle could potentially invade. Our approach allows to accurately predict niche changes in novel or non-equilibrium contexts, which can improve our understanding about ecological aspects and geographic range boundaries in current and potential invasions.©2019 Espindola et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600710>Mycorrhizal symbiosis down-regulates or does not change root aquaporin expression in trifoliate orange under drought stress.</a></h2><p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas absorb water from soil to host plants, while the relationship between mycorrhizas and aquaporins (AQPs, membrane water channel proteins, which function in water transport) in mycorrhizal plants is unclear. In this study, Funneliformis mosseae-colonized trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings were grown in pots fitted with 37-μm nylon meshes at the bottom of each pot to allow mycorrhizal hyphae absorb water from an outer beaker. The expression of seven plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) genes, six tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) genes, and four nodulin-26 like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) genes were analyzed in roots of both well-watered (WW) and drought stressed (DS) plants. The six-week DS plants dramatically increased hyphal water absorption rate by 1.4 times, as compared with WW plants. Mycorrhizal plants exhibited greater plant growth performance, leaf water status (water potential and relative water content), and gas exchange under both WW and DS conditions. Mycorrhizal inoculation induced diverse expression patterns in these AQPs under WW: up-regulation of PtNIP1;1, PtPIP2;1, and PtPIP2;5, down-regulation of PtNIP1;2, PtNIP6;1, PtPIP1;2, PtPIP1;5, PtPIP2;8, PtTIP1;1, PtTIP1;2, PtTIP1;3, and PtTIP5;1, and no changes in other AQPs.

Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens.

Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium  in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria.

Whole RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a promising source of novel biomarkers for early MAP infection and disease progression in cattle. Since the blood transcriptome is widely used as a source of biomarkers, we analyzed whether it recapitulates, at least in part, the transcriptome of the ileocecal valve (ICV), the primary site of MAP . Total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood (PB) and ICV samples, and RNA-Seq was used to compare gene expression between animals with focal or diffuse histopathological lesions in gut tissues versus control animals with no detectable signs of infection. Our results demonstrated both shared, and PB and ICV-specific gene expression in response to a natural MAP infection. As expected, the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes was larger in the ICV than in the PB samples. Among the DE genes in the PB and ICV samples, there were some common genes irrespective of the type of lesion including the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8/IL8), apolipoprotein L (APOLD1), and the interferon inducible protein 27 (IFI27). The biological processes (BP) enriched in the PB gene expression profiles from the cows with diffuse lesions included the killing of cells of other organism, defense response, immune response and the regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis. Two of these BP, the defense and immune response, were also enriched in the ICV from the cows with diffuse lesions. Metabolic analysis of the DE genes revealed that the N-glycan biosynthesis, bile secretion, one-carbon pool by folate and purine metabolism were significantly enriched in the ICV from the cows with focal lesions. In the ICV from cows with diffuse lesions; the valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation route, purine metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption and the cholesterol routes were enriched. Some of the identified DE genes, BP and metabolic pathways will be studied further to develop novel diagnostic tools, vaccines and immunotherapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659300>Generation of protective pneumococcal-specific nasal resident memory CD4 T cells via parenteral immunization.</a></h2><p>The generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (T) is an essential aspect of immunity at mucosal surfaces, and it has been suggested that preferential generation of T is one of the principal advantages of mucosally administered vaccines. We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined.

These molecules controlling immune barriers can potentially be used as novel tools for plant protection, which mimic natural defense mechanisms against invaders. The constitutive expression in tomato plants of the precursor of the defense peptide systemin was previously demonstrated to increase tolerance against moth larvae and aphids and to hamper the  by phytopathogenic fungi, through the expression of a wealth of defense-related genes. In this work we studied the impact of the exogenous supply of systemin to tomato plants on pests to evaluate the use of the peptide as a tool for crop protection in non-transgenic approaches. By combining gene expression studies and bioassays with different pests we demonstrate that the exogenous supply of systemin to tomato plants enhances both direct and indirect defense barriers. Experimental plants, exposed to this peptide by foliar spotting or root uptake through hydroponic culture, impaired larval growth and development of the noctuid moth  , even across generations, reduced the leaf  by the fungal pathogen  and were more attractive towards natural herbivore antagonists. The induction of these defense responses was found to be associated with molecular and biochemical changes under control of the systemin signalling cascade. Our results indicate that the direct delivery of systemin, likely characterized by a null effect on non-target organisms, represents an interesting tool for the sustainable protection of tomato plants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609709>Use of impregnated catheters to decrease  rates in neonates - a randomized controlled pilot trial.</a></h2><p>Nosocomial infections increase mortality and morbidity in preterm infants.

Despite many prophylactic agents are available the preferred perioperative ocular surface antimicrobial agent is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of preoperative liposomal ozone dispersion in reducing bacterial  from the conjunctival sac and periocular skin in dogs, in comparison with povidone-iodine. Twenty-two owned dogs consisting with 44 eyes in total scheduled for diversified ophthalmic surgery or surgical procedure were enrolled for the study and divided in four groups (ozone eyelid, ozone conjunctiva, fluoroquinolone, placebo) receiving the respective preoperative protocol. A swab was taken before beginning and at the end of the protocol evaluating total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in CFU for total microbial count, coagulase positive and negative staphylococci both for liposomal ozone dispersion and povidone iodine; For group, no statistical difference in median CFU for both one-day placebo and fluoroquinolone preoperative prophylactic topical therapy. The results of the present study demonstrate that liposomal ozone-dispersion is able to reduce preoperative bacterial load in ocular surface at the same strength of povidone iodine.Copyright © 2019.

The Lymphoid Enhancer-binding Factor-1 (LEF1) is an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor that is commonly overexpressed in brain-colonizing cancer cells. Here, we overexpressed LEF1 in an in vivo breast cancer brain  model. It shortened survival, albeit without engaging EMT at the MMPI. By differential proteome analysis, we identified a novel function of LEF1 as a regulator of the glutathione (GSH) system, the principal cellular redox buffer. LEF1 overexpression also conferred resistance against therapeutic GSH depletion during brain  and improved management of intracellular ROS. We conclude that besides EMT, LEF1 facilitates metastasis by improving the anti-oxidative capacity of epithelial breast cancer cells, in particular during  of the brain parenchyma.

The proximity of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is considered to be one of the foremost risk factors for the development of VRSA. This study aimed to determine the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of intestinal co- with VRE and MRSA.A case-control study was conducted in 52-bed intensive care units (ICUs) of a university-affiliated hospital from September 2012 to October 2017. Active surveillance using rectal cultures for VRE were conducted at ICU admission and on a weekly basis. Weekly surveillance cultures for detection of rectal MRSA were also conducted in patients with VRE carriage. Patients with intestinal co- of VRE and MRSA were compared with randomly selected control patients with VRE  alone (1:1). Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for MRSA isolates were determined by the Etest.Of the 4679 consecutive patients, 195 cases and 924 controls were detected. The median monthly incidence and duration of intestinal co- with VRE and MRSA were 2.3/1000 patient-days and 7 days, respectively. The frequency of both MRSA infections and mortality attributable to MRSA were higher in the case group than in the control group: 56.9% vs. 44.1% (P = 0.011) and 8.2% vs. 1.0% (P = 0.002), respectively. Independent risk factors for intestinal co- were enteral tube feeding (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-3.32), metabolic diseases (OR, 1.75; 95% CI 1.05-2.93), male gender (OR, 1.62; 95% CI 1.06-2.50), and Charlson comorbidity index < 3 (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.88-6.94). All MRSA isolates from case patients were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC ≤ 2 mg/L).Our study indicates that intestinal co- of VRE and MRSA occurs commonly among patients in the ICU with MRSA endemicity, which might be associated with poor clinical outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640527>Expression analyses of cave mollies () reveal key genes involved in the early evolution of eye regression.</a></h2><p>Eye regression occurs across cave-dwelling populations of many species and is often coupled with a decrease or loss in eye function. Teleost fishes are among the few vertebrates to undergo widespread  of caves and often exhibit eye regression with blindness. Cave populations of the poeciliid fish  (cave molly) exhibit reduced-albeit functional-eyes, offering the opportunity to investigate partial eye regression. We sequenced eye transcriptomes of cave and surface populations of  to identify differentially expressed genes that potentially underlie eye regression in cave mollies. We identified 28 significantly differentially expressed genes, 20 of which were directly related to light sensitivity, eye structure and visual signaling. Twenty-six of these genes were downregulated in cave compared to surface populations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed eye-related gene ontologies that were under-represented in cave mollies. In addition, a set of co-expressed genes related to vision and circadian rhythm was correlated with habitat type (cave versus surface). Our study suggests that differential gene expression plays a key role in the beginning evolutionary stages of eye regression in , shedding further light on regressive evolution in cavefish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597748>Evaluation of the Direct MacConkey Method for Identification of Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-Negative Organisms from Rectal Swabs: Re-evaluating Zone Diameter Cutoffs.</a></h2><p>The optimal method to screen for gastrointestinal  with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO) has yet to be established. The Direct MacConkey plate method (Direct MAC) demonstrates high sensitivity for CRO detection, but established zone diameter (ZD) criteria for ertapenem (≤27 mm) and meropenem (≤32 mm) result in high rates of false-positives upon confirmatory testing. To increase specificity, we screened for CRO in two high-risk wards using the Direct MAC method, recorded ZDs for each sample, and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the optimal ZD cutoff criteria. Of 6,868 swabs obtained over an 18-month period, 4,766 (69%) had growth on MAC plates and 2,500 (36%) met criteria for further evaluation based on previously established ZDs around the carbapenem disks. A total of 812 (12%) swabs were confirmed positive for at least one CRO, including 213 (3 %) carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO), resulting in a specificity of 78% for the Direct MAC plate. Reducing the ertapenem and meropenem ZDs to ≤25 mm improved specificity to 83%, decreasing the confirmatory testing workload by 32%. The sensitivity with the lower ZD criteria were 89% for CRO and 94% for CPO, respectively. The Direct MAC plate method criteria for CRO testing can be modified to balance the sensitivity and specificity of CRO while reducing the burden on clinical microbiology laboratories. These modifications can be particularly helpful in regions with a low CRO prevalence.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636880>Retrospective Analysis of Microbial  Patterns in Central Venous Catheters, 2013-2017.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to provide epidemiological information on microbial  in central venous catheters (CVCs).CVCs submitted to Medical Microbiology Laboratory from January 1, 2013, through October 1, 2017, which met our criteria would be included for analysis. Quantitative culture was used for CVCs. The results of culture and related information on CVCs were collected and recorded in detail.

Positive microbial culture occurred in 379 catheters with 18.7% (379 of 2020) prevalence of . There were 23 microbial genera and 45 organisms detected. Among the isolated organisms, there were 39 kinds of isolated bacteria and 6 kinds of isolated fungi.  (19.8%) predominated in total isolated microorganisms, followed by  (11.3%) and  (10.3%). There were no significant differences in isolated organisms and fungal species between different sexes (  = 2.365,  = 0.50). Conversely, there were significant differences in isolated bacterial and fungal species between different wards and years (  = 124.046,  = 0.000;   = 77.064,  = 0.000). A total of 107 (5.3%, 107/2020) CVCs were associated with a diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The most common organisms in causing CLABSI were  (23.4%),  (13.1%), and  (12.1%).The prevalence of microbial  in CVCs is still significant and even has gradually changed over time. The study provides a new view of microbial  pattern in CVCs and a prevalence of CLABSI, which will facilitate catheter-related infection prevention and control in clinic.Copyright © 2019 Yu He et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660422>New dataset of foliicolous lichens on leaves of five major species of Dipterocarpaceae in INIKEA forest rehabilitation plot of Borneo.</a></h2><p>Rehabilitation of degraded forest is being intensified in Borneo, effort by the INIKEA Rehabilitation Project in Luasong (Sabah) has resulted in healthy growth of native timber species to Borneo.
