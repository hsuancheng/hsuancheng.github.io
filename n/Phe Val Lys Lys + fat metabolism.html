Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk fat. Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids,  and Thr decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of +Tyr, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, ,  and Thr, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535386>Digestibility of amino acid in full-fat canola seeds, canola meal, and canola expellers fed to broiler chickens and pigs.</a></h2><p>Canola products including full-fat canola seeds (FFCS), canola meal (CM), and canola expellers (CE) have been used in diets for both broiler chickens and pigs. However, their ability to utilize the AA in canola products might be different from each other. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in broiler chickens and growing pigs fed FFCS, CM, and CE. Three diets were prepared to contain FFCS, CM, or CE as a sole source of nitrogen. A nitrogen-free diet was prepared. In Exp. 1, a total of 272 twenty-one-day-old male broiler chickens with an initial BW of 932 ± 80.6 g were assigned to diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of feeding, birds were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital, and ileal digesta samples were collected from distal two-third of the ileum. In Exp. 2, 16 barrows were surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum. After 8-d recovery period, pigs (initial BW = 18.9 ± 1.17 kg) were divided into 4 blocks based on BW and assigned to a quadruplicate 4 × 2 incomplete Latin Square design with 4 diets and 2 periods. Each period consisted of 5-d adaptation and 2-d ileal digesta collection periods. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement with effects of species (broiler chickens or pigs) and diets (FFCS, CM, or CE). There were interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the AID of all indispensable AA except for . The AID of indispensable AA in FFCS for broiler chickens was greater (P < 0.05) than for pigs. Broiler chickens also had greater (P < 0.05) AID of Arg, His, Leu, , and  in CM compared with pigs; however, there were no differences in the AID of indispensable AA in CE between broiler chickens and pigs. The basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA, except Trp, in pigs were greater (P < 0.05) than in broiler chickens. There were also interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the SID of all indispensable AA except for . Broiler chickens fed the diet containing FFCS had greater (P < 0.05) SID of indispensable AA compared with pigs fed the same diet; however, the SID of indispensable AA in CM or CE were not different between broiler chickens and pigs. In conclusion, differences in digestibility of AA in canola products were affected by nonruminant animal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12146486>Evaluation of isoleucine, leucine, and valine as a second-limiting amino acid for milk production in dairy cows fed grass silage diet.</a></h2><p>Five Finnish ruminally cannulated Ayrshire cows were used in a 5 x 5 Latin square trial with 14-d periods to determine whether branched-chain amino acids (AA) are the second- or colimiting AA for milk protein synthesis on grass silage-cereal based diet. Mammary  of AA as well as AA supply from the basal diet were also studied. Grass silage (17.5% crude protein) was given ad libitum with 9 kg/d as a cereal-based concentrate (13.8% crude protein). Treatments were basal diet without AA infusion (Control), abomasal infusion of AA mixture of His, Ile, Leu, and  at 8.5, 14.9,27.9, and 18.3 g/d, respectively, AA mixture minus Ile, AA mixture minus Leu, and AA mixture minus . Glucose was infused on all treatments at 250 g/d. Amino acid infusions had no effect on dry matter intake (mean 19.2 kg/d), yields of milk (mean 25.3 kg/d), energy-corrected milk (mean 25.9 kg/d), milk protein (mean 807 g/d), lactose (mean 1261 g/d), or  (mean 1056 g/d). Milk composition was not affected by the treatments. Plasma concentrations of His and  responded to AA infusions but concentration of Ile increased only on treatment AA mixture minus Leu, and concentration of Leu only on treatment AA mixture minus Ile. Infusion of AA mixture of His, Ile, Leu, and  decreased plasma concentrations of Arg, , Met, , and Tyr. Amino acid infusions did not affect concentrations of plasma urea and energy metabolites or AA utilization by the mammary gland. Based on unchanged production parameters, the supply of His or branched-chain AA seemed not to be limiting under the current dietary conditions. Changes in plasma AA concentrations suggest either antagonism between individual AA in absorption or increased partitioning of AA into the muscle tissues. About 75% of omasal canal nonammonia nitrogen flow (427 g/d) was of microbial origin, and AA profiles of microbial protein and omasal canal digesta were fairly similar. Postruminal AA supply seems to be dependent on the basal diet, but variation may exist even within the similar basal diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668850>Dietary deprivation of each essential amino acid induces differential systemic adaptive responses in mice.</a></h2><p>Dietary deprivation of essential amino acids (EAAs) in mammals is known to cause reductions in food intake and body weight. The aim of this study was to determine whether and how mice respond to deprivation of individual EAA species.Dietary deprivation of any single EAA (not non-EAA) in mice led to progressive weight loss in the order of Ile(-) > (-) > Thr(-) > Leu(-) > Trp(-) > His(-) > (-) > Met(-) > (-) , which correlated with the reduction in food intake. Decreased levels of the deprived EAAs as well as increased levels of all or some of the other amino acids were detected in the serum, although these levels differed among the diets examined. Serum biochemistry identified significant increases in creatine phosphokinase, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and decreases in glucose and triglycerides; computed tomography revealed a marked reduction in abdominal/femoral fat and muscle depots; histology identified diffuse myofiber atrophy in the rectus femoris muscle, all in that approximate order. In contrast, amino acid response, autophagy, and ubiquitination marker genes as well as amino acid transporter genes were induced in both deprived EAA-specific and tissue-specific manners.Dietary deprivation of individual EAAs induced systemic adaptive responses that differed in magnitude and molecular machinery.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A prototype supplement of ruminally protected Met and  was added to the 14% CP diet to provide 0, 50, 100, and 150% of the predicted deficiency of Met and . The DMI; yields of milk, 3.5% FCM, total N, protein N, and whey N; plasma concentrations of Arg, Cit, His, Ile, Leu, Orn, , Pro, Tyr, , and urea N were greater for cows fed the 18% CP diet. Supplementing ruminally protected Met and  to the 14% CP diet did not affect DMI or yields of milk, 3.5% FCM, milk CP, and milk SNF. Milk  yield was affected quadratically because it was greater when 0 or 150% of the deficiency of Met and  was supplied. Percentages of CP and casein N in milk increased linearly as cows were fed increasing amounts of ruminally protected Met and . Plasma concentrations of urea N, Met, and  increased when ruminally protected Met and  were fed; however, other nutrients probably were limiting for synthesis of milk and milk protein when cows were fed a 14% CP diet because yields of each were not increased by ruminally protected Met and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14594253>In situ evaluation of hen mortality meal as a protein supplement for dairy cows.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional composition and in situ degradation of hen mortality meals. There were four treatments: control autoclaved hen meal (C-HM), enzyme-treated, fermented, autoclaved hen meal (E-HM), NaOH-treated, fermented, autoclaved hen meal (NaOH-HM), and soybean meal (SBM). For the E-HM or NaOH-HM, hen mortality was treated with a feather digesting enzyme or NaOH to improve digestibility of feathers on the carcass. After the enzyme or NaOH treatment, treated hen mortality was preserved by a fermentation procedure. The crude protein levels of the C-HM and SBM were higher than the E-HM and NaOH-HM, and the concentration of  in the C-HM was higher than the other treatments. Levels of , Thr, Arg, Ile, Leu, , and  for the C-HM and SBM were higher than in the E-HM and NaOH-HM. The Met, Cys, and Gly levels in the C-HM were higher than the soybean meal. In situ ruminal degradation data showed that the C-HM had lower dry matter and crude protein degradation than the other treatments, whereas the E-HM or NaOH-HM was more susceptible to ruminal degradation. These results indicate that the C-HM has higher levels of crude protein, amino acids, and resistance to ruminal degradation, whereas the E-HM or NaOH-HM was more digestible to ruminal microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106110>Evaluation of various sources of corn dried distillers grains plus solubles for lactating dairy cattle.</a></h2><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of feeding dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) from different sources on milk production and composition in dairy cows. Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Treatments consisted of total mixed diets containing no DDGS (CON), or DDGS from source 1 (DDGS-1), source 2 (DDGS-2), or source 3 (DDGS-3) at 20% of diet dry matter. The processing of DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 was intended to decrease heat damage and improve nutritional quality. The DDGS in the diets replaced a portion of the ground corn and soybean meal, allowing them to be isonitrogenous at 16% crude protein. All diets had a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 55:45. Dry matter intake (21.4 kg/d) did not differ among diets, but cows fed diets containing DDGS had greater yields of milk (34.6 vs. 31.2 kg/d), 4% -corrected milk (32.7 vs. 29.6 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (35.4 vs. 32.3) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Feed efficiency was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (1.78 vs. 1.63). Milk  yield was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with those fed CON (1.26 vs. 1.14 kg/d). Milk protein percentages (3.28, 3.13, 3.19, and 3.17% for CON, DDGS-1, DDGS-2, and DDGS-3, respectively) were greater for CON vs. DDGS and tended to be lower for DDGS-1 than for DDGS-2 and DDGS-3. Milk protein yields tended to be greater for cows fed DDGS than for those fed CON (1.09 vs. 1.02 kg/d). Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (9.36 vs. 10.6 mg/dL). Feeding DDGS decreased arterial plasma concentrations of Arg, Ile, , and Thr and increased His and Leu compared with CON. Arterial plasma from cows fed DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 had greater concentrations of Ile, Trp, and  compared with DDGS-1. In all diets, , Met, and  were the first 3 limiting amino acids for protein synthesis with  being first limiting in DDGS-1 and DDGS-3 and Met being first limiting for CON and DDGS-2. Inclusion of DDGS did not affect the molar proportions of ruminal acetate or propionate compared with CON. Ruminal proportions of butyrate were lower in CON compared with DDGS. Total concentrations of VFA were greater in CON compared with DDGS. The concentrations of rumen ammonia were greater in CON (7.2 mg/dL) compared with DDGS (4.5 mg/dL). Overall, the source of DDGS used in this study did not affect lactation performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884342>Milk protein synthesis in response to the provision of an "ideal" amino acid profile at 2 levels of metabolizable protein supply in dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Providing a well-balanced supply of essential AA (EAA) can serve as an opportunity to reduce the protein intake for dairy cows by increasing the efficiency of metabolizable protein (or PDIE, its equivalent in the INRA feeding system) utilization for milk protein yield. Our objectives were to compare the effect of supplying an "ideal" EAA profile (EAA+) with an imbalanced AA profile (control) at 2 levels of PDIE/NE(L) (net energy for lactation) supplies to study the interaction between PDIE and AA profiles, and to compare this ideal profile with a simple mixture of the 4 most deficient EAA (4 EAA) in the diets of dairy cows. Six lactating multiparous Holstein cows received 6 treatments with 2 different levels of PDIE supplied by diets and AA infusions in the duodenum according to a changeover design with 3-wk periods. Within each PDIE supply level, the cows received 3 different AA infusions in the duodenum according to a 3×3 Latin square design with 1-wk subperiods, which corresponded to the following treatment groups: control (Glu), 4EAA (, Met, His, Leu), and EAA+ (4 EAA plus Ile, , , Trp, and Tyr). In the low and high PDIE treatments, diets and infusions provided 54.7 and 64.0 g/Mcal of PDIE/NE(L), respectively, which corresponded to crude protein levels of 13.6 and 15.2%, respectively. High-PDIE supplies increased the milk protein yield by 163 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.4 g/kg, the milk yield by 4.1 kg/d, and the lactose yield by 178 g/d and decreased the PDIE efficiency of utilization by 12.4%, whereas the N efficiency of utilization remained unaffected. Supplying the 2 EAA profiles (4EAA and EAA+) increased the milk protein yield by 67 g/d, the milk protein content by 1.3g/kg, and the milk yield by 0.9 kg/d, whereas the milk fat and milk lactose contents were decreased by 2.4 and 1.6g/kg, respectively. The responses regarding milk yield and its composition were similar whether the cows received the 4 EAA or the EAA+ treatment. The responses were similar for the milk yield and composition whether the EAA were supplied by low- or high-PDIE supplies. In conclusion, the efficiency of PDIE utilization was improved by 6.6% and the N efficiency was improved by 7.0% by correcting the EAA profiles, independent of the level of PDIE supplied. In addition, the increased efficiency observed, associated with provision of the 4 EAA, was similar to the provision of all EAA (EAA+) in this experiment.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

Four diets were prepared to contain FFSB, SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF as the sole source of N. A N-free diet was formulated to estimate the basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA for broiler chickens and pigs. In Exp. 1, a total of four hundred sixteen 21-d-old male broiler chickens (922.1 ± 79.9 g initial BW) were assigned to 5 experimental diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected after birds were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. In Exp. 2, twenty barrows (62.0 ± 6.9 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were allotted to 5 experimental diets with 2 consecutive 7-d experimental periods. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected at d 6 and 7. For statistical analysis, treatments were considered a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with effects of species and experimental diets (Exp. 1 vs. Exp. 2). There were no interactions between species and diets for the digestibility of CP and AA except for Cys ( < 0.01). The AID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.01) than in broiler chickens. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the AID of CP and indispensable AA in SBM-47 were greater ( < 0.05) than in FFSB, and the AID of  in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. The SID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.05) than in broiler chickens except for Trp. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the SID of  in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. In broiler chickens, the SID of CP, Ile, Leu, Thr, Trp, and  in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than that in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In pigs, the SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , and  in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In conclusion, the digestibility of CP and most AA were less in broiler chickens than in pigs, but the pattern of differences in the AA digestibility among ingredients was similar between broiler chickens and pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569279>Effects of graded levels of duodenal infusions of leucine on mammary uptake and output in lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Four multiparous Holstein cows, each equipped with a duodenal cannula and an ultrasonic mammary blood flow probe, were assigned to a 4x4 Latin square to measure the effects of duodenal infusions of Leu (0, 40, 80 and 120 g/d) on lactational responses and mammary  of nutrients. Cows were fed a diet of 67.0% corn silage, 5.3% grass hay, 14.2% peas, 7.8% maize starch, 1.0% each of molasses, urea, and sodium bicarbonate and 2.4% minerals and vitamins. Requirements of the remaining 9 essential amino acids were met by infusing into the duodenum 323 g/d of a mixture of amino acids including, Ile, , Met, , Trp, , His, Thr, Arg, Tyr and Glu. Milk protein content and yield were highest with 40 g/d of Leu and then progressively declined. Milk  content and yield were significantly decreased over the entire range of Leu infusions. Arterial concentrations of Leu increased linearly and corresponding mammary arterio-venous differences increased to a plateau with 80 g/d of Leu. As Leu infusions increased, extraction rates of Leu decreased linearly, whereas those of Ile, , , Arg, Thr and Tyr were significantly increased. Leu was taken up by the mammary gland according to milk output with 0 and 40 g/d of Leu infused and then largely in excess. Based on responses of protein yield and mammary uptake to milk output ratio, Leu concentration in total amino acids absorbed in the small intestine needs to be close to 8.9% for optimal milk protein synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889653>Ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed extruded diets containing different protein sources.</a></h2><p>This study compared apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of macronutrients and amino acids in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed dry extruded diets. The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, , Trp, , Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, Thr, Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p></html>
