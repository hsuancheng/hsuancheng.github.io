This is due to differences in the nutritional and metabolic features between yak and other ordinary cattle combined with difficulties associated with farm-based research and a lack of technical guidance. A comprehensive analysis of the composition and alterations in ruminal metabolites is required to advance the development of modern yak husbandry. In the current study, we characterized the effect of feed type on the ruminal fluid  and metabolites in yak using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  and  were the predominant bacterial phyla in the yak rumen. At the genus level, the relative abundance of  and  was significantly ( < 0.01) higher in the forage group compared to that in the concentrate group, while the concentrate group harbored higher proportions of  and . Yak rumen metabolomics analysis combined with enrichment analysis revealed that feed type altered the concentrations of ruminal metabolites as well as the metabolic pattern, and significantly ( < 0.01) affected the concentrations of ruminal metabolites involved in protein digestion and absorption (e.g., L-arginine, ornithine, L-threonine, L-proline and β-alanine), purine metabolism (e.g., xanthine, hypoxanthine, deoxyadenosine and deoxyadenosine monophosphate) and fatty  biosynthesis (e.g., stearic , myristic  and ). Correlation analysis of the association of microorganisms with metabolite features provides us with a comprehensive understanding of the composition and function of microbial communities. Associations between utilization or production were widely identified between affected  and certain metabolites, and these findings will contribute to the direction of future research in yak.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208088>The effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities in mice.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to high altitude and low oxygen on intestinal microbial communities using mice as an animal model. Fecal  from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16% Oxygen and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11% Oxygen for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption, energy metabolism,  metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low oxygen had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443847>The impact of dietary sn-2 palmitic triacylglycerols in combination with docosahexaenoic  or  on lipid metabolism and host faecal  composition in Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Sn-2 palmitic  triacylglycerols (sn2PA fat) and polyunsaturated fatty acids are thought to influence the metabolic status and intestinal bacterial population of the host. In this study, the impact of sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA in the diet on lipid metabolism in the liver and faecal  composition were investigated in rats fed diets containing sn2PA fat, 90% sn2PA fat + 10% DHA oil (wt%), or 90% sn2PA fat + 10% ARA oil (wt%). Tissue fatty  composition was measured using gas chromatography (GC), whereas the faecal microbial composition was assessed using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. In addition, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed using ion chromatography. The results showed that sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly reduced liver triacylglyceride (TG) content compared with the sn2PA fat only group. Moreover, the supplementation with sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly promoted the growth of Lactobacillus in the feces at the genus level. On the other hand, the growth of the opportunistic pathogen Desulfovibrio was significantly inhibited by sn2PA fat in combination with ARA compared with the sn2PA fat group. In addition, sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly increased total SCFA concentration in the faeces, suggesting a beneficial effect on host intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19636438>Metabolomics reveals metabolic biomarkers of Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The causes and etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) are currently unknown although both host genetics and environmental factors play a role. Here we used non-targeted metabolic profiling to determine the contribution of metabolites produced by the gut  towards disease status of the host. Ion Cyclotron Resonance Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (ICR-FT/MS) was used to discern the masses of thousands of metabolites in fecal samples collected from 17 identical twin pairs, including healthy individuals and those with CD. Pathways with differentiating metabolites included those involved in the metabolism and or synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, bile acids and . Several metabolites were positively or negatively correlated to the disease phenotype and to specific microbes previously characterized in the same samples. Our data reveal novel differentiating metabolites for CD that may provide diagnostic biomarkers and/or monitoring tools as well as insight into potential targets for disease therapy and prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23394615>Impact of dietary dairy polar lipids on lipid metabolism of mice fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The effect of milk polar lipids on lipid metabolism of liver, adipose tissue, and brain and on composition of intestinal  was investigated. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 5 weeks, followed by 5 weeks with HFD without (control) or supplemented with total polar lipids (TPL), phospholipids (PL), or sphingolipids (SPL). Animals fed SPL showed a tendency for lower triglyceride synthesis (P = 0.058) in the liver, but not in adipose tissue. PL and TPL reduced de novo hepatic fatty  biosynthesis. The ratio of palmitoleic to palmitic  in the liver was lower for animals fed SPL or TPL compared to control. There was little effect of the supplementation on the cecal  composition. In the brain, DHA (C22:6) content correlated negatively with tetracosanoic  (C24:0) after TPL supplementation (-0.71, P = 0.02) but not in control (0.26, P = 0.44).  (C20:4) was negatively correlated with C24:0 in both groups (TPL, -0.77, P = 0.008; control, -0.81, P = 0.003).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431181>Brain and liver fatty  composition changes upon consumption of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68.</a></h2><p>Recent reports suggest that the metabolic activity of the enteric  may influence the fatty  composition of the host tissue. There are many studies dealing with the influence of lactobacilli on various pathological conditions, and some of the effects are strain-specific. This study was designed to test the effects of a particular Lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68 on fatty  composition of the liver and the brain of C57BL/6 mice in the absence of an underlying pathological condition. Female mice were supplemented with live L. rhamnosus LA68 bacteria for the duration of 1 month. Serum biochemistry was analyzed and liver and brain fatty  composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Significant changes in liver and brain fatty  composition were detected. In the liver tissue we detected an increase in palmitoleic  (p = 0.038), while in the brain compartment we found an increase in palmitic (p = 0.042), stearic (p = 0.017),  (p = 0.009) and docosahexaenoic  (p = 0.004) for control versus experimental group. These results show discrete changes caused by LA68 strain consumption. Even short duration of administration of LA68 influences the fatty  composition of the host which adds to the existing knowledge about Lactobacillus host interaction, and adds to the growing knowledge of metabolic intervention possibilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012235>A safflower oil based high-fat/high-sucrose diet modulates the gut  and liver phospholipid profiles associated with early glucose intolerance in the absence of tissue inflammation.</a></h2><p>Omega-6 (n-6) PUFA-rich diets are generally considered obesogenic in rodents. Here, we examined how long-term intake of a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet based on safflower oil affected metabolism, inflammation, and gut  composition.We fed male C57BL/6J mice a HF/HS diet based on safflower oil-rich in n-6 PUFAs-or a low-fat/low-sucrose diet for 40 wk. Compared to the low-fat/low-sucrose diet, intake of the safflower-based HF/HS diet only led to moderate weight gain, while glucose intolerance developed at week 5 prior to signs of inflammation, but concurrent with increased levels of linoleic  and  in hepatic phospholipids. Intake of the HF/HS diet resulted in early changes in the gut , including an increased abundance of Blautia, while late changes coincided with altered inflammatory profiles and increased fasting plasma insulin. Analysis of immune cells in visceral fat and liver revealed no differences between diets before week 40, where the number of immune cells decreased in the liver of HF/HS-fed mice.We suggest that a diet-dependent increase in the n-6 to omega-3 (n-3) PUFA ratio in hepatic phospholipids together with gut  changes contributed to early development of glucose intolerance without signs of inflammation.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6 fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating -driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut  composition, short-chain fatty acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators, browning process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut  composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory  and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin resistance via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces insulin resistance. Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing , up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte browning and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Our findings formulate recommendations of n-6 fatty acids like AA from dietary intake for obese subjects preferably in a sexually dimorphic way.Copyright © 2017.

Here using a combined metabonomics approach compromising holistic (1)H-NMR profiling and targeted MS approaches, we report for the first time the metabolic phenotype of longevity in a well characterized human aging cohort compromising mostly female centenarians, elderly, and young individuals. With increasing age, targeted MS profiling of blood serum displayed a marked decrease in tryptophan concentration, while an unique alteration of specific glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are seen in the longevity phenotype. We hypothesized that the overall lipidome changes specific to longevity putatively reflect centenarians' unique capacity to adapt/respond to the accumulating oxidative and chronic inflammatory conditions characteristic of their extreme aging phenotype. Our data in centenarians support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the  metabolic cascade as we underpinned increased concentration of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting enhanced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE, markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative products of linoleic . Lastly, we also revealed that the longevity process deeply affects the structure and composition of the human gut  as shown by the increased extrection of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in urine of centenarians. Together, our novel approach in this representative Italian longevity cohort support the hypothesis that a complex remodeling of lipid, amino  metabolism, and of gut  functionality are key regulatory processes marking exceptional longevity in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23068014>Analysis of fecal , organic acids and plasma lipids in hepatic cancer patients with or without liver cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Changes in the  composition are able to affect nutrient absorption and energy metabolism, but there are few human studies. The aims were to analyze fecal constituents quantitatively and compare them with liver dysfunction in hepatic cancer patients and to evaluate the relationships among intestinal , fecal organic acids and plasma lipid composition.Fecal samples collected from 46 hepatic cancer patients (with liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis or liver fibrosis and normal liver) were evaluated for fecal constituents. Blood organic , lipid and fatty  concentrations were analyzed.Fecal  and organic acids showed no significant differences among different liver dysfunction patients. In normal liver patients, fecal Candida was positively correlated with plasma phospholipid while Bifidobacterium was negatively correlated with plasma eicosapentaenoic  and eicosapentaenoic / ratio (all p < 0.05). In cirrhotic liver patients, positive correlations were noted for Lactobacillus and docosahexaenoic  and Candida and eicosapentaenoic  or eicosapentaenoic / ratio (all p < 0.01). It was suggested that intestinal biota affected serum fatty  metabolism and were modified by liver disorders.Intestinal  and organic  concentrations in hepatic cancer patients had positive and/or negative correlations with serum lipid levels.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

The variables measured were fasting blood glucose and insulin levels; glucose tolerance; diacylglycerols as intracellular mediators of insulin resistance in adipose tissue (AT), liver, and muscle; inflammation markers (plasma IL-6 and leptin, and liver and AT histology markers); eicosanoids from  as lipid mediators of inflammation; and the populations of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Enterobacteriales, and Bifidobacteriales in feces. It was found that d-fagomine reduces fat-induced impaired glucose tolerance, inflammation markers, and mediators (hepatic microgranulomas and lobular inflammation, plasma IL-6, prostaglandin E , and leukotriene B ) while attenuating the changes in the populations of Enterobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales.d-Fagomine delays the development of a fat-induced prediabetic state in rats by reducing low-grade inflammation. We suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of d-fagomine may be linked to a reduction in fat-induced overpopulation of minor gut bacteria.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Increased consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) that is abundant in Western diet contributes to obesity and related diseases. Although gut--related metabolic pathways of dietary PUFAs were recently elucidated, the effects on host physiological function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that gut  confers host resistance to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity by modulating dietary PUFAs metabolism. Supplementation of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), an initial linoleic -related gut-microbial metabolite, attenuates HFD-induced obesity in mice without eliciting -mediated adipose inflammation and by improving metabolic condition via free fatty  receptors. Moreover, Lactobacillus-colonized mice show similar effects with elevated HYA levels. Our findings illustrate the interplay between gut  and host energy metabolism via the metabolites of dietary omega-6-FAs thereby shedding light on the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders by targeting gut microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718810>Module-based functional pathway enrichment analysis of a protein-protein interaction network to study the effects of intestinal  depletion in mice.</a></h2><p>Complex communities of microorganisms play important roles in human health, and alterations in the intestinal  may induce intestinal inflammation and numerous diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the key genes and processes affected by depletion of the intestinal  in a murine model. The Affymetrix microarray dataset GSE22648 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for the DEGs using the Cytoscape software, and the network was divided into several modules using the MCODE plugin. Furthermore, the modules were functionally annotated using the PiNGO plugin, and DEG-related pathways were retrieved and analyzed using the GenMAPP software. A total of 53 DEGs were identified, of which 26 were upregulated and 27 were downregulated. The PPI network of these DEGs comprised 3 modules. The most significant module-related DEGs were the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4B1 isozyme gene (CYP4B1) in module 1, CYP4F14 in module 2 and the tachykinin precursor 1 gene (TAC1) in module 3. The majority of enriched pathways of module 1 and 2 were oxidation reduction pathways (metabolism of xenobiotics by CYPs) and lipid metabolism-related pathways, including linoleic  and  metabolism. The neuropeptide signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched functional pathway of module 3. In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that intestinal  depletion affects cellular metabolism and oxidation reduction pathways. In addition, this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the neuropeptide signaling pathway is reported to be affected by intestinal  depletion in mice. The present study provides a list of candidate genes and processes related to the interaction of  with the intestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574769>Cysteinyl leukotrienes and their receptors: bridging inflammation and colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Long-standing inflammation has emerged as a hallmark of neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells and may be a limiting factor of successful conventional tumor therapies.

To our knowledge, there are no published data on fatty  in Canadian children with autism. The aim of this study was to investigate red blood cell and serum fatty  status to identify whether abnormalities exist in Canadian children with autism, and to enhance future cross-study comparison.Eleven Canadian children with autism (3 girls, 8 boys; age 3.05 ± 0.79 y) and 15 controls (9 girls, 6 boys; age 3.87 ± 1.06 y) met inclusion criteria, which included prior Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, no recent medication or supplements, no specialty diets, and no recent illness.The children with autism demonstrated lower red blood cell docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.0003), eicosapentaenoic  (P < 0.03),  (P < 0.002), and ω-3/ω-6 ratios (P < 0.001). They also demonstrated lower serum docosahexaenoic  (P < 0.02),  (P < 0.05), and linoleic  (P < 0.02) levels.Fatty acids in both serum and red blood cells were abnormal in this small group of Canadian children with autism than in controls, underlining a need for larger age- and sex-matched investigations in this community.

In this study, a combination of the pyrosequencing and the mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques were used to investigate the effects of a raw potato starch (RPS, high in resistant starch) diet on microbial composition and microbial metabolites in the hindgut of pig. The results showed that Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter increased significantly, while Sarcina and Clostridium decreased in relative abundances in the hindgut of pigs fed RPS. The metabolimic analysis revealed that RPS significantly affected starch and sucrose metabolites, amino  turnover or protein biosynthesis, lipid metabolites, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Furthermore, a Pearson's correlation analysis showed that Ruminococcus and Coprococcus were positively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate, maltose, , 9, 12-octadecadienoic , oleic , phosphate, but negatively correlated with α-aminobutyric . However, the correlation of Clostridium and Sarcina with these compounds was in the opposite direction. The results suggest that RPS not only alters the composition of the gut microbial community but also modulates the metabolic pathway of microbial metabolism, which may further affect the hindgut health of the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089111>The molecular landscape of colitis-associated carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>In spite of the well-established histopathological phenotyping of IBD-associated preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, their molecular landscape remains to be fully elucidated. Several studies have pinpointed the initiating role of longstanding/relapsing inflammatory insult on the intestinal mucosa, with the activation of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ), chemokines and metabolites of  resulting in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB. Longstanding inflammation may also modify the intestinal , prompting the overgrowth of genotoxic microorganisms, which may act as further cancer promoters. Most of the molecular dysregulation occurring in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis is documented in colitis-associated adenocarcinoma too, but marked differences have been established in both their timing and prevalence. Unlike sporadic cancers, TP53 alterations occur early in IBD-related carcinogenesis, while APC dysregulation emerges mainly in the most advanced stages of the oncogenic cascade. From the therapeutic standpoint, colitis-associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, are significantly involved in colitis-associated cancer development and progression.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral insulin resistance secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to β cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut , bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated insulin production by pancreatic β cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as , eicosapentaneoic , and docosahexaenoic  (which are unsaturated fatty acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut  that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic β cells, gut, liver, and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913299>Identification of diagnostic biomarkers and metabolic pathway shifts of heat-stressed lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Controlling heat stress (HS) is a global challenge for the dairy industry. However, simple and reliable biomarkers that aid the diagnoses of HS-induced metabolic disorders have not yet been identified. In this work, an integrated metabolomic and lipidomic approach using (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra-fast LC-MS was employed to investigate the discrimination of plasma metabolic profiles between HS-free and HS lactating dairy cows. Targeted detection using LC-MS in multiple reaction monitoring mode was used to verify the reliability of the metabolites as biomarker candidates. Overall, 41 metabolites were identified as candidates for lactating dairy cows exposed to HS, among which 13 metabolites, including trimethylamine, glucose, lactate, betaine, creatine, pyruvate, acetoacetate, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, C16 sphinganine, lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), phosphatidylcholine (16:0/14:0), and , had high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing HS status, and are likely to be the potential biomarkers of HS dairy cows. All of these potentially diagnostic biomarkers were involved in carbohydrate, amino , lipid, or gut microbiome-derived metabolism, indicating that HS affected the metabolic pathways in lactating dairy cows. Further research is warranted to evaluate these biomarkers in practical applications and to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of HS-induced metabolic disorders.Heat stress (HS) annually causes huge losses to global dairy industry, including animal performance decrease, metabolic disorder and health problem. So far, physiological mechanisms underlying HS of dairy cows still remain elusive. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to elucidate the HS-induced metabolic disorders of dairy cows using integrated (1)H NMR and LC-MS-based metabolic study. The results not only provided potential diagnostic biomarkers for HS lactating dairy cows, but also significantly explored the related physiological mechanisms of metabolic pathway shifts induced by HS environment. This work offers comprehensive insights into the global metabolic alterations of dairy cows exposed to HS and provides a new perspective for further study.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut  and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23009651>Molecular analysis of model gut microbiotas by imaging mass spectrometry and nanodesorption electrospray ionization reveals dietary metabolite transformations.</a></h2><p>The communities constituting our microbiotas are emerging as mediators of the health-disease continuum. However, deciphering the functional impact of microbial communities on host pathophysiology represents a formidable challenge, due to the heterogeneous distribution of chemical and microbial species within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Herein, we apply imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to localize metabolites from the interaction between the host and colonizing . This approach complements other molecular imaging methodologies in that analytes need not be known a priori, offering the possibility of untargeted analysis. Localized molecules within the GI tract were then identified in situ by surface sampling with nanodesorption electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (nanoDESI FTICR-MS). Products from diverse structural classes were identified including cholesterol-derived lipids, glycans, and polar metabolites. Specific chemical transformations performed by the  were validated with bacteria in culture. This study illustrates how untargeted spatial characterization of metabolites can be applied to the molecular dissection of complex biology in situ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513935>Dysbiotic Subgingival Microbial Communities in Periodontally Healthy Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Studies that demonstrate an association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and dysbiotic oral microbiomes are often confounded by the presence of extensive periodontitis in these individuals. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of RA in modulating the periodontal microbiome by comparing periodontally healthy individuals with RA to those without RA.Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy individuals (22 with RA and 19 without RA), and the 16S gene was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial biodiversity and co-occurrence patterns were examined using the QIIME and PhyloToAST pipelines.The subgingival microbiomes differed significantly between patients with RA and controls based on both community membership and the abundance of lineages, with 41.9% of the community differing in abundance and 19% in membership. In contrast to the sparse and predominantly congeneric co-occurrence networks seen in controls, RA patients revealed a highly connected grid containing a large intergeneric hub anchored by known periodontal pathogens. Predictive metagenomic analysis (PICRUSt) demonstrated that  and ester lipid metabolism pathways might partly explain the robustness of this clustering. As expected from a periodontally healthy cohort, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were not significantly different between groups; however, Cryptobacterium curtum, another organism capable of producing large amounts of citrulline, emerged as a robust discriminant of the microbiome in individuals with RA.Our data demonstrate that the oral microbiome in RA is enriched for inflammophilic and citrulline-producing organisms, which may play a role in the production of autoantigenic citrullinated peptides in RA.© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951525>A randomised trial of the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  supplements on the human intestinal .</a></h2><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anticolorectal cancer (CRC) activity. The intestinal  has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Dietary omega-3 PUFAs alter the mouse intestinal microbiome compatible with antineoplastic activity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of omega-3 PUFA supplements on the faecal microbiome in middle-aged, healthy volunteers (n=22).A randomised, open-label, cross-over trial of 8 weeks' treatment with 4 g mixed eicosapentaenoic /docosahexaenoic  in two formulations (soft-gel capsules and Smartfish drinks), separated by a 12-week 'washout' period. Faecal samples were collected at five time-points for microbiome analysis by 16S ribosomal RNA PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty  analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.Both omega-3 PUFA formulations induced similar changes in RBC fatty  content, except that drinks were associated with a larger, and more prolonged, decrease in omega-6 PUFA  than the capsule intervention (p=0.02). There were no significant changes in α or β diversity, or phyla composition, associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation. However, a reversible increased abundance of several genera, including ,  and  was observed with one or both omega-3 PUFA interventions. Microbiome changes did not correlate with RBC omega-3 PUFA incorporation or development of omega-3 PUFA-induced diarrhoea. There were no treatment order effects.Omega-3 PUFA supplementation induces a reversible increase in several short-chain fatty -producing bacteria, independently of the method of administration. There is no simple relationship between the intestinal microbiome and systemic omega-3 PUFA exposure.ISRCTN18662143.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

It is not clear which mechanisms explain how ETWB feeding affects hepatic metabolism, but factors (i.e., xenometabolites) associated with specific microbes may be involved.The objective of this study was to characterize ETWB-driven shifts in the cecal microbiome and to identify correlates between microbial changes and diet-related differences in liver metabolism in diet-induced obese mice that typically display steatosis.Five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a 45%-lard-based fat diet supplemented with ETWB (20% wt:wt) or rapidly digestible starch (control) (n = 15/group) for 10 wk were characterized by using a multi-omics approach. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify variables that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups.Body weight and liver TGs were decreased by ETWB feeding (by 10% and 25%, respectively; P < 0.001), and an index of liver reactive oxygen species was increased (by 29%; P < 0.01). The cecal microbiome showed an increase in Bacteroidetes (by 42%; P < 0.05) and a decrease in Firmicutes (by 16%; P < 0.05). Metabolites that were strong discriminators between the ETWB and control groups included decreased liver antioxidants (glutathione and α-tocopherol); decreased liver carbohydrate metabolites, including glucose; lower hepatic ; and increased liver and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. Liver transcriptomics revealed key metabolic pathways affected by ETWB, especially those related to lipid metabolism and some fed- or fasting-regulated genes.Together, these changes indicate that dietary fibers such as ETWB regulate hepatic metabolism concurrently with specific gut bacteria community shifts in C57BL/6J mice. It is proposed that these changes may elicit gut-derived signals that reach the liver via enterohepatic circulation, ultimately affecting host liver metabolism in a manner that mimics, in part, the fasting state.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16819372>Nutritional approach to restore impaired intestinal barrier function and growth after neonatal stress in rats.</a></h2><p>Psychological stress during the neonatal period results in intestinal barrier dysfunction and growth alterations later in life.

From PND15 to PND35, rats received a control diet or a similar diet adapted to contain  and docosahexaenoic acids, galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461.Maternal separation had only a minor impact on the measured gut barrier parameters at PND15, whereas it severely affected them at PND35. At this age, intestinal permeability to macromolecules was higher, mucin content in small intestinal tissues was lower and  composition was altered in S compared with H animals. Feeding the adapted diet normalized the intestinal permeability, although it did not restore intestinal mucin content or . In addition, the adapted diet improved the growth rate recovery of the S animals after weaning and resulted in increased villus length in small intestine.Our results suggest that an adapted diet containing specific long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotics and probiotics can revert the negative imprinting of neonatal stress on both intestinal barrier function and growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245669>Differences in the Gut  Establishment and Metabolome Characteristics Between Low- and Normal-Birth-Weight Piglets During Early-Life.</a></h2><p>Low-birth-weight (LBW) piglets are at a high-risk for postnatal growth failure, mortality, and metabolic disorders later in life. Early-life microbial exposure is a potentially effective intervention strategy for modulating the health and metabolism of the host. Yet, it has not been well elucidated whether the gut  development in LBW piglets is different from their normal littermates and its possible association with metabolite profiles. In the current study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics was used to investigate differences in the fecal  and metabolites between LBW and normal piglets during early-life, including day 3 (D3), 7 (D7), 14 (D14), 21 (D21, before weaning), and 35 (D35, after birth). Compared to their normal littermates, LBW piglets harbored low proportions of  on D3,  on D7, , , and  on D21, as well as  on D21 and D35. However, the abundance of  on D7 and D21,  on D14 and D35,  and  on D14 and D21, and  on D21 was significantly higher in LBW piglets when compared with normal piglets. The results of the metabolomics analysis suggested that LBW significantly affected fecal metabolites involved in fatty  metabolism (e.g., linoleic , α-linolenic , and ), amino  metabolism (e.g., valine, phenylalanine, and glutamic ), as well as bile  biosynthesis (e.g., glycocholic , 25-hydroxycholesterol, and chenodeoxycholic ). Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant negative association between  and N1-acetylspermine on D7,  and linoleic  on D14,  and chenodeoxycholic  on D21, and  and phenylalanine on D35, respectively. Collectively, LBW piglets have a different gut bacterial community structure when compared with normal-birth-weight (NBW) piglets during early-life, especially from 7 to 21 days of age. Also, a distinctive metabolic status in LBW piglets might be partly associated with the altered intestinal . These findings may further elucidate the factors potentially associated with the impaired growth and development of LBW piglets and facilitate the development of nutritional interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349441>Association between sn-2 fatty  profiles of breast milk and development of the infant intestinal microbiome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence shows that host diet and gut microbes are related. Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%), oleic  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C,  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period. The above results provided important information for designing the configuration of FAs in next-generation formulas for Chinese infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186175>Breast-fed and bottle-fed infant rhesus macaques develop distinct gut microbiotas and immune systems.</a></h2><p>Diet has a strong influence on the intestinal  in both humans and animal models. It is well established that microbial colonization is required for normal development of the immune system and that specific microbial constituents prompt the differentiation or expansion of certain immune cell subsets. Nonetheless, it has been unclear how profoundly diet might shape the primate immune system or how durable the influence might be. We show that breast-fed and bottle-fed infant rhesus macaques develop markedly different immune systems, which remain different 6 months after weaning when the animals begin receiving identical diets. In particular, breast-fed infants develop robust populations of memory T cells as well as T helper 17 (TH17) cells within the memory pool, whereas bottle-fed infants do not. These findings may partly explain the variation in human susceptibility to conditions with an immune basis, as well as the variable protection against certain infectious diseases.Copyright © 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598081>Gut microbiome changes in overweight male adults following bowel preparation.</a></h2><p>Human gut microbiome has an essential role in human health and disease. Although the major dominant  within individuals have been reported, the change of gut microbiome caused by external factors, such as antibiotic use and bowel cleansing, remains unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the change of gut microbiome in overweight male adults after bowel preparation, where none of the participants had been diagnosed with any systemic diseases.A total of 20 overweight, male Taiwanese adults were recruited, and all participants were omnivorous. The participants provided fecal samples and blood samples at three time points: prior to bowel preparation, 7 days after colonoscopy, and 28 days after colonoscopy. The  composition in fecal samples was analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene amplicon sequencing.Our results demonstrated that the relative abundance of the most dominant bacteria hardly changed from prior to bowel preparation to 28 days after colonoscopy. Using the ratio of Prevotella to the sum of Prevotella and Bacteroides in the fecal samples at baseline, the participants were separated into two groups. The fecal samples of the Type 1 group was Bacteroides-dominant, and that of the Type 2 group was Prevotella-dominant with a noticeable presence Bacteroides. Bulleidia appears more in the Type 1 fecal samples, while Akkermensia appears more in the Type 2 fecal samples. Of each type, the gut microbial diversity differed slightly among the three collection times. Additionally, the Type 2 fecal  was temporarily susceptible to bowel cleansing. Predictive functional analysis of microbial community reveals that their activities for the mineral absorption metabolism and  metabolism differed significantly between the two types. Depending on their fecal type, the variance of triglycerides and C-reactive protein also differed between the two types of participants.Depending upon the fecal type, the microbial diversity and the predictive functional modules of microbial community differed significantly after bowel preparation. In addition, blood biochemical markers presented somewhat associated with fecal type. Therefore, our results might provide some insights as to how knowledge of the microbial community could be used to promote health through personalized clinical treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662340>Lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes through JAK/STAT and AMPK-regulated cPLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes played important roles in the development of adipose tissue and contributed much to the processes of obesity. On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a key outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria in the gut , and has a dominant role in linking inflammation to high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of inflammation regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes. In addition, LPS-increased DNA synthesis, cell numbers and cell viability of preadipocytes were attenuated by AACOCF3, AG490, BML-275, cPLA2 siRNA, JAK2 siRNA or AMPK siRNA. Attenuation JAK2/STAT or AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression reduced LPS-mediated adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Stimulation of  or AMPK activator, A-769662, increased cell numbers and cell viability and promoted differentiation of preadipocytes. Collectively, these results indicated that LPS increased preadipocytes proliferation and adipogenesis via JAK/STAT and AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression. The mechanisms of LPS-stimulated cPLA2 expression may be a link between bacteria and obesity and provides the molecular basis for preventing metabolic syndrome or hyperplasic obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052232>Different functional genes of upper airway microbiome associated with natural course of childhood asthma.</a></h2><p>Microbial colonization of the airway plays a role in the pathogenesis of asthma; however, the effect of the upper airway microbiome on childhood asthma is not fully understood.

Gut  linked compounds such as short chain fatty acids, bile acids, choline metabolites, indole derivatives, vitamins, polyamines, lipids, neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones have many biological functions. This review focuses on the gut  and host metabolism in liver cirrhosis. Dysbiosis in liver cirrhosis causes serious complications, such as bacteremia and hepatic encephalopathy, accompanied by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability. Gut dysbiosis in cirrhosis and intervention with probiotics and synbiotics in a clinical setting is reviewed and evaluated. Recent studies have revealed the relationship between gut  and host metabolism in chronic metabolic liver disease, especially, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and with the gut  metabolic interactions in dysbiosis related metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recently, our understanding of the relationship between the gut and liver and how this regulates systemic metabolic changes in liver cirrhosis has increased. The serum lipid levels of phospholipids, free fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially, eicosapentaenoic , , and docosahexaenoic  have significant correlations with specific fecal flora in liver cirrhosis. Many clinical and experimental reports support the relationship between fatty  metabolism and gut-. Various blood metabolome such as cytokines, amino acids, and vitamins are correlated with gut  in probiotics-treated liver cirrhosis patients. The future evaluation of the gut--liver metabolic network and the intervention of these relationships using probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics, with sufficient nutrition could aid the development of treatments and prevention for liver cirrhosis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486796>Differential human gut microbiome assemblages during soil-transmitted helminth infections in Indonesia and Liberia.</a></h2><p>The human intestine and its  is the most common infection site for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which affect the well-being of ~ 1.5 billion people worldwide. The complex cross-kingdom interactions are not well understood.A cross-sectional analysis identified conserved microbial signatures positively or negatively associated with STH infections across Liberia and Indonesia, and longitudinal samples analysis from a double-blind randomized trial showed that the gut  responds to deworming but does not transition closer to the uninfected state. The microbiomes of individuals able to self-clear the infection had more alike microbiome assemblages compared to individuals who remained infected. One bacterial taxon (Lachnospiracae) was negatively associated with infection in both countries, and 12 bacterial taxa were significantly associated with STH infection in both countries, including Olsenella (associated with reduced gut inflammation), which also significantly reduced in abundance following clearance of infection. Microbial community gene abundances were also affected by deworming. Functional categories identified as associated with STH infection included  metabolism;  is the precursor for pro-inflammatory leukotrienes that threaten helminth survival, and our findings suggest that some modulation of  activity in the STH-infected gut may occur through the increase of  metabolizing bacteria.For the first time, we identify specific members of the gut microbiome that discriminate between moderately/heavily STH-infected and non-infected states across very diverse geographical regions using two different statistical methods. We also identify microbiome-encoded biological functions associated with the STH infections, which are associated potentially with STH survival strategies, and changes in the host environment.

All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20% energy), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30% energy) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut , faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated.The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of  (p=0.007) and  (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased  (p=0.04),  (p<0.001) and decreased  (p=0.04).

The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in  and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention.Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut , faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.; Results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut , which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 20 healthy purebred Yorkshire female pigs, weighing approximately 25 kg BW, were allotted to 1 of 3 feeding regimens: R1 (n = 5 pigs), feeding a diet containing 10% FS between 25 and 50 kg BW and CON diet thereafter, R2 (n = 10 pigs), feeding CON diet between 25 and 85 kg BW and a diet containing 6% FS thereafter, and R3 (n = 5 pigs), feeding CON diet between 25 and 110 kg BW. Titanium dioxide was used as an indigestible marker to assess AID and ileal flows of crude fat and FA. At 110 kg BW, pigs were slaughtered and representative digesta samples were obtained from the distal ileum. Ileal flows and AID of crude fat and individual FA did not differ (P > 0.10) between R1 and R3, and therefore, results from these 2 feeding regimens were combined to give 2 dietary treatments (CON and FS). There were no treatment effects on AID of crude fat and the sum of all FA, SFA, or MUFA. However, the AID of individual SFA decreased with chain length (linear; P < 0.05) for both FS and CON. The AID of myristic  (14:0), individual trans-18:1 FA (6t-8t-18:1 to 12t-18:1), myristoleic  (9c-14:1), and palmitoleic  (9c-16:1) were greater for CON than FS (P < 0.05) whereas no diet effect was observed for the AID of linoleic  (18:2n-6; 80.2 and 86.1% for FS and CON, respectively) and α-linolenic  (18:3n-3; 86.7 and 89.8% for FS and CON, respectively). Ileal flows of rumenic  (9c11t-CLA), n-3 PUFA, and highly unsaturated FA (HUFA; , eicosatrienoic, eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids) exceeded their intakes, indicating net appearance of these FA in the upper gut of the pig. It remains to be determined whether enteric  can elongate and desaturate 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 and isomerize 18:2n-6. The contribution of endogenous FA losses from the host to the ileal flow of these FA should also be considered.

Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital . Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10),  and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty  metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p></html>
