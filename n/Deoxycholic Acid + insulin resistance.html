The fundamental derangement in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is , a key component of the metabolic syndrome, which includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. The natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not always benign, and causality for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is well known in clinical practice and sometimes it is accompanied by hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is likely to be associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, and it raises the possibility that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease may be not only a marker but also an early mediator of atherosclerosis. Therapy is currently directed at treating components of the metabolic syndrome which may be beneficial also for the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28001263>Current management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic accumulation of lipid in patients who do not consume alcohol in amounts generally considered harmful to the liver.

Technosphere  delivers  with an ultra rapid pharmacokinetic profile that is distinctly different from all other  products but similar to natural  release. Such rapid absorption is often associated with penetration enhancers that disrupt cellular integrity.Technosphere  was compared to a panel of known penetration enhancers in vitro using the Calu-3 lung cell line to investigate the effects of TI on  transport.Measures of tight junction integrity such as transepithelial electrical , Lucifer yellow permeability, and F-actin staining patterns were all unaffected by TI. Cell viability and plasma membrane integrity were also not affected by TI. In contrast, cells treated with comparable (or lower) concentrations of penetration enhancers showed elevated Lucifer yellow permeability, disruption of the F-actin network, reduced cell viability, and compromised plasma membranes.These results demonstrate that TI is not cytotoxic in an in vitro human lung cell model and does not function as a penetration enhancer. Furthermore, TI does not appear to affect the transport of  across cellular barriers.2009 Diabetes Technology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883669>Metformin treatment prevents gallstone formation but mimics porcelain gallbladder in C57Bl/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Gallstone disease (GD) is highly correlated with metabolic syndrome and its related illnesses including type II diabetes (DMII) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). While previous studies claimed that metformin decreases the chance of developing GD in PCOS patients, this phenomenon has not been investigated in animal models to date. Here we fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 2% of cholesterol and 1% of cholic  to ten-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice for 105 days. The groups were as follows: Low fat diet; HFD; HFD + Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (Met) (day 64-105). All drugs were administered by oral gavage (Met = 300 mg/kg & UDCA = 750 mg/kg). Serum lipid profile and gross organ examination were performed after euthanasia. A microscopic evaluation of the paraffin-embedded gallbladders was done after hematoxylin & eosin and Von Kossa staining. HFD successfully induces gallstone (4 out of 4 of the HFD members). While both UDCA and metformin (d 1-105) prevented gallstone formation and cholecystitis, Metformin (d 64-105) group had a few small stones. Additionally, metformin induces mucosal calcification in gallbladder (porcelain GB) of more than 80% of the HFD + Met (day 1-105) and HFD + Met (day 64-105) groups, collectively, which can be a potential problem by itself. While metformin shows a noticeable benefit towards GB health by reducing the chance for gallstone formation, if it induces porcelain gallbladder in humans as well, it might inflict patients with preventable medical charges.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding whether enhanced EGFRtk activity and ER stress induction are involved in cardiac damage, and microvascular dysfunction in type 1 diabetes mellitus is an important question that has remained unanswered. Cardiac fibrosis and microvascular function were determined in C57BL/6J mice injected with streptozotocin only or in combination with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478), ER stress inhibitor (Tudca), or  for 2 weeks. In diabetic mice, we observed an increase in EGFRtk phosphorylation and ER stress marker expression (CHOP, ATF4, ATF6, and phosphorylated-eIF2α) in heart and mesenteric  arteries, which were reduced with AG1478, Tudca, and . Cardiac fibrosis, enhanced collagen type I, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 were decreased with AG1478, Tudca, and  treatments. The impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and -independent relaxation responses were also restored after treatments. The inhibition of NO synthesis reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in control and treated streptozotocin mice, whereas the inhibition of NADPH oxidase improved endothelium-dependent relaxation only in streptozotocin mice. Moreover, in mesenteric  arteries, the mRNA levels of Nox2 and Nox4 and the NADPH oxidase activity were augmented in streptozotocin mice and reduced with treatments. This study unveiled novel roles for enhanced EGFRtk phosphorylation and its downstream ER stress in cardiac fibrosis and microvascular endothelial dysfunction in type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177958>Reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress using chemical chaperones or Grp78 overexpression does not protect muscle cells from palmitate-induced .</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a novel link between elevated fatty acids levels, obesity and  in liver and adipose tissue. However, it is unknown whether ER stress also contributes to lipid-induced  in skeletal muscle, the major tissue responsible of -stimulated glucose disposal. Here, we investigated the possible role of ER stress in palmitate-induced alterations of  action, both in vivo, in gastrocnemius of high-palm diet fed mice, and in vitro, in palmitate-treated C(2)C(12) myotubes. We demonstrated that 8 weeks of high-palm diet increased the expression of ER stress markers in muscle of mice, whereas ex-vivo -stimulated PKB phosphorylation was not altered in this tissue. In addition, exposure of C(2)C(12) myotubes to either tuncamycine or palmitate induced ER stress and altered -stimulated PKB phosphorylation. However, alleviation of ER stress by either TUDCA or 4-PBA treatments, or by overexpressing Grp78, did not restore palmitate-induced reduction of -stimulated PKB phosphorylation in C(2)C(12) myotubes. This work highlights that, even ER stress is associated with palmitate-induced alterations of  signaling, ER stress is likely not the major culprit of this effect in myotubes, suggesting that the previously proposed link between ER stress and  is less important in skeletal muscle than in adipose tissue and liver.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These organs have been shown to have increased susceptibility to cold ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury in comparison with otherwise comparable lean livers; the mechanisms governing this increased susceptibility to CIR injury are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important link between hepatic steatosis, , and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated ER stress signaling and blockade in the mediation of CIR injury in severely steatotic rodent allografts. Steatotic allografts from genetically leptin-resistant rodents had increased ER stress responses and increased markers of hepatocellular injury after liver transplantation into strain-matched lean recipients. ER stress response components were reduced by the chemical chaperone taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and this resulted in an improvement in the allograft injury. TUDCA treatment decreased nuclear factor kappa B activation and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. However, the predominant response was decreased expression of the ER stress cell death mediator [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. Furthermore, activation of inflammation-associated caspase-11 was decreased, and this linked ER stress/CHOP to proinflammatory cytokine production after steatotic liver transplantation. These data confirm ER stress in steatotic allografts and implicate this as a mediating mechanism of inflammation and hepatocyte death in the steatotic liver allograft.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063275>Emerging Therapies for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States.

GLUT4 expression disorder might cause , and over-expression of GLUT4 has been confirmed to ameliorate diabetes. Here, we reported that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and its agonist chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) could induce GLUT4 transcription in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, CDCA could increase the GLUT4 protein amount in C57BL/6J mice sex-dependently. The following progressive 5'-deletion analysis and site-mutation investigation further suggested that FXR could induce GLUT4 expression through FXR response element (FXRE) in the GLUT4 promoter. EMSA and knock-down of retinoid X receptor (RXR) indicated that FXR binds to the GLUT4-FXRE as a monomer and RXR does not participate in the FXR stimulation of GLUT4 expression. In addition, we demonstrated that FXR does not interfere with -induced GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. All these data thereby implied that FXR is a new transcription factor of GLUT4, further elucidating the potential role for FXR in glucose metabolism.Copyright 2008 S.

They function as nutrient signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors (FXR, PXR, Vitamin D) and G-protein coupled receptors [TGR5, sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), muscarinic receptors]. Bile acids and insulin appear to collaborate in regulating the metabolism of nutrients in the liver. They both activate the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Bile  induction of the FXR-α target gene, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is highly dependent on the activation PKCζ, a branch of the insulin signaling pathway. SHP is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. One might hypothesize that chronic low grade inflammation which is associated with insulin resistance, may inhibit bile  signaling and disrupt lipid metabolism. The disruption of these signaling pathways may increase the risk of fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Finally, conjugated bile acids appear to promote cholangiocarcinoma growth via the activation of S1PR2.Copyright © 2014.

However, it is still unclear how FXR agonists protect against NASH and which cell type is the main target of FXR agonists. In this study, we examined the effects of OCA on the development of NASH using melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice that progressively developed hepatic steatosis and NASH on Western diet (WD). Treatment with OCA effectively prevented chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice with only marginal effect on body weight and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) is a unique histological structure characteristic of NASH, which triggers hepatocyte death-induced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, treatment with OCA markedly reduced hCLS formation even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH, thereby inhibiting the progression of liver fibrosis. As its mechanism of action, OCA suppressed metabolic stress-induced p53 activation and cell death in hepatocytes. Our findings in this study highlight the role of FXR in hepatocytes in the pathogenesis of NASH. Collectively, this study demonstrates the anti-fibrotic effect of OCA in a murine model of NASH with obesity and , which suggests the clinical implication for human NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18410557>Review article: current management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome.To assess the epidemiological impact and the current management of patients with NAFLD.Published peer-reviewed literature and abstracts concerning NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were reviewed. Articles specifically related to epidemiology, diagnosis and current treatment strategies for NAFLD and NASH are summarized.NAFLD is strongly associated with the epidemic of obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus, and is estimated to affect about 20-30% of the population in the US. From the spectrum of NAFLD, only patients with biopsy-proven NASH (estimated prevalence in the US population is about 3-5%) have been convincingly shown to progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical manifestation of NAFLD is usually absent or subtle, with abnormal aminotransferases or incidental radiographic findings of fatty liver. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is attributed to a multi-hit process involving , oxidative stress, apoptotic pathways, and adipocytokines. In 2008, there is no established treatment for NAFLD. Weight loss and treatment for each component of metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, a large number of agents are being considered in clinical trials of patients with NASH.Awareness of the tremendous impact of NAFLD as an important cause of chronic liver disease is increasing along with a great deal of information about its pathogenesis.

We showed recently using in vitro studies that when PB was incorporated with stabilising lipophilic bile acids and microencapsulated using the polymer sodium alginate, the microcapsules showed good stability but poor and irregular PB release. This suggests that PB microcapsules may exhibit better release profile and hence better absorption, if more hydrophilic bile acids were used, such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). Accordingly, this study aimed to produce PB-UDCA microcapsules and examine PB absorption and antidiabetic effects in our mouse-model of  and diabetes (fed high-fat diet; HFD). The study also aimed to examine the effects of the microcapsules on the bile  profile. Healthy mice (fed low-fat diet; LFD) were used as control. Seventy mice were randomly allocated into seven equal groups: LFD, HFD given empty microcapsules, HFD given metformin (M), HFD given standard-dose probucol (PB-SD), HFD given high-dose probucol (PB-H), HFD given UDCA microcapsules and HFD given PB-UDCA microcapsules. Blood glucose (BG), inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17), plasma cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides were analysed together with plasma bile  and probucol concentrations. PB-UDCA microcapsules reduced BG in HFD mice, but did not reduce inflammation or improve lipid profile, compared with positive control (HFD) group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ER stress inhibitors ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) in the treatment of DN in db/db mice. Findings have revealed that diabetic db/db mice were more hyperglycemic than their non-diabetic controls, and exhibited a marked increase in body weight, water intake, urine volume, fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, glucose and  tolerance. UDCA (40 mg/kg/day) or 4-PBA (100 mg/kg/day) treatment for 12 weeks resulted in an improvement in these biochemical and physical parameters. Moreover, UDCA or 4-PBA intervention markedly decreased urinary albuminuria and attenuated mesangial expansion in diabetic db/db mice, compared with db/db mice treated with vehicle. These beneficial effects of UDCA or 4-PBA on DN were associated with the inhibition of ER stress, as evidenced by the decreased expression of BiP, phospho-IRE1α, phospho-eIF2α, CHOP, ATF-6 and spliced X-box binding protein-1 in vitro and in vivo. UDCA or 4-PBA prevented hyperglycemia-induced or high glucose (HG)-induced apoptosis in podocytes in vivo and in vitro via the inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-12 activation. Autophagy deficiency was also seen in glomeruli in diabetic mice and HG-incubated podocytes, exhibiting decreased expression of LC3B and Beclin-1, which could be restored by UDCA or 4-PBA treatment.

Most early treatment studies tended to focus on improvement in the serum aminotransferases. Presently, treatment of NAFLD is aimed at improving the underlying steatosis, necroinflammatory activity, and fibrosis because elevations of the aminotransferases may not accurately reflect these important histologic endpoints.

A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients.  with an increased release of free fatty acids, oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic  (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved  mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on.

It may lead, at least in some patients, to steatohepatitis (ASH) which is known to progress to cirrhosis more rapidly. Because of the fact that the prevalence of obesity in association with the metabolic syndrome () is strikingly increasing in the Western world, we will more and more often be faced with a second form of steatohepatitis, the so called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Clinical differentiation between these two entities may often be difficult. The use of the CAGE-questions as well as interviewing family members can help to indentify hidden alcohol abuse. Clinically, the presence of both diseases can only be speculated. To get the diagnosis, liver biopsy must be performed to show the typical histologic feature of fatty liver with hepatocyte necrosis as well as infiltration of polymorphcellular leukocytes. Histology cannot differentiate between ASH and NASH. Therefore, similar pathogenetic mechanisms are supposed. However, therapeutic approaches are different.

They also had increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 19, associated with decreased levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and endogenous bile acids, indicating activation of farnesoid X receptor. Markers of liver fibrosis decreased significantly in the group treated with 25 mg OCA. Adverse experiences were similar among groups.In this phase 2 trial, administration of 25 or 50 mg OCA for 6 weeks was well tolerated, increased  sensitivity, and reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

In C57Bl6 wild-type mice,  was induced by the chronic ingestion of diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFF). HFF mice were randomized to treatment with UDCA or candersartan incorporated into the diet to achieve an ingested dose of approximately 70 mg/kg/day of UDCA or 3 mg/kg/day respectively. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured with tail-cuff method. At 4 weeks of dietary treatment systolic and diastolic blood pressure were comparable in HFF and low-fat (LF) control mice. Co-administration of candesartan at 4 weeks significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, UDCA showed no anti-hypertensive effect at 4 weeks. At 24 weeks of dietary intervention, HFF fed mice had substantially elevated systolic blood pressure compared to LF controls. The provision of UDCA substantially attenuated the dietary HFF induced increase in systolic blood pressure concomitant with significantly lower plasma angiotensin II. The anti-hypertensive effect of UDCA in HFF mice was comparable to candesartan.

In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to inflammation and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the obesity epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients. To date, although there has not been any proven pharmacotherapy against NAFLD, numerous promising pipelines with good target engagement are under development. Moreover, given the global landmark phase 3 trials using obeticholic  (a farnesoid X receptor agonist, REGENERATE trial) and elafibranor (a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, RESOLVE-IT trial), the era of specific target therapies focusing on molecular and metabolic pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis is near at hand.

L35 cells were found to concentrate taurocholate from the culture medium, without any significant effect on the expression of 7 alpha-hydroxylase. At physiologic levels (up to 100 microM), CYP7 mRNA expression was not repressed by any bile . At supra-physiologic levels (1 mM), the more hydrophobic dihydroxy bile acids, taurodeoxycholate and taurochenodeoxycholate, decreased CYP7 mRNA without decreasing the relative abundance of beta-actin mRNA. Similar results were obtained by culturing cells with sodium dodecylsulfate (50 microM). The medium of L35 cells treated with either taurochenodeoxycholate (1 mM), taurodeoxycholate (1 mM), or sodium dodecylsulfate (50 microM) contained significantly greater activities of two cytosolic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase, indicating a cytotoxic response. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters decreased the expression of 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA without evidence of cytotoxicity; therefore, the inability of L35 cells to show bile  repression cannot be ascribed to a lack of an effect by this secondary messenger system. In addition,  decreased and dexamethasone increased 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA without increasing the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme markers. The combined data suggest that L35 cells are resistant to repression of CYP7 gene expression by bile acids, but display physiologic expression to hormones and protein kinase C activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595891>High-fat Diet-induced Intestinal Hyperpermeability is Associated with Increased Bile Acids in the Large Intestine of Mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is characterized by low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, which is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability. This study examined the effects of 3 high-fat diets (HFDs) composed of different fat sources (soybean oil and lard) on the intestinal permeability, tight junction (TJ) protein expression, and cecal bile  (BA) concentrations in mice, and then analyzed their interrelations. C57/BL6 mice were fed the control diet, HFD (soybean oil), HFD (lard), and HFD (mix; containing equal concentrations of soybean oil and lard) for 8 wk. Glucose tolerance, intestinal permeability, TJ protein expression, and cecal BA concentration were evaluated. Feeding with the 3 HDFs similarly increased body weight, liver weight, and fat pad weight, and induced glucose intolerance and intestinal hyperpermeability. The expression of TJ proteins, zonula occludens-2 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, were lower in the colons of the 3 HFD groups than in the control group (P < 0.05), and these changes appeared to be related to intestinal hyperpermeability. Feeding with HFDs increased total secondary BA (SBA) and total BA concentrations along with increases in some individual BAs in the cecum. Significant positive correlations between intestinal permeability and the concentrations of most SBAs, such as  and ω-muricholic acids, were detected (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the HFD-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased BA secretion. The abundance of SBAs in the large intestine may be responsible for the hyperpermeability.© 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20522594>Tauroursodeoxycholic  may improve liver and muscle but not adipose tissue  sensitivity in obese men and women.</a></h2><p> is commonly associated with obesity.

Obeticholic  (OCA) illustrates this limitation since its dyslipidemic effect in humans cannot be observed in these rodents. Conversely, Golden Syrian hamsters have a lipoprotein metabolism mimicking human dyslipidemia since it does express the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). We therefore developed a Diet-Induced NASH (DIN) hamster model and evaluated the impact of OCA. Compared with chow fed controls, hamsters fed for 20 weeks with a free-choice (FC) diet, developed obesity, , dyslipidemia and NASH (microvesicular steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal to bridging fibrosis). After 20 weeks of diet, FC fed hamsters were treated without or with obeticholic  (15mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Although a non-significant trend towards higher dietary caloric intake was observed, OCA significantly lowered body weight after 5 weeks of treatment. OCA significantly increased CETP activity and LDL-C levels by 20% and 27%, and reduced HDL-C levels by 20%. OCA blunted hepatic gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and reduced fecal bile acids mass excretion by 64% (P < 0.05). Hamsters treated with OCA showed a trend towards higher scavenger receptor Class B type I (SR-BI) and lower LDL-receptor hepatic protein expression. OCA reduced NAS score for inflammation (P < 0.01) and total NAS score, although not significantly. Compared to mouse and rat models, the DIN hamster replicates benefits and side effects of OCA as observed in humans, and should be useful for evaluating novel drugs targeting NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigated whether TGR5-mTORC1 signaling mediates the RYGB-induced alteration in GLP-1 production in mice and human beings.Circulating bile acids, TGR5-mTORC1 signaling, GLP-1 synthesis and secretion were determined in lean or obese male C57BL/6 mice with or without RYGB operation, as well as in normal glycemic subjects, obese patients with type 2 diabetes before and after RYGB.Positive relationships were observed among circulating bile acids, ileal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and GLP-1 during changes in energy status in the present study. RYGB increased circulating bile acids, ileal Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and mTORC1 signaling activity, as well as GLP-1 production in both mice and human subjects. Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile  secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma  (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA.

Fish oil might be a therapeutic alternative, but its effect on bile  metabolism in humans is unknown. We compared the effects of triglyceride-lowering therapy by fish oil or bezafibrate on cholesterol synthesis and bile  metabolism in HTG. Cholesterol synthesis, bile  pool sizes, and synthesis rates were compared between 9 male HTG patients and 10 normolipidemic controls matched for age, sex, and BMI. Effects of bezafibrate or fish oil were studied only in HTG patients in a randomized crossover trial. Patients had 14-fold higher serum triglyceride concentrations and greater cholesterol synthesis, as indicated by a 107% higher ratio of serum lathosterol to cholesterol (P < 0.01) than controls. The groups did not differ in bile  metabolism. Both bezafibrate and fish oil reduced serum TG concentration (-68 and -51% vs. baseline, respectively). Compared with baseline, bezafibrate therapy was associated with reduced cholesterol synthesis (-25%, P = 0.009) without changes in bile  synthesis rate and pool size. In contrast, fish oil increased bile  synthesis (+31% vs. baseline, P = 0.07 and +53% vs. bezafibrate, P = 0.02) and altered bile  distribution, as reflected by an increased ratio of the cholic  (CA) synthesis rate to the chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) synthesis rate (+35% vs baseline, P = 0.05 and + 32% vs bezafibrate, P = 0.07) without effects on bile  pool size or cholesterol synthesis. In conclusion, cholesterol synthesis is greater in HTG patients than in controls, whereas bile  synthesis does not differ. Bezafibrate and fish oil have similar triglyceride-lowering capacities, but distinct effects on cholesterol synthesis. Bile  synthesis is increased by fish oil, but not by bezafibrate therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27564402>Emerging and future therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a disease of increasing prevalence with morbidity and mortality closely related to cardiovascular disease, malignancies and cirrhosis. Despite the need for pharmacological treatment and intense research in the field, there is currently no approved agent for NASH.There are medications shown to improve hepatic steatosis, including thiazolidinediones, vitamin E and pentoxifylline. However, hepatic fibrosis, the hard prognostic end-point for NASH, has shown little improvement with pharmaceutical intervention. Long-term use of thiazolidinediones has provided a marginal effect on fibrosis, whereas obeticholic , a farnesoid X receptor, showed to improve fibrosis, but further data are needed. There are currently many novel agents under investigation, including glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, sodium glucose co-transporters and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ selective modulators, whose preliminary results have been promising.Given the multifactorial pathogenesis of NASH, it is rational to consider multiple treatments rather than monotherapy as a more promising approach. Although, it remains to be shown, targeting more than one pathogenetic 'hit' of the disease may provide more efficacious management. Furthermore, the establishment of a noninvasive index for long-term follow-up of NASH patients will facilitate treatment guidance by reducing the need for multiple liver biopsies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561641>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH): treatment.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now recognized as a cause of potentially progressive liver damage, posing patients at risk of advanced liver failure.

The concept that , coupled with oxidative stress, may be the underlying mechanism responsible for fat accumulation and disease progression points to -sensitizing agents (metformin, thiazolidinediones) as the most promising drugs. They proved effective in reducing enzyme levels in the short period, but very limited information is available on liver histology, not to say progression to liver cell failure.

A recently established rabbit model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced MetS showed hypogonadism and the presence of prostate gland alterations, including inflammation, hypoxia and fibrosis. The present study investigated whether HFD-induced MetS might also alter bladder structure and function. Testosterone and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist INT-747, were evaluated for possible effects on HFD bladder. MetS rabbits develop bladder alterations, including fibrosis (reduced muscle/fiber ratio), hypoxia [2-fold increase as compared to regular diet (RD) group], low-grade inflammation (increased leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory markers) and RhoA/ROCK hyperactivity. Bladder strips from HFD rabbits, pre-contracted with carbachol, showed an overactive response to the selective ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. All these HFD-induced bladder alterations were partially blunted by testosterone and almost completely reverted by INT-747. Both treatments prevented some MetS features (glucose intolerance and visceral fat increase), thus suggesting that their effects on bladder could be ascribed to an improvement of the metabolic and/or hypogonadal state. However, a pathogenetic role for hypogonadism has been ruled out as GnRH analog-induced hypogonadal rabbits, fed a regular diet, did not show any detectable bladder alterations. In addition, INT-747 did not revert the MetS-induced hypogonadal state. FXR mRNA was highly expressed in rabbit bladder and positively associated with visceral fat increase. A direct effect of INT-747 on bladder smooth muscle was further suggested by inhibition of RhoA/ROCK-mediated activity by in vitro experiments on isolated cells. In conclusion, HFD-related MetS features are associated to bladder derangements, which are ameliorated by testosterone or INT-747 administration. INT-747 showed the most marked effects in counteracting MetS-related RhoA/ROCK overactivity, thus opening novel therapeutic opportunities for this drug.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NAFLD has such an epidemic prevalence as to make it impossible to screen general population looking for NAFLD cases. Conversely, focusing on those cohorts of individuals exposed to the highest risk of NAFLD could be a more rational approach. NAFLD, which can be diagnosed with either non-invasive strategies or through liver biopsy, is a pathogenically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. The existence of metabolic as opposed to genetic-associated disease, notably including "lean NAFLD" has recently been recognized. Moreover, NAFLD is a systemic condition, featuring metabolic, cardiovascular and (hepatic/extra-hepatic) cancer risk. Among the clinico-laboratory features of NAFLD we discuss hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, gallstones,  and selected endocrine derangements. NAFLD is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome and progressive liver disease develops in T2D patients in whom the course of disease is worsened by NAFLD. Finally, lifestyle changes and drug treatment options to be implemented in the individual patient are also critically discussed. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the new concepts on clinical and pathogenic heterogeneity of NAFLD, a systemic disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations. It is highly prevalent in certain cohorts of individuals who are thus potentially amenable to selective screening strategies, intensive follow-up schedules for early identification of liver-related and extrahepatic complications and in whom earlier and more aggressive treatment schedules should be carried out whenever possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237451>Differential effects of a 40-hour fast and bile  supplementation on human GLP-1 and FGF19 responses.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) play an important role in postprandial metabolism.

After an overnight fast, we observed strong correlations between postprandial  and gDCA levels at specific time points. In , administration of gDCA increased GLP-1 levels and lowered late postprandial glucose without effect on FGF19. Energy expenditure was not affected by gDCA administration. Unexpectedly, 40 h of fasting increased both GLP-1 and FGF19, where the former appeared bile  independent and the latter bile  dependent. Second, a single dose of gDCA increased postprandial GLP-1.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of  signalling and is localised on the ER membrane. The aim of the study was to investigate the cross-talk between ER stress and PTP1B.Leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob), Ptp1b (also known as Ptpn1) knockout and C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a high-fat or normal-chow diet for 20 weeks. ER stress was induced in cultured myotubes by treatment with tunicamycin. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to assess proteins involved in the ER stress response. Myotube glucose uptake was determined by measuring 2-deoxy[(3)H]glucose incorporation.A high-fat diet induced ER stress and PTP1B expression in the muscle tissue of mice and these responses were attenuated by treatment with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA). Cultured myotubes exhibited increased levels of PTP1B in response to tunicamycin treatment. Silencing of Ptp1b with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or overexpression of Ptp1b with adenovirus construct failed to alter the levels of ER stress. Ptp1b knockout mice did not differ from the wild-type mice in the extent of tunicamycin-induced upregulation of glucose-regulated protein-78. However, tunicamycin-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase-2 were significantly attenuated in the Ptp1b knockout mice.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the hepatic hallmark of MetS, is regarded as an active player in the pathogenesis of MetS-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study was aimed at evaluating the relationship between MetS-induced NASH and penile dysfunction. We used a non-genomic, high fat diet (HFD)-induced, rabbit model of MetS, and treated HFD rabbits with testosterone (T), with the selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA), or with the anti-TNFα mAb infliximab. Rabbits fed a regular diet were used as controls. Liver histomorphological and gene expression analysis demonstrated NASH in HFD rabbits. Several genes related to inflammation (including TNFα), activation of stellate cells, fibrosis, and lipid metabolism parameters were negatively associated to maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in penis. When all these putative liver determinants of penile Ach responsiveness were tested as covariates in a multivariate model, only the association between hepatic TNFα expression and Ach response was confirmed. Accordingly, circulating levels of TNFα were increased 15-fold in HFD rabbits. T and OCA dosing in HFD rabbits both reduced TNFα liver expression and plasma levels, with a parallel increase of penile eNOS expression and responsiveness to Ach. Also neutralization of TNFα with infliximab treatment fully normalized HFD-induced hypo-responsiveness to Ach, as well as responsiveness to vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Thus, MetS-induced NASH in HFD rabbits plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ED, likely through TNFα, as indicated by treatments reducing liver and circulating TNFα levels (T or OCA), or neutralizing TNFα action (infliximab), which significantly improve penile responsiveness to Ach in HFD rabbits.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the exact mechanisms whereby FGF21 mediates  sensitivity remain not fully understood. In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and metabolic parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and  signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced body weight, blood glucose and serum , and increased  sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of . Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored  signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  increased adiponectin expression and improved  in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes. In conclusion, our results showed that the administration of FGF21 reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored  signaling via inhibiting ER stress under the condition of , demonstrating the causative role of ER stress in downregulating adiponectin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202273>Effects of barley variety, dietary fiber and β-glucan content on bile  composition in cecum of rats fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced obesity and  have been linked to changes in bile  (BA) profiles, which in turn are highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, lithocholic-, - and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Over the last decade, it has become well accepted that this resolution of diabetes occurs before significant weight loss; however, the mechanisms behind this effect remain unknown and could represent novel therapeutic targets for obesity and diabetes. Bile acids have been identified as putative mediators of these weight loss-independent effects.To identify the longitudinal changes in bile acids after RYGB, which may provide mechanistic insight into the weight loss-independent effects of RYGB.Observational study before/after intervention.Academic medical center.Samples were collected from morbidly obese patients (n = 21) before and after RYGB.RYGB.Seventeen individual bile  species were measured preoperatively and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Anthropometric, hormonal, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp data were also examined to identify physiological parameters associated with bile  changes.Fasting total plasma bile acids increased after RYGB; however, increases were bimodal and were observed only at 1 (P < .05) and 24 months (P < .01). One-month increases were secondary to surges in ursodeoxycholic  and its glycine and taurine conjugates, bacterially derived bile acids with putative -sensitizing effects. Increases at 24 months were due to gradual rises in primary unconjugated bile acids as well as  and its glycine conjugate. Plasma bile  changes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric or hormonal measures, although hepatic  sensitivity was significantly improved at 1 month.Overall findings suggest that bacterially derived bile acids may mediate the early improvements at 1 month after RYGB. Future studies should examine the changes in specific bile  chemical species after bariatric procedures and bile -specific signaling changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21282643>Neural dysregulation of peripheral  action and blood pressure by brain endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was recently revealed to affect hypothalamic neuroendocrine pathways that regulate feeding and body weight. However, it remains unexplored whether brain ER stress could use a neural route to rapidly cause the peripheral disorders that underlie the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the metabolic syndrome. Using a pharmacologic model that delivered ER stress inducer thapsigargin into the brain, this study demonstrated that a short-term brain ER stress over 3 d was sufficient to induce glucose intolerance, systemic and hepatic , and blood pressure (BP) increase. The collection of these changes was accompanied by elevated sympathetic tone and prevented by sympathetic suppression. Molecular studies revealed that acute induction of metabolic disorders via brain ER stress was abrogated by NF-κB inhibition in the hypothalamus. Therapeutic experiments further revealed that acute inhibition of brain ER stress with tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) partially reversed obesity-associated metabolic and blood pressure disorders. In conclusion, ER stress in the brain represents a mediator of the sympathetic disorders that underlie the development of  syndrome and T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094181>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a cause and consequence of cardio-metabolic complications.

It included patients with biopsy-proven NASH. The patients were randomized into three groups: NAC (1.2 g) + UDCA (15 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=26); UDCA (20 mg/kg) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=13); NAC (1.2g) + MTF (850-1500 mg/day) (n=14) for 48 weeks. Clinical, laboratory and the second liver biopsies were performed after 48 weeks.A total of 53 patients were evaluated; 17 (32.1%) were males; median age ±54 (IQR=15, 21-71) years. In the baseline, no difference was seen between groups according clinical and histological parameters. The groups differed only in cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. No significant differences in biochemical and histologic parameters were found between these the three groups after 48 weeks of treatment. In the intragroup analysis (intention-to-treat) comparing histological and biochemical features, there were significant improvements in the steatosis degree (P=0.014), ballooning (0.027) and, consequently, in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (P=0.005), and in the ALT levels at the end of the treatment only in the NAC + MTF group. No significant evidence of modification in the liver fibrosis could be observed in any of the groups.This multicenter study suggests that the association of NAC + MTF could reduce the liver disease activity in patients with NASH.

However, the effects of diets high in whole versus refined grains on circulating bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and inflammation through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5), have not been studied.We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial () in 80 healthy adults (40 women/40 men, age 18-45 years) from the greater Seattle Area, half of which were normal weight (BMI 18.5-25.0 kg/m) and half overweight to obese (BMI 28.0-39.9 kg/m). Participants consumed two four-week controlled diets in randomized order: 1) a whole grain diet (WG diet), designed to be low in glycemic load (GL), high in whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, and 2) a refined grain diet (RG diet), designed to be high GL, high in refined grains and added sugars, separated by a four-week washout period. Quantitative targeted analysis of 55 bile  species in fasting plasma was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of glucose, , and CRP were measured in fasting serum. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of diet on bile  concentrations, and determine the association between plasma bile  concentrations and HOMA-IR and CRP. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was used to control for multiple testing.A total of 29 plasma bile acids were reliably detected and retained for analysis. Taurolithocholic  (TLCA), taurocholic  (TCA) and glycocholic  (GCA) were statistically significantly higher after the WG compared to the RG diet (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant differences by BMI or sex. When evaluating the association of bile acids and HOMA-IR, GCA, taurochenodeoxycholic , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), 5β‑cholanic ‑3β,12α‑diol, 5‑cholanic ‑3β‑ol, and glycodeoxycholic  (GDCA) were statistically significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR individually, and as a group, total, 12α‑hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile acids were also significant (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by BMI, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), cholic  (CA), UDCA, 5β-cholanic -3β, , and total, 12α-hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile  groups were significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR among overweight to obese individuals (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by sex, GCA, CDCA, TCA, CA, UDCA, GDCA, glycolithocholic  (GLCA), total, primary, 12α‑hydroxylated, and glycine-conjugated bile acids were significantly associated with HOMA-IR among women, and CDCA, GDCA, and GLCA were significantly associated among men (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant associations between bile acids and CRP.Diets with comparable macronutrient and energy composition, but differing in carbohydrate source, affected fasting plasma bile acids differently. Specifically, a diet characterized by whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars led to modest increases in concentrations of TLCA, TCA and GCA, ligands for FXR and TGR5, which may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In rodents,  regulates BA composition, in part by regulating the BA 12α-hydroxylase CYP8B1. However, it is unclear whether a similar effect occurs in humans. To address this question, we examined the relationship between clamp-measured  sensitivity and plasma BA composition in a cohort of 200 healthy subjects and 35 type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. In healthy subjects,  (IR) was associated with increased 12α-hydroxylated BAs (cholic , , and their conjugated forms).

In T2D patients, BAs were nearly twofold elevated, and more hydrophobic, compared with healthy subjects, although we did not observe disproportionate increases in 12α-hydroxylated BAs. In multivariate analysis of the whole dataset, controlling for sex, age, BMI, and glucose tolerance status, higher 12α-hydroxy/non-12α-hydroxy BA ratios were associated with lower  sensitivity and higher plasma TGs.

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and microbiota composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting , and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal microbiota correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with  to the weight-lowering and -sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation.

The primary study end point was reduction in ALT levels from baseline in patients treated with HD-UDCA compared with placebo. Secondary study end points were the proportion of patients with ALT normalization, relative reduction in the scores of serum markers of fibrosis and hepatic inflammation, and safety and tolerability.HD-UDCA significantly reduced mean ALT levels -28.3% from baseline after 12 months compared with -1.6% with placebo (p<0.001).

One of their common denominators is hypogonadism. However, testosterone supplementation is limited by concerns for potential prostatic side effects. The objective was to determine whether MetS-associated prostate alterations are prevented by testosterone supplementation. We used a previously described animal model of MetS, obtained by feeding male rabbits a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Subsets of HFD rabbits were treated with testosterone or with the farnesoid X receptor agonist INT-747. Rabbits fed a standard diet were used as controls. HFD-animals develop hypogonadism and all the MetS features: hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and visceral obesity. In addition, HFD-animals show a prostate inflammation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that HFD-induced prostate fibrosis, hypoxia, and inflammation. The mRNA expression of several proinflammatory (IL8, IL6, IL1β, and TNFα), T lymphocyte (CD4, CD8, Tbet, Gata3, and ROR γt), macrophage (TLR2, TLR4, and STAMP2), neutrophil (lactoferrin), inflammation (COX2 and RAGE), and fibrosis/myofibroblast activation (TGFβ, SM22α, αSMA, RhoA, and ROCK1/ROCK2) markers was significantly increased in HFD prostate. Testosterone, as well as INT-747, treatment prevented some MetS features, although only testosterone normalized all the HFD-induced prostate alterations. Interestingly, the ratio between testosterone and estradiol plasma level retains a significant, negative, association with all the fibrosis and the majority of inflammatory markers analyzed. These data highlight that testosterone protects rabbit prostate from MetS-induced prostatic hypoxia, fibrosis, and inflammation, which can play a role toward the development/progression of BPH/LUTS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954560>Alterations in the metabolism of phospholipids, bile acids and branched-chain amino acids predicts development of type 2 diabetes in black South African women: a prospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>South Africa (SA) has the highest global projected increase in diabetes risk.

At baseline: the NGT-T2D group had i) a higher lysophosphatidylcholine:lysophosphatidylethanolamine ratio containing linoleic  (LPC(C18:2):LPE(C18:2)), ii) lower proliferation-related bile acids (ursodeoxycholic- and chenodeoxycholic ), iii) higher levels of leucine and its catabolic intermediates (ketoleucine and C5-carnitine), compared to the NGT-NGT group. At follow-up: the NGT-T2D group had i) lower LPC(C18:2) levels, ii) higher apoptosis-related bile acids (- and glycodeoxycholic ), and iii) higher levels of all BCAAs and their catabolic intermediates.Changes in lysophospholipid metabolism and the bile  pool occur during the development of type 2 diabetes in black South African women. Further, impaired leucine catabolism precedes valine and isoleucine catabolism in the development of type 2 diabetes. These metabolite patterns can be useful to identify and monitor type 2 diabetes risk >10 years prior to disease onset and provide insight into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in this high risk, but under-studied population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study we have investigated whether administering obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, a genetic model of obesity associated with dyslipidemia and , with an FXR ligand protects against lipid-induced cardiomyopathy.FXR is expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes and the treatment with FXR agonists, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and GW4064, increased the mRNA expression of FXR and its canonical target gene, the small heterodimer partner (SHP), as well as proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARα, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-4). Feeding obese fa/fa rats with CDCA, 12 weeks, reduced hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidaemia. The histological-pathological analysis of hearts demonstrated that treatment with the FXR ligand reduced lipid heart content decreased the rate of apoptosis, fibrosis scores and restored heart  signalling.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis once considered a benign process is now known to lead to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic liver disease, the exact aetiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease remains unknown, but the fundamental pathophysiological process appears to be  and oxidative stress related to the metabolic syndrome.

It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type-2 . Consumption of fructose is linked to increased prevalence of MS. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a steroid bile  with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities and has been shown to improve insulin resistance. The current study aims to investigate the effect of UDCA (150 mg/kg) on MS induced in rats by fructose administration (10%) in drinking water for 12 weeks. The effects of UDCA were compared to fenofibrate (100 mg/kg), an agonist of PPAR-α receptors. Treatment with UDCA or fenofibrate started from the 6th week after fructose administration once daily. Fructose administration resulted in significant increase in body weight, elevations of blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), uric  levels, insulin resistance index and blood pressure compared to control rats. Moreover, fructose increased oxidative stress in aortic tissues indicated by significant increases of malondialdehyde (MDA), expression of iNOS and reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) content. These disturbances were associated with decreased eNOS expression, increased infiltration of leukocytes and loss of aortic vascular elasticity. Treatment with UDCA successfully ameliorated the deleterious effects of fructose. The protective effect of UDCA could be attributed to its ability to decrease uric  level, improve insulin resistance and diminish oxidative stress in vascular tissues. These results might support possible clinical application of UDCA in MS patients especially those present with liver diseases, taking into account its tolerability and safety. However, further investigations on human subjects are needed before the clinical application of UDCA for this indication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064031>Metabolic syndrome induces inflammation and impairs gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus in rabbits.</a></h2><p>Rabbits with high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and showed a reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immunopositivity in the hypothalamus. This study investigated the relationship between MetS and hypothalamic alterations in HFD-rabbits. Gonadotropin levels decreased as a function of MetS severity, hypothalamic gene expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). HFD determined a low-grade inflammation in the hypothalamus, significantly inducing microglial activation, expression and immunopositivity of IL-6, as well as GLUT4 and reduced immunopositivity for KISS1 receptor, whose mRNA expression was negatively correlated to glucose intolerance. Correcting glucose metabolism with obetcholic  improved hypothalamic alterations, reducing GLUT4 and IL-6 immunopositivity and significantly increasing GnRH mRNA, without, however, preventing HFD-related HH. No significant effects at the hypothalamic level were observed after systemic anti-inflammatory treatment (infliximab). Our results suggest that HFD-induced metabolic derangements negatively affect GnRH neuron function through an inflammatory injury at the hypothalamic level.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

By degrading dietary substrates, the gut microbiota produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles. Unravelling the signalling mechanisms of the microbial-mammalian metabolic axis adds one more layer of complexity to the physiopathology of CMD and opens new avenues for the development of microbiota-based pharmacological therapies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most patients with NAFLD face medical complications related to their underlying MS in other organ systems; however, a small but significant group of patients with the more aggressive form of fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As patients are generally asymptomatic, often their disease goes unrecognized. This is particularly true for NASH, where liver biopsy is currently required to make the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, no one treatment has been shown to be universally efficacious and those that are of benefit are not without side effects.

An overall summary of the articles was developed for each section of discussion in this review.NASH associated with metabolic syndrome can progress advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Weight loss and lifestyle modification have been shown to improve NASH. Other medications used for weight loss and metabolic syndrome have been evaluated, such as orlistat, metformin and thiazolidinediones. Alternative regimens using ursodeoxycholic , statins and probiotics as well as bariatric surgery have been evaluated, but have not been recommended as first-line treatment for NASH. Vitamin E for NASH patients without diabetes seems to be promising. The lack of effective treatment for NASH suggests the heterogeneity of patients presenting with the NASH phenotype. The best treatment strategy for these patients may be to identify their pathogenic target and develop personalised treatment protocols.Currently, there are few options available for the management of NASH.

BA dysregulation plays an important role in the development of metabolic disease. However, BAs in relation to fatty acids have not been fully investigated in obesity-related metabolic disorders. A targeted metabolomic measurement of serum BA and free fatty  profiles was applied to sera of 381 individuals in 2 independent studies. The results showed that the ratio of dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) to  (DCA) species (DCAS) was significantly increased in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from a case-control study and decreased in the remission group of obese subjects with T2DM after metabolic surgery.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced  and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

Additionally, owing to divergent data, the objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of UDCA on glycemic parameters in clinical trials. Clinical trials investigating the impact of UDCA treatment on glycemic markers were searched in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases (from inception to April 16, 2018). A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method.

Hence, accumulation of lipids in the liver is considered to be one of the risk factors for  and metabolic syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is widely used for the treatment of liver dysfunction. We investigated the therapeutic effects of UDCA on type 2 diabetes mellitus exacerbating hepatic steatosis and the underlying mechanisms of its action using KK-A(y) mice fed a high-fat diet. KK-A(y) mice were prefed a high-fat diet; and 50, 150, and 450 mg/kg of UDCA was orally administered for 2 or 3 weeks. Administration of UDCA decreased fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analyses showed that UDCA improved hepatic (but not peripheral) . Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents were significantly reduced by treatment with UDCA, although the genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, including fatty  synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, were upregulated. Fecal levels of bile acids, neutral sterols, fatty acids, and phospholipids were significantly increased by UDCA treatment. The gene expression levels and protein phosphorylation levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were not changed by UDCA treatment. These results indicate that UDCA ameliorates hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia by improving hepatic  and steatosis in high-fat diet-fed KK-A(y) mice. Reduction of hepatic lipids might be due to their excretion in feces, followed by enhanced utilization of glucose for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol.

However, the detection is obstructed by the low contents, structural diversity, high structural similarity, and matrix interference. Herein, a fast cholamine-derivatization, within 1 min at room temperature, coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach was developed to determine LCFFAs in complex samples. After derivatization, the ionization and separation efficiency were significantly improved, which resulted in up to 2000-fold increase of sensitivity compared with non-derivatization method, and the limits of detection were at low femtogram level. As well, this approach was applied successfully in the rapid profiling or quantification of targeted and non-targeted LCFFAs in the sera of healthy human and asthma patients. The targeted metabolomics method showed that the contents of 17 PUFAs were significantly changed in asthma patients, especially hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (HPETEs) and prostaglandins (PGs).

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of cholic  (CA) or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) administration on portal and systemic levels of GLP-1 in genetically obese mice with established hepatic steatosis. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice were fed CA or UDCA during 4 weeks. Systemic and portal GLP-1 levels were measured as well as glucose tolerance test, serum and biliary parameters, hepatic triglyceride content, liver histology, and hepatic gene expression of relevant genes related to bile secretion. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice exhibited marked obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and fasting hyperglycemia. Administration of both CA and UDCA was associated to decreased hepatic triglyceride content and complete reversion of histological steatosis. BA-fed animals did not exhibit significant differences in glucose tolerance. In addition, neither CA nor UDCA administration significantly influenced portal or systemic GLP-1 levels. CA and UDCA strongly ameliorated established fatty liver in ob/ob mice independently of the GLP-1 incretin pathway. Thus, the anti-steatotic action of these bile acids is likely related to direct hepatic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27170389>Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis: From Pathophysiology to Novel Therapies.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) disease is defined by an accumulation of liver fat exceeding 5% of its weight in the absence of significant alcoholic intake.

Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20829802>FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation and : involvement of ER stress and IKKβ pathways.</a></h2><p>Free-fatty acids (FFAs) are well-characterized factor for causing production of inflammatory factors and  in adipocytes. Using cultured adipocytes, we demonstrate that FFAs can activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway by examination of ER stress sensor activation and marker gene expression. Chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) can reduce FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation and improve  signaling whereas overexpression of spliced X-box protein 1 (XBP-1s) only attenuates FFA-induced inflammation. PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (PERK) is one of the three major ER stress sensor proteins and deficiency of PERK alleviates FFA-induced inflammation and . The key downstream target of FFA-induced ER stress is IκB kinase β (IKKβ), a master kinase for regulating expression of inflammatory genes. Deficiency of PERK attenuates FFA-induced activation of IKKβ and deficiency of IKKβ alleviates FFA-induced inflammation and . Consistently, overexpression of IKKβ in 3T3-L1 CAR adipocytes causes inflammation and . In addition, IKKβ overexpression has profound effect on adipocyte lipid metabolism, including inhibition of lipogenesis and promotion of lipolysis. Furthermore, increased endogenous IKKβ expression and activation is also observed in isolated primary adipocytes from mice injected with lipids or fed on high-fat diet (HFD) acutely. These results indicate that ER stress pathway is a key mediator for FFA-induced inflammation and  in adipocytes with PERK and IKKβ as the critical signaling components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093351>Effects of Ursodeoxycholic  and  on Palmitate-Induced ROS Production and Down-Regulation of PI3K/Akt Signaling Activity.</a></h2><p>In obese and diabetic patients, plasma free fatty  (FFA) levels are often elevated and may play a causal role in  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We have previously shown that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has antioxidative activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling-mediated glutathione production. In this study, we investigated the effects of UDCA on  response by analyzing intracellular ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The level of ROS was quantified using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA), and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting assay using appropriate antibodies. The intracellular ROS levels were increased by palmitate but were reduced by treatment with UDCA and . Furthermore,  significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. When the cells were pre-treated with palmitate, -induced Akt-phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. However, when the cells were treated with palmitate and UDCA, the effects of  were partially restored.

Consistently, the  stimulation of the PI 3-kinase-dependent K(+) uptake, hepatocyte swelling and proteolysis inhibition was blunted by TLCS in perfused rat liver. The PKC inhibitor Go6850 and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) counteracted the suppression of -induced IRbeta and PKB phosphorylation by TLCS. Rapamycin and dibutyryl-cAMP, which inhibited basal signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), restored -induced PKB- but not IRbeta phosphorylation. In livers from 7 day bile duct-ligated rats PKB Ser(473) phosphorylation was decreased by about 50%.TLCS induces  by a PKC-dependent suppression of -induced IRbeta phosphorylation and the PI 3-kinase/PKB path.

Activation of FXR may ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia, a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome. Because hamsters share many characteristic features of human lipid metabolism, we used a high-fructose-fed hamster model to study the impact of FXR activation with chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Male Syrian hamsters fed a diet containing 60% kcal from fructose for 2 wk developed hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (+120 and +60%, P = 0.005 and 0.0004 vs. controls) due to increased hepatic lipoprotein production. This could be largely attributed to enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as indicated by increased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, fatty  synthase, and steaoryl-CoA desaturase-1. Lipoprotein analysis demonstrated that the increase in plasma triglycerides occurred in the VLDL density range, whereas increases in VLDL, IDL/LDL, and HDL cholesterol accounted for the elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Addition of 0.1% CDCA to the high-fructose diet decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and consequently triglyceride production and prevented the increases in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol (-40 and -18%, P = 0.03 and 0.03 vs. high fructose-fed animals). CDCA-treated animals had lower VLDL triglycerides and decreased VLDL and IDL/LDL cholesterol plasma concentrations. These data demonstrate that activation of FXR with CDCA effectively lowers plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, mainly by decreasing de novo lipogenesis and hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Our studies identify activators of FXR as promising new tools in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemic states, including the  syndrome and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817118>[DYNAMIC OF CLINICAL, LABORATORY AND SONOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS AFTER SUCCESSFUL LITHOLITIC THERAPY AT PATIENTS WITH GALLSTONE DISEASE IN ASSOCIATION WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME].</a></h2><p>The aim of study was to determine the leading clinical, immunological and sonographic pararneters, reflecting the efficiency of Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) at the rate of 10 mg per 1 kg of body weight in the treatment of gallstone disease in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS).An assessment of clinical, biochemical immunological and sonographic parameters in 54 patients with gallstone disease associated with the metabolic syndrome before and after the six-month treatment UDCA were made.In accordance with our results the significant predictors, reflecting successful litholitic therapy at patients with gallstone disease in association with metabolic syndrome are decrease the serum concentration of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (P = 0.003), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (P = 0.001), increase the serum concentration of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (P = 0.02), decrease the left liver lobe thickness (P = 0,003) and the thickness of gallbladder wall (P = 0.0002).The results of our study have shown that the therapy with ursodesoxycholic  of patients with metabolic syndrome leads to decrease of factors of gallstone progression (elevated levels of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and increased thickness of the left lobe liver and gallbladder wall).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10664531>In the search for specific inhibitors of human 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs): chenodeoxycholic  selectively inhibits 11beta-HSD-I.</a></h2><p>Selective inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type I may be of therapeutical interest for two reasons: i) 9alpha-Fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids like 11-dehydro-dexamethasone (DH-D) are rapidly activated by human kidney 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type II (11beta-HSD-II) to dexamethasone (D). If the same reaction by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I could be selectively inhibited, DH-D could be used for selective renal immunosuppressive therapy. ii) Reduction of cortisone to cortisol in the liver may increase  in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and inhibition of the enzyme may lead to a decrease in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, we characterized the metabolism of DH-D by human hepatic 11beta-HSD-I and tried to find a selective inhibitor of this isoenzyme.For kinetic analysis of 11beta-HSD-I, we used microsomes prepared from unaffected parts of liver segments, resected because of hepatocarcinoma or metastatic disease. For inhibition experiments, we also tested 11beta-HSD-II activity with human kidney cortex microsomes. The inhibitory potency of several compounds was evaluated for oxidation and reduction in concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5)mol/l.Whereas D was not oxidized by human liver microsomes at all, cortisol was oxidized to cortisone with a maximum velocity (V(max)) of 95pmol/mg per min. The reduction of DH-D to D (V(max)=742pmol/mg per min, Michaelis--Menten constant (K(m))=1.6 micromol/l) was faster than that of cortisone to cortisol (V(max)=187pmol/mg per min). All reactions tested in liver microsomes showed the characteristics of 11beta-HSD-I: K(m) values in the micromolar range, preferred cosubstrate NADP(H), no product inhibition. Of the substances tested for inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I and -II, chenodeoxycholic  was the only one that selectively inhibited 11beta-HSD-I (IC(50) for reduction: 2.8x10(-6)mol/l, IC(50) for oxidation: 4.4x10(-6)mol/l), whereas ketoconazole preferentially inhibited oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by 11beta-HSD-II. Metyrapone, which is reduced to metyrapol by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, inhibited steroid reductase activity of 11beta-HSD-I and -II and oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD-II. These findings can be explained by substrate competition for reductase reactions and by product inhibition of the oxidation, which is a well-known characteristic of 11beta-HSD-II.Our in vitro results may offer a new concept for renal glucocorticoid targeting. Oral administration of small amounts of DH-D (low substrate affinity for 11beta-HSD-I) in combination with chenodeoxycholic  (selective inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I) may prevent hepatic first pass reduction of DH-D, thus allowing selective activation of DH-D to D by the high affinity 11beta-HSD-II in the kidney. Moreover, selective inhibitors of the hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, like chenodeoxycholic , may become useful in the therapy of patients with hepatic  including diabetes mellitus type II, because cortisol enhances gluconeogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22289951>[Obesity and gallbladder diseases].</a></h2><p>Obesity is an important health problem in the world and related to many critical diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome.

Here we show that ER stress-induced  receptor (IR) down-regulation may play a critical role in obesity-induced . The expression levels of IR are negatively associated with the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in  target tissues of db/db mice and mice fed a high-fat diet. Significant IR down-regulation was also observed in fat tissue of obese human subjects and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with ER stress inducers. ER stress had little effect on IR tyrosine phosphorylation per se but greatly reduced IR downstream signaling. The ER stress-induced reduction in IR cellular levels was greatly alleviated by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine but not by the proteasome inhibitor N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132). Inhibition of autophagy prevented IR degradation but did not rescue IR downstream signaling, consistent with an adaptive role of autophagy in response to ER stress-induced .

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating  sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of  through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs  signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of -associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.

However, dietary cholesterol intake was superabundant in non-obese patients compared with obese patients, although total energy and carbohydrate intake was not excessive. Therefore, excess cholesterol intake appears to be one of the main factors associated with NAFLD development and liver injury.We reviewed a year of follow-up data of non-obese NAFLD patients treated with Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 inhibitor ezetimibe to evaluate its therapeutic effect on clinical parameters related to NAFLD. Without any dietary or exercise modification, 10 mg/day of ezetimibe was given to 8 patients. In 4 of 8 patients, ezetimibe was administered initially. In the remaining 4 patients, medication was switched from ursodeoxycholic  to ezetimibe.In each patient, body mass index was maintained under 25 kg/m2 during the observation period. Serum ALT levels significantly decreased within 6 months and in 4 patients levels reached the normal range (<30 U/L), which was accompanied with at least a 10% decrease in serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. However, ultrasonographic findings of fatty liver did not show obvious improvement for a year.We conclude that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can suppress hepatic injury in non-obese patients with NAFLD and that ezetimibe may offer a novel treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27895393>Emerging role of obeticholic  in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic liver disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer.

Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on  are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation.
