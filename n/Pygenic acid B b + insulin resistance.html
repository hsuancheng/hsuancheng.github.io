In this study, we investigated the effects of two fatty acids, palmitate (PA) and arachidonic  (AA) on glycogenesis under  signaling in HepG2cells, a transformed hepatic carcinoma cell line. In the presence of 200 Î¼mol of palmitate,  (10(-7) mol/L) stimulation of glycogenesis was inhibited, as evidenced by increased glucose in the medium and decreased intracellular glycogen. Wortmannin (WM), a specific inhibitor of PI3K, dramatically decreased the amount of intracellular glycogen in cells without PA incubation. However, glycogen in PA treated cells was not significantly changed by WM, indicating that PA may also act on PI3K. Interestingly, AA restored the effects of WM inhibition on glycogenesis in PA cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PA in the absence of WM increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase (inactive form of GS) and decreased phosphorylated protein kinase  (active form of PKB), causing a reduction of intracellular glycogen. AA, however, reversed the effects of PA on GS and PKB. Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by a specific inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (CC) abolished the inhibitory effect of PA on glycogen synthesis by decreasing phosphorylated GS and increasing phosphorylated PKB. However, the effect of CC in the presence of PA disappeared when AA was also present.Our results suggest that there is a disruption of the  signaling pathway between PKB and GS when the cells were exposed to PA, contributing to IR. PA may also interrupt the PKC signaling pathway. In contrast, AA could rescue glycogenesis impaired by PA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776912>Clinopodium chinense Attenuates Palmitic -Induced Vascular Endothelial Inflammation and   through TLR4-Mediated NF-   and MAPK Pathways.</a></h2><p>Elevated palmitic  (PA) levels are associated with the development of inflammation,   (IR) and endothelial dysfunction. Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced inflammation and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa  kinase  , nuclear factor kappa- (NF-  ), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased -mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse  mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired  signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-   and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8100834>Impaired fatty  metabolism in familial combined hyperlipidemia. A mechanism associating hepatic apolipoprotein  overproduction and  .</a></h2><p>To establish whether   and/or postprandial fatty  metabolism might contribute to familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) we have examined parameters of   and lipid metabolism in six FCH kindreds. Probands and relatives (n = 56) were divided into three tertiles on the basis of fasting plasma triglycerides (TG). Individuals in the highest tertile (TG > 2.5 mM; n = 14) were older and had increased body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma  concentrations compared with individuals in the lowest tertile (n = 24). The former also presented with decreased HDL cholesterol and increased total plasma cholesterol, HDL-TG, and apoprotein , E, and CIII concentrations.  concentrations were positively correlated with plasma apo , apo CIII, apo E, and TG, and inversely with HDL cholesterol. Fasting nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were elevated in FCH subjects compared to six unrelated controls and five subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. Prolonged and exaggerated postprandial plasma NEFA concentrations were found in five hypertriglyceridemic FCH probands. In FCH the X2 minor allele of the AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster was associated with increased fasting plasma TG, apo CIII, apo AI, and NEFA concentrations and decreased postheparin lipolytic activities. The clustering of risk factors associated with   in FCH indicates a common metabolic basis for the FCH phenotype and the syndrome of   probably mediated by an impaired fatty  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15252018>Fatty -induced   in L6 myotubes is prevented by inhibition of activation and nuclear localization of nuclear factor kappa .</a></h2><p>Recent studies have implicated inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) in mediating fatty  (FA)-induced  . How IKK causes these effects is unknown. The present study addressed the role of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), the distal target of IKK activity, in FA-induced   in L6 myotubes, an in vitro skeletal muscle model. A 6-h exposure of myotubes to the saturated FA palmitate reduced -stimulated glucose uptake by approximately 30%, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase  phosphorylation by approximately 40%, and stimulated inhibitor of kappaBalpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB. On the other hand, the Omega-3 polyunsaturated FA linolenate neither induced   nor promoted nuclear localization of NFkappaB. Supporting the hypothesis that IKK acts through NFkappaB to cause  , the IKK inhibitors acetylsalicylate and parthenolide prevented FA-induced reductions in -stimulated glucose uptake and NFkappaB nuclear translocation. Most importantly, NFkappaB SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits NFkappaB nuclear translocation downstream of IKK, was sufficient to prevent palmitate-induced reductions in -stimulated glucose uptake. Acetylsalicylate, but not NFkappaB SN50, prevented FA effects on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity and protein kinase  phosphorylation. We conclude that FAs induce   and activates NFkappaB in L6 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NFkappaB activation, indirectly by preventing IKK activation or directly by inhibiting NFkappaB nuclear translocation, prevents the detrimental effects of palmitate on the metabolic actions of  in L6 myotubes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1826300>Effect of nicotinic -induced   on pancreatic  cell function in normal and streptozocin-treated baboons.</a></h2><p>To study the interaction between  secretion and  action in maintaining glucose homeostasis, we induced experimental   in eight normal baboons, in six baboons treated with 40 mg/kg streptozocin (STZ-40), and in six baboons treated with 200 mg/kg streptozocin (STZ-200).   was induced by a 20-d continuous intravenous infusion of nicotinic  (NA). Normal animals showed compensatory increases in several measures of  secretion (fasting  [FI], acute  response to arginine [AIRarg], acute  response to glucose [AIRgluc], and glucose potentiation slope [delta AIRarg/delta G]), with no net change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAtc). STZ-40 animals showed compensatory increases in FI, AIRarg, and AIRgluc, but delta AIRarg/delta G failed to compensate. Although FPG remained normal in this group during NA infusion, HbA1c rose significantly. STZ-200 animals failed to show compensatory changes in both AIRgluc and delta AIRarg/delta G, with both HbA1c and FPG rising. These animals showed a paradoxical inhibition of  secretion in response to intravenous glucose during NA infusion, at a time when they were hyperglycemic. These data indicate that a significant degree of   does not cause hyperglycemia in the presence of normal  cell function but, in animals with reduced  cell mass and superimposed  , the degree of hyperglycemia is proportional to the degree of pancreatic  cell dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20185762>Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{delta} by GW501516 prevents fatty -induced nuclear factor-{kappa} activation and   in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acids cause   in skeletal muscle through the activation of a chronic inflammatory process. This process involves nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation as a result of diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation and subsequent protein kinase Ctheta (PKCtheta) phosphorylation. At present, it is unknown whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARdelta) activation prevents fatty -induced inflammation and   in skeletal muscle cells. In C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, the PPARdelta agonist GW501516 prevented phosphorylation of  receptor substrate-1 at Ser(307) and the inhibition of -stimulated Akt phosphorylation caused by exposure to the saturated fatty  palmitate. This latter effect was reversed by the PPARdelta antagonist GSK0660. Treatment with the PPARdelta agonist enhanced the expression of two well known PPARdelta target genes involved in fatty  oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, preventing the reduction in fatty  oxidation caused by palmitate exposure. In agreement with these changes, GW501516 treatment reversed the increase in DAG and PKCtheta activation caused by palmitate. These effects were abolished in the presence of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor etomoxir, thereby indicating that increased fatty  oxidation was involved in the changes observed. Consistent with these findings, PPARdelta activation by GW501516 blocked palmitate-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. Likewise, drug treatment inhibited the increase in IL-6 expression caused by palmitate in C2C12 and human skeletal muscle cells as well as the protein secretion of this cytokine. These findings indicate that PPARdelta attenuates fatty -induced NF-kappaB activation and the subsequent development of   in skeletal muscle cells by reducing DAG accumulation. Our results point to PPARdelta activation as a pharmacological target to prevent  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9012639>Differences in  suppression of free fatty  levels by gender and glucose tolerance status. Relation to plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein  concentrations.   Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) Investigators.</a></h2><p>Most discussions of relations of   to coronary heart disease risk factors have focused on -stimulated glucose uptake, but  suppression of plasma free fatty  (FFA) levels is also important in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. To identify groups with impaired  suppression of FFAs, we studied a multiethnic cohort of 1521 women and men at four US centers that comprise the   Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS): 682 with normal glucose tolerance, 352 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 487 with non--dependent diabetes. The FFA level 2 hours after a 75-gm oral glucose load adjusted for fasting FFAs was used as the measure of  suppression. After adjustment for age, center, ethnicity, body mass index, and fasting and 2-hour  levels, 2-hour FFA levels were significantly higher in men than women and in persons with impaired glucose tolerance and non--dependent diabetes mellitus versus normal glucose tolerance. The gender difference was largely accounted for by differences in central obesity as measured by waist-hip ratio; the difference by glucose tolerance status was not affected by central obesity, suggesting a different mechanism. In multivariate regression analyses, 2-hour FFA levels were strongly related to fasting triglyceride and apoB levels, respectively, after adjustment for age, fasting and 2-hour  concentrations, and fasting FFA concentrations. In summary, elevated plasma apoB and triglyceride concentrations associated with male gender and with glucose intolerance are partly accounted for by differences in the ability of  to suppress FFA concentrations.</p></html>
