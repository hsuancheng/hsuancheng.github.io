Tryptophan-d5 (TRP-d5) and carbamazepine (CAR) were applied to the method quantification, where TRP-d5 was the corresponding internal standard (IS) for TRP and KYN, and CAR was the corresponding IS for the other analytes. Plasma samples were processed by deproteinisation with acetonitrile, followed by separation on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column by using gradient elution with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water and acetonitrile and detection by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) within a total run time of 5 min. The calibration ranges were 3-600 ng/mL for 3-HK, 1.5-300 ng/mL for 5-HT, 25-5000 ng/mL for KYN, 1-200 ng/mL for XA, 100-20,000 ng/mL for TRP, 5-1000 ng/mL for KYNA, 2-400 ng/mL for 3-HAA, 2.5-500 ng/mL for 5-HIAA and 10-2000 ng/mL for IAA and IPA. All intra- and inter-day analytical variations were acceptable. Matrix effect and recovery evaluation proved that matrix effect can be negligible, and sample preparation approach was effective. The newly developed method can simultaneously determine a panel of TRP metabolites and was successfully applied in the clinical study characterising TRP  in healthy volunteers.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

(1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 60, 1286-1294) was reinvestigated with prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase purified from bovine vesicular gland microsomes. When the purified enzyme was incubated with arachidonic acid in the presence of hematin and tryptophan, a rapid light emission was observed. The  acid cyclo-oxygenase activity as demonstrated with manganese protoporphyrin was not responsible for the luminescence. When the hematin-requiring prostaglandin hydroperoxidase reaction (the conversion of prostaglandin G2 to H2) was carried out with tryptophan, skatole, or , the light emission was observed, but not with either epinephrine or guaiacol in place of tryptophan. The light intensity was dependent on the concentration of enzyme, hematin, tryptophan, and prostaglandin G2. Various other hydroperoxides in addition to prostaglandin G2 were also active. The luminescence spectrum recorded by a spectrometer equipped with a filter spectral analyzer gave emission peaks around 500, 550, and 610 nm. The spectrum was distinguishable from that of singlet oxygen, and was similar to that reported for a photochemical reaction of tryptophan.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583168>Evaluating internal exposure of sea turtles as model species for identifying regional chemical threats in nearshore habitats of the Great Barrier Reef.</a></h2><p>Marine megafauna that forage in proximity to land can be exposed to a diverse mixture of chemicals that - individually or combined - have the potential to affect their health. Characterizing such complex exposure and examining associations with health still poses considerable challenges. The present study summarizes the development and application of novel approaches to identifying chemical hazards and their potential impacts on the health of coastal wildlife, using green sea turtles as model species. We used an epidemiological study approach to collect blood and keratinized scute samples from free-ranging turtles foraging in nearshore areas and an offshore control site. These were analyzed using a combination of non-targeted, effect-based and multi-chemical analytical screening approaches to assess internal exposure to a wide range of chemicals. The screening phase identified a suite of elements (essential and non-essential) as priority for further investigation. Many of these elements are not commonly analyzed in marine wildlife, illustrating that comprehensive screening is important where exposure is unknown or uncertain. In particular, cobalt was present at highly elevated concentrations, in the order of those known to elicit acute effects across other vertebrate species. Several trace elements, including cobalt, were correlated with clinical indicators of impaired turtle health. In addition, biomarkers of oxidative stress (e.g.  and lipid peroxidation products) identified in the blood of turtles showed significant correlations with clinical health markers (particularly alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin), as well as with cobalt. To assist interpretation of trace element blood data in the absence of sufficient information on reptile toxicity, we established exposure reference intervals using a healthy control population. In addition, trace element exposure history was investigated by establishing temporal exposure indices using steady-state relationships between blood and scute. Overall, the data provide a strong argument for the notion that trace element exposure is having an impact on the health of coastal sea turtle populations.Copyright © 2018.

One of the aims of metabolomics is to research the response of an organism to a pathophysiological insult by measuring the concentrations of small molecule metabolites in biofluids and tissues and its dynamics. Intestinal microbiota is most probably involved in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and celiac disease. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC - MS) of serum generates comprehensive metabolic profiles, reflecting integrated human (systemic) and gut microbial metabolism which may be altered in disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate GC - MS-based serum metabolomic profiles in UC and CD patients. Serum metabolic profiles were collected from 75 individuals: 20 patients with mild-moderate active UC, 35 CD patients, and 20 healthy controls (HC). We characterized 84 serum metabolites by use GC-MS. 18 metabolites at least have a combined (human + microbial) origin. In serum of UC patients, phenylacetic acid (PAA), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), succinic acid (SA) and fumaric acid (FA) were the metabolites most prominently increased, whereas 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) was significantly decreased. Serum of CD patients showed significant increases in IAA,  (IPA), SA and FA. Increased serum levels of succinic acid suggest its possible damaging effect on intestinal mucosa especially in ulcerative colitis. Orally administered butyrate + inulin as supplement to mesalazine in UC or gluten free diet in CD was effective in reducing disease activity with a marked improvement of serum metabolomic profiles (including SA reduction) and gut microbiota in both diseases. There were no any adverse events.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23540839>Small molecule regulation of protein conformation by binding in the Flap of HIV protease.</a></h2><p>The fragment indole-6-carboxylic acid (1F1), previously identified as a flap site binder in a fragment-based screen against HIV protease (PR), has been cocrystallized with pepstatin-inhibited PR and with apo-PR. Another fragment,  (1F1-N), predicted by AutoDock calculations and confirmed in a novel inhibition of nucleation crystallization assay, exploits the same interactions in the flap site in two crystal structures. Both 1F1 and 1F1-N bind to the closed form of apo-PR and to pepstatin:PR. In solution, 1F1 and 1F1-N raise the Tm of apo-PR by 3.5-5 °C as assayed by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and show equivalent low-micromolar binding constants to both apo-PR and pepstatin:PR, assayed by backscattering interferometry (BSI). The observed signal intensities in BSI are greater for each fragment upon binding to apo-PR than to pepstatin-bound PR, consistent with greater conformational change in the former binding event.

The overall purification was about 25-fold with a yield of 4.5%. The purified enzyme was apparently homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight estimated by gel filtration was approximately 280,000 and sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) was 11 by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The absorption spectra indicated that the enzyme was a hemoprotein. The purified enzyme was shown to catalyze the reaction in which 1 mol each of NH3 and CO2 was formed at the expense of 1 mol each of L-tryptophan and molecular oxygen. Neither peroxidase nor catalase activity was detected in the purified enzyme and no formation of H2O2 was observed during the enzyme reaction. The product(s) of the reaction was unstable but was converted to and was identified as its stable quinoxaline derivative, 2-(3-indolyl)quinoxaline, in the presence of o-phenylenediamine. These results indicate that the product of the reaction was 3-indolylglycoaldehyde or 3-indolylglyoxal. A variety of other indole derivatives such as D-tryptophan, 5-hydroxyl-L-tryptophan, tryptamine, serotonin, melatonin, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan, N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide, 3-indoleacetamide, 3-indolelactic acid, , 3-indoleethanol, and skatole were also substrates.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29143552>Metabonomics analysis of serum from rats given long-term and low-level cadmium by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>1.

Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups, namely, the control group, low-dose group (0.13 mg/kg·bw), middle-dose group (0.8 mg/kg·bw) and high-dose group (4.89 mg/kg·bw). The rats continuously received CdCl via drinking water for 24 weeks. Serum samples were collected for metabonomics analysis. The data generated from the UPLC-MS was analysed using principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA model with satisfactory explanatory and predictive ability is capable of discriminating the treatment groups from the control group. 2. Finally, the 10 metabolites were identified and showed significant changes in some treatment groups compared with that in the control group (p < 0.0167 or p < 0.003).

The 422-nm absorption species has been considered to be the catalytically competent ketoenamine form of the Schiff base of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with a lysine residue. The 338-nm absorption band showed an intense fluorescence band at 390 nm and not around 500 nm, indicating that the 338-nm absorption species is the substituted aldamine rather than an enolimine form of the Schiff base which has been suggested previously. To explore the mechanism of the enzyme that can exert its catalytic ability at high pH where most of its coenzyme exists as the catalytically incompetent aldamine structure, the reaction of tryptophanase with 3-indolepropionate, a substrate analogue that stops the reaction at the step of the Michaelis complex, was studied at various pH values and analogue concentrations. Kinetic analysis was done based on a scheme involving eight forms of the enzyme, i.e., the liganded and unliganded forms of the ketoenamine, the substituted aldamine structures, and their protonated and deprotonated forms. Kinetic parameters were obtained for each interconversion step. The results showed that the binding of 3-indolepropionate to tryptophanase shifts the equilibrium from the substituted aldamine to the ketoenamine structure over the entire pH region studied. This implies that in the reaction of tryptophanase with tryptophan at high pH, where the enzyme shows maximum activity, the binding of the substrate to the enzyme converts the inactive aldamine form of the coenzyme to the active ketoenamine form. Mechanisms for the activation process, in which a nucleophile is expelled from the aldamine either by steric hindrance of the nucleophile with the ligand or by the negative charge of the ligand alpha-carboxylate group that stabilizes the aldimine structure, were discussed.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490564>[Studies on biotransformation of chemical constituents of tongmai formula by human intestinal flora].</a></h2><p>To study the chemical constituents in Tongmai formula (TMF) after biotransformation by human intestinal flora (HIF), water extract of TMF was anaerobically incubated with HIF at 37 degrees C.

Lipid peroxidation is involved in DNA damage, thus indirectly participating in the early steps of tumor initiation. Melatonin and structurally related indoles are effective in protecting against oxidative stress. The aim of the study was to compare the relative efficacies of melatonin, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and 5-hydroxy-indole-3-acetic acid (5HIAA) in altering basal and iron-induced lipid peroxidation in homogenates of hamster testes. To determine the effect of the indoles on the autoxidation of lipids, homogenates were incubated in the presence of each agent in concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mM. To study their effects on induced lipid peroxidation, homogenates were incubated with FeSO(4) (30 microM + H(2)O(2) (0.1 mM) + each of the indoles in the same concentrations as above. The degree of lipid peroxidation was expressed as concentrations of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals (MDA + 4-HDA) per mg protein. The indoles decreased both basal and iron-related lipid peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Melatonin reduced basal MDA + 4-HDA levels when used at the concentrations of 0.25 mM or higher, and prevented iron-induced lipid peroxidation at concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, or 5.0 mM. The lowest effective concentrations of NAS required to lower basal and iron-related lipid peroxidation were 0.05 mM and 0.25 mM, respectively. IPA, only when used in the highest concentrations of 2.5 mM or 5 mM inhibited basal lipid peroxidation levels and it was ineffective on the levels of MDA + 4-HDA due to iron damage. 5HIAA reduced basal lipid peroxidation when used at concentrations of 0.25 mM or higher, and it prevented iron-induced lipid peroxidation only at the highest applied concentration (5 mM). In conclusion, melatonin and related indoles at pharmacological concentrations protect against both the autoxidation of lipids as well as induced peroxidation of lipids in testes. In doing so, these agents would be expected to reduce testicular cancer that is initiated by products of lipid peroxidation.Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29621258>DIVA metabolomics: Differentiating vaccination status following viral challenge using metabolomic profiles.</a></h2><p>Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a major source of economic loss within the agricultural industry. Vaccination against BRD-associated viruses does not offer complete immune protection and vaccine failure animals present potential routes for disease spread. Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is possible using antigen-deleted vaccines, but during virus outbreaks DIVA responses are masked by wild-type virus preventing accurate serodiagnosis. Previous work by the authors has established the potential for metabolomic profiling to reveal metabolites associated with systemic immune responses to vaccination. The current study builds on this work by demonstrating for the first time the potential to use plasma metabolite profiling to differentiate between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals following infection-challenge. Male Holstein Friesian calves were intranasally vaccinated (Pfizer RISPOVAL®PI3+RSV) and subsequently challenged with Bovine Parainfluenza Virus type-3 (BPI3V) via nasal inoculation. Metabolomic plasma profiling revealed that viral challenge led to a shift in acquired plasma metabolite profiles from day 2 to 20 p.i., with 26 metabolites identified whose peak intensities were significantly different following viral challenge depending on vaccination status. Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin and decreased  in non-vaccinated animals at day 6 p.i. may be associated with increased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen scavenging at periods of peak virus titre. During latter stages of infection, increased levels of N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine and lysophosphatidycholine and decreased enterolactone in non-vaccinated animals may reflect suppression of innate immune response mechanisms and progression to adaptive immune responses. Levels of hexahydrohippurate were also shown to be significantly elevated in non-vaccinated animals from days 6 to 20 p.i. These findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic profiling to identify plasma markers that can be employed in disease diagnostic applications to both differentially identify infected non-vaccinated animals during disease outbreaks and provide greater information on the health status of infected animals.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26840773>A Structure-Guided Switch in the Regioselectivity of a Tryptophan Halogenase.</a></h2><p>Flavin-dependent halogenases are potentially useful biocatalysts for the regioselective halogenation of aromatic compounds.

Structure-guided mutagenesis resulted in a triple mutant (L460F/P461E/P462T) that exhibited a complete switch in regioselectivity; with the substrate 3-indolepropionate 75 % 5-chlorination was observed with the mutant in comparison to 90 % 6-chlorination for the wild-type SttH. This is the first clear example of how regiocomplementary halogenases can be created from a single parent enzyme.

Therefore, compounds that inhibit or even reverse Abeta aggregation might be useful for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. To identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a mass spectrometry-based screening assay was developed to identify and rank order compounds that inhibit the aggregation of Abeta. To carry out this assay, Abeta was incubated with a test compound at 37 degrees C for 20 h followed by ultrafiltration to separate the monomeric Abeta from its aggregates. Aliquots of the ultrafiltrate were analyzed for monomeric Abeta using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry based on the abundance the quadruply protonated molecule of Abeta at m/z 1083. The calibration curve for Abeta was linear with a correlation coefficient (r2) of >0.99 over the range of at least 11-110 microM. The limit of detection was 0.224 ng (5.18 nM, 10-microL injection), and the limit of quantitation was 0.747 ng (17.2 nM, 10-microL injection). Based on previous reports of compounds that either bind to Abeta or are useful in treating Alzheimer's disease, melatonin, methysticin, , and daunomycin were assayed and ranked in order of inhibition of Abeta aggregation. The most effective inhibitor of aggregation of Abeta protein was daunomycin followed in descending order by , melatonin, and then methysticin. These data suggest that this ultrafiltration LC-MS screening assay may be used to identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on the prevention of Abeta aggregation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389651>The role of water bridges in directing the conformational preferences of 3-indole-propionic acid and tryptamine.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612852>Clinical association between the metabolite of healthy gut microbiota,  and chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota serves an important role in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Chemical-shift changes of protein-backbone resonances and side-chain-amide resonances on ligand binding were measured with generally or selectively 15N-labelled protein. The patterns of changes in the chemical shifts of protein resonances and, particularly, ligand resonances distinguish the corepressors from the inducers, indicating, in agreement with earlier work, that corepressors and inducers bind to the protein in different ways.

This was accompanied by a near complete restoration of mitochondrial respiratory rates, membrane potential, and ATP levels in isolated mitochondria from the hippocampus, cortex, or striatum. When isolated mitochondria from untreated young mice were given melatonin, a slight increase in respiratory rate was observed. No such effect was observed in mitochondria from aged mice. In APP-expressing neuroblastoma cells in culture, mitochondrial function was restored by melatonin or by the structurally related compounds indole-3-propionic acid or N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine. This restoration was partially blocked by melatonin receptor antagonists indicating melatonin receptor signaling is required for the full effect. Therefore, treatments that stimulate melatonin receptor signaling may be beneficial for restoring mitochondrial function in AD, and preservation of mitochondrial function may an important mechanism by which long term melatonin treatment delays cognitive dysfunction in AD mice.© 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19338303>Structural insight into the inhibition of human kynurenine aminotransferase I/glutamine transaminase K.</a></h2><p>Human kynurenine aminotransferase I (hKAT I) catalyzes the formation of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive compound. Here, we report three high-resolution crystal structures (1.50-1.55 A) of hKAT I that are in complex with glycerol and each of two inhibitors of hKAT I: indole-3-acetic acid (IAC) and Tris. Because Tris is able to occupy the substrate binding position, we speculate that this may be the basis for hKAT I inhibition. Furthermore, the hKAT/IAC complex structure reveals that the binding moieties of the inhibitor are its indole ring and a carboxyl group. Six chemicals with both binding moieties were tested for their ability to inhibit hKAT I activity;  and DL-indole-3-lactic acid demonstrated the highest level of inhibition, and as they cannot be considered as substrates of the enzyme, these two inhibitors are promising candidates for future study. Perhaps even more significantly, we report the discovery of two different ligands located simultaneously in the hKAT I active center for the first time.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113509>The microbial metabolite indole-3-propionic acid improves glucose metabolism in rats, but does not affect behaviour.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that an antidepressant-like effect of probiotics in rats was associated with a higher plasma level of the microbial tryptophan metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA).We therefore wanted to study the isolated effect of IPA on behaviour and glucose metabolism in rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed control or IPA-enriched diet for six weeks (n = 12 per group) and assessed in the elevated plus maze, open field and forced swim test. Blood glucose, metabolic hormones and the white blood cell (WBC) composition were analysed.IPA (mean intake 27.3 mg/kg/day) significantly lowered fasting blood glucose level by 0.42 mM (95% CI 0.11-0.73). Similarly, fasting plasma insulin levels and the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index of insulin resistance were reduced, whereas plasma metabolic hormones, behaviour and WBC composition remained unaffected by IPA.Our findings highlight IPA as a promising candidate for treatment of metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9804794>Indoleamine analogs as probes of the substrate selectivity and catalytic mechanism of serotonin N-acetyltransferase.</a></h2><p>Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-ace-tyltransferase (AANAT)) catalyzes the reaction of serotonin (or tryptamine) with acetyl-CoA to form N-acetylserotonin (or N-acetyltryptamine) and is responsible for the melatonin circadian rhythm in vertebrates. This study evaluates a series of indoleamine analogs as alternate substrates of AANAT. 3-Indolepropylamine and 3-indolebutylamine were chemically synthesized and found to be processed by AANAT, although 20- and 60-fold less efficiently compared with the natural substrate serotonin, respectively. Racemic alpha-methyltryptamine and Nomega-methyltryptamine were also shown to be substrates for AANAT, again with reduced kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin. The enzyme did exhibit approximately 9:1 stereoselectivity for the R-enantiomer of alpha-methyltryptamine versus the S-enantiomer. By measuring the enzymatic rates versus increasing buffer microviscosity, it was demonstrated that diffusional release of product is most likely the principal rate-determining step for the enzymatic transformation of tryptamine (which has similar kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin). Analysis of kcat and kcat/Km versus pH for the poor substrate Nomega-methyltryptamine showed that an ionizable group on the enzyme with pKa approximately 7, required to be in its deprotonated form, may be important in catalysis. The alpha-methyltryptamine analog alpha-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by the enzyme, but served as a modest competitive inhibitor. Taken together with the pH-rate analysis, these results favor a model in which the serotonin substrate binds to the enzyme as the positively charged ammonium salt, and nucleophilicity of the amine is important in enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6630445>Comparison of three reagents for detecting indole production by anaerobic bacteria in microtest systems.</a></h2><p>Three reagents for detecting indole, Kovac, Ehrlich, and p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMCA), were evaluated with commercial microtest systems for characterizing and identifying anaerobic bacteria. The DMCA reagent, the most sensitive of the three reagents, gave a positive reaction with 445 of 449 strains of various indole-producing anaerobic bacteria. There was 99.6% agreement between the results obtained with the DMCA in the microtest systems and results using the conventional tube test to detect indole by using xylene extraction and Ehrlich reagent. Ehrlich reagent detected indole in 163 of 176 (92.6%) indole-positive strains when the inoculum was overlaid with mineral oil before incubation. Kovac reagent was the least sensitive of the reagents tested. When the inoculum was overlaid with mineral oil, Kovac reagent detected only 80 of 108 (74.0%) of indole-positive strains. In addition to being the most sensitive reagent for detection indole, DMCA also allowed detection of indole derivatives (skatole, , and 3-indolebutyric acid) produced by some clostridia.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123037>Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers and Gut Microbiome Modulate Metabolic Syndrome-Related Aqueous Metabolites in Mice.</a></h2><p>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent environmental toxicants associated with increased risk for metabolic syndrome. Intermediary metabolism is influenced by the intestinal microbiome. To test the hypothesis that PBDEs reduce host-beneficial intermediary metabolites in an intestinal microbiome-dependent manner, 9-week old male conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally gavaged once daily with vehicle, BDE-47, or BDE-99 (100 mol/kg) for 4 days. Intestinal microbiome (16S rDNA sequencing), liver transcriptome (RNA-Seq), and intermediary metabolites in serum, liver, as well as small and large intestinal contents (SIC and LIC; LC-MS) were examined. Changes in intermediary metabolite abundances in serum, liver, and SIC, were observed under basal conditions (CV vs. GF mice) and by PBDE exposure. PBDEs altered the largest number of metabolites in the LIC; most were regulated by PBDEs in GF conditions. Importantly, intestinal microbiome was necessary for PBDE-mediated decreases in branched-chain and aromatic amino acid metabolites, including , a tryptophan metabolite recently shown to be protective against inflammation and . Gene-metabolite networks revealed a positive association between the hepatic glycan synthesis gene -1,6-mannosyltransferase (Alg12) mRNA and mannose, which are important for protein glycosylation. Glycome changes have been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome. In LIC of CV mice, 23 bacterial taxa were regulated by PBDEs. Correlations of certain taxa with distinct serum metabolites further highlight a modulatory role of the microbiome in mediating PBDE effects. In summary, PBDEs impact intermediary metabolism in an intestinal microbiome-dependent manner, suggesting that dysbiosis may contribute to PBDE-mediated toxicities that include metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895217>Large-scale profiling of metabolic dysregulation in ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in gynecologic malignancies. Profiling of endogenous metabolites has potential to identify changes caused by cancer and provide inspiring insights into cancer metabolism. To systematically investigate ovarian cancer metabolism, we performed metabolic profiling of 448 plasma samples related to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in both positive and negative modes. These unbiased metabolomic profiles could well distinguish EOC from benign ovarian tumor (BOT) and uterine fibroid (UF). Fifty-three metabolites were identified as specific biomarkers for EOC, and this is the first report of piperine, , 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde and hydroxyphenyllactate as metabolic biomarkers of EOC. The AUC values of these metabolites for discriminating EOC from BOT/UF and early-stage EOC from BOT/UF were 0.9100/0.9428 and 0.8385/0.8624, respectively. Meanwhile, our metabolites were able to distinguish early-stage EOC from late-stage EOC with an AUC of 0.8801. Importantly, analysis of dysregulated metabolic pathways extends our current understanding of EOC metabolism. Metabolic pathways in EOC patients are mainly characterized by abnormal phospholipid metabolism, altered l-tryptophan catabolism, aggressive fatty acid β-oxidation and aberrant metabolism of piperidine derivatives. Together, these metabolic pathways provide a foundation to support cancer development and progression. In conclusion, our large-scale plasma metabolomics study yielded fundamental insights into dysregulated metabolism in ovarian cancer, which could facilitate clinical diagnosis, therapy, prognosis and shed new lights on ovarian cancer pathogenesis.© 2014 UICC.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p></html>
