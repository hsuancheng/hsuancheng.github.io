Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217553>CB1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus modulate the release of 5-HT and GABA to stimulate food intake in rats.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids and their receptors not only contribute to the control of natural processes of appetite regulation and energy balance but also have an important role in the pathogenesis of . CB1 receptors (CB1R) are expressed in several hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where induce potent orexigenic responses. Activation of CB1R in the PVN induces hyperphagia by modulating directly or indirectly orexigenic and anorexigenic signals; however, interaction among these mediators has not been clearly defined. CB1R mRNA is expressed in serotonergic neurons that innervate the PVN, and activation of 5-HT receptors in the PVN constitutes an important satiety signal. Some GABAergic terminals are negatively influenced by 5-HT, suggesting that the hyperphagic effect of CB1R activation could involve changes in serotonergic and GABAergic signaling in the PVN. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to characterize the neurochemical mechanisms related to the hyperphagic effects induced by activation of CB1R in the PVN, studying in vitro and in vivo changes induced by direct activation these receptors. Here, we have found that the neurochemical mechanisms activated by stimulation of CB1 receptors in the PVN involve inhibition of 5-HT release, resulting in a decrease of serotonergic activity mediated by 5-HT and 5-HT receptors and inducing disinhibition of GABA release to stimulate food intake. In conclusion, these neurochemical changes in the PVN are determinant to the cannabinoid-induced stimulation of food intake. Our findings provide evidence of a functional connection among CB1R and serotonergic and GABAergic systems on the control of appetite regulation mediated by endocannabinoids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and European College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse liver. Liver tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6), alpha-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to , our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO. They also indicate that caution should be used in the interpretation of results using DMSO as a vehicle in animal experiments.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545039>Extra Virgin Olive Oil Minor Compounds Modulate Mitogenic Action of Oleic  on Colon Cancer Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Experimental and clinical findings suggest that olive oil has a protective effect, whereas oleic  consumption induces colorectal cancer (CRC). Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty acids, mainly oleic  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that oleic  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by oleic . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion, oleic  and oleic  in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high oleic  seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665872>Maternal intake of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids during mid-pregnancy is inversely associated with linear growth.</a></h2><p>This study investigates relations of maternal N-3 and N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake during pregnancy with offspring body mass index (BMI), height z-score and metabolic risk (fasting glucose, C-peptide, leptin, lipid profile) during peripuberty (8-14 years) among 236 mother-child pairs in Mexico. We used food frequency questionnaire data to quantify trimester-specific intake of N-3 alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA); N-6 linoleic  and  (AA); and N-6:N-3 (AA:EPA+DHA), which accounts for the fact that the two PUFA families have opposing effects on physiology. Next, we used multivariable linear regression models that accounted for maternal education and parity, and child's age, sex and pubertal status, to examine associations of PUFA intake with the offspring outcomes. In models where BMI z-score was the outcome, we also adjusted for height z-score. We found that higher second trimester intake of EPA, DHA and AA were associated with lower offspring BMI and height z-score. For example, each 1-s.d. increment in second trimester EPA intake corresponded with 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) z-scores lower BMI and 0.20 (0.05, 0.36) z-scores lower height. Accounting for height z-score in models where BMI z-score was the outcome attenuated estimates [e.g., EPA: -0.16 (-0.37, 0.05)], suggesting that this relationship was driven by slower linear growth rather than excess adiposity. Maternal PUFA intake was not associated with the offspring metabolic biomarkers. Our findings suggest that higher PUFA intake during mid-pregnancy is associated with lower attained height in offspring during peripuberty. Additional research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and to confirm findings in other populations.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400671>Possible Role of CYP450 Generated Omega-3/Omega-6 PUFA Metabolites in the Modulation of Blood Pressure and Vascular Function in Obese Children.</a></h2><p> is often accompanied by metabolic and haemodynamic disorders such as hypertension, even during childhood.

Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may compete with AA for CYP450-dependent bioactive lipid mediator formation. We aimed at investigating the role of AA, EPA and DHA and their CYP450-dependent metabolites in BP control and vascular function in 66 overweight/obese children. Fatty  profile moderately correlated with the corresponding CYP450-derived metabolites but their levels did not differ between children with normal BP (NBP) and high BP (HBP), except for higher EPA-derived epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) and their diols in HBP group, in which also the estimated CYP450-epoxygenase activity was higher. In the HBP group, EPA inversely correlated with BP, EEQs inversely correlated both with systolic BP and carotid Intima-Media Thickness (cIMT). The DHA-derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) were inversely correlated with diastolic BP. Omega-3 derived epoxymetabolites appeared beneficially associated with BP and vascular structure/function only in obese children with HBP. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of omega-3/omega-6 epoxymetabolites in children's hemodynamics.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050886>Association of Polymorphism in Fatty  Desaturase Gene with the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in Iranian Population.</a></h2><p>The type 2 diabetes is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. Due to a key role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids such as , one of the most important precursors of immunity mediators, fatty  desaturase (FADS) genes could have an important impact in the development of type 2 diabetes.This study aimed to determine the relationship between polymorphisms rs174537 in FADS1 gene and rs174575 in FADS2 gene with type 2 diabetes in Iranian population. After extracting genomic DNA, the locations of mutations and allele types were identified with high-resolution melting (HRM)-polymerase chain reaction method. Then, association between these mutations with metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes was investigated using χ correlation coefficients for variables and logistic regression.The results showed that among 50 diabetic participants, 68% of patients have the mutant allele for rs174537 in FADS1 gene. This rate is 26% for rs174575 in FADS2 gene. Based on the results, it seems that participants having rs174537 mutant allele are more prone to become diabetic but it has a beneficial effect on total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and participants having rs174575 mutant are less prone to become diabetic, and also, it leads to higher triglycerides and body mass index ().Detecting FADS1 and FADS2, gene polymorphisms using HRM can be an anticipating tool for making decision on initiating lifestyle modifications to prevent type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133307>The Anti-inflammatory Effect of Personalized Omega-3 Fatty  Dosing for Reducing Prostaglandin E in the Colonic Mucosa Is Attenuated in .</a></h2><p>This clinical trial developed a personalized dosing model for reducing prostaglandin E (PGE) in colonic mucosa using ω-3 fatty  supplementation. The model utilized serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, ω-3): (AA, ω-6) ratios as biomarkers of colonic mucosal PGE concentration. Normal human volunteers were given low and high ω-3 fatty  test doses for 2 weeks. This established a slope and intercept of the line for dose versus serum EPA:AA ratio in each individual. The slope and intercept was utilized to calculate a personalized target dose that was given for 12 weeks. This target dose was calculated on the basis of a model, initially derived from lean rodents, showing a log-linear relationship between serum EPA:AA ratios and colonic mucosal PGE reduction. Bayesian methods allowed addition of human data to the rodent model as the trial progressed. The dosing model aimed to achieve a serum EPA:AA ratio that is associated with a 50% reduction in colonic PGE Mean colonic mucosal PGE concentrations were 6.55 ng/mg protein (SD, 5.78) before any supplementation and 3.59 ng/mg protein (SD, 3.29) after 12 weeks of target dosing. In secondary analyses, the decreases in PGE were significantly attenuated in overweight and obese participants. This occurred despite a higher target dose for the obese versus normal weight participants, as generated by the pharmacodynamic predictive model. Large decreases also were observed in 12-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids, and PGE increased substantially. Future biomarker-driven dosing models for cancer prevention therefore should consider energy balance as well as overall eicosanoid homeostasis in normal tissue. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862696>AMP-activated protein kinase activation ameliorates eicosanoid dysregulation in high-fat-induced kidney disease in mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) causes renal lipotoxicity that is ameliorated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Although bioactive eicosanoids increase with HFD and are essential in regulation of renal disease, their role in the inflammatory response to HFD-induced kidney disease and their modulation by AMPK activation remain unexplored. In a mouse model, we explored the effects of HFD on eicosanoid synthesis and the role of AMPK activation in ameliorating these changes. We used targeted lipidomic profiling with quantitative MS to determine PUFA and eicosanoid content in kidneys, urine, and renal arterial and venous circulation. HFD increased phospholipase expression as well as the total and free pro-inflammatory  (AA) and anti-inflammatory DHA in kidneys. Consistent with the parent PUFA levels, the AA- and DHA-derived lipoxygenase (LOX), cytochrome P450, and nonenzymatic degradation (NE) metabolites increased in kidneys with HFD, while EPA-derived LOX and NE metabolites decreased. Conversely, treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-furanosyl 5'-monophosphate (AICAR), an AMPK activator, reduced the free AA and DHA content and the DHA-derived metabolites in kidney. Interestingly, kidney and circulating AA, AA metabolites, EPA-derived LOX, and NE metabolites are increased with HFD; whereas, DHA metabolites are increased in kidney in contrast to their decreased circulating levels with HFD. Together, these changes showcase HFD-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoid dysregulation and highlight the role of AMPK in correcting HFD-induced dysregulated eicosanoid pathways.Copyright © 2019 Declèves et al.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29605789>The role of the lipidome in -mediated colon cancer risk.</a></h2><p> is a state of chronic inflammation influenced by lipids such as fatty acids and their secondary oxygenated metabolites deemed oxylipids. Many such lipid mediators serve as potent signaling molecules of inflammation, which can further alter lipid metabolism and lead to carcinogenesis. For example, sphingosine-1-phosphate activates cyclooxygenase-2 in endothelial cells resulting in the conversion of  (AA) to prostaglandin E (PGE). PGE promotes colon cancer cell growth. In contrast, the less studied path of AA oxygenation via cytochrome p450 enzymes produces epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EETs), whose anti-inflammatory properties cause shrinking of enlarged adipocytes, a characteristic of , through the liberation of fatty acids. It is now thought that EET depletion occurs in  and may contribute to colon cell carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, gangliosides, a type of sphingolipid, are cell surface signaling molecules that contribute to the apoptosis of colon tumor cells. Many of these discoveries have been made recently and the mechanisms are still not fully understood, leading to an exciting new chapter of lipidomic research.

Platelet aggregation was measured with  (ASPI test; ASA-response assessment) or ADP (ADP test; clopidogrel-response assessment). Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and fibrinogen concentrations were measured and ITGB3 PIA1>A2 variants identified. Increases in PLT, glucose and SBP were demonstrated with dual resistance or to clopidogrel. Regardless of response, diabetics (versus non-diabetics) had elevated platelet aggregation with the ADP test (P = 0.0198), higher TXB2 (P = 0.0501), BMI (P = 0.0003) and SBP (P = 0.0627). ITGB3 PIA1/A1 homozygotes had higher platelet aggregation with the ASPI test (P = 0.0513), and fibrinogen concentrations (P = 0.0133), relative to A2 allele carriers. Significant associations of diabetes with clopidogrel resistance (P = 0.0011) and PIA1/A1 homozygotes with ASA resistance (P = 0.0518) were found. Higher concentrations of TXB2 (P = 0.0223) and higher SBP (P = 0.0063) were found with diabetes (versus non-diabetic) in PIA1/A1 homozygotes.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective effects in numerous pathological situations. It is not known whether rapeseed oil, which contains α-linolenic  (ALA), has a similar protective effect. Omega-3 PUFAs are sensitive to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipid peroxidation products could damage cardiac cells. We thus tested whether dietary refined rapeseed oil (RSO) associated with or without different antioxidants (vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and canolol) is cardio-protective in a situation of abdominal .Sixty male Wistar rats were subdivided into 5 groups. Each group was fed a specific diet for 11 weeks: a low-fat diet (3% of lipids, C diet) with compositionally-balanced PUFAs; a high-fat diet rich in palm oil (30% of lipids, PS diet); the PS diet in which 40% of lipids were replaced by RSO (R diet); the R diet supplemented with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E (RTC diet); and the RTC diet supplemented with canolol (RTCC diet). At the end of the diet period, the rats were sacrificed and the heart was collected and immediately frozen. Fatty  composition of cardiac phospholipids was then determined. Several features of cardiac function (fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis) were also estimated.Abdominal  reduced cardiac oxidative stress and apoptosis rate by increasing the proportion of  (AA) in membrane phospholipids. Dietary RSO had the same effect, though it normalized the proportion of AA. Adding vitamin E and CoQ10 in the RSO-rich high fat diet had a deleterious effect, increasing fibrosis by increasing angiotensin-2 receptor-1b (Ag2R-1b) mRNA expression. Overexpression of these receptors triggers coronary vasoconstriction, which probably induced ischemia. Canolol supplementation counteracted this deleterious effect by reducing coronary vasoconstriction.Canolol was found to counteract the fibrotic effects of vitamin E + CoQ10 on cardiac fibrosis in the context of a high-fat diet enriched with RSO. This effect occurred through a restoration of cardiac Ag2R-1b mRNA expression and decreased ischemia.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30688453>In Vivo Anti-inflammatory and Antiallergic Activity of Pure Naringenin, Naringenin Chalcone, and Quercetin in Mice.</a></h2><p>Flavonoids, found in almost all fruits and vegetables, belong to a class of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure and have properties with health-improving potential. However, few experimental studies on the effects of flavonoids have been carried out in vivo after external application and using pure compounds. Aiming to fill this gap, in this study we tested the topical anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity of three flavonoids of high purity, naringenin, naringenin chalcone, and quercetin, in mouse models. The topical anti-inflammatory effects were assessed against - (AA) and tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- (TPA) induced ear edema. The anti-inflammatory effect of naringenin against ear edema was noticeable at a 1% dose in the AA model and at half this dose in the TPA model. Quercetin (1.3%) did not exert any topical anti-inflammatory activity in the AA model, but its inhibitory effect in the TPA model was similar to that of naringenin (2%); in contrast, naringenin chalcone was more active against the AA-induced than TPA-induced inflammation.

In addition, 62 healthy men from the cohort who were homozygotes for the TT or CC genotype of the FADS1 rs174550 were recruited to a 4-wk intervention (FADSDIET) with an LA-enriched diet. The fatty  composition of plasma PUFAs and concentrations of plasma fasting glucose, serum hsCRP, and plasma lipid mediators (eicosanoids and related analogs) were measured at the beginning and end of the 4-wk intervention period.In the FADSDIET trial, the plasma LA proportion increased in both genotype groups in response to an LA-enriched diet. Responses in concentrations of serum hsCRP and plasma fasting glucose and the proportion of  (20:4n-6) in plasma phospholipids and cholesteryl esters differed between genotype groups (interaction of diet × genotype, P < 0.05).

We previously demonstrated that a high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic dysregulation, cardiac fibrosis and accumulation of more PAT in minipigs. This study used our obese minipig model to investigate the characteristics of PAT and omental visceral fat (VAT) induced by a HFD, and the potential link between PAT and HFD-related myocardial fibrosis.Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a HFD for 6 months.The HFD induced dyslipidemia, cardiac fibrosis and more fat accumulation in the visceral and pericardial depots. The HFD changes the fatty  composition in the adipose tissue by decreasing the portion of linoleic  in the VAT and PAT. No  was detected in the VAT and PAT of control pigs, whereas it existed in the same tissues of obese pigs fed the HFD. Compared with the control pigs, elevated levels of malondialdehyde and TNFα were exhibited in the plasma and PAT of obese pigs. HFD induced greater size of adipocytes in VAT and PAT. Higher levels of GH, leptin, OPG, PDGF, resistin, SAA and TGFβ were observed in obese pig PAT compared to VAT.This study demonstrated the similarities and dissimilarities between PAT and VAT under HFD stimulus.

Platelet activation plays a major role in CVDs. Thus, disrupting platelet activation represents an attractive therapeutic target. We examined the effect of esculetin in human platelet activation and experimental mouse models. At 10-80 μM, esculetin inhibited collagen- and -induced platelet aggregation in washed human platelets. However, it had no effects on other agonists such as thrombin and U46619. Esculetin inhibited adenosine triphosphate release, P-selectin expression, hydroxyl radical (OH) formation, Akt activation, and phospholipase C (PLC)γ2/protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation, but did not diminish mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in collagen-activated human platelets. Platelet function analysis indicated that esculetin substantially prolonged the closure time of whole blood. In experimental mice, esculetin significantly increased the occlusion time in thrombotic platelet plug formation and reduced mortality associated with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. However, it did not prolong the bleeding time. This study demonstrates that esculetin inhibits human platelet activation via hindering the PLCγ2-PKC cascade, hydroxyl radical formation, Akt activation, and ultimately suppressing platelet activation.

However, the role of 20-HETE in the regulation of large artery remodeling in metabolic syndrome has not been investigated. We hypothesized that elevated 20-HETE in metabolic syndrome increases matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) activation leading to increased degradation of elastin, increased large artery stiffness and increased systolic blood pressure. 20-HETE production was increased ~7 fold in large, conduit arteries of metabolic syndrome (JCR:LA-cp, JCR) vs. normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This correlated with increased elastin degradation (~7 fold) and decreased arterial compliance (~75% JCR vs. SD). 20-HETE antagonists blocked elastin degradation in JCR rats concomitant with blocking MMP12 activation. 20-HETE antagonists normalized, and MMP12 inhibition (pharmacological and MMP12-shRNA-Lnv) significantly improved (~50% vs. untreated JCR) large artery compliance in JCR rats. 20-HETE antagonists also decreased systolic (182 ± 3 mmHg JCR, 145 ± 3 mmHg JCR + 20-HETE antagonists) but not diastolic blood pressure in JCR rats. Whereas diastolic pressure was fully angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent, systolic pressure was only partially Ang II-dependent, and large artery stiffness was Ang II-independent. Thus, 20-HETE-dependent regulation of systolic blood pressure may be a unique feature of metabolic syndrome related to high 20-HETE production in large, conduit arteries, which results in increased large artery stiffness and systolic blood pressure. These findings may have implications for management of systolic hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

After 48-72 h release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and CXCL8 was measured using ELISA and mRNA expression and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins fibronectin, type I collagen, tenascin and perlecan were measured using qPCR or ECM ELISA, respectively.Challenge with the ω-6 PUFA  (AA), but not ω-3 PUFAs or SFAs, resulted in increased IL-6 and CXCL8 release from fibroblasts, however IL-6 and CXCL8 release was reduced in COPD (n = 19) compared to non-COPD (n = 36). AA-induced cytokine release was partially mediated by downstream mediators of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in both COPD and non-COPD. In comparison, TNFα-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 release was similar in COPD and non-COPD, indicating a specific interaction of AA in COPD. In patients with or without COPD, regression analysis revealed no relationship between BMI and cytokine release. In addition, AA, but not SFAs or ω-3 PUFAs reduced the basal deposition of fibronectin, type I collagen, tenascin and perlecan into the ECM in COPD fibroblasts. In non-COPD fibroblasts, AA-challenge decreased basal deposition of type I collagen and perlecan, but not fibronectin and tenascin.This study shows that AA has disease-specific effects on inflammation and ECM protein deposition.

To address the overall functionality, their potential role in supporting a healthy metabolic profile under obesogenic dietary challenges later in life was evaluated. At weaning Ucp1+/LUC reporter mice were fed a control low fat diet (LFD) with or without ARA + DHA, eHC or eHC + ARA + DHA for 8 weeks until week 12 after which interventions continued for another 12 weeks under a high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Serology (metabolic responses and inflammation) and in vivo and ex vivo luciferase activity were determined; in the meantime browning-related proteins UCP-1 and the genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and Ucp-1 were examined. ARA + DHA, eHC or their combination reduced body weight gain and adipose tissue weight compared to the HFD mice. The interventions induced Ucp-1 expression in adipose tissues prior to and during the HFD exposure. Ucp-1 induction was accompanied by higher PGC1a and PRDM16 expression. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were improved coinciding with lower serum cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, leptin, resistin, fibroblast growth factor 21, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and higher adiponectin than the HFD group. HFD-associated increased systemic (IL-1β and TNF-α) and adipose tissue inflammation (F4/80, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) was reduced.

Evidence from intervention trials and animal studies suggests that frequent intake of lean seafood, as compared with intake of terrestrial meats, reduces energy intake by 4-9 %, sufficient to prevent a positive energy balance and . At equal energy intake, lean seafood reduces fasting and postprandial risk markers of insulin resistance, and improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adults. Energy restriction combined with intake of lean and fatty seafood seems to increase weight loss. Marine n-3 PUFA are probably of importance through n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids and oxylipins, but other constituents of seafood such as the fish protein per se, trace elements or vitamins also seem to play a largely neglected role. A high intake of fatty seafood increases circulating levels of the insulin-sensitising hormone adiponectin. As compared with a high meat intake, high intake of seafood has been reported to reduce plasma levels of the hepatic acute-phase protein C-reactive protein level in some, but not all studies. More studies are needed to confirm the dietary effects on energy intake,  and insulin resistance.

We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in , we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  metabolism, and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT.

Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I ) is one of the major prostanoids produced with the help of prostacyclin synthase (prostaglandin I synthase) enzyme and rapidly hydrolyzed into 6-keto-PGF in biological fluids.  indicates an excess of body adiposity, which is globally considered as one of the major health disasters responsible for developing complex pathological situations in the human body. Adipose tissues can produce various PGs, and thus, the level and the molecular activity of these endogenously synthesized PGs are considered critical for the development of . In this regard, the involvement of prostacyclin in adipogenesis has been studied in the last few decades. The current review, along with the background of other related PGs, presents the several molecular aspects of endogenous prostaglandin I in adipose tissue development. Especially, the regulation of life cycle of adipocytes, impact on terminal differentiation, activity through prostacyclin receptor (IP), autocrine-paracrine manner, thermogenic adipose tissue remodeling and some future experimental aspects of prostacyclin have been focused upon in this study.

Prostaglandins play a regulatory role in inflammation. Cyclooxygenases are the main mediators of inflammation by catalyzing the initial step of  metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis. The differential expression of the constitutive isoform COX-1 and the inducible isoform COX-2, and the finding that COX-1 is the major form expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, lead to the search for COX-2-selective inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents that might diminish the gastrointestinal side effects of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). COX-2 isoform is expressed predominantly in inflammatory cells and decidedly upregulated in chronic and acute inflammations, becoming a critical target for many pharmacological inhibitors. COX-2 selective inhibitors happen to show equivalent efficacy with that of conventional NSAIDs, but they have reduced gastrointestinal side effects. This review would elucidate the most recent findings on selective COX-2 inhibition and their relevance to human pathology, concretely in inflammatory pathologies characterized by a prolonged pro-inflammatory status, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, , atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular pathologies.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403679>Characterization of the endocannabinoid system in subcutaneous adipose tissue in periparturient dairy cows and its association to metabolic profiles.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) plays a major role in metabolic adaptations in postpartum (PP) dairy cows. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of metabolism and energy homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high body weight (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low body weight loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of  were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT inflammation in PP dairy cows.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871048>The Effect of an Infant Formula Supplemented with AA and DHA on Fatty  Levels of Infants with Different FADS Genotypes: The COGNIS Study.</a></h2><p>Polymorphisms in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) genes influence the  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA)  concentrations (crucial in early life). Infants with specific genotypes may require different amounts of these fatty acids (FAs) to maintain an adequate status. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an infant formula supplemented with AA and DHA on FAs of infants with different FADS genotypes. In total, 176 infants from the COGNIS study were randomly allocated to the Standard Formula (SF; n = 61) or the Experimental Formula (EF; n = 70) group, the latter supplemented with AA and DHA. Breastfed infants were added as a reference group (BF; n = 45). FAs and FADS polymorphisms were analyzed from cheek cells collected at 3 months of age. FADS minor allele carriership in formula fed infants, especially those supplemented, was associated with a declined desaturase activity and lower AA and DHA levels. Breastfed infants were not affected, possibly to the high content of AA and DHA in breast milk. The supplementation increased AA and DHA levels, but mostly in major allele carriers. In conclusion, infant FADS genotype could contribute to narrow the gap of AA and DHA concentrations between breastfed and formula fed infants.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413441>Feasibility Evaluation of Myocardial Cannabinoid Type 1 Receptor Imaging in : A Translational Approach.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of targeted imaging of myocardial cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1-R) and its potential up-regulation in obese mice with translation to humans using [C]-OMAR and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).Activation of myocardial CB1-R by endocannabinoids has been implicated in cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice.  may lead to an up-regulation of myocardial CB1-R, potentially providing a mechanistic link between  and the initiation and/or progression of cardiomyopathy.Binding specificity of [C]-OMAR to CB1-R was investigated by blocking studies with rimonabant in mice. The heart was harvested from each mouse, and its radioactivity was determined by γ-counter. Furthermore, [C]-OMAR dynamic micro-PET/CT was carried out in obese and normal-weight mice. Ex vivo validation was performed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (absolute quantification) and RNAscope Technology (an in situ ribonucleic  analysis platform). Subsequently, myocardial CB1-R expression was probed noninvasively with intravenous injection of CB1-R ligand [C]-OMAR and PET/CT in humans with advanced  and normal-weight human control subjects, respectively.Rimonabant significantly blocked OMAR uptake in the heart muscle compared with vehicle, signifying specific binding of OMAR to the CB1-R in the myocardium. The myocardial OMAR retention quantified by micro-PET/CT in mice was significantly higher in obese compared with normal-weight mice. Absolute quantification of CB1-R gene expression with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization confirmed CB1-R up-regulation in all major myocardial cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes, endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts) of obese mice. Obese mice also had elevated myocardial levels of endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol compared with lean mice. Translation to humans revealed higher myocardial OMAR retention in advanced  compared with normal-weight subjects.Noninvasive imaging of cardiac CB1-R expression in  is feasible applying [C]-OMAR and PET/CT.

In the human body, these fatty acids (FAs) give rise to  (ARA, n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, n-3) that play key roles in regulating body homeostasis. Locally acting bioactive signaling lipids called eicosanoids derived from these FAs also regulate diverse homeostatic processes. In general, ARA gives rise to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids whereas EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Thus, a proportionally higher consumption of n-3 PUFAs can protect us against inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic diseases. The present review summarizes major sources, intake, and global consumption of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs.

Several hormonal signals, such as glucocorticoids and ghrelin, regulate feeding and metabolism by engaging the endocannabinoid system. Similarly, studies have suggested that leptin interacts with the endocannabinoid system, yet the mechanism and functional relevance of this interaction remain elusive. Therefore, we explored the interaction between leptin and endocannabinoid signaling with a focus on fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), the primary degradative enzyme for the endocannabinoid -arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA). Mice deficient in leptin exhibited elevated hypothalamic AEA levels and reductions in FAAH activity while leptin administration to WT mice reduced AEA content and increased FAAH activity. Following high fat diet exposure, mice developed resistance to the effects of leptin administration on hypothalamic AEA content and FAAH activity. At a functional level, pharmacological inhibition of FAAH was sufficient to prevent leptin-mediated effects on body weight and food intake. Using a novel knock-in mouse model recapitulating a common human polymorphism (FAAH C385A; rs324420), which reduces FAAH activity, we investigated whether human genetic variance in  affects leptin sensitivity. While WT (CC) mice were sensitive to leptin-induced reductions in food intake and body weight gain, low-expressing FAAH (AA) mice were unresponsive. These data demonstrate that FAAH activity is required for leptin's hypophagic effects and, at a translational level, suggest that a genetic variant in the FAAH gene contributes to differences in leptin sensitivity in human populations.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702246>Placental lipid droplet composition: Effect of a lifestyle intervention (UPBEAT) in obese pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal  is associated with adverse outcomes. Placental lipid droplets (LD) have been implicated in maternal-fetal lipid transfer but it is not known whether placental LD fat composition is modifiable. We evaluated the effects of a diet and physical activity intervention in obese pregnant women compared to routine antenatal care (UPBEAT study) on placental LD composition. LD were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Total FAs and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, PCs; sphingomyelins, SMs and lyso-phosphatidylcholines, Lyso-PCs) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Placenta MFSD2a expression was assessed by western blot. Placental LDs from obese women were comprised of predominantly saturated and monounsaturated FAs. TG and Chol composition was similar between intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 23) groups. PCs containing dihomo-ɣ-linolenic  in LD were positively associated with gestational weight gain (P < 0.007), and lowered by the intervention. In the whole sample, PCs carrying DHA and  were inversely associated with placental weight. Placenta MFSD2a expression was associated with DHA cord blood metabolites and relationships were observed between LD lipids, especially DHA carrying species, and cord blood metabolites.

In such cases, the immune system fails to recognize between foreign agents and its own body cells. Different factors, such as genetic factors (CD25, STAT4), epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and environmental factors (xenobiotics, drugs, hormones) trigger autoimmunity. Glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressive and biological agents are currently used to manage autoimmune diseases of different origins. However, complete cure remains elusive. Many dietary and natural products including polyphenols have been widely studied as possible alternative treatment strategies for the management of autoimmune disorders. Polyphenols possess a wide-range of pharmacological and therapeutic properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. As immunomodulatory agents, polyphenols are emerging pharmaceutical tools for management of various autoimmune disorders including vitiligo, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). Polyphenols activate intracellular pathways such as  dependent pathway, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway and epigenetic modulation, which regulate the host's immune response.

LA is known to induce  and insulin resistance. In this study, two concentrations of LA with or without added glucose (G) were fed to mice to investigate their effects on endocannabinoid (EC) biology.Four groups of C57BL/6 mice were provided with diets containing 1% or 8% LA with or without added G (LAG) for 8 weeks. Body weights, food intake, circulating glucose and insulin levels were measured throughout the study. Following euthanasia, plasma, bowel and hepatic ECs, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels (enzymes responsible for EC degradation) and transcriptional activity of PPARα in liver were quantified. Liver was probed for evidence of insulin receptor activity perturbation.Increasing dietary LA from 1% to 8% significantly increased circulating, small bowel and hepatic ECs. 1%LAG fed mice had lowest feed efficiency, and only liver levels of both ECs were reduced by addition of G. Addition of G to 1% LA diets resulted in elevated monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels ( < 0.001 and  < 0.001, respectively) in liver due to increased transcriptional activity of PPARα ( < 0.05). The reduced EC levels with addition of G also correlated with a measure of enhanced insulin action.In conclusion, body weight of mice is influenced by the source of calorie intake. Furthermore, tissue EC/g are dependent on tissue-specific synthesis and degradation that are modulated by dietary LA and G which also influence food efficiency, and down-stream insulin signalling pathways.

The purpose of our studies was to determine the in vivo role of adipocyte ACSL4 in regulating -associated adipocyte dysfunction.We developed a novel mouse model with adipocyte-specific ablation of ACSL4 (Ad-KO) using loxP Cre recombinase technology. Metabolic phenotyping of Ad-KO mice relative to their floxed littermates (ACSL4) was performed, including body weight and body composition over time; insulin and glucose tolerance tests; and energy expenditure, activity, and food intake in metabolic cages. Adipocytes were isolated for ex vivo adipocyte oxygen consumption by Clark electrode and lipidomics analysis. In vitro adipocyte analysis including oxygen consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte oxygen consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free fatty  pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and liver fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole body energy expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Dilation of MCA following challenge with acetylcholine and hypoxia was blunted in MCA from GK versus WKY, due to lower nitric oxide bioavailability and altered  metabolism, whereas myogenic activation and constrictor responses to serotonin were unchanged. MCA wall distensibility and cross-sectional area were not different between GK and WKY, suggesting that wall mechanics were unchanged at this age, supported by the determination that MCA dilation to sodium nitroprusside was also intact. With the use of ex vivo aortic rings as a bioassay, altered vascular reactivity determined in MCA was paralleled by relaxation responses in artery segments from GK, whereas measurements of vasoactive metabolite production indicated a loss of nitric oxide and prostacyclin bioavailability and an increased thromboxane A production with both methacholine challenge and hypoxia.

Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk.

Histopathologic analyses documented that mice on the ω-6 diet had a significant increase in macrovesicular steatosis, extramedullary myelopoiesis (EMM), apoptotic hepatocytes and decreased glycogen storage in lobular hepatocytes, and hepatocyte proliferation relative to mice fed the Lc ω-3 diet. Together, these results support PUFA dietary regulation of hepatic pathology and inflammation with implications for enteral feeding regulation of steatosis and other hepatic lesions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation and deficiency of anti-inflammatory nutrients like omega(n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may contribute to these associations. Fetal supply of n-3 PUFA is dependent on maternal levels and studies have suggested that improved offspring outcomes are associated with higher maternal intake. However, little is known about how maternal  affects the response to n-3 supplementation during pregnancy. We sought to determine (1) the associations of  with PUFA concentrations and (2) if the systemic response to n-3 supplementation differs by body mass index (BMI). This was a secondary analysis of 556 participants (46% lean, 28% obese) in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network trial of n-3 (Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) + Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)) supplementation, in which participants had 2g/day of n-3 ( = 278) or placebo ( = 278) from 19 to 22 weeks until delivery.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral  and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors. This review will provide a brief update on the effects of endocannabinoid signalling in atherosclerosis and related metabolic complications.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662340>Lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes through JAK/STAT and AMPK-regulated cPLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes played important roles in the development of adipose tissue and contributed much to the processes of .

Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes.

We investigated a potential role for ApoD in insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and thrombosis-processes related to lipid metabolism-in severely obese women.We measured ApoD expression in a cohort of 44 severely obese women including dysmetabolic and non-dysmetabolic patients. Physical and metabolic characteristics of these women were determined from anthropometric measurements and blood samples. ApoD was quantified at the mRNA and protein levels in samples from three intra-abdominal adipose tissues (AT): omental, mesenteric and round ligament (RL).ApoD protein levels were highly variable between AT of the same individual. High ApoD protein levels, particularly in the RL depot, were linked to lower plasma insulin levels (-40%, p = 0.015) and insulin resistance (-47%, p = 0.022), and increased insulin sensitivity (+10%, p = 0.008). Lower circulating pro-inflammatory PAI-1 (-39%, p = 0.001), and TNF-α (-19%, p = 0.030) levels were also correlated to high ApoD protein in the RL AT.ApoD variability between AT was consistent with different accumulation efficiencies and/or metabolic functions according to the anatomic location of fat depots. Most statistically significant correlations implicated ApoD protein levels, in agreement with protein accumulation in target tissues. These correlations associated higher ApoD levels in fat depots with improved metabolic health in severely obese women.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001352>In Vitro Antiatherothrombotic Effects of Extracts from  L.,  L., and  Benth.</a></h2><p>Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The pathogenesis is mainly due to atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, and platelet thrombus formation. The main risk factors for coronary artery disease include , hypercholesterolemia, smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure. As a part of disease management, treatment options using anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs can be applied with addition to lipid-lowering medication. However, medicinal plants comprising antiatherothrombotic effects can be used as options to combat the disease rather than drug therapies with lesser adverse effects. Therefore, the haematological effect of  L. L., and  Benth extracts was studied using in vitro model to prevent and to treat coronary atherothrombotic disease. The aqueous, methanol, and polysaccharide extracts of  and  respectively, were studied for their anticoagulant and antiplatelet effect on human whole blood. Extracts were subjected to the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test for anticoagulant activity. The antiplatelet activity was investigated using an electrical impedance method.  aqueous extract (BVAE),  polysaccharide extract (BVPE),  aqueous extract (TPAE), and  polysaccharide extract (TPPE) significantly prolonged the coagulation time in a concentration-dependent manner (<0.05). The administration of BVAE demonstrated the most effective antiplatelet activity against platelet aggregation caused by  (AA) and collagen. These antiplatelet activities may correspond to the presence of higher total phenolic compound, which thus inhibit the platelet aggregation activity.

T2DM is associated with a number of pathological complications, including cardiovascular disease that is mostly promoted by the increased oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients. We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of an individualized oral supplementation with α-lipoic  (ALA), carnosine, and thiamine. For that purpose, 82 obese type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, and were either supplemented daily with 7 mg ALA/kg body weight, 6 mg carnosine/kg body weight, and 1 mg thiamine/kg body weight or placebo for 8 weeks. An array of biochemical tests including the estimation of oxidative stress and platelet aggregation were performed at baseline and at follow-up. Moreover, the antiplatelet activity of each of the supplement's components was determined ex vivo at human and washed rabbit platelets. Glucose and HbA levels were significantly reduced after supplementation (135.7 ± 19.5 mg/dL vs. 126.5 ± 16.8 mg/dL and 8.3% ± 0.3% vs. 6.03% ± 0.58%, respectively, P < .05); however, insulin was significantly increased (3.6 ± 0.7 μIU/mL vs. 6.8 ± 0.2 μIU/mL, P < .05). The patients treated with the supplement recorded higher follow-up values for HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, and a significant drop in serum hydroperoxide level. Only ALA inhibited platelets aggregation ex vivo through ADP, platelet activating factor, , epinephrine, collagen, and thrombin pathways. Daily supplementation with an individualized ALA, carnosine, and thiamine supplement effectively reduced glucose concentration in type 2 diabetic patients, probably by increasing insulin production from the pancreas. In addition to that, the reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of platelet aggregation could potentially provide greater cardiovascular protection.

Dietary fatty acids, which are increased in sera of obese individuals and after high-fat meals, activate the innate immune system and induce inflammation. This study investigated whether dietary fatty acids directly cause inflammation and/or synergize with -induced cytokines in primary human pulmonary fibroblasts in vitro. Fibroblasts were challenged with BSA-conjugated fatty acids [ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and ω-3 PUFAs or saturated fatty acids (SFAs)], with or without TNF-α, and release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and CXCL8, was measured. We found that the ω-6 PUFA  (AA), but not ω-3 PUFAs or SFAs, upregulates IL-6 and CXCL8 release. Combined AA and TNF-α challenge resulted in substantially greater cytokine release than either alone, demonstrating synergy. Synergistic upregulation of IL-6, but not CXCL8, was mainly mediated via cyclooxygenase (COX). Inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced CXCL8 release, induced by AA and TNF-α alone, but not in combination. Synergistic CXCL8 release, following AA and TNF-α challenge, was not medicated via a single signaling pathway (MEK1, JNK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and NF-κB) nor by hyperactivation of NF-κB or p38. To investigate if these findings occur in other airway cells, effects of AA in primary human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells and human bronchial epithelial cells were also investigated. We found proinflammatory effects in ASM cells but not epithelial cells. This study suggests that diets rich in ω-6 PUFAs might promote airway inflammation via multiple pathways, including COX-dependent and -independent pathways, and in an obese person, may lead to more severe airway inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311389>Insulin-induced lipid body accumulation is accompanied by lipid remodelling in model mast cells.</a></h2><p>Mast cell lipid bodies are key to initiation, maintenance and resolution of inflammatory responses in tissue.

The role of  (AA) and its downstream enzymatic cascades, such as cyclooxygenase, in adipogenesis is well established. The exact contribution of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, however, remains to be established. Enzymes belonging to this pathway are mainly encoded by the CYP2J locus which shows extensive allelic expansion in mice. Here we aimed to establish the role of endogenous epoxygenase during adipogenesis under homeostatic and metabolic stress conditions.We took advantage of the simpler genetic architecture of the Cyp2j locus in the rat and used a Cyp2j4 (orthologue of human CYP2J2) knockout rat in two models of metabolic dysfunction: physiological aging and cafeteria diet (CAF). The phenotyping of Cyp2j4 rats under CAF was integrated with proteomics (LC-MS/MS) and lipidomics (LC-MS) analyses in the liver and the adipose tissue.We report that Cyp2j4 deletion causes adipocyte dysfunction under metabolic challenges. This is characterized by (i) down-regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) PPARγ and C/EBPα, (ii) adipocyte hypertrophy, (iii) extracellular matrix remodeling, and (iv) alternative usage of AA pathway. Specifically, in Cyp2j4 rats treated with a cafeteria diet, the dysfunctional adipogenesis is accompanied by exacerbated weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation, and dysregulated gluconeogenesis.These results suggest that AA epoxygenases are essential regulators of healthy adipogenesis.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity.

It provides a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds. Polyphenols regulate immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. They inactivate NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and modulate mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPk) and  acids pathways. Polyphenolic compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AkT), inhibitor of kappa kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (IKK/JNK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which is a protein complex that controls protein synthesis, and JAK/STAT. They can suppress toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Their antioxidant activity and ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute as well to their anti-inflammation properties. They inhibit certain enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species ROS production like xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (NOX) while they upregulate other endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px). Furthermore, they inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to a reduction in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) and inflammation antagonism. The effects of these biologically active compounds on the immune system are associated with extended health benefits for different chronic inflammatory diseases. Studies of plant extracts and compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as diabetes, , neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416584>The Current Conditions and Lifestyles of Obese University Students.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in Japan remains high, and the onset becomes early.

In conclusion, this study shows that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI can influence breast milk FAs and infant growth and cognition, endorsing the importance of a healthy weight in future generations.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877283>Increased Serum Dihomo-γ-linolenic  Levels Are Associated with , Body Fat Accumulation, and Insulin Resistance in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Objective To clarify the associations between serum omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) levels and -related metabolic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) and  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and -related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several -related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with , body fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258511>Association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Visceral fat accumulation in overweight status has been resulted in changes of fatty  profiles. The fatty acids profiles can be altered by fatty  desaturase; the activity of which is highly associated with  and other metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that fatty  composition, desaturase activity, and accumulation of visceral fat are interrelated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects with different amounts of visceral fat.Healthy overweight subjects (25.0 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m, n=232) were classified into lower (T1), middle (T2), and upper tertiles (T3) according to L4 visceral fat area (T1: <71.8 cm, T2: 71.8 cm-99.6 cm, T3: >99.6 cm).The T3 group showed higher amounts of cis-10-heptadecenoic  and activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase and lower activity of Δ5-desaturase than the T1 group. Additionally, the T3 group showed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, myristic , palmitic , stearic , monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , , n-3 PUFAs, and docosapentaenoic  than the T1 and T2 groups.This study indicates that greater than a certain area (>99.6 cm) of visceral fat is needed to observe altered levels of individual fatty  species and desaturase activities. The results suggest that increased activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase in parallel with decreased Δ5-desaturase activity may be a causative factor in disturbed fatty  metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30457056>Anti-Arthritic Effect of Garcinol Enriched Fraction Against Adjuvant Induced Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Garcinia indica also known as kokum is used in traditional system of medicine for relieving inflammation and rheumatic pain. Garcinol, a benzophenone obtained from its fruit rind is reported to have anti-inflammatory effect via modulating  metabolism, suppressing iNOS expression, NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression. It has also been studied for antioxidant and anticancer activity. Apart from these, few patents claim that garcinol also has anti- and hepatoprotective effect and has a potential to be used for the treatment of renal disorders, endometriosis and cardiac dysfunction.Garcinol Enriched Fraction (GEF) from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica should be effective in the treatment of arthritis, one of the chronic inflammatory disorder owing to its anti-inflammatory property as indicated by earlier experiments.GEF was prepared from the fruit rind of Garcinia indica and quantified using LC-MS/MS. It was found to contain 89.4% w/w of garcinol. GEF was evaluated at the dose of 10mg/kg for its efficacy against Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis in Wistar albino rats. Paw volumes of both sides were measured by Plethysmometer and body weight was recorded on 0, 1, 5, 12 and 21st day. The hyperalgesic response was also measured by motility test and stair climbing test.GEF showed a significant reduction in paw swelling (p < 0.0001) and arthritis index (p < 0.0001) exhibiting anti-inflammatory potential. It also improves the motility and stair climbing ability of experimental animals (p < 0.05), thus reducing hyperalgesia.Garcinol enriched fraction shows anti-arthritic activity in experimental animals.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201937>Gestational Diabetes Alters the Metabolomic Profile in 2nd Trimester Amniotic Fluid in a Sex-Specific Manner.</a></h2><p>Maternal diabetes and  induce marked abnormalities in glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in the fetus, and are linked to , diabetes, and metabolic disease in the offspring, with specific metabolic characterization based on offspring sex. Gestational diabetes (GDM) has profound effects on the intrauterine milieu, which may reflect and/or modulate the function of the maternal⁻fetal unit. In order to characterize metabolic factors that affect offspring development, we profiled the metabolome of second trimester amniotic fluid (AF) from women who were subsequently diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) using a targeted metabolomics approach, profiling 459 known biochemicals through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assays. Using a nested case-control study design, we identified 69 total biochemicals altered by GDM exposure, while sex-specific analysis identified 44 and 58 metabolites in male and female offspring, respectively. The most significant changes were in glucose, amino , glutathione, fatty , sphingolipid, and bile  metabolism with specific changes identified based on the offspring sex. Targeted isotope dilution LC/MS confirmatory assays measured significant changes in docosahexaenoic  and . We conclude that the sex-specific alterations in GDM maternal⁻fetal metabolism may begin to explain the sex-specific metabolic outcomes seen in offspring exposed to GDM in utero.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492181>Adipokines secretion in feline primary adipose tissue culture in response to dietary fatty acids.</a></h2><p> in cats has been associated with alterations in adipokines including: adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple beneficial effects on -associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty acids on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic , , or palmitic , at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003).  treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic  treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty acids treatments at 25 (P = 0.2), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of  on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic  on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30648905>Dietary Fatty Acids Amplify Inflammatory Responses to Infection through p38 MAPK Signaling.</a></h2><p> is an important risk factor for severe asthma exacerbations, which are mainly caused by respiratory infections. Dietary fatty acids, which are increased systemically in obese patients and are further increased after high-fat meals, affect the innate immune system and may contribute to dysfunctional immune responses to respiratory infection. In this study we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acids on immune responses to respiratory infection in pulmonary fibroblasts and a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Cells were challenged with BSA-conjugated fatty acids (ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs], ω-3 PUFAs, or saturated fatty acids [SFAs]) +/- the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly[I:C]) or bacterial compound lipoteichoic  (LTA), and release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured. In both cell types, challenge with  (AA) (ω-6 PUFA) and poly(I:C) or LTA led to substantially greater IL-6 and CXCL8 release than either challenge alone, demonstrating synergy. In epithelial cells, palmitic  (SFA) combined with poly(I:C) also led to greater IL-6 release. The underlying signaling pathways of AA and poly(I:C)- or LTA-induced cytokine release were examined using specific signaling inhibitors and IB. Cytokine production in pulmonary fibroblasts was prostaglandin dependent, and synergistic upregulation occurred via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, whereas cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cell lines was mainly mediated through JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. We confirmed these findings using rhinovirus infection, demonstrating that AA enhances rhinovirus-induced cytokine release. This study suggests that during respiratory infection, increased levels of dietary ω-6 PUFAs and SFAs may lead to more severe airway inflammation and may contribute to and/or increase the severity of asthma exacerbations.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>
