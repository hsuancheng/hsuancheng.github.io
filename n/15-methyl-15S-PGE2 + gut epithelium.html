In addition, co-morbidities such as gastro-intestinal problems have frequently been reported. Mutations and deletion of proteins of the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains () gene-family were identified in patients with ASD, and  knock-out mouse models display autism-like phenotypes. SHANK3 proteins are not only expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show expression in gastrointestinal (GI)  and report a significantly different GI morphology in  knock-out (KO) mice. Further, we detected a significantly altered microbiota composition measured in feces of  KO mice that may contribute to inflammatory responses affecting brain development. In line with this, we found higher  lipopolysaccharide levels in liver samples of  KO mice, and detected an increase in Interleukin-6 and activated astrocytes in  KO mice. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 plays a specific role in the GI tract that may contribute to the ASD phenotype by extracerebral mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237031>Unraveling the factors and mechanism involved in persistence: Host-pathogen interactions in Helicobacter pylori.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori and humans have one of the most complex relationships in nature. How a bacterium manages to live in one of the harshest and hostile environments is a topic of unraveling mysteries. H. pylori is a prevalent species and it colonizes the human  of more than 50% of the world population. It infects the epithelial region of antrum and persists there for a long period. Over the time of evolution, H. pylori has developed complex strategies to extend the degree of inflammation in gastric mucosa. H. pylori needs specific adaptations for initial colonization into the host environment like helical shape, flagellar movement, chemotaxis, and the production of urease enzyme that neutralizes acidic environment of the stomach. There are several factors from the bacterium as well as from the host that participate in these complex interactions. On the other hand, to establish the persistent infection, H. pylori escapes the immune system by mimicking the host antigens. This pathogen has the ability to dodge the immune system and then persist there in the form of host cell, which leads to immune tolerance. H. pylori has an ability to manipulate its own pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which leads to an inhibition in the binding with specific pattern recognition receptors of the host to avoid immune cell detection. Also, it manipulates the host metabolic homeostasis in the gastric . Besides, it has several genes, which may get involved in the acquisition of nutrition from the host to survive longer in the host. Due to the persistence of H. pylori, it causes chronic inflammation and raises the chances of gastric cancer. This review highlights the important elements, which are certainly responsible for the persistence of H. pylori in the human host.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30857564>10-year experience with umbilical cord blood IgE and microbiome therapy.</a></h2><p>The benefit of probiotics in newborn children in relation to allergy and general morbidity later in life appears to be controversial. Allergic diseases represent an increasingly important health problem worldwide in recent years. This is evident in all age groups. The occurrence of allergic illnesses also continues to rise exponentially, and thus the use of preventive and prognostic methods, particularly in children with an inherently higher risk of allergy, is gaining increased importance. Since the advent of probiotics the effect of probiosis on immunity through alterations of composition and function of the human  microbiome has been increasingly studied. The exact mechanisms have not yet been clearly defined. The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (The Czech Academy of Sciences has suggested that the expression of TH1 and TH2 cytokines in umbilical blood is associated with an increased risk of allergies. The counter -balance of Th1 and Th2 affect Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and maturation of the gastrointestinal tract .We examined IgE levels in 3000 samples of umbilical blood taken from children born into families with a positive history of allergy in one or both parents from 2007 to 2017. At the age of ten days, those with high IgE were given Colinfant Newborn (a lyophilized non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia.coli) for one month, three times weekly. At 15 months and three years we investigated the levels of Immunoglobulins E,A and G, and the incidence of illness and allergy. The results revealed that allergy and high umbilical IgE is strongly linked with family history (p ≤ 0.001). We also detected differences in seasonality, especially with regards to pollen allergies. Eighty percent of children treated with Colinfant Newborn had significantly reduced IgE and morbidity at 13-15 months and 3 years, and furthermore without any clinical signs of allergy. Normalization of Immunoglobulins A and G was seen in 90% of treated subjects (p ≤ 0.001). These levels significantly correlated with an almost negligible morbidity up to 4 years of life. Colinfant Newborn, a lyophilized strain of Esherichia coli (E. coli), and a normal component of intestinal flora, readily colonizes the intestinal tract. It's long term presence significantly stimulates the production of specific and non-specific intestinal antibodies. and optimalizes immune development through tolerance. In our study Colinfant Newborn reduced the incidence of infections later in life by safely and effectively normalizing immunoglobulin levels in the majority of treated patients.Our study strongly suggests as positive effect of physiological Escherichia coli on the microbiome of newborn children as evidenced by a significantly reduced incidence of allergy and morbidity when applied early in life. These benefits appear to be strongly strain specific.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937864>Pericytes in the .</a></h2><p>This review chapter describes the current knowledge about the nature of pericytes in the , their interaction with endothelial cells in blood vessels, and their pathophysiological functions in the setting of chronic liver disease.

Although inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), multifactorial chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, have been associated with intestinal dysbiosis, the detailed interactions between host and  microbiota are still not completely understood. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) represent 1% of the intestinal . Accumulating evidence indicates that EECs are key sensors of  microbiota and/or microbial metabolites.

The study of the physiological/molecular mechanisms, mediating the responses to the monitoring of the GIT contents, has been referred to as chemosensory science. While most of the progress in this area of research has been obtained in laboratory rodents and humans, significant steps forward have also been reported in pigs. The objective of this review was to update the current knowledge on nutrient chemosensing in pigs in light of recent advances in humans and laboratory rodents. A second objective relates to informing the existence of nutrient sensors with their functionality, particularly linked to the  peptides relevant to the onset/offset of appetite. Several cell types of the intestinal  such as Paneth, goblet, tuft and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) contain subsets of chemosensory receptors also found on the tongue as part of the taste system. In particular, EECs show specific co-expression patterns between nutrient sensors and/or transceptors (transport proteins with sensing functions) and anorexigenic hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), amongst others. In addition, the administration of bitter compounds has an inhibitory effect on GIT motility and on appetite through GLP-1-, CCK-, ghrelin- and PYY-labelled EECs in the human small intestine and colon. Furthermore, the mammalian chemosensory system is the target of some bacterial metabolites. Recent studies on the human microbiome have discovered that commensal bacteria have developed strategies to stimulate chemosensory receptors and trigger host cellular functions. Finally, the study of gene polymorphisms related to nutrient sensors explains differences in food choices, food intake and appetite between individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018888>Role of innate lymphoid cells in allergic diseases.</a></h2><p> Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest and research into understanding the type 2 immune responses by the -derived cytokines interleukin (IL) 33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a unique family of effector immune cells that functionally resemble T cells but lack clonal distributed antigen receptors. Group 2 ILCs, ILC2s, are known for their capability to secrete proallergic cytokines, including IL-5 and IL-13. ILC2s are enriched at mucosal barriers in lung, , and skin, and their activation has been associated with a variety of allergic disorders.  To study the role of ILC2 in different allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A MEDLINE search was performed for articles that reported on ILC2 in allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A review of the literature revealed an important role of ILC2 in various allergic disorders.  Identification of ILC2s in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis indicates that these cells may represent a new therapeutic target.

LNFs with solid matrices may be typically categorized into three major types of formulations, viz., solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and lipid-drug conjugate nanoparticles (LDC-NPs). Solid matrix based LNFs are, potentially, the most appropriate delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs in need of improved drug solubility, permeability, absorption, or increased oral BA. In addition, LNFs as matrices are able to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs in a single matrix based on their excellent ability to form cores and shells. Interestingly, LNFs also act as delivery devices to impart chemical stability to various orally administered drugs. : Aim of the review is to forecast the presentation of pharmacokinetic characteristics of solid lipid matrix based nanocarriers which are typically biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic carrier systems for efficient oral delivery of various drugs. Efficient delivery is broadly mediated by the fact that lipophilic drugs are readily soluble in lipidic substrates that are capable of permeating across the   following oral administration, subsequently delivering the moiety of interest more efficiently across the  mucosal membrane. This enhances the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile. This article specifically focuses on the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic aspects of such solid lipid matrix based nanoformulations and possible mechanisms for better drug absorption and improved BA following oral administration. It also briefly reviews methods to access the efficacy of LNFs for improving oral BA of drugs, regulatory aspects and some interesting lipid-derived commercial formulations, with a concluding remark. : LNFs enhance the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027304>Xenobiotics Formed during Food Processing: Their Relation with the Intestinal Microbiota and Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>The colonic  is exposed to a mixture of compounds through diet, among which some are procarcinogens, whereas others have a protective effect. Therefore, the net impact of these compounds on human health depends on the overall balance between all factors involved. Strong scientific evidence has demonstrated the relationship between nitrosamines (NA), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are the major genotoxins derived from cooking and food processing, and cancer. The mechanisms of the relationship between dietary toxic xenobiotics and cancer risk are not yet well understood, but it has been suggested that differences in dietary habits affect the colonic environment by increasing or decreasing the exposure to mutagens directly and indirectly through changes in the composition and activity of the  microbiota. Several changes in the proportions of specific microbial groups have been proposed as risk factors for the development of neoplastic lesions and the enrichment of enterotoxigenic microbial strains in stool. In addition, changes in the  microbiota composition and activity promoted by diet may modify the faecal genotoxicity/cytotoxicity, which can be associated with a higher or lower risk of developing cancer. Therefore, the interaction between dietary components and intestinal bacteria may be a modifiable factor for the development of colorectal cancer in humans and deserves more attention in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954681>Regulation of immune and tissue homeostasis by Drosophila POU factors.</a></h2><p>The innate immune system of insects deploys both cellular and humoral reactions in immunocompetent tissues for protection of insects against a variety of infections, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Transcriptional regulation of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), cytokines, and other immune effectors plays a pivotal role in maintenance of immune homeostasis both prior to and after infections. The POU/Oct transcription factor family is a subclass of the homeodomain proteins present in all metazoans. POU factors are involved in regulation of development, metabolism and immunity. Their role in regulation of immune functions has recently become evident, and involves control of tissue-specific, constitutive expression of immune effectors in barrier epithelia as well as positive and negative control of immune responses in  and fat body. In addition, they have been shown to affect the composition of  microbiota and play a role in regulation of intestinal stem cell activities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of how POU transcription factors control Drosophila immune homeostasis in healthy and infected insects. The role of POU factor isoform specific regulation of stem cell activities in Drosophila and mammals is also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The dysregulation of intestinal  functions can impact organism physiology and, in humans, leads to devastating and complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, intestinal cancers, and obesity. Two decades ago, the discovery of an immune response in the intestine of the genetic model system, , sparked interest in using this model organism to dissect the mechanisms that govern  (patho) physiology in humans.

Disruption of the gingival epithelial barrier, and the subsequent penetration of exogenous pathogens into the host tissues, triggers an inflammatory response, establishing chronic infection. Currently, more than 700 different bacterial species have been identified in the oral cavity, some of which are known to be periodontopathic. These bacteria contribute to epithelial barrier dysfunction in the gingiva by producing several virulence factors. However, some bacteria in the oral cavity appear to be beneficial, helping gingival epithelial cells maintain their integrity and barrier function. This review aims to discuss current findings regarding microorganism interactions and epithelial barrier function in the oral cavity, with reference to investigations in the , where this interaction has been extensively studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30999787>Probing paracellular - transcellular tissue barrier permeability using a  mucosal explant culture system.</a></h2><p>Intestinal permeation enhancers (PEs), i.e. agents improving oral delivery of therapeutic drugs with poor bioavailability, may typically act by two principally different mechanisms: to increase either transcellular -or paracellular passage across the . With the aim to define these different modes of action in a small intestinal mucosal explant system, the transcellular-acting PE sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was compared to the paracellular-acting PE ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), using several fluorescent polar - and lipophilic probes. Here, SDS rendered the enterocyte cell membranes leaky for the relatively small polar tracers Lucifer yellow and a 3 kD Texas red-conjugated dextran, but most conspicuously SDS blocked constitutive endocytosis from the brush border. In contrast, the main action of EDTA was to increase paracellular passage across the  of both polar probes, including 10 - and 70 kDa dextrans and lipophilic probes, visualized by distinct stripy lateral staining of enterocytes and/or accumulation in the lamina propria. In addition, EDTA caused a loss of epithelial cell polarity by opening tight junctions for diffusion of domain-specific basolateral/apical cell membrane protein markers into the opposite domains. By transmission electron microscopy, SDS caused the formation of vacuoles and vesicle-like structures at the lateral cell membranes. In contrast, EDTA led to a bulging of the whole enterocyte apex, resulting in a "cobblestone" appearance of the , probably caused by an extreme contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring. We conclude that the mucosal explant system is a convenient model for predicting transcellular/paracellular modes of action of novel prospective PEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31086325>A complex human  microbiome cultured in an anaerobic intestine-on-a-chip.</a></h2><p>The diverse bacterial populations that comprise the commensal microbiome of the human intestine play a central role in health and disease. A method that sustains complex microbial communities in direct contact with living human intestinal cells and their overlying mucus layer in vitro would thus enable the investigation of host-microbiome interactions. Here, we show the extended coculture of living human intestinal  with stable communities of aerobic and anaerobic human  microbiota, using a microfluidic intestine-on-a-chip that permits the control and real-time assessment of physiologically relevant oxygen gradients. When compared to aerobic coculture conditions, the establishment of a transluminal hypoxia gradient in the chip increased intestinal barrier function and sustained a physiologically relevant level of microbial diversity, consisting of over 200 unique operational taxonomic units from 11 different genera and an abundance of obligate anaerobic bacteria, with ratios of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes similar to those observed in human faeces.

Here, we employed a series of mechanistic tests to evaluate four factors commonly assumed to influence host susceptibility: parasite exposure, barriers to infection, immune responses, and body size. We tested these factors in an aquatic host-parasite system (Daphnia dentifera and the fungal parasite, Metschnikowia bicuspidata) using both laboratory-reared and field-collected hosts. We found support for each factor as a driver of infection. Elevated parasite exposure, which occurs through consumption of infectious fungal spores, increased a host's probability of infection. The host's   functioned as a barrier to infection, but in the opposite manner from which we predicted: thinner anterior  epithelia were more resistant to infectious spores than thick epithelia. This relationship may be mediated by structural attributes associated with epithelial cell height. Fungal spores that breached the host's  barrier elicited an intensity-dependent haemocyte response that decreased the probability of infection for some Daphnia. Although larger body sizes were associated with increased levels of spore ingestion, larger hosts also had lower frequencies of parasite attack, less penetrable  barriers, and stronger haemocyte responses. After investigating which mechanisms underlie host susceptibility, we asked: do these four factors contribute equally or asymmetrically to the outcome of infection? An information-theoretic approach revealed that host immune defenses (barriers and immune responses) played the strongest roles in mediating infection outcomes. These two immunological traits may be valuable metrics for linking host susceptibility to the spread of infectious disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) that are derived from intestinal crypt stem cells are biologically relevant in an in vitro model of the intestinal . HIEs contain all intestinal epithelial cell types; however, similar to the intestine, HIEs spontaneously produce few EECs, which limits their study.To increase the number of EECs in HIEs, we used lentivirus transduction to stably engineer jejunal HIEs with doxycycline-inducible expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3), a transcription factor that drives EEC differentiation (tetNGN3-HIEs). We examined the impact of NGN3 induction on EECs by quantifying the increase in the enterochromaffin cells and other EEC subtypes. We functionally assessed secretion of serotonin and EEC hormones in response to norepinephrine and rotavirus infection.Treating tetNGN3-HIEs with doxycycline induced a dose-dependent increase of chromogranin A (ChgA)-positive and serotonin-positive cells, showing increased enterochromaffin cell differentiation. Despite increased ChgA-positive cells, other differentiated cell types of the  remained largely unchanged by gene expression and immunostaining. RNA sequencing of doxycycline-induced tetNGN3-HIEs identified increased expression of key hormones and enzymes associated with several other EEC subtypes. Doxycycline-induced tetNGN3-HIEs secreted serotonin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, peptide YY, and ghrelin in response to norepinephrine and rotavirus infection, further supporting the presence of multiple EEC types.We have combined HIEs and inducible-NGN3 expression to establish a flexible in vitro model system for functional studies of EECs in enteroids and advance the molecular and physiological investigation of EECs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

They play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by limiting microbial  interactions and preventing unnecessary microbe-driven inflammation. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) belongs to Regenerating islet-derived III proteins family and is a C-type (Ca dependent) lectin. PAP protein plays a protective effect presenting anti-inflammatory properties able to reduce the severity of colitis, preserving  barrier and epithelial inflammation. Here, we sought to determine whether PAP delivered at intestinal lumen by recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (LL-PAP) before and after chemically induced colitis is able to reduce the severity in two models of colitis. After construction and characterization of our recombinant strains, we tested their effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic-acid (DNBS) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe colitis compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. After the DSS challenge, no protective effects of LL-PAP could be detected. We determined that after 5 days administration, LL-PAP increase butyrate producer's bacteria, especially Eubacterium plexicaudatum.

A firm connection between melatonin at a physiologically relevant concentration and the  microbiota and inflammation has recently established. Herein, we summarize their crosstalk and focus on four novelties. First, how melatonin is synthesized and degraded in the  and exerts potentially diverse phenotypic effects through its diverse metabolites. Second, how melatonin mediates the activation and proliferation of intestinal mucosal immune cells with paracrine and autocrine properties. By modulating T/B cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, melatonin immunomodulatory involved in regulating T-cell differentiation, intervening T/B cell interaction and attenuating the production of pro-inflammatory factors, achieving its antioxidant action via specific receptors. Third, how melatonin exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, amyloid-β peptides via nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1) pathway to modulate intestinal immune function in immune-pineal axis.

These deleterious events were reversed by pretreating the Caco-2 cells with a selective pharmacological inhibitor of macropinocytosis, but not with the inhibitors of clathrin or caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways.Chronic ethanol exposure may increase intestinal permeability by inducing the micropinocytosis of occludin, resulting in the disruption of intestinal TJ.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534167>Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial tight junction dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Enhanced  permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic  of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on  permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved  permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295531>FXR-modulates the -vascular barrier by regulating the entry sites for bacterial translocation in experimental cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Pathological bacterial translocation (PBT) in cirrhosis is the hallmark of spontaneous bacterial infections, increasing mortality several-fold. Increased intestinal permeability is known to contribute to PBT in cirrhosis, although the role of the mucus layer has not been addressed in detail. A clear route of translocation for luminal intestinal bacteria is yet to be defined, but we hypothesize that the recently described -vascular barrier (GVB) is impaired in experimental portal hypertension, leading to increased accessibility of the vascular compartment for translocating bacteria.Cirrhosis was induced in mouse models using bile-duct ligation (BDL) and CCl. Pre-hepatic portal-hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Intestinal permeability was compared in these mice after GFP-Escherichia coli or different sized FITC-dextrans were injected into the intestine.Healthy and pre-hepatic portal-hypertensive (PPVL) mice lack translocation of FITC-dextran and GFP-E. coli from the small intestine to the liver, whereas BDL and CCl-induced cirrhotic mice demonstrate pathological translocation, which is not altered by prior thoracic-duct ligation. The mucus layer is reduced in thickness, with loss of goblet cells and Muc2-staining and expression in cirrhotic but not PPVL mice. These changes are associated with bacterial overgrowth in the inner mucus layer and pathological translocation of GFP-E. coli through the ileal . GVB is profoundly altered in BDL and CCl-mice with Ileal extravasation of large-sized 150 kDa-FITC-dextran, but only slightly altered in PPVL mice. This pathological endothelial permeability and accessibility in cirrhotic mice is associated with augmented expression of PV1 in intestinal vessels. OCA but not fexaramine stabilizes the GVB, whereas both FXR-agonists ameliorate  to liver translocation of GFP-E. coli.Cirrhosis, but not portal hypertension per se, grossly impairs the endothelial and muco-epithelial barriers, promoting PBT to the portal-venous circulation. Both barriers appear to be FXR-modulated, with FXR-agonists reducing PBT via the portal-venous route.For intestinal bacteria to enter the systemic circulation, they must cross the mucus and epithelial layer, as well as the -vascular barrier. Cirrhosis disrupts all 3 of these barriers, giving bacteria access to the portal-venous circulation and thus, the -liver axis. Diminished luminal bile acid availability, cirrhosis and the associated reduction in farnesoid x receptor (FXR) signaling seem, at least partly, to mediate these changes, as FXR-agonists reduce bacterial translocation via the portal-venous route to the liver in cirrhosis.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The vagus is the major neural connection between  and brain, and we have previously shown that ingestion of beneficial bacteria modulates behaviour and brain neurochemistry via this pathway. Given the high levels of serotonin in the , we considered if -brain signaling, and specifically the vagal pathway, might contribute to the therapeutic effect of oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Mesenteric nerve recordings were conducted in mice after treatment with SSRI to ascertain if this class of drugs resulted in increased vagal excitability. Patch clamp recordings of enteric neurons were carried out to measure activity of primary afferent neurons in the  in response to SSRI and to assess the importance of   in transducing signal. The tail suspension test (TST) was used following 14d feeding of SSRI in vagotomised and surgical sham mice to measure depressive-like behaviour. Brain mRNA expression was examined via PCR and the intestinal microbiome was assessed. Mesenteric nerve recordings in BALB/c mice demonstrated that oral treatment with SSRI leads to a significant increase in vagal activity. This effect was not observed in mice treated with a representative noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is known that signals from the  can be transmitted to the vagus via the enteric nervous system. Exposure of the  to SSRI increased the excitability of intrinsic primary afferent neurons in the myenteric plexus, through an intestinal  dependent mechanism, and alpha-diversity of  microbiota was altered. Critically, blocking vagal signaling from  to brain, via subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, abolished the antidepressive effects of oral SSRI treatment as determined by the tail suspension test. This work suggests that vagus nerve dependent -brain signaling contributes to the effects of oral SSRI and further, highlights the potential for pharmacological approaches to treatment of mood disorders that focus on vagal stimulation and may not even require therapeutic agents to enter the circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626040>Overexpression of BCL-2 in the Intestinal  Prevents Sepsis-Induced  Barrier Function Via Altering Tight Junction Protein Expression.</a></h2><p>Sepsis induces both intestinal hyperpermeability and epithelial apoptosis. While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent  barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the   (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213556>Bifidobacterium dentium Fortifies the Intestinal Mucus Layer via Autophagy and Calcium Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Much remains unknown about how the intestinal microbiome interfaces with the protective intestinal mucus layer.  species colonize the intestinal mucus layer and can modulate mucus production by goblet cells.

Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered . In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the . Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function.

However, whether 5-HT plays a functional role in bacteria from the  microbiota remains unknown. We demonstrate that elevating levels of intestinal lumenal 5-HT by oral supplementation or genetic deficiency in the host 5-HT transporter (SERT) increases the relative abundance of spore-forming members of the  microbiota, which were previously reported to promote host 5-HT biosynthesis. Within this microbial community, we identify Turicibacter sanguinis as a  bacterium that expresses a neurotransmitter sodium symporter-related protein with sequence and structural homology to mammalian SERT. T. sanguinis imports 5-HT through a mechanism that is inhibited by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. 5-HT reduces the expression of sporulation factors and membrane transporters in T. sanguinis, which is reversed by fluoxetine exposure. Treating T. sanguinis with 5-HT or fluoxetine modulates its competitive colonization in the gastrointestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, fluoxetine reduces the membership of T. sanguinis in the  microbiota of conventionally colonized mice. Host association with T. sanguinis alters intestinal expression of multiple gene pathways, including those important for lipid and steroid metabolism, with corresponding reductions in host systemic triglyceride levels and inguinal adipocyte size. Together, these findings support the notion that select bacteria indigenous to the  microbiota signal bidirectionally with the host serotonergic system to promote their fitness in the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300674>Periderm invasion contributes to epithelial formation in the teleost pharynx.</a></h2><p>The gnathostome pharyngeal cavity functions in food transport and respiration. In amniotes the mouth and nares are the only channels allowing direct contact between internal and external epithelia. In teleost fish, gill slits arise through opening of endodermal pouches and connect the pharynx to the exterior. Using transgenic zebrafish lines, cell tracing, live imaging and different markers, we investigated if pharyngeal openings enable epithelial invasion and how this modifies the pharyngeal . We conclude that in zebrafish the pharyngeal endoderm becomes overlain by cells with a peridermal phenotype. In a wave starting from pouch 2, peridermal cells from the outer skin layer invade the successive pouches until halfway their depth. Here the peridermal cells connect to a population of cells inside the pharyngeal cavity that express periderm markers, yet do not invade from outside. The latter population expands along the midline from anterior to posterior until the esophagus- boundary. Together, our results show a novel role for the periderm as an internal  becomes adapted to function as an external surface.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141690>Mucus Architecture and Near-Surface Swimming Affect Distinct Salmonella Typhimurium Infection Patterns along the Murine Intestinal Tract.</a></h2><p>Mucus separates -luminal microbes from the tissue. It is unclear how pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) can overcome this obstacle. Using live microscopy, we monitored S.Tm interactions with native murine  explants and studied how mucus affects the infection. A dense inner mucus layer covers the distal colon tissue, limiting direct tissue access. S.Tm performs near-surface swimming on this mucus layer, which allows probing for colon mucus heterogeneities, but can also entrap the bacterium in the dense inner colon mucus layer. In the cecum, dense mucus fills only the bottom of the intestinal crypts, leaving the  between crypts unshielded and prone to access by motile and non-motile bacteria alike. This explains why the cecum is highly infection permissive and represents the primary site of S.Tm enterocolitis in the streptomycin mouse model.

EECs sense luminal and circulating nutrients and respond by secreting hormones that act on multiple organs and organ systems, such as the brain, gallbladder, and pancreas, to control satiety, digestion, and glucose homeostasis. In addition, EECs act locally, on enteric neurons, endothelial cells, and the gastrointestinal , to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients. Many recent reports raise the possibility that EECs and the enteric nervous system may coordinate to regulate gastrointestinal functions. Loss of all EECs results in chronic malabsorptive diarrhea, placing EECs in a central role regulating nutrient absorption in the . Because there is increasing evidence that EECs can directly modulate the efficiency of nutrient absorption, it is possible that EECs are master regulators of a feed-forward loop connecting appetite, digestion, metabolism, and abnormally augmented nutrient absorption that perpetuates metabolic disease. This review focuses on the roles that specific EEC hormones play on glucose, peptide, and lipid absorption within the intestine.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340532>Novel Insights on the Toxicity of Phycotoxins on the  through the Targeting of Enteric Glial Cells.</a></h2><p>In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that phycotoxins can impact intestinal epithelial cells and can cross the intestinal barrier to some extent.

Whether, like animals, amoebae also use tissue-level barriers to reduce direct contact with bacteria has remained unclear. We have explored this question in the social amoeba , which forms plaques on lawns of bacteria that expand as amoebae divide and bacteria are consumed. We show that CadA, a cell adhesion protein that functions in  development, is also a bacterial agglutinin that forms a protective interface at the plaque edge that limits exposure of vegetative amoebae to bacteria. This interface is important for amoebal survival when bacteria-to-amoebae ratios are high, optimizing amoebal feeding behavior, and protecting amoebae from oxidative stress. Lectins also control bacterial access to the   of mammals to limit inflammatory processes; thus, this strategy of antibacterial defense is shared across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic taxa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309318>Distribution and co-expression patterns of specific cell markers of enteroendocrine cells in pig gastric .</a></h2><p>Although the pig is an accepted model species for human digestive physiology, no previous study of the pig gastric mucosa and gastric enteroendocrine cells has investigated the parallels between pig and human. In this study, we have investigated markers for each of the classes of gastric endocrine cells, gastrin, ghrelin, somatostatin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histidine decarboxylase, and PYY cells in pig stomach. The lining of the proximal stomach consisted of a collar of stratified squamous  surrounded by gastric cardiac glands in the fundus. This differs considerably from human that has only a narrow band of cardiac glands at its entrance, surrounded by a fundic mucosa consisting of oxyntic glands. However, the linings of the corpus and antrum are similar in pig and human. Likewise, the endocrine cell types are similar and similarly distributed in the two species. As in human, gastrin cells were almost exclusively in the antrum, ghrelin cells were most abundant in the oxyntic mucosa and PYY cells were rare. In the pig, 70% of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the antrum and 95% in the fundus contained 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), higher proportions than in human. Unlike the enteroendocrine of the small intestine, most gastric enteroendocrine cells (EEC) did not contain colocalised hormones. This is similar to human and other species. We conclude that the pig stomach has substantial similarity to human, except that the pig has a protective lining at its entrance that may reflect the difference between a pig diet with hard abrasive components and the soft foods consumed by humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339218>Intestinal responses of the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) after ingestion of an entomopathogenic bacterium strain.</a></h2><p>Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is the main fruit fly pest of tropical and subtropical countries. The application of insecticides to manage this pest has led to serious resistance problems; therefore, new ways to control B. dorsalis are required. Pathogenic bacteria are sources of biocontrol agents for pest management.We determined that a pathogenic bacterial strain, Serratia marcescens PS-1, isolated from a moribund striped flea beetle (Phyllotreta striolata), was lethal to B. dorsalis adults following ingestion. Histological analyses revealed that PS-1 damaged the intestinal , resulting in cell death within 24 h.

We sought to identify new drivers of ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory CRC.The study uses samples from patients with UC, mouse models of colitis and CRC and mice deficient for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factor ZEB1 and the DNA repair glycosylase N-methyl-purine glycosylase (MPG). Samples were analysed by immunostaining, qRT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, microbiota next-generation sequencing and ROS determination.ZEB1 was induced in the colonic  of UC and of mouse models of colitis. Compared with wild-type counterparts, -deficient mice were partially protected from experimental colitis and, in a model of inflammatory CRC, they developed fewer tumours and exhibited lower levels of DNA damage (8-oxo-dG) and higher expression of MPG. Knockdown of ZEB1 in CRC cells inhibited 8-oxo-dG induction by oxidative stress (HO) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)1β). ZEB1 bound directly to the MPG promoter whose expression inhibited. This molecular mechanism was validated at the genetic level and the crossing of -deficient and -deficient mice reverted the reduced inflammation and tumourigenesis in the former. ZEB1 expression in CRC cells induced ROS and IL1β production by macrophages that, in turn, lowered MPG in CRC cells thus amplifying a positive loop between both cells to promote DNA damage and inhibit DNA repair.ZEB1 promotes colitis and inflammatory CRC through the inhibition of MPG in epithelial cells, thus offering new therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation and inflammatory cancer.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recently, ribosomal DNA and morphological analysis resulted in the reinstatement of R. australis as a separate species from R. microplus. Both feed on cattle and can transmit bovine pathogens such as Anaplasma and Babesia species. The current treatment with acaricides is becoming increasingly less effective due to the emergence of resistant tick strains. A promising alternative can be found in the form of anti-tick vaccines. The available commercial vaccines can be used to control tick infestation, but the lack of a knockdown effect (> 90% reduction in tick numbers as seen with effective acaricides) hampers its widespread use, hence higher efficacious vaccines are needed. Instead of searching for new protective antigens, we investigated the efficacy of vaccines that contain more than one (partially) protective antigen. For screening vaccine formulations, a previously developed in vitro feeding assay was used in which R. australis larvae are fed sera that were raised against the candidate vaccine antigens. In the present study, the efficacy of the Bm86 midgut antigen and the cytosolic Subolesin (SUB) antigen were evaluated in vitro.Antiserum against recombinant Bm86 (rBm86) partially inhibited larval engorgement, whereas antiserum against recombinant SUB (rSUB) did not have any effect on feeding of larvae. Importantly, when larvae were fed a combination of antiserum against rBm86 and rSUB, a synergistic effect on significantly reducing larval infestations was found. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the rBm86 antiserum reacted with   of R. australis larvae, whereas the antiserum against rSUB stained salivary glands and rectal sac .Combining anti-Bm86 and anti-subolesin antibodies synergistically reduced R. australis larval feeding in vitro. Rhipicephalus australis is a one host tick, meaning that the larvae develop to nymphs and subsequently adults on the same host. Hence, this protective effect could be even more pronounced when larvae are used for infestation of vaccinated cattle, as the antibodies could then affect all three developmental stages.

Therefore, understanding their immunopathology is crucial. The biliary epithelial cells (BEC), expressing TLR-4, are constantly exposed to  microbes and bacterial wall LPS, and in settings of inflammation, the immune infiltrate is dense within the peribiliary region of human liver. By dual immunohistochemistry, we affirm human intrahepatic T cell infiltrate includes CCR6CD4 and AhRCD4 T cells with potential for plasticity to Th17 phenotype. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Th1 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines and LPS enhance human primary BEC release of the CCR6 ligand CCL20 and BEC secretion of Th17-polarizing cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β. Cell culture assays with human BEC secretome showed that secretome polarizes CD4 T cells toward a Th17 phenotype and supports the survival of Th17 cells. BEC secretome did not promote Th1 cell generation. Additionally, we give evidence for a mutually beneficial feedback of the type 17 cell infiltrate on BEC, showing that treatment with type 17 cytokines increases BEC proliferation, as monitored by Ki67 and activation of JAK2-STAT3 signaling. This study identifies human BEC as active players in determining the nature of the intrahepatic immune microenvironment. In settings of inflammation and/or infection, biliary  establishes a prominent peribiliary type 17 infiltrate via recruitment and retention and enhances polarization of intrahepatic CD4 cells toward Th17 cells via type 17 cytokines, and, reciprocally, Th17 cells promote BEC proliferation for biliary regeneration.

Thus, for more than a century, the principles of germ cell migration have been a focus of interest in the field of reproductive biology.Based on published reports (mainly from rodents), investigations of germ cell migration before releasing from the body, including primordial germ cells (PGCs), gonocytes, spermatogonia, and immature spermatozoon, were summarized.Germ cells migrate with various patterns, with each migration step regulated by distinct mechanisms. During development, PGCs actively and passively migrate from the extraembryonic region toward genital ridges through the hindgut . After sex determination, male germline cells migrate heterogeneously in a developmental stage-dependent manner within the testis.During migration, there are multiple gates that disallow germ cells from re-entering the proper developmental pathway after wandering off the original migration path.

The contribution of the adaptive immune response to CD pathogenesis has been extensively studied, but the absence of valid experimental models has hampered our understanding of the early steps leading to loss of gluten tolerance. Using intestinal organoids developed from duodenal biopsies from both non-celiac (NC) and celiac (CD) patients, we explored the contribution of   to CD pathogenesis and the role of microbiota-derived molecules in modulating the 's response to gluten. When compared to NC, RNA sequencing of CD organoids revealed significantly altered expression of genes associated with  barrier, innate immune response, and stem cell functions. Monolayers derived from CD organoids exposed to gliadin showed increased intestinal permeability and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to NC controls. Microbiota-derived bioproducts butyrate, lactate, and polysaccharide A improved barrier function and reduced gliadin-induced cytokine secretion.

Following SI tissue loss (as occurs in short  syndrome, or SGS), remaining SI must compensate, or "adapt"; the capacity of SI  to reprogram its regional identity has not been described. Here, we apply single-cell resolution analyses to characterize molecular changes underpinning adaptation to SGS.Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on epithelial cells isolated from distal SI of mice following 50% proximal small bowel resection (SBR) vs sham surgery. Single-cell profiles were clustered based on transcriptional similarity, reconstructing differentiation events from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) through to mature enterocytes. An unsupervised computational approach to score cell identity was used to quantify changes in regional (proximal vs distal) SI identity, validated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, qPCR, western blotting, and RNA-FISH.Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection-based clustering and visualization revealed differentiation trajectories from ISCs to mature enterocytes in sham and SBR. Cell identity scoring demonstrated segregation of enterocytes by regional SI identity: SBR enterocytes assumed more mature proximal identities. This was associated with significant upregulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress gene expression, which was validated via orthogonal analyses. Observed upstream transcriptional changes suggest retinoid metabolism and proximal transcription factor Creb3l3 drive proximalization of cell identity in response to SBR.Adaptation to proximal SBR involves regional reprogramming of ileal enterocytes toward a proximal identity. Interventions bolstering the endogenous reprogramming capacity of SI enterocytes-conceivably by engaging the retinoid metabolism pathway-merit further investigation, as they may increase enteral feeding tolerance, and obviate intestinal failure, in SGS.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Such insects often possess specialized organs for hosting the microbial symbionts. What developmental processes and mechanisms underlie the formation of the host organs for microbial symbiosis is of fundamental biological interest but poorly understood. Here we investigate the morphogenesis of the midgut symbiotic organ and the process of symbiont colonization therein during the developmental course of the stinkbug . Upon hatching, the midgut is a simple and smooth tube. Subsequently, symbiont colonization to the posterior midgut occurs, and thickening and folding of the midgut  proceed during the first instar period. By the second instar, rudimentary crypts have formed, and their inner cavities are colonized by the symbiotic bacteria. From the second instar to the fourth instar, while the alimentary tract grows and the posterior midgut is established as the symbiotic organ with numerous crypts, the anterior midgut and the posterior midgut are structurally and functionally isolated by a strong constriction in the middle. By the early fifth instar, the midgut symbiotic organ attains the maximal length, but toward the mid fifth instar, the basal region of each crypt starts to constrict and narrow, which deforms the midgut symbiotic organ as a whole into a shorter, thicker and twisted shape. By the late fifth instar to adulthood, the crypts are constricted off, by which the symbiotic bacteria are confined in the crypt cavities and isolated from the midgut main tract, and concurrently, the strong midgut constriction in the middle becomes loose and open, by which the food flow from the anterior midgut to the posterior midgut recovers. This study provides the most detailed and comprehensive descriptions ever reported on the morphogenesis of the symbiotic organ and the process of symbiont colonization in an obligatory insect-bacterium  symbiotic system. Considering that  is recently emerging as a useful model system for experimentally studying the intimate insect-microbe  symbiosis, the knowledge obtained in this study establishes the foundation for the further development of this research field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30962874>Cofactors of wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis do not increase highly individual gliadin absorption in healthy volunteers.</a></h2><p>In wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA), cofactors such as exercise, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), alcohol or unfavorable climatic conditions are required to elicit a reaction to wheat products. The mechanism of action of these cofactors is unknown, but an increase of gliadin absorption has been speculated. Our objectives were to study gliadin absorption with and without cofactors and to correlate plasma gliadin levels with factors influencing protein absorption in healthy volunteers.Twelve healthy probands (six males, six females; aged 20-56 years) ingested 32 g of gluten without any cofactor or in combination with cofactors aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ASA, alcohol and pantoprazole. Gliadin serum levels were measured up to 120 min afterwards and the intestinal barrier function protein zonulin in stool was collected before and after the procedure; both were measured by ELISA. Stool microbiota profile was obtained by 16S gene sequencing.Within 15 min after gluten intake, gliadin concentrations in blood serum increased from baseline in all subjects reaching highly variable peak levels after 15-90 min. Addition of cofactors did not lead to substantially higher gliadin levels, although variability of levels was higher with differences between individuals (p < 0.001) and increased levels at later time points. Zonulin levels in stool were associated neither with addition of cofactors nor with peak gliadin concentrations. There were no differences in  microbiota between the different interventions, although the composition of microbiota (p < 0.001) and the redundancy discriminant analysis (p < 0.007) differed in probands with low versus high stool zonulin levels.The adsorption of gliadin in the  in healthy volunteers is less dependent on cofactors than has been hypothesized. Patients with WDEIA may have a predisposition needed for the additional effect of cofactors, e.g., hyperresponsive or damaged intestinal . Alternatively, other mechanisms, such as cofactor-induced blood flow redistribution, increased activity of tissue transglutaminase, or increases in plasma osmolality and acidosis inducing basophil and mast cell histamine release may play the major role in WDEIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30895556>The   from feeding to fasting in the predatory soil mite Pergamasus longicornis (Mesostigmata: Parasitidae): one tissue, two roles.</a></h2><p>A review of acarine  physiology based on published narratives dispersed over the historical international literature is given. Then, in an experimental study of the free-living predatory soil mite Pergamasus longicornis (Berlese), quantitative micro-anatomical changes in the   are critically assessed from a temporal series of histological sections during and after feeding on larval dipteran prey. An argued functional synthesis based upon comparative kinetics is offered for verification in other mesostigmatids. Mid- and hind- epithelia cell types interconvert in a rational way dependent upon the physical consequences of ingestion, absorption and egestion. The fasted transitional pseudo-stratified  rapidly becomes first squamous on prey ingestion (by stretching), then columnar during digestion before confirmed partial disintegration ( 'lumenation') during egestion back to a pseudo-stratified state. Exponential processes within the mid- and endodermic hind- exhibit 'stiff' dynamics. Cells expand rapidly ([Formula: see text] 22.9-49.5 min) and vacuolate quickly ([Formula: see text] 1.1 h). Cells shrink very slowly ([Formula: see text] 4.9 days) and devacuolate gently ([Formula: see text] 1.0-1.7 days). Egestive cellular degeneration has an initial [Formula: see text] 7.7 h. Digestion appears to be triggered by maximum  expansion-estimated at 10 min post start of feeding. Synchrony with changes in  lumen contents suggests common changes in physiological function over time for the cells as a whole tightly-coupled . Distinct in architecture as a tissue over time the various constituent cell types appear functionally the same. Functional phases are: early fluid transportation (0-1 h) and extracellular activity (10-90 min); through rising food absorption (10 min to [Formula: see text] day); to slow intracellular meal processing and degenerative egestive waste material production (1 to [Formula: see text] days) much as in ticks. The same  is both absorptive and degenerative in role. The switch in predominant physiology begins 4 h after the start of feeding. Two separate pulses of clavate cells appear to be a mechanism to facilitate transport by increasing epithelial surface area in contact with the lumen. Free-floating cells may augment early extracellular lumenal digestion. Possible evidence for salivary enzyme alkaline-related extra-corporeal digestion was found. Giant mycetome-like cells were found embedded in the mid- wall. Anteriorly, the mid- behaves like a temporally expendable food processing tissue and minor long-term resistive store. Posteriorly the mid- behaves like a major assimilative/catabolic tissue and 'last-out' food depot (i.e., a 'hepatopancreas' function) allowing the mite to resist starvation for up to 3.5 weeks after a single meal. A 'conveyor-belt' wave of physiology (i.e., feeding and digestion, then egestion and excretion) sweeps posteriorly but not necessarily pygidially over time. Assimilation efficiency is estimated at 82%. The total feeding cycle time histologically from a single meal allowing for the bulk of intracellular digestion and egestive release is not 52.5 h but of the order of 6 days ([Formula: see text] total  emptyings per day), plus typically a further 3 days for subsequent excretion to occur. Final complete  system clearance in this cryptozooid may take much longer ([Formula: see text] days). A common physiology across the anactinotrichid acarines is proposed. A look to the future of this field is included.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604999>Small molecule FAK activator promotes human intestinal epithelial monolayer wound closure and mouse ulcer healing.</a></h2><p>GI mucosal healing requires epithelial sheet migration. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) stimulates epithelial motility. A virtual screen identified the small drug-like FAK mimic ZINC40099027, which activates FAK. We assessed whether ZINC40099027 promotes FAK-Tyr-397 phosphorylation and wound healing in Caco-2 monolayers and two mouse intestinal injury models. Murine small bowel ulcers were generated by topical serosal acetic acid or subcutaneous indomethacin in C57BL/6J mice. One day later, we began treatment with ZINC40099027 or DMSO, staining the mucosa for phosphorylated FAK and Ki-67 and measuring mucosal ulcer area, serum creatinine, ALT, and body weight at day 4. ZINC40099027 (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently activated FAK phosphorylation, without activating Pyk2-Tyr-402 or Src-Tyr-419. ZINC40099027 did not stimulate proliferation, and stimulated wound closure independently of proliferation. The FAK inhibitor PF-573228 prevented ZINC40099027-stimulated wound closure. In both mouse ulcer models, ZINC40099027accelerated mucosal wound healing. FAK phosphorylation was increased in jejunal  at the ulcer edge, and Ki-67 staining was unchanged in jejunal mucosa. ZINC40099027 serum concentration at sacrifice resembled the effective concentration in vitro. Weight, creatinine and ALT did not differ between groups. Small molecule FAK activators can specifically promote epithelial restitution and mucosal healing and may be useful to treat  mucosal injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649668>The Roles of Peyer's Patches and Microfold Cells in the  Immune System: Relevance to Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h2><p>Microfold (M) cells are located in the  covering mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as the Peyer's patches (PPs) of the small intestine. M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31486062>Innervation and nerve-immune cell contacts in mouse Peyer's patches.</a></h2><p>Neural regulation of the function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) relies on a delicate balance of the two divisions of its nervous system, namely, the intrinsic and extrinsic divisions. The intrinsic innervation is provided by the enteric nervous system (ENS), whereas the extrinsic innervation includes sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve fibers and extrinsic sensory nerve fibers. In the present study, we used immunofluorescent staining of neurofilament-heavy (NF-H) to reveal the distribution of nerve fibers and their associations with immune cells inside mouse Peyer's patches (PP), an essential part of -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our results demonstrate (1) the presence of an extensive meshwork of NF-H-immunoreactive presumptive nerve fibers in all PP compartments including the lymphoid nodules, interfollicular region, follicle-associated , and subepithelial dome; (2) close associations/contacts of nerve fibers with blood vessels including high endothelial venules, indicating neural control of blood flow and immune cell dynamics inside the PP; (3) close contacts between nerve fibers/endings and B/T cells and various subsets of dendritic cells ( e.g., B220-, B220+, CD4-, CD4+, CD8-, and CD8+). Our novel findings concerning PP innervation and nerve-immune-cell contacts in situ should facilitate our understanding of bi-directional communications between the PNS and GALT. Since the innervation of the , including PP, might be important in the pathogenesis and progression of some neurological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, e.g., prion diseases and inflammatory bowel disease, better knowledge of PNS-immune system interactions in the GALT (including PP) should benefit the development of potential treatments for these diseases via neuroimmune manipulations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274093>[The key role of bacteriophages in the defense of the   against pathogenic bacteria].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31091514>A 3D construct of the intestinal canal with wrinkle morphology on a centrifugation configuring microfluidic chip.</a></h2><p>A new in vitro  microfluidic chip that mimics in vivo intestinal canal morphology and stimulation is developed to contribute to research into tissue engineering, and intestinal development and function. This strategy utilizes centrifugation to configure spatial cells along the side wall of a vertical cylinder-like microfluidic chamber, by which a tubular intestinal  cell sheet is formed. Diverse intestinal cell lines are inoculated to address this approach. Furthermore, to generate microenvironmental stimulation, low-level centrifugation introduces fluid flow to this microfluidic system perpendicularly acting on cell sheet cultivation for several days. Fluid flow engenders the sectional cell sheet to bend toward the cell chamber lumen, which manifests an intestinal  vaulted and wrinkle morphology. This may mimic the fluid flow existing in in vivo material transportation and the absorption of the   barrier. In addition, the same fluid flow stimulation was reproduced in another Transwell system, which also exhibited a wrinkle  cell sheet. Under fluid flow stimulation, some of the villus specific genes' expression level increased in the microfluidics and Transwell insert.

Increased levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -a surrogate marker of GBT- contribute to maintain a chronic inflammatory state. However, circulating LPS can be neutralized by lipoproteins and transported to the liver for elimination. While ESRD-associated GBT has been widely described, less is known about its changes and impact on clinical outcome after kidney transplantation (KT). One hundred and forty-six renal transplant recipients with serum samples obtained immediately before and 1 year after transplantation (1-Year post KT) were included. Intestinal  integrity (iFABP), total LPS (by measuring 3-hydroxymyristate), LPS activity (biologically active LPS measured by the LAL assay), inflammatory biomarkers (sCD14 and cytokines), lipoproteins and LPS-binding proteins (LBP and phospholipid transfer protein [PLTP] activity) were simultaneously measured. At 1-Year post KT, iFABP decreased but remained higher than in normal volunteers. Total LPS concentration remained stable while LPS activity decreased. Inflammation biomarkers decreased 1-Year post KT. We concomitantly observed an increase in lipoproteins. Higher sCD14 levels before transplantation was associated with lower incidence of acute rejection. Although GBT remained stable after KT, the contemporary increase in lipoproteins could bind circulating LPS and contribute concomitantly to neutralization of LPS activity, as well as improvement in ESRD-associated chronic inflammation. Chronic exposure to LPS in ESRD could promote endotoxin tolerance and explain why patients with higher pre-transplant sCD14 are less prompt to develop acute rejection after transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138751>Infection-Induced Intestinal Dysbiosis Is Mediated by Macrophage Activation and Nitrate Production.</a></h2><p>Oral infection of C57BL/6J mice with  results in a marked bacterial dysbiosis and the development of severe pathology in the distal small intestine that is dependent on CD4 T cells and interferon gamma (IFN-γ).

At the same time, beneficial nutrients and water have to be absorbed by the . To prevent development of intestinal inflammation or tumour formation, intestinal homeostasis has to be tightly controlled and therefore a strict balance between cell death and proliferation has to be maintained. The proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was shown to play a striking role for the regulation of this balance in the . Depending on the cellular conditions, on the one hand TNFα is able to mediate cell survival by activating NFκB signalling. On the other hand, TNFα might trigger cell death, in particular caspase-dependent apoptosis but also caspase-independent programmed necrosis. By regulating these cell death and survival mechanisms, TNFα exerts a variety of beneficial functions in the intestine. However, TNFα signalling is also supposed to play a critical role for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious diseases, intestinal wound healing and tumour formation.

Fetal lambs were IA exposed to  (, UP) for six days from 127 d-133 d of gestational age (GA). The plant sterols β-sitosterol and campesterol, dissolved with β-cyclodextrin (carrier), were given IA every two days from 122 d-131 d GA. Fetal circulatory cytokine levels,  inflammation, intestinal injury, enterocyte maturation, and mucosal phospholipid and bile acid profiles were measured at 133 d GA (term 150 d). IA plant sterol administration blocked a fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Plant sterols reduced intestinal accumulation of proinflammatory phospholipids and tended to prevent mucosal myeloperoxidase-positive (MPO) cell influx, indicating an inhibition of  inflammation. IA administration of plant sterols and carrier diminished intestinal mucosal damage, stimulated maturation of the immature , and partially prevented -driven reduction of mucosal bile acids.

Since the chemical and physical characteristics of these smaller plastic fragments are markedly different with respect to their bulk product, the potential toxicological effects in the environment need to be deeply investigated. To partially fill this gap of knowledge, the aim of this study was to evaluate the polystyrene nanobead intake in the tissues of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and their related toxicity. Embryos at 72 h post fertilization (hpf) were exposed for 48 h to 0.5 μm fluorescent polystyrene nanobeads at a concentration of 1 mg L. Confocal microscopy was employed to investigate nanoplastic ingestion and tissue infiltration, while potential sub-lethal effects were evaluated by measuring several endpoints, which covered the adverse effects at the molecular (protein carbonylation), cellular (P-glycoprotein, activity of several antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes) and organism levels by evaluating of possible changes in the embryos' swimming behaviour. Imaging observations clearly highlighted the nanoplastics' uptake, showing nanobeads not only in the digestive tract, but also migrating to other tissues through the  .

Potential failures, such as poor permeability or interaction with efflux drug transporters, can be identified in epithelial Caco-2 monolayer models and can impact a drug candidate's progression onto the next stages of the drug development process. Whilst monolayer models demonstrate reasonably good prediction of  permeability for some compounds, more developed  tools are needed to assess new entities that enable closer  correlation.

Previous studies have shown that starter feeding can effectively facilitate the growth and development of the rumen in ruminants. However, the mechanism through which starter feeding stimulates the development of the rumen is not clear. Here, we performed an integrated analysis in ruminal microbiota and a host transcriptomic profile in a lamb model with the intervention of starter feed to understand the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk in stimulating the development of the ruminal .Decreased ruminal pH and increased acetate and butyrate concentrations in the rumen, followed by increasing rumen organ index, were observed in lambs supplemented with starter. Using metagenome sequencing in combination with 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the results showed the abundance of acetate-producing Mitsuokella spp., lactate-producing Sharpea spp., lactate-utilizing Megasphaera spp., and Entodinium spp. was enriched in rumen microbial communities in the starter-feed group. The abundances of genes involved in sugar degradation were decreased in starter-feed lambs, but the GH13 encoding α-amylase was obviously increased. Rumen epithelial transcriptome analysis revealed that seven differentially expressed genes, including MAPK1, PIK3CB, TNFSF10, ITGA6, SNAI2, SAV1, and DLG, related to the cell growth module were upregulated, and BAD's promotion of cell death was downregulated. Correlation analysis revealed that the increase in the concentrations of acetate and butyrate significantly correlated with the expression of these genes, which indicates acetate and butyrate likely acted as important drivers in the ruminal microbiome-host crosstalk.The present study comprehensively describes the symbiotic relationship between the rumen microbiota and the host in lambs after starter feeding.

Here, we tested the effect of bacitracin towards TcdB, a major virulence factor of  contributing to severe -associated diseases (CDAD) including pseudomembranous colitis. Bacitracin protected stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids as well as human  epithelial cells from intoxication with TcdB. Moreover, it prevented the TcdB-induced disruption of epithelia formed by   cells  and maintained the barrier function as detected by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). In the presence of bacitracin, TcdB was not able reach its substrate Rac1 in the cytosol of human epithelial cells, most likely because its pH-dependent transport across cell membranes into the cytosol is decreased by bacitracin. In conclusion, in addition to its direct antibiotic activity against  and its inhibitory effect towards the toxin CDT, bacitracin neutralizes the exotoxin TcdB of this important pathogenic bacterium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463705>Immune activity at the   in the larval sea urchin.</a></h2><p>The embryo of the purple sea urchin has been a fruitful model for the study of developmental gene regulatory networks.

Vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies result in less diverse, dysbiotic microbial communities and increased susceptibility to infection or injury of the gastrointestinal tract. The vitamin A and vitamin D receptors are nuclear receptors expressed by the host, but not the microbiota. Vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal  and mucosal immune cells underlies the effects of these nutrients on the microbiota. Vitamin A and vitamin D regulate the expression of tight junction proteins on intestinal epithelial cells that are critical for barrier function in the . Other shared functions of vitamin A and vitamin D include the support of innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 by T cells, and induction of regulatory T cells in the mucosal tissues. There are some unique functions of vitamin A and D; for example, vitamin A induces  homing receptors on T cells, while vitamin D suppresses  homing receptors on T cells. Together, vitamin A- and vitamin D-mediated regulation of the intestinal  and mucosal immune system shape the microbial communities in the  to maintain homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652951>The Pivotal Role of TRP Channels in Homeostasis and Diseases throughout the Gastrointestinal Tract.</a></h2><p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels superfamily are a large group of proteins that play crucial roles in cellular processes. For example, these cation channels act as sensors in the detection and transduction of stimuli of temperature, small molecules, voltage, pH, and mechanical constrains. Over the past decades, different members of the TRP channels have been identified in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract playing multiple modulatory roles. Noteworthy, TRPs support critical functions related to the taste perception, mechanosensation, and pain. They also participate in the modulation of motility and secretions of the human . Last but not least, altered expression or activity and mutations in the TRP genes are often related to a wide range of disorders of the  , including inflammatory bowel disease, fibrosis, visceral hyperalgesia, irritable bowel syndrome, and colorectal cancer. TRP channels could therefore be promising drug targets for the treatment of GI malignancies. This review aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the most recent advances highlighting the expression and function of TRP channels in the GI tract, and secondly, the description of the potential roles of TRPs in relevant disorders is discussed reporting our standpoint on GI tract-TRP channels interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590302>Mycotoxin Occurrence in Maize Silage-A Neglected Risk for Bovine  Health?</a></h2><p>Forages are important components of dairy cattle rations but might harbor a plethora of mycotoxins. Ruminants are considered to be less susceptible to the adverse health effects of mycotoxins, mainly because the ruminal microflora degrades certain mycotoxins. Yet, impairment of the ruminal degradation capacity or high ruminal stability of toxins can entail that the intestinal  is exposed to significant mycotoxin amounts. The aims of our study were to assess i) the mycotoxin occurrence in maize silage and ii) the cytotoxicity of relevant mycotoxins on bovine intestinal cells. In total, 158 maize silage samples were collected from European dairy cattle farms. LC-MS/MS-based analysis of 61 mycotoxins revealed the presence of emerging mycotoxins (e.g. emodin, culmorin, enniatin B1, enniatin B, and beauvericin) in more than 70% of samples. Among the regulated mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were most frequently detected (67.7%). Overall, 87% of maize silages contained more than five mycotoxins. Using an in vitro model with calf small intestinal epithelial cells B, the cytotoxicity of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1 and enniatin B was evaluated (0-200 µM). Absolute IC50 values varied in dependence of employed assay and were 1.2-3.6 µM, 0.8-1.0 µM, 8.6-18.3 µM, and 4.0-6.7 µM for deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1, and enniatin B, respectively.

This stark difference between availability and requirement can be dealt with owing to the root's architecture as an inverted . In roots, the two epithelial characteristics (selective acquisition and diffusion barrier) are split between two cell layers: the epidermis at the root periphery and the endodermis as the innermost cortical cell layer around the vasculature. Polarized transport of nutrients across the root  can be achieved through different pathways: apoplastic, symplastic, or coupled transcellular. This review highlights different features of the root that allow this polarized transport. Special emphasis is placed on the coupled transcellular pathway, facilitated by polarized nutrient carriers along root cell layers but barred by suberin lamellae in endodermal cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A central determinant of absorption and distribution of flavonoids in the human body is the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2, expressed in   and other barrier tissues. While flavonoids were previously identified as substrates and/or inhibitors of this protein, precise enzyme kinetic calculations of affinity and activity parameters are rare due to the lack of suitable experimental models. We present a novel method that allows the direct measurement of kinetic constants for ABCG2-mediated cellular efflux of natural flavonoids thanks to the application of fluorogenic 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, which reacts with intracellular flavonoids forming a fluorescent, nonmembrane-permeable conjugate, thus making it possible to measure the intracellular substrate concentration throughout the experiment. Our studies were performed in Madin-Darby canine kidney II-derived cell lines expressing human ABCG2 and involve substrate efflux from whole, unmodified cells, precluding the need for plasma membrane vesicle preparation. We present methods for calculation of enzyme kinetic constants by measuring substrate concentration at efflux-influx equilibrium or during efflux from preloaded cells, and we obtained   values of 137 M for quercetin, 36 M for kaempferol, and 348 M for luteolin. Our method also allows direct verification of the transport inhibition mechanism and potentially the structure-activity relationship in substrates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The study presents the first direct calculation of kinetic constants for enzyme-mediated active transport of natural flavonoids in a whole-cell assay, using a fluorogenic compound to measure intracellular substrate concentrations at specific time points. It has implications for nutriceutical use of polyphenols, mechanisms of food-drug interactions, and studies on absorption/distribution-determining membrane transporters, allowing a quantitative approach to pharmacokinetics of flavonoid transport across barrier tissues.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407650>Review: The roles and functions of glutamine on intestinal health and performance of weaning pigs.</a></h2><p>The  is composed of a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells and plays important roles in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, immune and barrier functions and amino acid metabolism. Weaning stress impairs piglet intestinal  structural and functional integrities, which results in reduced feed intake, growth rates and increased morbidity and mortality. Several measures are needed to maintain swine  development and growth performance after weaning stress. A large body of evidence indicates that, in weaning piglets, glutamine, a functional amino acid, may improve growth performance and intestinal morphology, reduce oxidative damage, stimulate enterocyte proliferation, modulate cell survival and death and enhance intestinal paracellular permeability.

Located at close proximity to the colorectal , the  microbiota comprises a large population of microorganisms that interact with host cells to regulate many physiological processes, such as energy harvest, metabolism and immune response. Sequencing studies have revealed microbial compositional and ecological changes in patients with CRC, whereas functional studies in animal models have pinpointed the roles of several bacteria in colorectal carcinogenesis, including Fusobacterium nucleatum and certain strains of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. These findings give new opportunities to take advantage of our knowledge on the  microbiota for clinical applications, such as  microbiota analysis as screening, prognostic or predictive biomarkers, or modulating microorganisms to prevent cancer, augment therapies and reduce adverse effects of treatment. This Review aims to provide an overview and discussion of the  microbiota in colorectal neoplasia, including relevant mechanisms in microbiota-related carcinogenesis, the potential of utilizing the microbiota as CRC biomarkers, and the prospect for modulating the microbiota for CRC prevention or treatment.

The molecular machinery and biological significance of M cell differentiation, however, remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Sox8, a member of the SRY-related HMG box transcription factor family, is specifically expressed by M cells in the intestinal . The expression of Sox8 requires activation of RANKL-RelB signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays revealed that Sox8 directly binds the promoter region of  to increase  expression, which is the hallmark of functionally mature M cells. Furthermore, genetic deletion of  causes a marked decrease in the number of mature M cells, resulting in reduced antigen uptake in Peyer's patches. Consequently, juvenile -deficient mice showed attenuated germinal center reactions and antigen-specific IgA responses. These findings indicate that Sox8 plays an essential role in the development of M cells to establish mucosal immune responses.© 2019 Kimura et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964858>Infection-generated electric field in   drives bidirectional migration of macrophages.</a></h2><p>Many bacterial pathogens hijack macrophages to egress from the port of entry to the lymphatic drainage and/or bloodstream, causing dissemination of life-threatening infections. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that Salmonella infection generates directional electric fields (EFs) in the follicle-associated  of mouse cecum. In vitro application of an EF, mimicking the infection-generated electric field (IGEF), induces directional migration of primary mouse macrophages to the anode, which is reversed to the cathode upon Salmonella infection. This infection-dependent directional switch is independent of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system. The switch is accompanied by a reduction of sialic acids on glycosylated surface components during phagocytosis of bacteria, which is absent in macrophages challenged by microspheres. Moreover, enzymatic cleavage of terminally exposed sialic acids reduces macrophage surface negativity and severely impairs directional migration of macrophages in response to an EF. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044013>Quantification of serine protease HtrA molecules secreted by the foodborne pathogen .</a></h2><p> is a major food-borne pathogen and a worldwide health threat. Utilizing different virulence factors,  invades the host's intestinal epithelial cell layer. One important factor in this process is the serine protease HtrA, which is secreted into the extracellular space, and helps the bacteria to transmigrate across the   by cleaving various cell-cell adhesion proteins. The aim of the present study is to quantify the amount of HtrA molecules secreted per bacterial cell in liquid culture and during infection.HtrA protein purification and quantitative Western blotting were used to determine the number of HtrA molecules secreted by two  model strains, 11168 and 81-176, in liquid culture during an 8-h time course. On average, the two strains yielded similar HtrA secretion rates, with strain 11168 secreting 4314 ± 949 molecules and 81-176 secreting 5483 ± 1246 per bacterium after 2 h. After 8 h, both strains showed a decrease in the average amount of HtrA secreted per bacterial cell over time. Secretion of HtrA by strain 11168 reduced to about 1772 ± 520 molecules and only 2151 ± 562 HtrA molecules were secreted by strain 81-176 at this time point. During infection of  epithelial cells, the secretion of HtrA is slightly higher with a similar secretion pattern over time compared to culturing in vitro.We determined the number of HtrA molecules secreted by single  cells over time. The results suggest that HtrA secretion is regulated in a time-dependent fashion, leading to increasing accumulative HtrA concentrations in the extracellular medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030221>Feeding of deoxynivalenol increases the intestinal paracellular permeability of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the deleterious effects attributed to mycotoxins, in particular on the intestine, faced increased attention and it was shown that deoxynivalenol (DON) causes adverse effects on  health. In this context, it has been repeatedly reported that DON can alter the intestinal morphology, disrupt the intestinal barrier and reduce nutrient absorption. The underlying mechanism of a compromised intestinal barrier caused by DON in chickens has yet to be illustrated. Although, DON is rapidly absorbed from the upper parts of the small intestine, the effects on the large intestine cannot be excluded. Additionally, a damaging effect of DON on the   might decrease the resistance of the  against infectious agents. Consequently, the objectives of the present studies were: (1) to investigate the impact of DON on the epithelial paracellular permeability by demonstrating the mucosal to serosal flux of C-mannitol in the small and large intestine applying Ussing chambers and (2) to delineate the effects of DON on the colonization and translocation of Escherichia coli. Both parameters are well suited as potential indicators for  barrier failure. For this, a total of 75 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were housed in floor pens on wood shavings with feed and water provided ad libitum. Birds were randomly allocated to three different groups (n = 25 with 5 replicates/group) and were fed for 5 weeks with either contaminated diets (5 or 10 mg DON/kg feed) or basal diets (control). Body weight (BW) and BW gain of birds in the group fed with 10 mg/kg DON were significantly lower than in group with 5 mg/kg DON and the control group. Moreover, the mannitol flux in jejunum and cecum was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in DON-fed groups compared to control birds. Consistent with this, DON enhanced the translocation of E. coli with a higher number of bacteria encountered in the spleen and liver. Altogether, the actual results verified that DON can alter the intestinal paracellular permeability in broiler chickens and facilitates the translocation of enteric microorganisms such as E. coli to extra-intestinal organs. Considering that moderate levels of DON are present in feed, the consumption of DON-contaminated feed can induce an intestinal breakdown with negative consequences on broiler health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862756>A More Robust  Microbiota in Calorie-Restricted Mice Is Associated with Attenuated Intestinal Injury Caused by the Chemotherapy Drug Cyclophosphamide.</a></h2><p>Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is widely used in cancer chemotherapy, but it often induces mucositis, in which the disruption of the  microbiota might play a pivotal role. Whether the manipulation of the  microbiota can be used as a strategy to improve CTX-induced mucositis remains to be studied. Here we observed the effects of a 4-week calorie restriction (CR) on CTX-induced mucositis. Compared with -fed mice, CR mice showed significantly less mucositis in response to CTX, including lower intestinal permeability, less bacterial translocation, higher number of epithelial stem cells, and less  damage. CTX induced significant shifts of the  microbiota of the  microbiota in -fed control mice. In contrast, CR mice showed no significant change in their  microbiota in responding to CTX treatment. CR significantly enriched the  microbiota in  and  which are known to mitigate inflammation and improve  barrier function. These findings suggest that CR remodeled  microbiota is more robust and may contribute to attenuate the side effects of cyclophosphamide, which supports the concept that cancer chemotherapy would benefit from strategies targeting the  microbiota. Improving the  microbiota via calorie restriction is beneficial for human health. Our findings showed differential responses between calorie-restricted mice and -fed mice. Compared with the -fed mice, the calorie-restricted mice were less susceptible to cyclophosphamide side effects otherwise observed on the  integrity and its microbiota. These results show the potential benefits of manipulating the  microbiota with CR prior to cancer chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517482>16α-Hydroxytrametenolic Acid from  Improves Intestinal Barrier Function Through the Glucocorticoid Receptor-Mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Pathway.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the effect of triterpenoids from edible mushroom  on intestinal  integrity and revealed the transcriptional regulatory pathways that underpin restorative mechanisms in the . Based on computational docking studies, transcriptional activation experiments and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein immunofluorescence localization assays in cultured cells, 16α-hydroxytrametenolic acid (HTA) was discovered as a novel GR agonist in this study. HTA ameliorates TNF-α-induced Caco-2 monolayer intestinal epithelial barrier damage and suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), which attenuated downstream IκB and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation through GR activation. Moreover, HTA prevented NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and binding to its cis-element and suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced downstream NO production and pro-inflammatory cytokines at both protein and mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, HTA from  improves intestinal barrier function through a GR-mediated PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and may be potentially exploited as a supportive dietary therapeutic strategy for restoring  health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872394>Crypt fusion as a homeostatic mechanism in the human colon.</a></h2><p>The crypt population in the human intestine is dynamic: crypts can divide to produce two new daughter crypts through a process termed crypt fission, but whether this is balanced by a second process to remove crypts, as recently shown in mouse models, is uncertain. We examined whether crypt fusion (the process of two neighbouring crypts fusing into a single daughter crypt) occurs in the human colon.We used somatic alterations in the gene cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as lineage tracing markers to assess the clonality of bifurcating colon crypts (n=309 bifurcating crypts from 13 patients). Mathematical modelling was used to determine whether the existence of crypt fusion can explain the experimental data, and how the process of fusion influences the rate of crypt fission.In 55% (21/38) of bifurcating crypts in which clonality could be assessed, we observed perfect segregation of clonal lineages to the respective crypt arms. Mathematical modelling showed that this frequency of perfect segregation could not be explained by fission alone (p<10). With the rates of fission and fusion taken to be approximately equal, we then used the distribution of CCO-deficient patch size to estimate the rate of crypt fission, finding a value of around 0.011 divisions/crypt/year.We have provided the evidence that human colonic crypts undergo fusion, a potential homeostatic process to regulate total crypt number. The existence of crypt fusion in the human colon adds a new facet to our understanding of the highly dynamic and plastic phenotype of the colonic .© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrated that TRAIL regulates autoimmune inflammation and immune cell homeostasis in several autoimmune animal models, suggesting a novel immunoregulatory role of TRAIL in autoimmune diseases. However, the impact of TRAIL in inflammatory bowel disease is yet undefined. This study is to address the therapeutic effects and immunoregulatory role of TRAIL in autoimmune  inflammation. We demonstrated herein that TRAIL significantly suppressed  inflammation and reduced the severity of colitis in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model. Suppression of  inflammation was not due to induction of apoptosis in colonic T cells, dendritic cells, or  cells by TRAIL. In contrast, TRAIL directly inhibited activation of colitogenic T cells and development of  inflammation in an adoptive transfer-induced colitis model. The anti-inflammatory effects of TRAIL on colitis were abolished when T cells from TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) knockout mice were adoptively transferred, suggesting that TRAIL regulates autoreactive colitogenic T-cell activation in the development of  inflammation. Our results demonstrate that TRAIL effectively inhibited colonic T-cell activation and suppressed autoimmune colitis, suggesting a potential therapeutic application of TRAIL in human inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504777>Loss of NLRP6 expression increases the severity of acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Nlrp6 is a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) that forms atypical inflammasomes. Nlrp6 modulates the   interaction with the microbiota. However, the expression and function of Nlrp6 in the kidney, a sterile environment, have not been characterized. We explored the role of Nlrp6 in acute kidney injury (AKI).In a transcriptomics array of murine nephrotoxic AKI, Nlrp6 and Naip3 were the only significantly downregulated NLR genes. The functional implications of Nlrp6 downregulation were explored in mice and in cultured murine tubular cells.Nlrp6 was expressed by healthy murine and human kidney tubular , and expression was reduced during human kidney injury or murine nephrotoxic AKI induced by cisplatin or a folic acid overdose. Genetic Nlrp6 deficiency resulted in upregulation of kidney extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and more severe AKI and kidney inflammation. In cultured tubular cells, Nlrp6 downregulation induced by specific small interfering RNA resulted in upregulation of ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and chemokine messenger RNA expression and downregulation of the nephroprotective gene Klotho. MAPK inhibition prevented the inflammatory response in Nlrp6-deficient cells.Nlrp6 dampens sterile inflammation and has a nephroprotective role during nephrotoxic kidney injury through suppression of MAP kinase activation.© The Author(s) 2019.

By dissecting border regions and combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-dimensional cytometry, bulk RNA-sequencing, fate-mapping and microscopy, we reveal the diversity of non-parenchymal brain macrophages. Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) residing in the dura mater, subdural meninges and choroid plexus consisted of distinct subsets with tissue-specific transcriptional signatures, and their cellular composition changed during postnatal development. BAMs exhibited a mixed ontogeny, and subsets displayed distinct self-renewal capacity following depletion and repopulation. Single-cell and fate-mapping analysis both suggested that there is a unique microglial subset residing on the apical surface of the choroid plexus .

IpaJ and VirA induce large-scale impairment of host protein secretion and block the recycling of surface receptors. Moreover, these two effectors decrease clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis. Therefore,  infection induces a global blockage of host cell intracellular transport, affecting the exchange between cells and their external environment.

Using LCM, surface  (SE) and lamina propria (LP) compartments were isolated and total RNA extracted. The relative expression of Th1, Th17 and Treg cytokines was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), in addition to the assessment of mRNA splicing of the transcription factor X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1). Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry.The increased expression of IL-17 was observed in both intestinal compartments of IBD patients when compared to controls. IFN- γ, TNF-α , IL-10, HNE and Foxp3 were overexpressed in the LP compartment of both IBD patients as compared to controls. An upregulation of IFN-γ and an infiltration of HNE+ cells was found in the SE of patients with UC. Splicing of XBP1 mRNA was recognized in both intestinal compartments of IBD patients when compared to controls.In IBD patients, both intestinal compartments are involved in Th17 response, whereas, LP compartment plays a prominent role in Th1 and Treg immune responses. Nevertheless, high level of IFN- γ was found in the SE of UC patients, suggesting that this compartment is involved in the Th1 immune response.

This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon . Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the  mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. These effects suggested that TRF could serve as a  health supplement for preventive measures for UC condition in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095688>Dietary Factors in Prevention of Pediatric Escherichia coli Infection: A Model Using Domestic Piglets.</a></h2><p>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major etiological agent causing acute watery diarrhea that is most frequently seen in young children in lower-income countries. The duration of diarrheal symptom may be shortened by antibiotic treatment, but ETEC is relative refractory to common antibiotics. Burgeoning evidence suggests bioactive components that naturally occur in human milk (e.g., lysozyme and oligosaccharides) and plants (e.g., nondigestible carbohydrates and phytochemicals) contain antimicrobial functions are promising preventive measures to control ETEC infection. Although the exact protective mechanisms may vary for each compound and are still not completely understood, they generally act to (1) competitively inhibit the binding of pathogenic bacteria and toxins to  ; (2) directly kill pathogens; and (3) stimulate and/or enhance host mucosal and systemic immune defense against pathogenic microorganisms. An appropriate ETEC-challenge animal model is critical to evaluate the effect and unveil the mechanism of bioactive compounds in prevention of enteric infection. Despite wide application in biomedical research, rodents do not usually manifest typical clinical signs of enteric infections. The remarkable differences in digestive physiology, immune response, and  microbiota between rodents and human beings necessitate the use of alternative animal models. Pigs are closely related to humans in terms of genomes, physiology, anatomy of gastrointestinal tracts, digestive enzymes, components of immune system, and  microbiota. Like human infants and young children, nursing and nursery piglets are more susceptible to ETEC infection and reproduce the clinical signs as observed in humans. Hence, the ETEC-challenge piglet represents a valuable translational model to study pathogenesis and evaluate dietary factors (e.g., milk bioactive compounds, nondigestible carbohydrates, and phytochemicals) as preventive measures for ETEC infection in pediatrics.© The Author(s) 2019.

Blood components or their metabolites may regulate the susceptibility of mosquitoes to arboviruses. Here we report that serum iron in human blood influences dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes. Dengue virus acquisition by Aedes aegypti was inversely correlated with the iron concentration in serum from human donors. In a mouse-mosquito acquisition model, iron supplementation reduced dengue virus prevalence and viral load, whereas neutralization of serum iron facilitated dengue virus infection in A. aegypti mosquitoes. Of note, mosquitoes feeding on iron-deficient (sideropenic) mice exhibited a higher prevalence of dengue virus. Reversal of the sideropenic status of hosts largely reduced dengue virus acquisition and infection by mosquitoes. Serum iron, rather than haem-bound iron, was utilized by the mosquito iron metabolism pathway to boost the activity of reactive oxygen species in the  , subsequently inhibiting infection by dengue virus. On the basis of these results, a status of iron deficiency in the human population might contribute to the vectorial permissiveness to dengue virus, thereby facilitating its spread by mosquitoes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369869>Intestinal epithelial barrier functions in ageing.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelial barrier protects the mucosa of the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract and plays a key role in maintaining the host homeostasis. It encompasses several elements that include the intestinal  and biochemical and immunological products, such as the mucus layer, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and secretory immunologlobulin A (sIgA). These components are interlinked with the large microbial community inhabiting the  to form a highly sophisticated biological system that plays an important role on many aspects of human health both locally and systemically. Like any other organ and tissue, the intestinal epithelial barrier is affected by the ageing process. New insights have surfaced showing that critical functions, including intestinal stem cell regeneration and regulation of the intestinal crypt homeostasis, barrier integrity, production of regulatory cytokines, and epithelial innate immunity to pathogenic antigens change across life. Here we review the age-associated changes of the various components of the intestinal epithelial barrier and we highlight the necessity to elucidate further the mechanisms underlying these changes. Expanding our knowledge in this area is a goal of high medical relevance and it will help to define intervention strategies to ameliorate the quality of life of the ever-expanding elderly population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 15 goslings (Anser cygnoides), with typical visceral gout symptoms, were screened and compared with 15 healthy goslings. We determined the signatures of the microbiome in the cecum chyme of goslings in the 2 groups by 16S sequencing, and analyzed the changes in intestinal permeability, levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the induced inflammatory response of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found the existence of  dysbiosis in goslings with gout as a result of interactions among the multitude of bacteria present in the , and the proliferation of a specific pathogenic genus, Proteobacteria, played a decisive role in this process. Moreover, the permeability increased not only in the intestinal  but also in the renal endothelium, providing possibilities for -derived LPS to enter the blood circulation and damage the kidneys. The systemic LPS concentration was increased in the gout group and exhibited a positive correlation with the degree of renal injury. In addition, we also found that inflammatory disorders concurrently existed in the  and kidney of goslings with gout, and the LPS/TLR4/MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) inflammatory signaling was activated. These results indicate that the loss of intestinal barrier as a result of  dysbiosis causes the translocation of -derived LPS, which can play an important role in the development of gout in goslings through interference with kidney functions.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456801>Microbiota-Immune Interaction in the Pathogenesis of -Derived Infection.</a></h2><p>-derived infection is among the most common complications in patients who underwent severe trauma, serious burn, major surgery, hemorrhagic shock or severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). It could cause sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which are regarded as a leading cause of mortality in these cases. -derived infection is commonly caused by pathological translocation of intestinal bacteria or endotoxins, resulting from the dysfunction of the  barrier. In the last decades, the studies regarding to the pathogenesis of -derived infection mainly focused on the breakdown of intestinal epithelial tight junction and increased permeability. Limited information is available on the roles of intestinal microbial barrier in the development of -derived infection. Recently, advances of next-generation DNA sequencing techniques and its utilization has revolutionized the  microecology, leading to novel views into the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its connections with multiple diseases. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in the research field of intestinal barrier disruption and -derived infection, mainly through the perspectives of the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota and its interaction with intestinal mucosal immune cells. This review presents novel insights into how the  microbiota collaborates with mucosal immune cells to involve the development of pathological bacterial translocation.

What's Your  Telling You?!</a></h2><p>A complex network of interactions exists between the microbiome, the , and immune cells that reside along the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal immune system has been assigned with the difficult task of discriminating between commensal, harmless bacteria, and invading pathogens that translocate across the epithelial monolayer. Importantly, it is trained to maintain tolerance against commensals, and initiate protective immune responses against pathogens to secure intestinal homeostasis. Breakdown of this fine balance between the host and its intestinal microbiota can lead to intestinal inflammation and subsequently to development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A decade since their discovery, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are now recognized as important regulators of intestinal homeostasis. ILC3s have emerged as a critical subset in the . They are the most phenotypically diverse ILC population and interact directly with numerous different cell types (haematopoietic and non-haematopoeitic), as well as interface with the bacterial flora. In addition to their contribution to intestinal pathogen immunity, they also mitigate against tissue damage occurring following acute injury, by facilitating tissue repair and regeneration, a key function in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. However, in chronic inflammation the tables are turned and ILC3s may acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype in the . Chronic ILC activation can lead to persistent inflammation contributing to IBD and/or colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of group 3 ILCs and their contributions to intestinal homeostasis and disease leading to novel therapeutic targets and clinical approaches that may inform novel treatment strategies for immune-mediated disorders, including IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158953>Stable Gastric Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, Robert's Stomach Cytoprotection/Adaptive Cytoprotection/Organoprotection, and Selye's Stress Coping Response: Progress, Achievements, and the Future.</a></h2><p>We reviewed again the significance of the stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 as a likely mediator of Robert's stomach cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection and organoprotection and as novel mediator of Selye's stress coping response to reestablish homeostasis. Specific points of BPC 157 therapy and the original concept of Robert's cytoprotection/adaptive cytoprotection/organoprotection are discussed, including the beneficial effects of BPC 157. First, BPC 157 protects stomach cells and maintains gastric integrity against various noxious agents (Robert's killing cell by contact) and is continuously present in the gastric mucosa and gastric juice. Additionally, BPC 157 protects against the adverse effects of alcohol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastric  and other epithelia, that is, skin, liver, pancreas, heart (organoprotection), and brain, thereby suggesting its use in wound healing. Additionally, BPC 157 counteracts gastric endothelial injury that precedes and induces damage to the gastric  and generalizes "gastric endothelial protection" to protection of the endothelium of other vessels (thrombosis, prolonged bleeding, and thrombocytopenia). BPC 157 also has an effect on blood vessels, resulting in vessel recruitment that circumvents vessel occlusion and the development of additional shunting and rapid bypass loops to rapidly reestablish the integrity of blood flow (ischemic/reperfusion colitis, duodenal lesions, cecal perforation, and inferior vena caval occlusion). Lastly, BPC 157 counteracts tumor cachexia, muscle wasting, and increases in pro-inflammatory/procachectic cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and significantly corrects deranged muscle proliferation and myogenesis through changes in the expression of FoxO3a, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and P-GSK-3β (mitigating cancer cachexia).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585047>Formyl peptide receptor 2 regulates monocyte recruitment to promote intestinal mucosal wound repair.</a></h2><p>Mucosal wound repair is coordinated by dynamic crosstalk between endogenous and exogenous mediators and specific receptors on epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells. One class of such receptor-ligand pairs involves formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) that have been shown to influence inflammatory response and repair. Here we explored the role of murine Fpr2/3, an ortholog of human FPR2/receptor for lipoxin A4 (ALX), in orchestrating intestinal mucosal repair. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice,  mice exhibited delayed recovery from acute experimental colitis and perturbed repair after biopsy-induced colonic mucosal injury. Decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes were observed in healing wounds from  mice compared with WT animals. Bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that  monocytes showed a competitive disadvantage when infiltrating colonic wounds. Moreover,  monocytes were defective in chemotactic responses to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)20, which is up-regulated during early phases of inflammation. Analysis of  monocytes revealed altered expression of the CCL20 receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, suggesting that Fpr2/3 regulates CCL20-CCR6-mediated monocyte chemotaxis to sites of mucosal injury in the .

However, little is known about the anatomy and histology of this leafhopper. Here, we examined histology and ultrastructure of the digestive system of H. lamellatus, both by dissecting and by semi- and ultrathin sectioning techniques. We found that the H. lamellatus digestive tract consists of an esophagus, a filter chamber, a conical midgut and midgut loop, Malpighian tubules, an ileum, and a rectum. Furthermore, both the basal region of the filter chamber  and the apical surface of the midgut  have developed microvilli. We also identify the perimicrovillar membrane, which ensheaths the microvilli of midgut loop enterocyte, and the flame-like luminal membrane, which covers the microvilli of the conical midgut . In addition, H. lamellatus has the principal and accessory salivary glands. Our observations also showed that the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and secretory granules were all highly abundant in the secretory cells of the principal salivary glands, while the accessory glands consist of only one ovate or elbow-like acinus. We also briefly contrast the structure of the  of H. lamellatus with those of other leafhopper species.

Therefore, impact of NiO-NPs exposure (0, 5, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 mg kg soil) on the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) survival (at 28th day), reproduction (at 56th day), histopathology, ultrastructures, antioxidant enzymes and oxidative DNA damage was appraised in full life cycle study. Lower concentrations of NiO-NPs (5, 50 and 200) did not influence the survival, reproduction and growth rate of adult worms significantly. However, reproduction reduced by 40-50% with 500 and 1000 mg kg exposure, which also induced oxidative stress leading to DNA damage in earthworms. Ultrastructural observation and histology of earthworms exposed to higher NiO-NPs concentrations revealed abnormalities in  layer, microvilli and mitochondria with underlying pathologies of epidermis and muscles, as well as adverse effects on the  barrier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study unveiling the adverse effects of NiO-NPs on a soil invertebrate (Eisenia fetida).

FOXP3-positive Treg cells were sorted as CD4+CD25CD127 cells from unstimulated cells. Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were expanded, and phenotypes and gene expression profiles were compared. T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads and the suppressive abilities of Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were measured. Human colon organoid cultures were established, cultured with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. T84 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) were incubated with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells and trans-epithelial electrical resistance was measured to determine epithelial cell barrier function.Phenotypes of Tr1 cells isolated from controls vs patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis did not differ significantly following expansion. Tr1 cells and FOXP3-positive Treg cells suppressed proliferation of effector T cells, but only Tr1 cells suppressed secretion of IL1beta (IL1B) and TNF from myeloid cells. Tr1 cells, but not FOXP3-positive Treg cells, isolated from healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis secreted IL22, which regulated repair of the  and promoted barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Tr1 cell culture supernatants promoted differentiation of mucin-producing goblet cells in intestinal organoid cultures.Human Tr1 cells suppress proliferation of effector T cells (adaptive immune response) and production of IL1B and TNF by myeloid cells (inmate immune response).

Co-treatment of the colon cancer cell line Caco-2 with the oxidative stress inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (HO) and colloidal Pt resulted in a significant decrease in HO induced oxidative stress. Colloidal Pt by itself did not induce any oxidative stress. Additionally, both overnight pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with colloidal Pt followed by 1 h treatment with HO, or co-treatment of cells for 1 h with colloidal Pt and HO resulted in a significant recovery of cell death.

Here, we addressed whether flow and peristalsis impact the infectivity of the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic  using Intestine-Chip technology. Strikingly, infection is significantly increased and minimal bacterial loads are sufficient to invade enterocytes from the apical side and trigger loss of barrier integrity, thereby shifting the paradigm about early stage Shigella invasion. Shigella quickly colonizes epithelial crypt-like invaginations and demonstrates the essential role of the microenvironment. Furthermore, by modulating the mechanical forces of the microenvironment, we find that peristalsis impacts Shigella invasion. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella leverages the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This approach will enable molecular and mechanistic interrogation of human-restricted enteric pathogens.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we used the human colon cancer epithelial cell line HCT116 to study the potential cytotoxic effects of ingested silica NPs in the presence or absence of serum. Furthermore, we evaluated different physico-chemical parameters important for the assessment of nanoparticle safety, including primary particle size (12, 70, 200, and 500 nm) and surface modification (-NH and -COOH). Silica NPs triggered cytotoxicity, as evidenced by reduced metabolism and enhanced membrane leakage. Automated microscopy revealed that the silica NPs promoted apoptosis and necrosis proportional to the administered specific surface area dose. Cytotoxicity of silica NPs was suppressed by increasing amount of serum and surface modification. Furthermore, inhibition of caspases partially prevented silica NP-induced cytotoxicity. In order to investigate the role of specific cell death pathways in more detail, we used isogenic derivatives of HCT116 cells which lack the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 or BAX. In contrast to the anticancer drug cisplatin, silica NPs induced cell death independent of the p53-BAX axis. In conclusion, silica NPs initiated cell death in colon cancer cells dependent on the specific surface area and presence of serum. Further studies in vivo are warranted to address potential cytotoxic actions in the  . The unintended toxicity of silica NPs as observed here could also be beneficial. As loss of p53 in colon cancer cells contributes to resistance against anticancer drugs, and thus to reoccurrence of colon cancer, targeted delivery of silica NPs could be envisioned to also deplete p53 deficient tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260507>Schlafen 3 knockout mice display gender-specific differences in weight gain, food efficiency, and expression of markers of intestinal epithelial differentiation, metabolism, and immune cell function.</a></h2><p>Self-renewal and differentiation are essential for intestinal  absorptive functioning and adaptation to pathological states such as short  syndrome, ulcers, and inflammatory bowel disease. The rodent Slfn3 and its human analog Slfn12 are critical in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. We sought to characterize intestinal function in Slfn3 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female pair-fed Slfn3KO mice gained less weight with decreased food efficiency than wild type (WT) mice, with more pronounced effects in females. RNA sequencing performed on intestinal mucosa of Slfn3KO and WT mice showed gene ontology decreases in cell adhesion molecule signaling, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, and adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes in Slfn3KO mice, with greater effects in females. qPCR analysis of fatty acid metabolism genes, Pla2g4c, Pla2g2f, and Cyp3c55 revealed an increase in Pla2g4c, and a decrease in Pla2g2f in Slfn3KO females. Additionally, adipogenesis genes, Fabp4 and Lpl were decreased and ketogenesis gene Hmgcs2 was increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Sequencing did not reveal significant changes in differentiation markers, so qPCR was utilized. Slfn3KO tended to have decreased expression of intestinal differentiation markers sucrase isomaltase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, villin 1, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) vs. WT males, although these trends did not achieve statistical significance unless data from several markers was pooled. Differentiation markers, Glut2 and sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), did show statistically significant sex-dependent differences. Glut2 mRNA was reduced in Slfn3KO females, while SGLT1 increased in Slfn3KO males. Notch2 and Cdx2 were only increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Although Slfn3KO mice gain less weight and decreased food efficiency, their biochemical phenotype is more subtle and suggests a complex interplay between gender effects, Slfn3, and another regulatory pathway yet to be identified that compensates for the chronic loss of Slfn3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533310>Interaction of a Densovirus with Glycans of the Peritrophic Matrix Mediates Oral Infection of the Lepidopteran Pest .</a></h2><p>The success of oral infection by viruses depends on their capacity to overcome the  epithelial barrier of their host to crossing over apical, mucous extracellular matrices. As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect  barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut ; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the  densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest . Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall  function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of -Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the  barrier in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897851>Caprate Modulates Intestinal Barrier Function in Porcine Peyer's Patch Follicle-Associated .</a></h2><p>Many food components influence intestinal epithelial barrier properties and might therefore also affect susceptibility to the development of food allergies. Such allergies are triggered by increased antibody production initiated in Peyer's patches (PP). Usually, the presentation of antigens in the lumen of the  to the immune cells of the PP is strongly regulated by the follicle-associated  (FAE) that covers the PP. As the food component caprate has been shown to impede barrier properties in villous , we hypothesized that caprate also affects the barrier function of the PP FAE, thereby possibly contributing a risk factor for the development of food allergies.In this study, we have focused on the effects of caprate on the barrier function of PP, employing in vitro and ex vivo experimental setups to investigate functional and molecular barrier properties. Incubation with caprate induced an increase of transepithelial resistance, and a marked increase of permeability for the paracellular marker fluorescein in porcine PP to 180% of control values. These effects are in accordance with changes in the expression levels of the barrier-forming tight junction proteins tricellulin and claudin-5.This barrier-affecting mechanism could be involved in the initial steps of a food allergy, since it might trigger unregulated contact of the  lumen with antigens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984145>Impacts of Duck-Origin Parvovirus Infection on Cherry Valley Ducklings From the Perspective of  Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Duck-origin goose parvovirus (D-GPV) is the causative agent of beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS), characterized by growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, and persistent diarrhea. However, the pathogenic mechanism of D-GPV remains undefined. Here, we first reported the  microbiome diversity of D-GPV infected Cherry Valley ducks. In the investigation for the influence of D-GPV infection on  microbiota through a period of infection, we found that D-GPV infection caused  microbiota dysbiosis by reducing the prevalence of the dominant genera and decreasing microbial diversity. Furthermore, exfoliation of the intestinal , proliferation of lymphocytes, up-regulated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22 and down-regulated mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 occurred when D-GPV targeted in cecal . In addition, the content of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal contents was significantly reduced after D-GPV infection. Importantly, the disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was associated with the decrease of SCFAs-producing bacteria and the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, the decrease of SCFAs and the enrichment of pathogen-containing  communities promoted intestinal inflammatory injury. These results may provide a new insight that target the  microbiota to understand the progression of BADS disease and to research the pathogenic mechanism of D-GPV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126070>GI inflammation Increases Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Sglt1.</a></h2><p>A correlation between gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and  hormones has reported that inflammatory stimuli including bacterial endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 induces high levels of incretin hormone leading to glucose dysregulation. Although incretin hormones are immediately secreted in response to environmental stimuli, such as nutrients, cytokines, and LPS, but studies of glucose-induced incretin secretion in an inflamed state are limited. We hypothesized that GI inflammatory conditions induce over-stimulated incretin secretion via an increase of glucose-sensing receptors. To confirm our hypothesis, we observed the alteration of glucose-induced incretin secretion and glucose-sensing receptors in a GI inflammatory mouse model, and we treated a conditioned media (Mϕ 30%) containing inflammatory cytokines in intestinal  cells and enteroendocrine L-like NCI-H716 cells. In GI-inflamed mice, we observed that over-stimulated incretin secretion and insulin release in response to glucose and sodium glucose cotransporter (Sglt1) was increased. Incubation with Mϕ 30% increases Sglt1 and induces glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion with increasing intracellular calcium influx. Phloridzin, an sglt1 inhibitor, inhibits glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion, ERK activation, and calcium influx. These findings suggest that the abnormalities of incretin secretion leading to metabolic disturbances in GI inflammatory disease by an increase of Sglt1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941782>Goblet cells and mucus layer in the  of young pigs: Response to dietary contents of threonine and non-essential amino acids.</a></h2><p>Mucins secreted by goblet cells (GC) are the major components of mucus layer coating and protecting  . The study aimed at determining the effect of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and threonine (Thr) levels on GC number and mucus layer thickness measured in different parts of the . A two-factorial experiment was conducted on 72 pigs (initial BW 12.5 kg) using as factors: Thr level (5.1, 5.7, 6.3 and 6.9 g standardized ileal digestible [SID] Thr/kg) and wheat gluten (WG) level used as a source of NEAA (20.4, 40.4 and 60.4 g WG protein in WG20, WG40 and WG60 diets respectively). All diets covered the requirement for essential AA, except for Thr, and they were fed to six pigs for 20 days. Thr level affected only the count of GC containing acidic mucins in the proximal colon, which was higher in pigs fed a diet with 5.1 g SID Thr/kg in comparison with diet containing 6.3 g SID Thr/kg. In the villi, WG40 and/or WG60 increased the GC number containing acidic mucins and lowered that with neutral mucins in the middle jejunum. In the crypts, higher WG levels decreased the GC number with acidic mucins in the duodenum, ileum and proximal colon and increased that with neutral and mixed mucins in the duodenum and ileum. The mucus layer was thicker in the proximal and middle jejunum in WG20 pigs, whereas in the proximal colon it was thicker in WG60 pigs. The lowest GC count was found in the middle jejunum and the highest in the duodenum and proximal colon. The mucus layer was the thinnest in the proximal and middle jejunum and the thickest in the ileum. The results did not show the negative effect of a moderate Thr deficiency and the positive effect of non-essential AA supplementation on GC functions.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212027>Mini-: a promising model for drug development.</a></h2><p>Until recently, major advances in drug development have been hampered by a lack of proper cell and tissue models; but the introduction of organoid technology has revolutionized this field. At the level of the gastrointestinal tract, the so-called mini- comprises all major cell types of native intestine and recapitulates the composition and function of native intestinal .

Calcium and vitamin D may be involved in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, the dysfunction of which may lead to endotoxemia and inflammation, and contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. We investigated supplemental calcium (1200 mg, daily) and/or vitamin D (1000 IU daily) effects on intestinal barrier function-related biomarkers in a subset of 105 participants from a large colorectal adenoma recurrence chemoprevention clinical trial. We assessed expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLD), and mucin-12 (MUC12) in the normal-appearing colorectal mucosa using standardized, automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis. Following 1 year of treatment, in the calcium relative to the no calcium group, the CLDN1, OCLD, and MUC12 expression increased by 14% (P = 0.17), 23% (P = 0.11), and 22% (P = 0.07), respectively. In secondary analyses, the estimated calcium treatment effects were greater among participants with baseline serum 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations below the median value of 22.69 ng/mL (CLDN1: 29%, P = 0.04; OCLD: 36%, P = 0.06; MUC12: 35%, P = 0.05). There were no biomarker expression changes in the vitamin D alone group; however, modest increases were found in the combined calcium/vitamin D group. At baseline, obesity, history of a sessile-serrated adenoma, colorectal MIB-1/Ki-67 expression, and a family history of colorectal cancer were associated with CLDN1, OCLD, and MUC12 expression.

Obesity and its comorbidities inflict a heavy burden on the global economies and have become a serious threat to individuals' wellbeing with no immediate cure available. The causes of obesity are manifold, involving several factors including physiological, metabolic, neural, psychosocial, economic, genetics and the environment, among others. Recent advances in genome sequencing and metagenomic profiling have added another dimension to this complexity by implicating the  microbiota as an important player in energy regulation and the development of obesity. As such, accumulating evidence demonstrate the impact of the  microbiota on body weight, adiposity, glucose, lipid metabolism, and metabolic syndrome. This also includes the role of microbiota as a modulatory signal either directly or through its bioactive metabolites on intestinal lumen by releasing chemosensing factors known to have a major role in controlling food intake and regulating body weight. The importance of  signaling by microbiota signaling is further highlighted by the presence of taste and nutrient receptors on the intestinal  activated by the microbial degradation products as well as their role in release of peptides hormones controlling appetite and energy homeostasis.

To investigate the interaction of gut microbiota and DEPs-induced colonic injury, adult C57BL/6 mice are kept in whole-body inhalation chambers and exposed to filtered room air (FRA) or DEPs (300 µg m) 1 h per day for 28 consecutive days. DEPs exposure results in colon epithelial injury with inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus depletion. Abundance of  in murine feces is transiently increased following 7-day DEPs exposure and then decreased until the end of 28-day exposure. A reduction of the colonic mucus layer thickness is observed in mice receiving gut microbiota from DEPs-exposed mice.

HS is a signaling molecule that modulates various physiological effects. It is also a respiratory toxin that inhibits complex IV in the electron transfer chain (ETC). Colon epithelial cells are adapted to high environmental HS exposure as they harbor an efficient mitochondrial HS oxidation pathway, which is dedicated to its disposal. Herein, we report that the sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes are apically localized in human colonic crypts at the host-microbiome interface, but that the normal apical-to-crypt gradient is lost in colorectal cancer . We found that sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), which catalyzes the committing step in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway and couples to complex III, is a critical respiratory shield against HS poisoning. HS at concentrations ≤20 μm stimulated the oxygen consumption rate in colon epithelial cells, but, when SQR expression was ablated, HS concentrations as low as 5 μm poisoned cells. Mitochondrial HS oxidation altered cellular bioenergetics, inducing a reductive shift in the NAD/NADH redox couple. The consequent electron acceptor insufficiency caused uridine and aspartate deficiency and enhanced glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation. The metabolomic signature of this HS-induced stress response mapped, in part, to redox-sensitive nodes in central carbon metabolism. Colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines appeared to counter the growth-restricting effects of HS by overexpressing sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes. Our findings reveal an alternative mechanism for HS signaling, arising from alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics that drive metabolic reprogramming.© 2019 Libiad et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141995>Cecal Infusion of Sodium Propionate Promotes Intestinal Development and Jejunal Barrier Function in Growing Pigs.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by microbial fermentation facilitate the differentiation and proliferation of intestinal .

Consequently,   is constantly confronted to stress and often suffers cellular damage. We have previously shown that regenerative cells are present in the guts of adult Aedes albopictus, and that chemical damage or bacterial infection leads to the proliferation of these regenerative cells in the midgut. In this study, we extended the analysis of  cells response to stress to two other important disease vector mosquitoes: Culex pipiens and Anopheles gambiae. We fed mosquitoes on sucrose solutions or on sucrose supplemented with pathogenic bacteria or with damage-inducing chemicals. We also assayed the survival of mosquitoes following the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria. We found that in adult C. pipiens, dividing cells exist in the digestive tract and that these cells proliferate in the midgut after bacterial or chemical damage, similarly to what we previously observed in A. albopictus. In sharp contrast, we did not detect any mitotic cell in the midguts of A. gambiae mosquitoes, neither in normal situation nor after the induction of  damage. In agreement with this observation, A. gambiae mosquitoes were more sensitive to oral bacterial infections compared to A. albopictus and C. pipiens. This work provides evidence that major differences in  physiological responses exist between different mosquitoes. The presence of regenerative cells in the mosquito guts and their ability to multiply after  damage affect the mosquito survival to oral infections, and is also likely to affect its vectorial capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836737>Epithelial-microbial diplomacy: escalating border tensions drive inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract-the main site of host-microbial interaction in the body.

We tested the hypothesis that elevated endocannabinoid activity at cannabinoid CB receptor (CBRs) in the  of mice rendered DIO by chronic access to a high fat and sucrose diet for 60 days inhibits nutrient-induced release of satiation peptides and promotes overeating. Immunoreactivity for CBRs was present in enteroendocrine cells in the mouse's upper small-intestinal  that produce and secrete the satiation peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), and expression of mRNA for CBRs was greater in these cells when compared to non-CCK producing cells. Oral gavage of corn oil increased levels of bioactive CCK (CCK-8) in plasma from mice fed a low fat no-sucrose diet. Pretreatment with the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2, blocked this response, which was reversed by co-administration with the peripherally-restricted CBR neutral antagonist, AM6545. Furthermore, monoacylglycerol metabolic enzyme function was dysregulated in the upper small-intestinal  from DIO mice, which was met with increased levels of a variety of monoacylglycerols including the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl--glycerol. Corn oil failed to affect levels of CCK in DIO mouse plasma; however, pretreatment with AM6545 restored the ability for corn oil to stimulate increases in levels of CCK, which suggests that elevated endocannabinoid signaling at small intestinal CBRs in DIO mice inhibits nutrient-induced CCK release. Moreover, the hypophagic effect of AM6545 in DIO mice was reversed by co-administration with the CCK receptor antagonist, devazepide. Collectively, these results provide evidence that hyperphagia associated with DIO is driven by a mechanism that includes CBR-mediated inhibition of -brain satiation signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103967>Detection of Paracetamol as substrate of the  microbiome.</a></h2><p> microbiome, a new organ; represent targets to alter pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs.

HIOs resemble the native gut in that they consist of a fluid-filled lumen surrounded by a polarized epithelium and associated mesenchyme; however, their topologically-closed, spherical shape prevents flow through the interior luminal space, making the system less physiological and leading to the buildup of cellular and metabolic waste. These factors ultimately limit experimentation inside the HIOs. Here, we present a millifluidic device called the gut organoid flow chip (GOFlowChip), which we use to "port" HIOs and establish steady-state liquid flow through the lumen for multiple days. This long-term flow is enabled by the use of laser-cut silicone gaskets, which allow liquid in the device to be slightly pressurized, suppressing bubble formation. To demonstrate the utility of the device, we establish separate luminal and extraluminal flow and use luminal flow to remove accumulated waste. This represents the first demonstration of established liquid flow through the luminal space of a gastrointestinal organoid over physiologically relevant time scales. Flow cytometry results reveal that HIO cell viability is unaffected by long-term porting and luminal flow. We expect the real-time, long-term control over luminal and extraluminal contents provided by the GOFlowChip will enable a wide variety of studies including intestinal secretion, absorption, transport, and co-culture with intestinal microorganisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287995>Liver-Specific, but Not Retina-Specific, Hepcidin Knockout Causes Retinal Iron Accumulation and Degeneration.</a></h2><p>The liver secretes hepcidin (Hepc) into the bloodstream to reduce blood iron levels. Hepc accomplishes this by triggering degradation of the only known cellular iron exporter ferroportin in the , macrophages, and liver. We previously demonstrated that systemic Hepc knockout (HepcKO) mice, which have high serum iron, develop retinal iron overload and degeneration. However, it was unclear whether this is caused by high blood iron levels or, alternatively, retinal iron influx that would normally be regulated by retina-produced Hepc. To address this question, retinas of liver-specific and retina-specific HepcKO mice were studied. Liver-specific HepcKO mice had elevated blood and retinal pigment  (RPE) iron levels and increased free (labile) iron levels in the retina, despite an intact blood-retinal barrier. This led to RPE hypertrophy associated with lipofuscin-laden lysosome accumulation. Photoreceptors also degenerated focally. In contrast, there was no change in retinal or RPE iron levels or degeneration in the retina-specific HepcKO mice. These data indicate that high blood iron levels can lead to retinal iron accumulation and degeneration. High blood iron levels can occur in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or result from use of iron supplements or multiple blood transfusions.

Their potential has recently led to a significant increase in research interest in their effects on the intestine, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal  and modulating the  microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic features of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 based on adhesive properties for the inhibition of the adhesion of infectious pathogens. The molecular identification of the strain was performed from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA with 27FYM and 1492R primers, and its probiotic features, including resistance to gastric juices, resistance to bile salts, and hydrophobicity were evaluated. The potential of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to adhere to human adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-2, as well as the auto and co-aggregation and anti-adherence activity against Escherichia coli were investigated. The results demonstrated that this strain has a desirable potential for passing through the low pH of the stomach and entering the intestines. Moreover, 54% hydrophobicity, 44% auto-aggregation, and 32% co-aggregation were observed for this strain. The adhesion level of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to Caco-2 cells was 12%, and adhered lactobacilli cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, this strain showed appropriate anti-adherence effects, including competition, inhibition, and replacement properties against Escherichia coli. The results indicated that Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 had good potential for exerting antagonistic effects against E. coli.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Intestinal microbiota residing in the GI tract engages in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Different sections of the GI tract contain distinct proportions of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in the presence of unique bacterial products in each GI section. The intestinal microbiota converts ingested nutrients into metabolites that target either the intestinal microbiota population or host cells. Metabolites act as messengers of information between the intestinal microbiota and host cells. The intestinal microbiota composition and resulting metabolites thus impact host development, health, and pathogenesis. Many recent studies have focused on modulation of the  microbiota and their metabolites to improve host health and prevent or treat diseases. In this review, we focus on the production of microbial metabolites, their biological impact on the intestinal microbiota composition and host cells, and the effect of microbial metabolites that contribute to improvements in inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic diseases. Understanding the role of microbial metabolites in protection against disease might offer an intriguing approach to regulate disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503404>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-derived Microbial Anti-inflammatory Molecule regulates intestinal integrity in diabetes mellitus mice via modulating tight junction protein expression.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal barrier structure and function has been validated as an important pathogenic process in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  dysbiosis is thought to be the critical factor in diabetic intestinal pathogenesis. As the most abundant commensal bacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) play important roles in  homeostasis. The microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), an F. prausnitzii metabolite, has anti-inflammatory potential in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal .16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the  microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the  microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the tight junction pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2 and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal barrier function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal barrier structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the tight junction pathway and ZO-1 expression.

Tubular organs have multi-scale morphological features which are closely related to their functions. Here we discuss morphogenesis and the mechanical functions of the vertebrate oviduct in the female reproductive tract, also known as the fallopian tube. The oviduct functions to convey eggs from the ovary to the uterus. In the luminal side of the oviduct, the  forms multiple folds (or ridges) well-aligned along the longitudinal direction of the tube. In the epithelial cells, cilia are formed orienting toward the downstream of the oviduct. The cilia and the folds are supposed to be involved in egg transportation. Planar cell polarity (PCP) is developed in the , and the disruption of the Celsr1 gene, a PCP related-gene, causes randomization of both cilia and fold orientations, discontinuity of the tube, inefficient egg transportation, and infertility. In this review article, we briefly introduce various biophysical and biomechanical issues in the oviduct, including physical mechanisms of formation of PCP and organized cilia orientation, epithelial cell shape regulation, fold pattern formation generated by mechanical buckling, tubulogenesis, and egg transportation regulated by fluid flow.

Cellular replication in the crypt is supported by an intestinal stem cell niche, the identity of which has long been controversial.

This shift in the microbial content led us to question whether several of these microbes are important in inflammatory processes present in these diseases and more specifically whether lipopolysaccharides from the gram-negative cell wall differentially stimulates resident cells. We, therefore, investigated the possible contribution of five major species of gram-negative bacteria found to be altered in presence during disease progression and evaluate their pathogenicity through LPS. We demonstrated that LPS from these different species had individual capacities to induce NF-κB and pro-inflammatory IL-8 production from HEK-TLR4 cells in a TLR4 dependent manner. Additional work using human intestinal colonic epithelial cell monolayers (Caco-2) demonstrated that the cells responded to the serotype specific LPS in a distinct manner, inducing many inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-10 in significantly altered proportions. Furthermore, the permeability of Caco-2 monolayers, as a test for their ability to alter intestinal permeability, was also differentially altered by the serotype specific LPS modulating trans-epithelial electrical resistance, small molecule movement, and tight junction integrity. Our results suggest that specific species of bacteria may be potentiating the pathogenesis of IBD and chronic inflammatory diseases through their serotype specific LPS responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154393> and  mutations synergistically induce intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm derived from pancreatic duct cells.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer can arise from precursor lesions called intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), which are characterised by cysts containing papillae and mucus-producing cells. The high frequency of  mutations in IPMN and histological analyses suggest that oncogenic KRAS drives IPMN development from pancreatic duct cells. However, induction of  mutation in ductal cells is not sufficient to generate IPMN, and formal proof of a ductal origin of IPMN is still missing. Here we explore whether combining oncogenic   mutation with an additional gene mutation known to occur in human IPMN can induce IPMN from pancreatic duct cells.We created and phenotyped mouse models in which mutations in  and in the tumour suppressor gene liver kinase B1 (/) are conditionally induced in pancreatic ducts using Cre-mediated gene recombination. We also tested the effect of β-catenin inhibition during formation of the lesions.Activating   mutation and  inactivation synergised to induce IPMN, mainly of gastric type and with malignant potential. The mouse lesions shared several features with human IPMN. Time course analysis suggested that IPMN developed from intraductal papillae and glandular neoplasms, which both derived from the  lining large pancreatic ducts. β-catenin was required for the development of glandular neoplasms and subsequent development of the mucinous cells in IPMN. Instead, the lack of β-catenin did not impede formation of intraductal papillae and their progression to papillary lesions in IPMN.Our work demonstrates that IPMN can result from synergy between   mutation and inactivation of a tumour suppressor gene. The ductal  can give rise to glandular neoplasms and papillary lesions, which probably both contribute to IPMN formation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

This human-specific disease is characterized by profuse bloody diarrhea, dramatic ulceration of the colonic  and immune cell infiltration of the colonic tissue. A major challenge in understanding the mechanisms supporting bacillary dysentery is the reliance on animal models that do not fully recapitulate the symptoms observed in humans, including bloody diarrhea. Here we outline advances provided by a recently developed infant rabbit model of bacillary dysentery. The infant rabbit model defines bacillary dysentery as a critical combination of massive vascular lesions and dramatic epithelial fenestration due to intracellular infection and cell-to-cell spread, respectively. The infant rabbit model provides an unprecedented framework for understanding how the cell biology of  infection relates to pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554603>High-fat-diet-induced modulations of leptin signaling and gastric microbiota drive precancerous lesions in the stomach.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a risk factor for malignancy in various tissues, and has been associated with  microbiota alterations. However, the link between obesity-associated microbiota and gastric pathogenesis has not been clarified. We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered microbiota composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal -specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 b-Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric microbiota of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial dysbiosis in the stomach. The microbiota changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric microbiota from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 b-Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous obesity, and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric microbiota and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric microbiota community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although PARs are traditionally known to affect several vascular responses, recent investigations have started to pinpoint the functional role of PAR signaling in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This organ is exposed to the highest number of proteases, either from the  lumen or from the mucosa. Luminal proteases include the host's digestive enzymes and the proteases released by the commensal microbiota, while mucosal proteases entail extravascular clotting factors and the enzymes released from resident and infiltrating immune cells. Active proteases and, in case of a disrupted  barrier, even entire microorganisms are capable to translocate the intestinal , particularly under inflammatory conditions. Especially PAR-1 and PAR-2, expressed throughout the GI tract, impact  permeability regulation, a major factor affecting intestinal physiology and metabolic inflammation. In addition, PARs are critically involved in the onset of inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and tumor progression. Due to the number of proteases involved and the multiple cell types affected, selective regulation of intestinal PARs represents an interesting therapeutic strategy. The analysis of tissue/cell-specific knockout animal models will be of crucial importance to unravel the intrinsic complexity of this signaling network. Here, we provide an overview on the implication of PARs in intestinal permeability regulation under physiologic and disease conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

This  is indeed able to produce digestive enzymes and to support vectorial transport of small organic nutrients, ions, and water. Moreover, it plays a key role in the defense against pathogenic microorganisms and in shaping  microbiota. Another important midgut function is the ability to produce signaling molecules that regulate its own physiology and the activity of other organs. The two main mature cell types present in the midgut of all insects, i.e., columnar and endocrine cells, are responsible for these functions. In addition, stem cells, located at the base of the midgut , ensure the growth and renewal of the midgut during development and after injury. In insects belonging to specific orders, midgut physiology is deeply conditioned by the presence of unique cell types, i.e., goblet and copper cells, which confer peculiar features to this organ. This review reports current knowledge on the cells that form the insect midgut , focusing attention on their morphological and functional features. Notwithstanding the apparent structural simplicity of this organ, the properties of the cells make the midgut a key player in insect development and homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005320>Adaptive responses in short-chain fatty acid absorption, gene expression, and bacterial community of the bovine rumen  recovered from a continuous or transient high-grain feeding.</a></h2><p>The feeding of high-grain diets to dairy cows commonly results in lowered pH and ruminal dysbiosis, characterized by changes in absorption dynamics of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) across the reticuloruminal wall, epithelial function, and the epithelial bacteria community structure. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of high-grain feeding persistence on the absorption kinetics of reticuloruminal SCFA, gene expression in the rumen , and the associated shifts in the epithelial bacteria in cows recovering from either a long-term continuous high-grain feeding model or a long-term transient high-grain feeding model. In a crossover study design, 8 nonlactating Holstein cows were fed 60% concentrate either continuously for 4 wk (continuous) or with a 1-wk break in the second week of the high-grain feeding (transient). After the high-grain feeding, all animals were fed a diet of 100% forage (recovery) for an additional 8 wk. Rumen papilla biopsies and SCFA absorption measurements were taken at the start of the trial (baseline), after the 4-wk high-grain feeding (49 d), after 2-wk recovery forage feeding (63 d), and after 8-wk recovery forage (105 d). Absorption of SCFA was determined in vivo using the washed and isolated reticulorumen technique. Rumen papillae biopsies were used for adherent bacterial DNA and host RNA extraction. The epithelial bacteria were determined using Illumina MiSeq (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. No significant effects of the high-grain feeding model were seen for bacterial diversity. However, bacterial diversity increased with time spent in the recovery forage feeding period regardless of feeding model. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria phyla and Acetivibrio spp. increased when animals were fed a transient high-grain feeding model. A trend toward increased CLDN4 expression was observed in the continuous model. Furthermore, there were interactions between feeding model and sampling day for gene targets CD14, DRA, NHE2, NHE3, and MCT2. When comparing length of recovery, in the continuous model increased relative absorption of SCFA was sustained at 63 d but dropped to baseline measurements at 105 d. A similar pattern was found with the transient model but it did not reach significance. The only gene target that was found to significantly correlate to relative absorption of SCFA was DRA (correlation coefficient ≤ -0.41). Whereas, genera Alkalibaculum, Anaerorhabdus, Coprococcus, and Dethiobacter all showed positive correlations to gene targets for pH regulation (NHE2 and NHE3) and SCFA uptake (MCT1) but negative correlations to SCFA absorption. We conclude that while the rumen absorption and epithelial bacteria were able to recover to baseline levels after 8 wk of forage feeding, the time needed for re-establishment of homeostasis in host gene expression is longer, especially when high-grain feeding is interrupted.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the role of IgG in intestinal immunity, driven in part by a genetic association of an affinity-lowering variant of an IgG receptor, FcγRIIA, with protection from ulcerative colitis (UC), a subclass of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We recently demonstrated a role for IgG and Fcγ receptor signalling in driving pathogenic IL-1β production by colonic mononuclear phagocytes and the subsequent induction of a local type 17 response in UC.

Here, we demonstrate that administration of IPA modulates the microbiota composition in the  and inhibits microbial dysbiosis in rats fed a high-fat diet. IPA induces the expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal  homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced NASH phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the . These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the  microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite.

Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned  represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal -irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal  tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263169>Bioaccumulation of metals in calanoid copepods by oral intake.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated that oral intake of water by two calanoid copepods, Pseudodiaptomus annandalei and Eurytemora affinis takes place and has implications for their ecotoxicology. In the first experiment, copepods were exposed to a dyed medium, which allowed us to visually examine the possibility of water uptake by the copepod. We observed that both copepod species were taking in water orally and evacuated dye at different speeds. This exposure left concentrated dye in the guts of the copepods indicating adsorption into the  . This was further demonstrated by exposing both copepod species independently to dissolved metals (Cd,17 µg/L; Cu,13.8 µg/L; Ni, 29.3 µg/L) and to dietary metals (Cd,18.8 µg/g; Cu, 35.3 µg/g; Ni, 32.5 µg/g). The results showed that although the concentration of dissolved metals they were exposed to were lower than those of the dietary metals, nevertheless, uptake of metals by both copepod species from the dissolved phase alone was substantially higher than from dietary exposure. This provides clear evidence to support our hypothesis that higher metal body burden observed in copepods exposed to dissolved metals than in those exposed to dietary metals is an implication of oral intake of water. P. annandalei showed higher excretion rate of metals when exposed to dissolved metals than E. affinis. However, the excretion rate of metals from both copepod species exposed to dietary metal was similar. We conclude here that both copepod species take in water orally. Our study further showed that metal uptake depends on the exposure routes and the uptake and excretion rates are dependent on the type of metals, amounts and the species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130953>Human -Associated Natural Killer Cells in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>It is well established that natural killer (NK) cells are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. Indeed, they can recognize molecules induced at the cell surface by stress signals and virus infections. The functions of NK cells in the  are much more complex.  NK cells are not precisely organized in lymphoid aggregates but rather scattered in the  or in the stroma, where they come in contact with a multitude of antigens derived from commensal or pathogenic microorganisms in addition to components of microbiota. Furthermore, NK cells in the bowel interact with several cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes, and contribute to the maintenance of immune homeostasis and development of efficient immune responses. NK cells have a key role in the response to intestinal bacterial infections, primarily through production of IFNγ, which can stimulate recruitment of additional NK cells from peripheral blood leading to amplification of the anti-bacterial immune response. Additionally, NK cells can have a role in the pathogenesis of  autoimmune inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These diseases are considered relevant to the generation of gastrointestinal malignancies. Indeed, the role of -associated NK cells in the immune response to bowel cancers is known. Thus, in the  immune system, NK cells play a dual role, participating in both physiological and pathogenic processes.

Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1-5 palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Whereas several studies report an increase in mast cell density during IBD, others found a decrease. Recently, we observed a reduced response to mast cell degranulation induced by antigen contact in a colitis model. As the effects of mast cell mediators on epithelial ion transport are mediated indirectly via stimulation of secretomotor neurons, we investigated in vitro whether proinflammatory cytokines change the response to mast cell degranulation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and a mix of proinflammatory cytokines caused an increase of short-circuit current (I) and tissue conductance in rat colon. Anion secretion induced by histamine was downregulated in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the cytokine mix, whereas the response to the mast cell stimulator compound 48/80 was not changed significantly. In a coculture of rat submucosal ganglionic cells with a mast cell line (RBL-2H3), TNFα preincubation for 1 d increased the percentage of neurons responding to mast cell degranulation with an increase of the cytosolic Ca concentration and enhanced the amplitude of this response. Consequently, the downregulation of epithelial secretion is compensated by an increased sensitivity of secretomotor neurons leading to a constant response of the  to compound 48/80. Furthermore, enteric neurons can modify mast cell functions as nicotine inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca concentration of RBL-2H3 cells and the I evoked by compound 48/80. Consequently, these in vitro models deliver new insights into cellular interactions in the  wall under inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

IELs located between the basolateral surfaces of the epithelial cells and then potentially provide a first line of immune defense against enteric pathogens, although, the precise roles of each IEL populations are not well defined. A variety of molecules are involved in the IEL-homing to the intestinal . Conventional IELs originate from circulating T cells activated in lymphoid organs and imprinted for  homing. On the other hand, unconventional IELs derive from thymocytes and migrate to the intestinal , although, some of them may arise extrathymically. Regarding the interaction between IELs and epithelial cells, IELs are known to be highly motile and actively migrate along the basement membrane, suggesting their roles in immune surveillance. In addition, there has been growing evidence to support that IELs are involved in the pathogenesis of  disorders such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of IEL dynamics and their clinical significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024501>Beyond  Instinct: Metabolic Short-Chain Fatty Acids Moderate the Pathogenesis of Alphaherpesviruses.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as sodium butyrate (SB), sodium propionate (SPr), and sodium acetate (SAc), are metabolic end-products of the fermentation of dietary fibers. They are linked with multiple beneficial effects on the general mammalian health, based on the sophisticated interplay with the host immune response. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) is a major pathogen, which primarily replicates in the respiratory , and disseminates through the body via a cell-associated viremia in leukocytes, even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infected monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes transmit EHV1 to the endothelium of the endometrium or central nervous system (CNS), causing reproductive or neurological disorders. Here, we questioned whether SCFA have a potential role in shaping the pathogenesis of EHV1 during the primary replication in the URT, during the cell-associated viremia, or at the level of the endothelium of the pregnant uterus and/or CNS. First, we demonstrated the expression of SCFA receptors, FFA2 and FFA3, within the  of the equine respiratory tract, at the cell surface of immune cells, and equine endothelium. Subsequently, EHV1 replication was evaluated in the URT, in the presence or absence of SB, SPr, or SAc. In general, we demonstrated that SCFA do not affect the number of viral plaques or virus titer upon primary viral replication. Only SB and SPr were able to reduce the plaque latitudes. Similarly, pretreatment of monocytic CD172a cells and T-lymphocytes with different concentrations of SCFA did not alter the number of infected cells. When endothelial cells were treated with SB, SPr, or SAc, prior to the co-cultivation with EHV1-inoculated mononuclear cells, we observed a reduced number of adherent immune cells to the target endothelium. This was associated with a downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the presence of SCFA, which ultimately lead to a significant reduction of the EHV1 endothelial plaques. These results indicate that physiological concentrations of SCFA may affect the pathogenesis of EHV1, mainly at the target endothelium, in favor of the fitness of the horse. Our findings may have significant implications to develop innovative therapies, to prevent the devastating clinical outcome of EHV1 infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071306>Effects of Serotonin and Slow-Release 5-Hydroxytryptophan on Gastrointestinal Motility in a Mouse Model of Depression.</a></h2><p>Mood disorders and constipation are often comorbid, yet their shared etiologies have rarely been explored. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) regulates central nervous system and enteric nervous system (ENS) development and long-term functions, including gastrointestinal (GI) motility and mood. Therefore, defects in neuron production of 5-HT might result in brain and intestinal dysfunction. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis. A variant of TPH2 that encodes the R441H substitution (TPH2-R441H) was identified in individuals with severe depression. We studied mice with an analogous mutation (TPH2-R439H), which results in a 60%-80% decrease in levels of 5-HT in the central nervous system and behaviors associated with depression in humans. Feeding chow that contains 5-HTP slow release (5-HTP SR) to TPH2-R439H mice restores levels of 5-HT in the central nervous system and reduces depressive-like behaviors.We compared the effects of feeding chow, with or without 5-HTP SR, to mice with the TPH2-R439H mutation and without this mutation (control mice). Myenteric and submucosal plexuses were isolated from all 4 groups of mice, and immunocytochemistry was used to quantify total enteric neurons, serotonergic neurons, and 5-HT-dependent subsets of neurons. We performed calcium imaging experiments to evaluate responses of enteric neurons to tryptamine-evoked release of endogenous 5-HT. In live mice, we measured total GI transit, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and propulsive colorectal motility. To measure colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs), we isolated colons and constructed spatiotemporal maps along the proximodistal length to quantify the frequency, velocity, and length of CMMCs. We measured villus height, crypt perimeter, and relative densities of enterochromaffin and enteroendocrine cells in small intestinal tissue.Levels of 5-HT were significantly lower in enteric neurons from TPH2-R439H mice than from control mice. TPH2-R439H mice had abnormalities in ENS development and ENS-mediated GI functions, including reduced motility and intestinal epithelial growth. Total GI transit and propulsive colorectal motility were slower in TPH2-R439H mice than controls, and CMMCs were slower and less frequent. Villus height and crypt perimeter were significantly decreased in colon tissues from TPH2-R439H mice compared with controls. Administration of 5-HTP SR to adult TPH2-R439H mice restored 5-HT to enteric neurons and reversed these abnormalities. Adult TPH2-R439H mice given oral 5-HTP SR had normalized numbers of enteric neurons, total GI transit, and colonic motility. Intestinal tissue from these mice had normal measures of CMMCs and enteric epithelial growth CONCLUSIONS: In studies of TPH2-R439H mice, we found evidence for reduced release of 5-HT from enteric neurons that results in defects in ENS development and GI motility. Our findings indicate that neuron production of 5-HT links constipation with mood dysfunction. Administration of 5-HTP SR to mice restored 5-HT to the ENS and normalized GI motility and growth of the enteric . 5-HTP SR might be used to treat patients with intestinal dysfunction associated with low levels of 5-HT.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

In Xenopus, narrowing and elongation of the tube is driven by radial rearrangements of its core of endoderm cells, a process that concomitantly opens the  lumen and facilitates epithelial morphogenesis. How endoderm rearrangements are properly oriented and coordinated to achieve this complex morphogenetic outcome is unknown.We find that, prior to  elongation, the core Wnt/PCP component Vangl2 becomes enriched at both the anterior and apical aspects of individual endoderm cells. In Vangl2-depleted guts, the cells remain unpolarized, down-regulate cell-cell adhesion proteins, and, consequently, fail to rearrange, leading to a short  with an occluded lumen and undifferentiated . In contrast, endoderm cells with ectopic Vangl2 protein acquire abnormal polarity and adhesive contacts. As a result, endoderm cells also fail to rearrange properly and undergo ectopic differentiation, resulting in guts with multiple torturous lumens, irregular epithelial architecture, and variable intestinal topologies.Asymmetrical enrichment of Vangl2 in individual  endoderm cells orients polarity and adhesion during radial rearrangements, coordinating digestive epithelial morphogenesis and lumen formation with  tube elongation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349378>Melatonin reduces inflammatory response in human intestinal epithelial cells stimulated by interleukin-1β.</a></h2><p>Melatonin is the main secretory product of the pineal gland, and it is involved in the regulation of periodic events. A melatonin production independent of the photoperiod is typical of the . However, the local physiological role of melatonin at the intestinal tract is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of melatonin in an in vitro model of inflamed intestinal . To this purpose, we assessed different parameters usually associated with intestinal inflammation using IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Differentiated monolayers of Caco-2 cells were preincubated with melatonin (1 nmol/L-50 μmol/L) and then exposed to IL-1β. After each treatment, different inflammatory mediators, DNA-breakage, and global DNA methylation status were assayed. To evaluate the involvement of melatonin membrane receptors, we also exposed differentiated monolayers to melatonin in the presence of luzindole, a MT1 and MT2 antagonist. Our results showed that melatonin, at concentrations similar to those obtained in the lumen  after ingestion of dietary supplements for the treatment of sleep disorders, was able to attenuate the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β. Anti-inflammatory effects were expressed as both a decrease of the levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and NO, and a reduced increase in paracellular permeability. Moreover, the protection was associated with a reduced NF-κB activation and a prevention of DNA demethylation. Conversely, luzindole did not reverse the melatonin inhibition of stimulated-IL-6 release. In conclusion, our findings suggest that melatonin, through a local action, can modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level, offering new opportunities for a multimodal management of IBD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The underlying interactions are multilayered, and the cellular responses are modulated by the local environment. The intestine is a particularly interesting tissue regarding host-pathogen interaction. It is densely colonized by commensal microbes and a portal of entry for ingested pathogens. This necessitates constant monitoring of microbial stimuli in order to maintain homeostasis during encounters with benign microbiota and to trigger immune defenses in response to bacterial pathogens. Homeostasis is maintained by physical barriers (the mucus layer and ), chemical defenses (antimicrobial peptides), and innate immune responses (NLRC4 inflammasome), which keep the bacteria from reaching the sterile lamina propria. Intestinal pathogens represent potent experimental tools to probe these barriers and decipher how pathogens can circumvent them. The streptomycin mouse model of oral  serovar Typhimurium infection provides a well-characterized, robust experimental system for such studies. Strikingly, each stage of the  tissue infection poses a different set of challenges to the pathogen and requires tight control of virulence factor expression, host response modulation, and cooperation between phenotypic subpopulations. Therefore, successful infection of the intestinal tissue relies on a delicate and dynamic balance between responses of the pathogen and its host. These mechanisms can be deciphered to their full extent only in realistic  infection models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31257542>Impact of chronic immobilization stress on parameters of colonic homeostasis in BALB/c mice.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  is a monolayer of cells arranged side‑by‑side and connected by tight junction (TJ) proteins expressed at the apical extreme of the paracellular membrane. This layer prevents stress‑induced inflammatory responses, thus helping to maintain  barrier function and  homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic immobilization stress on the colonic expression of various parameters of homeostasis. A total of two groups of female BALB/c mice (n=6) were included: A stressed group (short‑term immobilization for 2 h/day for 4 consecutive days) and an unstressed (control) group. Colon samples were obtained to detect neutrophils and goblet cells by optical microscopy, TJ protein expression (occludin, and claudin ‑2, ‑4, ‑7, ‑12 and ‑15) by western blotting, mRNA levels of TJ genes and proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, ‑6 and ‑8] by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, fecal lactoferrin by ELISA and the number of colony‑forming units of aerobic bacteria. Compared with goblet cells in control mice, goblet cells were enlarged and reduced in number in stressed mice, whereas neutrophil cellularity was unaltered. Stressed mice exhibited reduced mRNA expression for all evaluated TJ mRNAs, with the exception of claudin‑7, which was upregulated. Protein levels of occludin and all claudins (with the exception of claudin‑12) were decreased in stressed mice. Fecal lactoferrin, proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels and aerobic bacterial counts were all increased in the stressed group. These results indicated that immobilization stress induced proinflammatory and potential remodeling effects in the colon by decreasing TJ protein expression. The present study may be a useful reference for therapies aiming to regulate the effects of stress on intestinal inflammatory dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381892>From epithelial remodelling to carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The novel cancer theory named 'the tissue organization field theory' (TOFT) suggests that carcinogenesis is a process analogous to embryonic development, whereby organs are formed through interactions among different cell types.

Because SGG may correlate with impaired  epithelia, we assessed the association of antibodies to bacterial flagellin C (FliC), a measure potentially related to this impairment, with CRC and the CRC-specific interaction with antibodies to SGG proteins. Antibodies to FliC and SGG pilus proteins Gallo2178 and Gallo2179 were measured in two independent studies, a combined study from Nijmegen and Detroit (93 CRC cases, 74 controls) and a replication data set including 576 cases and 576 controls from the Spanish multicenter multicase-control study (MCC-Spain). Logistic regression was applied to assess whether antibodies to FliC were associated with CRC and modified the association of antibodies to SGG proteins with CRC. Antibodies to FliC were associated with those to SGG Gallo2178 among CRC cases, resulting in an interaction in the association of antibodies to Gallo2178 with CRC (p = 0.007). This association was only present among individuals with high antibody responses to FliC (OR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.45-4.06).

These effects have been speculated to occur via the  microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the  microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and tight junction (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal  was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the  microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the  microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

CD4CD8αα IELs are one of the most important types of IELs, and they play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the balance of the intestinal immune system. CD4CD8αα IELs are often regarded as a special subtype of CD4 IELs that can express CD8αα on their cytomembrane. Hence, CD4CD8αα IELs not only have the ability to modulate the functions of immune cells but also are regarded as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Transcription factors, microbes, and dietary factors have a substantial effect on the development of CD4CD8αα IELs, which make them exert immunosuppression and cytotoxicity activities. In addition, there is an intimate relationship between CD4CD8αα IELs and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereas it is still unclear how CD4CD8αα IELs influence IBD. As such, this review will focus on the unparalleled differentiation of CD4CD8αα IELs and discuss how these cells might be devoted to tolerance and immunopathological responses in the intestinal tract.

We associated damaging coding variants with low GM-CSF induced STAT5 stimulation index (GMSI) in pediatric CD patients and implicated variation of neutrophil GM-CSF signaling in cell function and disease complications. Because many CD patients with low GMSI do not carry damaging coding mutations, we sought to test the hypothesis that non-coding variants contribute to this phenotype. We enrolled, performed whole genome sequencing, and measured the GMSI in 77 CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (24 low and 53 normal GMSI). We identified 4 non-coding variants (rs3808851, rs10974787, rs10974788 and rs10974789) in RCL1 significantly associated with variation of GMSI level (p < 0.011). They were validated in two independent cohorts with: RNAseq data (n = 50) and blood eQTL dataset (n = 31,684). These variants are in LD and affect expression of JAK2 (p 0.005 to 0.013), RCL1 (p 8.17E-13 to 2.98E-11) and AK3 (p 2.00E-68 to 3.03E-55) genes.

Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and function of the  epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the . Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs  barrier function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Consistent with this function, a common variant of the autophagy gene  is associated with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disorder characterized by a chronic immune reaction directed against the  microbiota. We recently contributed to our understanding of the link between autophagy and inflammatory signaling in the intestine by demonstrating that autophagy proteins including ATG16L1 are necessary in the  to prevent a spontaneous type I interferon response to the  microbiota. Enhanced innate immunity that occurs upon autophagy inhibition is protective in mouse models of infection by an enteric bacterial pathogen and acute epithelial injury.

The RNA-binding protein HuR is essential for maintaining  epithelial integrity, and targeted deletion of HuR in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) disrupts mucosal regeneration and delays repair after injury. Here, we defined the role of HuR in regulating subcellular distribution of small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1 and investigated the implication of nucleophosmin (NPM) as a molecular chaperone in this process.Studies were conducted in intestinal epithelial tissue-specific HuR knockout (IE-HuR) mice and cultured IEC-6 cells, derived from rat small intestinal crypts. Functions of HuR and NPM in vitro were investigated via their gene silencing and overexpression.The abundance of cytoplasmic Rac1 in the small intestinal mucosa increased significantly in IE-HuR mice, although HuR deletion did not alter total Rac1 levels. HuR silencing in cultured IECs also increased the cytoplasmic Rac1 levels, without an effect on whole-cell Rac1 content. In addition, HuR deficiency in the intestinal  decreased the levels of NPM in IE-HuR mice and cultured IECs. NPM physically interacted with Rac1 and formed the NPM/Rac1 complex. NPM silencing decreased the NPM/Rac1 association and inhibited nuclear accumulation of Rac1, along with an increase in cytoplasmic abundances of Rac1. In contrast, ectopically expressed NPM enhanced Rac1 nuclear translocation and restored Rac1 subcellular localization to near normal in HuR-deficient cells.These results indicate that HuR regulates Rac1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the intestinal  by altering NPM expression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Renewal is controlled by interplay between signalling pathways, among which canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals play prominent roles. Overall 92% of colon tumours show increased canonical Wnt signalling resulting from mutations, established as major driver steps towards carcinogenesis.Here, we examined the physiological role of RhoU/Wrch1 in  homeostasis. RhoU is an atypical Rho GTPase related to Cdc42/Rac1 and identified as a transcriptional target of non-canonical Wnt signalling.

Hyperplasia affects all cell types in the small intestine and colon and has a higher impact on goblet cells. Hyperplasia is associated with a reduction of apoptosis and an increased proliferation. RhoU knockdown in human DLD-1 colon cancer cells also elicits a higher growth index and reduces cell apoptosis. Last, loss of RhoU function in the mouse   or in DLD-1 cells increases RhoA activity and the level of phosphorylated Myosin Light Chain-2, which may functionally link RhoU activity to apoptosis.RhoU is mostly expressed in the differentiated compartment of the .

Lepidophagy is further supported by the osteological observations. The perfect segregation of the functions such as food capture, ingestion and processing amongst the different types of teeth located in the oral cavity and pharyngeal region thus could be taken as evolutionary adaptations in scale eaters to support lepidophagy. Specialized arrangement of the esophageal and stomach epithelial folds could be altogether taken as an adaptation with the end goal to frame the scale stacks and accordingly facilitate the handling and processing of chitin-rich bolus. The esophageal mucosa is simple squamous  instead of stratified  with numerous goblet cells to withstand the mechanical harm by hard-food stuff like scales. The cardiac and fundic regions exhibited large number tubular gastric glands with simple columnar . Surface cells of all three stomach regions stained positive for PAS staining. The intestine is without pyloric caeca and is divided into anterior and posterior region. Histologically it is characterized by simple columnar  with brush border and numerous goblet cells throughout its length. Presence of large number microvilli on anterior and posterior intestine was noticeable. Intestinal goblet cells reacted positively to PAS, AB (pH 1) and AB (pH 2.5). Secretions of goblet cells are important for lubricating and protecting the . The results of present investigation improve the understanding of the digestive physiology of scale eaters in general and P. khavalchor in particular. Overall, our data indicates that though P. khavalchor predominantly feeds on scale, the digestive physiology is adapted to support dual feeding habit (lepidophagy and carnivory).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

In addition, beyond acting as a physical barrier, the function of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in sensing and responding to microbial signals is increasingly appreciated and likely has numerous implications for the vast network of immune cells within and below the intestinal . IECs also respond to factors produced by immune cells, and these can regulate IEC barrier function, proliferation and differentiation, as well as influence the composition of the microbiota. The mechanisms involved in IEC-microbe-immune interactions, however, are not fully characterized. In this review, we explore the ability of IECs to direct intestinal homeostasis by orchestrating communication between intestinal microbes and mucosal innate and adaptive immune cells during physiological and inflammatory conditions. We focus primarily on the most recent findings and call attention to the numerous remaining unknowns regarding the complex crosstalk between IECs, the microbiota and intestinal immune cells.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890187>Species-specific enhancement of enterohemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis mediated by microbiome metabolites.</a></h2><p>Species-specific differences in tolerance to infection are exemplified by the high susceptibility of humans to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection, whereas mice are relatively resistant to this pathogen. This intrinsic species-specific difference in EHEC infection limits the translation of murine research to human. Furthermore, studying the mechanisms underlying this differential susceptibility is a difficult problem due to complex in vivo interactions between the host, pathogen, and disparate commensal microbial communities.We utilize organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology to model damage of the human colonic  induced by EHEC infection, and show that epithelial injury is greater when exposed to metabolites derived from the human  microbiome compared to mouse. Using a multi-omics approach, we discovered four human microbiome metabolites-4-methyl benzoic acid, 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid, hexanoic acid, and heptanoic acid-that are sufficient to mediate this effect. The active human microbiome metabolites preferentially induce expression of flagellin, a bacterial protein associated with motility of EHEC and increased epithelial injury. Thus, the decreased tolerance to infection observed in humans versus other species may be due in part to the presence of compounds produced by the human intestinal microbiome that actively promote bacterial pathogenicity.Organ-on-chip technology allowed the identification of specific human microbiome metabolites modulating EHEC pathogenesis. These identified metabolites are sufficient to increase susceptibility to EHEC in our human Colon Chip model and they contribute to species-specific tolerance. This work suggests that higher concentrations of these metabolites could be the reason for higher susceptibility to EHEC infection in certain human populations, such as children. Furthermore, this research lays the foundation for therapeutic-modulation of microbe products in order to prevent and treat human bacterial infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238731>Avian coronavirus infection induces mannose-binding lectin production in dendritic cell precursors of chicken lymphoid organs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this immunocytochemical study was to compare mannose-binding lectin (MBL) production induced by avian coronavirus in the spleen and caecal tonsil (CT). One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface  and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively. In the CT the two separate precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells provide some 'autonomy' for the GALT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140746>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Glycocalyx Development by Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Non-Digestible Carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>The epithelial glycocalyx development is of great importance for microbial colonization. Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human  epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs (2'-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and 5 days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than 2'-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that 2'-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion. This may contribute to formulation of effective hMO and NDC formulations in infant formulas to support microbial colonization and  barrier function.© 2019 The Authors.

This review covers the current concepts of the etiology of Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis by focusing on an unbalanced interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal barrier. Understanding these issues is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies aiming at the disease cause. :  microbiota alterations and a dysfunctional intestinal mucosa are associated with IBD. Here we focus on specific defense structures of the mucosal barrier, namely antimicrobial peptides and the mucus layer, which keep the  microbiota at a distance under healthy conditions and are defective in IBD. : The microbiology of both forms of IBD is different but characterized by a reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Abundance of certain bacterial species is altered, and the compositional changes are related to disease activity. In IBD the mucus layer above the  is contaminated by bacteria and the immune reaction is dominated by the antibacterial response. Human genetics suggest that many of the basic deficiencies in the mucosal response, due to Paneth cell, defensin and mucus defects, are primary.

Antibiotics have been used for years as the primary treatment for mastitis. However, abuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistant strains and the presence of drug residues and has increased the difficulty of curing this disease. In addition, antibiotics kill most of the microbes that are present in the digestive tract, leading to imbalances in the  microbiome and destruction of the ecosystem that is normally present in the .  microbiota play an important role in the host's health and could be considered the "second brain" of the body. In recent years, the  microbiota and their metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), have been shown to participate in the development of mastitis. LPS is the main component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. Overproduction of rumen-derived LPS injures the rumen , resulting in the entry of LPS into the blood and damaged liver function; once in the blood, it circulates into the mammary gland, increasing blood-barrier permeability and leading to mammary gland inflammation. SCFAs, which are produced by  microbiota as fermentation products, have a protective effect on mammary gland inflammatory responses and help maintain the function of the blood-milk barrier. Recently, increasing attention has been focused on the use of probiotics as a promising alternative for the treatment of mastitis. This review summarizes the effects of the  microbiome and its metabolites on mastitis as well as the current of probiotics in mastitis. This work may provide a valuable theoretical foundation for the development of fresh ideas for the prevention and treatment of mastitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323936>Lysophosphatidic Acid and Autotaxin-associated Effects on the Initiation and Progression of Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  interacts dynamically with the immune system to maintain its barrier function to protect the host, while performing the physiological roles in absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, water and minerals.

Indeed, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with the modulation of host response to diets. One crucial mechanism by which the microbiota affects the host is signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed metabolite-sensing GPCRs. In the , both immune and nonimmune cells express GPCRs and their activation generally provide anti-inflammatory signals through regulation of both the immune system functions and the epithelial integrity. Members of GPCR family serve as a link between microbiota, immune system and intestinal  by which all these components crucially participate to maintain the  homeostasis. Conversely, impaired GPCR signaling is associated with IBD and other diseases, including hepatic steatosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. In this review, we first outline the signaling, function, expression and the physiological role of several groups of metabolite-sensing GPCRs. We then discuss recent findings on their role in the regulation of the inflammation, their existing endogenous and synthetic ligands and innovative approaches to therapeutically target inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026410>The Microbiome and Food Allergy.</a></h2><p>The -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) faces a considerable challenge.

MV ingestion improved histopathological scores and increased IL10 expression in the colon mucosa of colitis mice. While DSS has a profound effect on the  microbiome and significantly decreases both microbial richness and evenness, MV further reduces evenness but promotes microbial interactions and restores the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio repressed by DSS. Moreover, MV reduces the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Ruminococcus gnavus, in colitis mice and has a strong modulatory effect on microbial co-occurrence patterns and  metabolites. In addition, MV reverses several key inflammatory mediators, including sphingolipid metabolites, from elevated levels in DSS colitis mice. As a bioactive ingredient, MV exerts its effect on the  microbiome in a mechanism that differs from the whole blueberry.MV ingestion ameliorates intestinal inflammation by modulating colon  integrity,  microbiome, and key inflammatory mediators.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (Znhit1) is an evolutionarily conserved subunit of the SRCAP chromosome remodeling complex. Currently, the function of Znhit1 in vivo and its working mechanism in the SRCAP complex are unknown. Here we show that deletion of Znhit1 in intestinal  depletes Lgr5+ stem cells thus disrupts intestinal homeostasis postnatal establishment and maintenance. Mechanistically, Znhit1 incorporates histone variant H2A.Z into TSS region of genes involved in Lgr5+ stem cell fate determination, including Lgr5, Tgfb1 and Tgfbr2, for subsequent transcriptional regulation. Importantly, Znhit1 promotes the interaction between H2A.Z and YL1 (H2A.Z chaperone) by controlling YL1 phosphorylation.

In current study, we aim to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of commensal bacteria in injury and epithelial restitution after IIR.Commensal  bacteria were deleted by broad-spectrum antibiotics in mice. IIR was induced by clamping superior mesenteric artery. Intestinal injury, permeability, epithelial proliferation, and proinflammatory activity of mesenteric lymph were investigated.Commensals deletion improved mice survival in the early phase, but failed to improve the overall survival at 96 h after IIR. Commensals deletion reduced proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and augmented proinflammatory activity of mesenteric lymph after IIR. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) supplement promoted IEC proliferation and improved survival in mice with commensals deletion after IIR. LPS induced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in mucosa via toll-like receptor 4-NFκB-cyclooxygenase 2 pathway. PGE2 enhanced IEC proliferation in vivo, which was preceded by activation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2.

Patients suffering from IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, present with skeletal complications. However, the mechanism underpinning IBD-associated bone loss remains vague. Intestinal inflammation generates an inflammatory milieu at the intestinal  that leads to dysregulation of mucosal immunity through -residing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and other cell types. ILCs are recently identified mucosal cells considered as the gatekeeper of  immunity and their function is regulated by intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-secreted cytokines in response to the inflammatory microenvironment. We first demonstrate that serum as well as IECs collected from the intestine of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice contain high levels of inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines. Mechanistically, heightened inflammatory response of IECs was associated with significant intrinsic activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) in IECs and increased frequency of ILC1, ILC3, and myeloid osteoclast progenitors. Validating the central role of IEC-specific NF-κB activation in this phenomenon, conditional expression of constitutively active inhibitor kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2) in IECs in mice recapitulates the majority of the cellular, inflammatory, and osteolytic phenotypes observed in the chemically induced colitis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of IKK2 from IECs significantly attenuated inflammation and bone loss in DSS-induced colitis. Finally, using the DSS-induced colitis model, pharmacologic inhibition of IKK2 was effective in reducing frequency of ILC1 and ILC3 cells, attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines, and halted colitis-associated bone loss. Our findings identify IKK2 in IECs as viable therapeutic target for colitis-associated osteopenia.© 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015422>Physical and functional interaction between A20 and ATG16L1-WD40 domain in the control of intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) relies on tight control of inflammatory, cell death and autophagic mechanisms, but how these pathways are integrated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory protein A20 and the critical autophagic mediator Atg16l1 physically interact and synergize to regulate the stability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. A proteomic screen using the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 (WDD) identified A20 as a WDD-interacting protein. Loss of A20 and Atg16l1 in mouse intestinal  induces spontaneous IBD-like pathology, as characterized by severe inflammation and increased intestinal epithelial cell death in both small and large intestine. Mechanistically, absence of A20 promotes Atg16l1 accumulation, while elimination of Atg16l1 or expression of WDD-deficient Atg16l1 stabilizes A20. Collectively our data show that A20 and Atg16l1 cooperatively control intestinal homeostasis by acting at the intersection of inflammatory, autophagy and cell death pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing  bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in IBD patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non-IBD controls and IBD patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA:acetate CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active IBD patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active IBD patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from IBD patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, IBD- and non-IBD-derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active IBD patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in IBD patients. However, TNFα renders the  less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Recent evidence suggests that loss of  homeostasis and barrier breach by pathobionts, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, may influence disease severity. The mechanism(s) leading to altered  homeostasis and barrier breakdown in inflammatory arthritis are poorly understood. In the present study, we found a significant reduction in intestinal concentrations of several proresolving mediators during inflammatory arthritis, including downregulation of the -protective mediator resolvin D5n-3 DPA (RvD5n-3 DPA). This was linked with increased metabolism of RvD5n-3 DPA to its inactive 17-oxo metabolite. We also found downregulation of IL-10 expression in the  of arthritic mice that was coupled with a reduction in IL-10 and IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) in lamina propria macrophages. These changes were linked with a decrease in the number of mucus-producing goblet cells and tight junction molecule expression in the intestinal  of arthritic mice when compared with naive mice. P. gingivalis inoculation further downregulated intestinal RvD5n-3 DPA and Il-10 levels and the expression of  tight junction proteins. RvD5n-3 DPA, but not its metabolite 17-oxo-RvD5n-3 DPA, increased the expression of both IL-10 and IL-10R in macrophages via the upregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist l-kynurenine. Administration of RvD5n-3 DPA to arthritic P. gingivalis-inoculated mice increased intestinal Il-10 expression, restored  barrier function, and reduced joint inflammation. Together, these findings uncover mechanisms in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, where disruption of the  RvD5n-3 DPA-IL-10 axis weakens the  barrier, which becomes permissive to the pathogenic actions of the pathobiont P. gingivalis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394344>Bisphenol A increases intestinal permeability through disrupting intestinal barrier function in mice.</a></h2><p>That an alteration of the intestinal permeability is associated with  barrier function has been increasingly evident, which plays an important role in human and animal health. Bisphenol A (BPA), an industrial compound used worldwide, has recently been classified as an environmental pollutant. One of our earlier studies has demonstrated that BPA disrupts the intestinal barrier function by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in the human colonic epithelial cells line. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary BPA uptake on the colonic barrier function in mice, as well as the intestinal permeability. Dietary BPA uptake was observed to destroy the morphology of the colonic  and increase the pathology score. The levels of endotoxin, diamine peroxidase, D-lactate, and zonulin were found to have been significantly elevated in both plasma and colonic mucosa. A decline in the number of intestinal goblet cells and in mucin 2 gene expression was observed in the mice belonging to the BPA group. The results of immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) in colonic  of BPA mice decreased significantly, and their gene abundance was also inhibited. Moreover, dietary BPA uptake was also found to have significantly reduced colonic microbial diversity and altered microbial structural composition. The functional profiles of colonic bacterial community exhibited adverse effects of dietary BPA intake on the endocrine and digestive systems, as well as the transport and catabolism functions. Collectively, our study highlighted that dietary BPA increased the colonic permeability, and this effect was closely related to the disruption of intestinal chemistry and physical and biological barrier functions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, incretins are hormones that potentiate reductions in blood glucose levels. Given the established role of incretin-based therapy to treat diabetes and metabolic disorders, we investigated a possible regulatory link between intestinal epithelial HNF4α and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), an incretin that is specifically produced by  enteroendocrine cells. Conditional deletion of HNF4α in the whole intestinal  was achieved by crossing Villin-Cre and Hnf4α C57BL/6 mouse models. GIP expression was measured by qPCR, immunofluorescence and ELISA. Gene transcription was assessed by luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Metabolic parameters were analyzed by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. HNF4α specific deletion in the intestine led to a reduction in GIP. HNF4α was able to positively control Gip transcriptional activity in collaboration with GATA-4 transcription factor. Glucose homeostasis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remained unchanged in HNF4α deficient mice. Changes in GIP production in these mice did not impact nutrition or energy metabolism under normal physiology but led to a reduction of bone area and mineral content, a well described physiological consequence of GIP deficiency. Our findings point to a novel regulatory role between intestinal HNF4α and GIP with possible functional impact on bone density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262571> microbiota in PSC : From association to possible causality. Commentary to " pathobionts underlie intestinal barrier dysfunction and liver T helper 17 cell immune response in primary sclerosing cholangitis" by Nakamoto et al., Nature Microbiology, January 2019.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Several studies have shown that PSC patients harbor an impaired  microbiota. A recent study confirmed that PSC patients displayed a bacterial dysbiosis, characterized by an increased abundance of three different bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus gallinarum. This study also provides evidence for a possible mechanism of action of these bacteria: notably the formation of pores in   leading to an increased  permeability and the induction of liver inflammation characterized by an increased proportion of T helper 17 (T17) cells. For the first time, strong data demonstrate not only an association between  microbiota and primary sclerosing cholangitis but also a possible causal link.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
