The aims were to characterize the enzymatic activities of EHA25900 and to identify crucial amino acids for the stereospecificity. Recombinant EHA25900 oxidized 18:2n-6 sequentially to 9R-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9R-HPODE) and to a 9R(10)-allene oxide. 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS catalyze abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C-11, but the direction of oxygen insertion differs. A comparison between twelve 9-DOX domains of 9S- and 9R-DOX-AOS revealed conserved amino acid differences, which could contribute to the chirality of products. The Gly616Ile replacement of 9R-DOX-AOS (A. niger) increased the biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide, whereas the Phe627Leu replacement led to biosynthesis of 9S-HPODE and the 9S(10)-allene oxide as main products. The double mutant (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) formed over 90% of the 9S stereoisomer of HPODE. 9S-HPODE was formed by antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion, i.e., the original H-abstraction was retained but the product chirality was altered. We conclude that 9R-DOX-AOS can be altered to 9S-DOX-AOS by replacement of two amino acids (Gly616Ile, Phe627Leu) in the DOX domain.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to develop a method for accurate quantification of PCOOH (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 16:0/HpODE PC), focusing on isomers such as 16:0/13-HpODE PC and 16:0/ PC. Sodiated PCOOH ([M+Na](+), m/z 812) provided not only a known product ion (m/z 147) but also characteristic product ions (m/z 541 for 16:0/13-HpODE PC and m/z 388 for 16:0/ PC). Thus, three multiple reaction monitorings (MRMs) could be performed. MRM (812/147) enabled determination of 16:0/HpODE PC, and MRM (812/541) and MRM (812/388) allowed specific measurement of 16:0/13-HpODE PC and 16:0/ PC, respectively. By using this method, we could determine plasma PCOOH concentrations in healthy subjects and patients with angiographically significant stenosis. In healthy subject and patient plasma, the concentration of 16:0/HpODE PC was close to the sum of the concentrations of 16:0/13-HpODE PC and 16:0/ PC. This finding shows that radical and/or enzymatic oxidation, rather than singlet oxygen oxidation, is recognized to cause peroxidation of PC. The newly developed LC-MS/MS method appears to be a powerful tool for developing a better understanding of in vivo lipid peroxidation and its involvement in human diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Cyclopentenones have been shown to be versatile intermediates for the stereoselective preparation of highly substituted cyclopentane derivatives. Allene oxides are oxygenated fatty acids which are involved in the  of cyclopentenone biosynthesis in plants and marine invertebrates; however, their cyclization behavior is not well understood. Recent work by Brash and co-workers (J. Biol. Chem., 2013, 288, 20797) revealed an unusual cyclization property of the 9(S)-HPODE-derived allene oxides: the previously unreported 10Z-isomer cyclizes to a cis-dialkylcyclopentenone in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (100 : 3, v/v), but the known 10E-isomer does not yield cis-cyclopentenone under the same conditions. The mechanism for cyclization has been investigated for unsubstituted and methyl substituted vinyl allene oxide using a variety of methods including CASSCF, ωB97xD, and CCSD(T) and basis sets up to cc-pVTZ. The lowest energy pathway proceeds via homolytic cleavage of the epoxide ring, formation of an oxyallyl diradical, which closes readily to a cyclopropanone intermediate. The cyclopropanone opens to the requisite oxyallyl which closes to the experimentally observed product, cis-cyclopentenone. The calculations show that the open shell, diradical pathway is lower in energy than the closed shell reactions of allene oxide to cyclopropanone, and cyclopropanone to cyclopentenone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379235>Characterizing serum  alterations of Alzheimer's disease and intervention of Shengmai-San by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and multi-factor-induced neurodegenerative disorder. The development of a single-target treatment strategy for AD has not been successful. Shengmai-San (SMS), a traditional Chinese medicine containing multi-active components, has been reported to be effective for treating AD. However, the mechanism of SMS is still unclear, and as a multicomponent combination therapy, there is a lack of appropriate evaluation. Thereby, metabolomics was applied to investigate the multi-target intervention of SMS by monitoring the fold changes of metabolites in serum. An AD model was successfully replicated by treating rats with oral aluminum chloride (AlCl) and an intraperitoneal injection of d-galactose (d-gal) for 105 days. The intervention group was treated with SMS during the whole modeling process. The results of classical experiments showed that SMS could alleviate Aβ deposition, protect neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and improve spatial learning and memory impairment compared with the model group. Based on these curative effects, a metabolomics study was implemented using the UPLC-Q/TOF-MS method. A heatmap of AD-associated metabolites (P < 0.05) was set up to target the most relevant  network and to evaluate the comprehensive effects of SMS. Based on this AD-associated  network, the total regulation-of-metabolites' coverage rate of SMS was 51.35% and the gross metabolites' recovery proportion was 72.32%. Lipid peroxidation was the main mechanism of SMS intervention in AD, including inhibition of the generation of linoleic acid hydroperoxides, such as 13-HPODE,  and 9-OxoODE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095495>Regioisomeric distribution of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid in vegetable oils during storage and heating.</a></h2><p>The oxidative deterioration of vegetable oils is commonly measured by the peroxide value, thereby not considering the contribution of individual lipid hydroperoxide isomers, which might have different bioactive effects. Thus, the formation of 9- and 13-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid ( and 13- HpODE), was quantified after short-term heating and conditions representative of long-term domestic storage in samples of linoleic acid, canola, sunflower and soybean oil, by means of stable isotope dilution analysis-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy.Although heating of pure linoleic acid at 180 °C for 30 min led to an almost complete loss of  and 13-HpODE, heating of canola, sunflower and soybean oil resulted in the formation of 5.74 ± 3.32, 2.00 ± 1.09, 16.0 ± 2.44 mmol L 13-HpODE and 13.8 ± 8.21, 10.0 ± 6.74 and 45.2 ± 6.23 mmol L . An almost equimolar distribution of the 9- and 13-HpODE was obtained during household-representative storage conditions after 56 days, whereas, under heating conditions, an approximately 2.4-, 2.8- and 5.0-fold (P ≤ 0.001) higher concentration of  than 13-HpODE was detected in canola, soybean and sunflower oil, respectively.A temperature-dependent distribution of HpODE regioisomers could be shown in vegetable oils, suggesting their application as markers of lipid oxidation in oils used for short-term heating. © 2017 The Authors.

Recently, we synthesized the PCOOH isomers 1-palmitoyl-2-(9-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, (16:0/ PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (16:0/13-HpODE PC). Using these standards along with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, a reliable quantification method was developed.
