<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26175302>Intravesical treatment with cis- improves bladder function in rat model of acute bladder .</a></h2><p>The aim was to study the effect of intravesically instilled cis- (cis-UCA) on bladder function in an experimental rat model of acute bladder . Hyaluronic  (HA) was used as a comparator compound.Bladder irritation was induced in female rats by intravesical hydrochloric  (HCl) infusion. Vehicle, 0.5% HA, or 2% cis-UCA solutions were infused intravesically twice a day for three consequent days. On the fourth day, urodynamical measurements were performed, the animals were sacrificed, and the bladders were removed for histopathological assessment.HCl treatment caused significant impairment of bladder function indicated by decreased micturition intervals and voided urine volumes and induced severe voiding dysfunction observed as occurrence of overflow incontinence. These functional changes were accompanied by increased bladder weight, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the urothelium. Intravesical cis-UCA treatment recovered bladder function by significantly prolonging the micturition interval, increasing the voided volume, and reducing the occurrence of overflow incontinence. All these changes were comparable to the effects of HA.Intravesical administration of cis-UCA was able to partially recover bladder function impaired by chemical irritation. Cis-UCA may offer a novel intravesical treatment option in some inflammatory conditions of the bladder. Neurourol.

Up to 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe AD in European populations have FLG-null alleles compared with a general population frequency of 7% to 10%.This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FLG-null mutations and epidermal antigen-presenting cell (APC) maturation in subjects with and without AD. Additionally, we investigated whether the cis isomer of  (UCA), a filaggrin breakdown product, exerts immunomodulatory effects on dendritic cells.Epidermal APCs from nonlesional skin were assessed by using flow cytometry (n = 27) and confocal microscopy (n = 16). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy volunteers were used to assess the effects of cis- and trans-UCA on dendritic cell phenotype by using flow cytometry (n = 11).Epidermal APCs from FLG-null subjects had increased CD11c expression. Confocal microscopy confirmed this and additionally revealed an increased number of epidermal CD83(+) Langerhans cells in FLG-null subjects. In vitro differentiation in the presence of cis-UCA significantly reduced costimulatory molecule expression on monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy volunteers and increased their ability to induce a regulatory T-cell phenotype in mixed lymphocyte reactions.We show that subjects with FLG-null mutations have more mature Langerhans cells in nonlesional skin irrespective of whether they have AD. We also demonstrate that cis-UCA reduces maturation of dendritic cells and increases their capacity to induce regulatory T cells, suggesting a novel link between filaggrin deficiency and immune dysregulation.Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Here, CD98 siRNA (siCD98) was complexed with -modified chitosan (UAC) to form nanoparticles (NPs), which were transfected into Raw 264.7 macrophages in an effort to convey anti-inflammatory effects. Characterization showed that the generated NPs had a desirable particle size (156.0-247.1nm), a slightly positive zeta potential (15.8-17.5mV), and no apparent cytotoxicity against Raw 264.7 macrophages and colon-26 cells compared to control NPs fabricated by Oligofectamine (OF) and siRNA. Cellular uptake experiments demonstrated that macrophages exhibited a time-dependent accumulation profile of UAC/siRNA NPs. Further in vitro gene silencing experiments revealed that UAC/siCD98 NPs with a weight ratio of 60:1 yielded the most efficient knockdowns of CD98 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α. Indeed, the RNAi efficiency obtained with our NPs was even higher than that of the positive control OF/siCD98 NPs. These results suggest that UAC/siCD98 NPs might be a safe, efficient and promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
