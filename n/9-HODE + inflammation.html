Male (N=10) and female (N=10) runners ran at ∼70% VO2max for 1.5h followed by 30min of downhill running (-10%). Blood samples were taken pre-run and immediately-, 1-h-, and 24-h post-run, and analyzed for 9+13 HODE, F2-isoprostanes, six cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin (MYO). Gender groups performed at comparable relative heart rate and oxygen consumption levels during the 2-h run. All outcome measures increased post-run (time effects, P⩽0.001), with levels near pre-run levels by 24h except for CRP, CK, MYO, and delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). Plasma 9+13 HODE increased 314±38.4% post-run (P<0.001), 77.3±15.8% 1-h post-run (P<0.001), and 40.6±16.4% 24-h post-exercise (P=0.024), and F2-isoprostanes increased 50.8±8.9% post-run (P<0.001) and 19.0±5.3% 1-h post-run (P=0.006). Post-run increases were comparable between genders for all outcomes except for 9+13 HODE (interaction effect, P=0.024, post-run tending higher in females), IL-10 (P=0.006, females lower), and DOMS (P=0.029, females lower). The pre-to-post-run increase in 9+13 HODEs was not related to other outcomes except for plasma granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) (r=-0.710, P<0.001) and IL-6 (r=-0.457, P=0.043). Within the context of this study, exercise-induced increases in 9+13 HODEs tended higher in females, and were not related to increases in F2-isoprostanes, muscle damage, or soreness.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether an increased production of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, specifically 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), can contribute to the altered the redox and immune homeostasis, suggested to be involved in RTT. Serum levels of 9- and 13-HODEs were elevated in RTT and associated with the expression of arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase (ALOX15) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids supplementation has shown to lower HODEs levels in RTT. Statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the increased plasma HODEs levels and the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity. Collectively, these findings reinforce the concept of the key role played by lipid peroxidation in RTT, and the possible ability of omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids supplementation in improving the oxinflammation status in RTT.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small lipid derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE,  and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic acid oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls.It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria. Metabolic pathways that could be targeted towards an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of malaria were also pinpointed.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446191>Longitudinal analysis of serum oxylipin profile as a novel descriptor of the inflammatory response to surgery.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins are potent lipid mediators demonstrated to initiate and regulate  yet little is known regarding their involvement in the response to surgical trauma. As key modulators of the inflammatory response, oxylipins have the potential to provide novel insights into the physiological response to surgery and the pathophysiology of post-operative complications. We aimed to investigate the effects of major surgery on longitudinal oxylipin profile.Adults patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or open colorectal resections were included. Primary outcomes were serum oxylipin profile quantified by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, serum white cell count and C-reactive protein concentration. Serum samples were taken at three time-points: pre-operative (day zero), early post-operative (day one) and late post-operative (day four/five).Some 55 patients were included, of which 33 (60%) underwent surgery that was completed laparoscopically. Pre-operative oxylipin profiles were characterised by marked heterogeneity but surgery induced a common shift resulting in more homogeneity at the early post-operative time-point. By the late post-operative phase, oxylipin profiles were again highly variable. This evolution was driven by time-dependent changes in specific oxylipins. Notably, the levels of several oxylipins with anti-inflammatory properties (15-HETE and four regioisomers of DHET) were reduced at the early post-operative point before returning to baseline by the late post-operative period. In addition, levels of the pro-inflammatory 11-HETE rose in the early post-operative phase while levels of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) fell; concentrations of all three oxylipins then remained fairly static from early to late post-operative phases. Compared to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, patients undergoing open surgery had lower levels of some anti-inflammatory oxylipins (8,9-DHET and 17-HDoHE) in addition to reduced concentrations of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) with increased concentration of their pro-thrombotic counterpart (TxB2).Serum oxylipin profile is modified by surgical intervention and may even be sensitive to the degree of surgical trauma and therefore represents a novel descriptor of the surgical systemic inflammatory response.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408952>Metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in early stages of non-alcoholic  disease--A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of  conditions related to fat infiltration.

In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF, 9,10-DiHOME, , 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these,  and 5-HETE at 24 h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (p < 0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy  acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease.

A link has been established between respiratory exposure to vehicular emissions and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms driving this interaction remain unknown. Chronic inhalation exposure to mixed vehicle emissions has been linked to CVD in animal models. This study evaluated the temporal effects of acute exposure to mixed vehicle emissions (MVE; mixed gasoline and diesel emissions) on potentially active metabolites in the serum of exposed mice. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 or 300 μg/m(3)) by whole body inhalation. Immediately after and 18 hours after the end of the exposure period, animals were sacrificed for serum and tissue collection. Serum was analyzed for metabolites that were differentially present between treatment groups and time points. Changes in metabolite levels suggestive of increased oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione, cysteine disulfide, taurine), lipid peroxidation (13-HODE, ), energy metabolism (lactate, glycerate, branched chain amino acid catabolites, butrylcarnitine, fatty acids), and  (DiHOME, palmitoyl ethanolamide) were observed immediately after the end of exposure in the serum of animals exposed to MVE relative to those exposed to FA. By 18 hours post exposure, serum metabolite differences between animals exposed to MVE versus those exposed to FA were less pronounced.

We investigated the potential for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) dysfunction (i.e., proinflammatory effects) and abnormal plasma eicosanoid levels to contribute to the pathobiology of PAH and assessed ex vivo the effect of treatment with apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide 4F on the observed HDL dysfunction. We determined the "inflammatory indices" HII and LII for HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), respectively, in subjects with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and associated PAH (APAH) by an in vitro monocyte chemotaxis assay. The 4F was added ex vivo, and repeat LII and HII values were obtained versus a sham treatment. We further determined eicosanoid levels in plasma and HDL fractions from patients with IPAH and APAH relative to controls. The LIIs were significantly higher for IPAH and APAH patients than for controls. Incubation of plasma with 4F before isolation of LDL and HDL significantly reduced the LII values, compared with sham-treated LDL, for IPAH and APAH. The increased LII values reflected increased states of LDL oxidation and thereby increased proinflammatory effects in both cohorts. The HIIs for both PAH cohorts reflected a "dysfunctional HDL phenotype," that is, proinflammatory HDL effects. In contrast to "normal HDL function," the determined HIIs were significantly increased for the IPAH and APAH cohorts. Ex vivo 4F treatment significantly improved the HDL function versus the sham treatment. Although there was a significant "salutary effect" of 4F treatment, this did not entirely normalize the HII. Significantly increased levels for both IPAH and APAH versus controls were evident for the eicosanoids , 13-HODE, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE, while no statistical differences were evident for comparisons of IPAH and APAH for the determined plasma eicosanoid levels in the HDL fractions. Our study has further implicated the putative role of "oxidant stress" and  in the pathobiology of PAH. Our data suggest the influences on the "dysfunctional HDL phenotype" of increased oxidized fatty acids, which are paradoxically proinflammatory. We speculate that therapies that target either the "inflammatory milieu" or the "dysfunctional HDL phenotype," such as apoA-I mimetic peptides, may be valuable avenues of further research in pulmonary vascular diseases.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511226>Quantitative profiling of oxylipins in plasma and atherosclerotic plaques of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.</a></h2><p>Oxylipins are oxidation products of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) that affect a broad range of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, inflammation, inflammation resolution, and vascular function.

Oxidative stress may be a hallmark of X-ALD. In the plasma of X-ALD patients with different forms of the disease, characterized by high levels of C24:0 and C26:0, we observed the presence of oxidative stress revealed by decreased levels of GSH, α-tocopherol, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We showed that oxidative stress caused the oxidation of cholesterol and linoleic acid, leading to the formation of cholesterol oxide derivatives oxidized at C7 (7-ketocholesterol (7KC), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC), and 7α-hydroxycholesrol (7α-OHC)) and of 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (, 13-HODE), respectively. High levels of 7KC, 7β-OHC, 7α-OHC,  and 13-HODE were found. As 7KC induces oxidative stress,  and cell death, which could play key roles in the development of X-ALD, the impact of 7KC on the peroxisomal status was determined in microglial BV-2 cells. Indeed, environmental stress factors such as 7KC could exacerbate peroxisomal dysfunctions in microglial cells and thus determine the progression of the disease. 7KC induces oxiapoptophagy in BV-2 cells: overproduction of HO and O, presence of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation; elevated [LC3-II/LC3-I] ratio, increased p62 levels. 7KC also induces several peroxisomal modifications: decreased Abcd1, Abcd2, Abcd3, Acox1 and/or Mfp2 mRNA and protein levels, increased catalase activity and decreased Acox1-activity. However, the Pex14 level was unchanged. It is suggested that high levels of 7KC in X-ALD patients could foster generalized peroxisomal dysfunction in microglial cells, which could in turn intensify brain damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the source of this lipid, owing to the uptake of oxidised LDL by scavenger receptors. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by leukocytes during inflammation produces oxidants that are implicated in atherosclerosis. Modification of LDL by the MPO oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), results in extensive lipid accumulation by macrophages. However, the reactivity of the other major MPO oxidant, hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) with LDL is poorly characterised, which is significant given that thiocyanate is the favoured substrate for MPO. In this study, we comprehensively compare the reactivity of HOCl and HOSCN with LDL, and show key differences in the profile of oxidative damage observed. HOSCN selectively modifies Cys residues on apolipoprotein B100, and oxidises cholesteryl esters resulting in formation of lipid hydroperoxides,  () and F2-isoprostanes. The modification of LDL by HOSCN results macrophage lipid accumulation, though generally to a lesser extent than HOCl-modified LDL. This suggests that a change in the ratio of HOSCN:HOCl formation by MPO from variations in plasma thiocyanate levels, will influence the nature of LDL oxidation in vivo, and has implications for the progression of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary fat plays an important role in alcoholic liver disease pathogenesis. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of ethanol and a diet rich in linoleic acid (LA) leads to the increased production of oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), specifically 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), which contribute to a hepatic proinflammatory response exacerbating liver injury. Mice were fed unsaturated (with a high LA content) or saturated fat diets (USF and SF, respectively) with or without ethanol for 10 days, followed by a single binge of ethanol. Compared to SF+ethanol, mice fed USF+ethanol had elevated plasma alanine transaminase levels, enhanced hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and .

However, the postprandial responsiveness of these compounds is largely unknown; therefore, changes in the circulating oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome in response to a challenge meal were investigated at six occasions in a subject who freely modified her usual diet. The dietary change, and especially the challenge meal itself, represented a modification of precursor  acid status, with expectedly subtle effects on bioactive lipid levels. To detect even the slightest alteration, highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods for bioactive lipid profiling was employed. A previously validated UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for profiling the endocannabinoid metabolome was used, while validation of an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for oxylipin analysis was performed with acceptable outcomes for a majority of the parameters according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for linearity (0.9938 < R2 < 0.9996), limit of detection (0.0005-2.1 pg on column), limit of quantification (0.0005-4.2 pg on column), inter- and intraday accuracy (85-115%) and precision (< 5%), recovery (40-109%) and stability (40-105%).

Hence, the data confirm that the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method performance was sufficient to detect i) a shift, in the current case most notably in the postprandial bioactive lipid metabolome, caused by changes in diet and ii) responsiveness to a challenge meal for a subset of the oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome. To summarize, we have shown proof-of-concept of our UPLC-ESI-MS/MS bioactive lipid protocols for the purpose of monitoring subtle shifts, and thereby useful to address lipid-mediated postprandial inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129008>High levels of oxidized fatty acids in HDL are associated with impaired HDL function in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate oxidation products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in lipoproteins and synovial fluid (SF) from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to non-RA controls. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were isolated from plasma using fast protein liquid chromatography and HDL was isolated from SF using dextran sulfate precipitation. 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 9 hydroxyoctadecadienoic (HODE), and 13-HODE levels were measured in HDL, LDL, and SF by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. HDL's anti-inflammatory function, cholesterol levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activities were determined as previously. 5-HETE, 15-HETE, , and 13-HODE levels were significantly increased in HDL and LDL from patients with active RA (n = 10) compared to healthy controls (n = 8) and correlated significantly with measures of systemic , particularly in HDL (r = 0.65-0.80, p values < 0.004). Higher HETES and HODES in HDL were also significantly correlated with impaired HDL function as measured by the HDL inflammatory index (HII) (r = 0.54-0.58; p values < 0.03). 15-HETE levels and MPO activity were higher in RA SF (n = 10) compared to osteoarthritis (OA) SF(n = 11), and HDL from RA SF had worse function compared to OA SF HDL (HII = 2.1 ± 1.9 and 0.5 ± 0.1), respectively (p < 0.05). Oxidation products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid are increased in HDL and LDL from patients with active RA compared to healthy controls, and are associated with worse anti-oxidant function of HDL. These results suggest a potential mechanism by which oxidative stress from active RA increases oxidized fatty acids in HDL, promoting HDL dysfunction, and thereby increasing atherosclerotic risk.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170928>Effect of exposure to atmospheric ultrafine particles on production of free  acids and lipid metabolites in the mouse small intestine.</a></h2><p>Exposure to ambient ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) is a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, little is known about the effects of air pollution on gastrointestinal disorders.We sought to assess whether exposure to ambient UFP (diameter < 180 nm) increased free  acids and lipid metabolites in the mouse small intestine.Ldlr-null mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or UFP collected at an urban Los Angeles, California, site that was heavily affected by vehicular emissions; the exposure was carried out for 10 weeks in the presence or absence of D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide with antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties on a high-fat or normal chow diet.Compared with FA, exposure to UFP significantly increased intestinal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), including 15-HETE, 12-HETE, 5-HETE, as well as hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), including 13-HODE and . Arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) as well as some of the lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) in the small intestine were also increased in response to UFP exposure. Administration of D-4F significantly reduced UFP-mediated increase in HETEs, HODEs, AA, PGD2, and LPA. Although exposure to UFP further led to shortened villus length accompanied by prominent macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal villi, administration of D-4F mitigated macrophage infiltration.Exposure to UFP promotes lipid metabolism, villus shortening, and inflammatory responses in mouse small intestine, whereas administration of D-4F attenuated these effects. Our findings provide a basis to further assess the mechanisms underlying UFP-mediated lipid metabolism in the digestive system with clinical relevance to gut homeostasis and diseases.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557153>Multiplex profiling of -related bioactive lipid mediators in Toxocara canis- and Toxocara cati-induced neurotoxocarosis.</a></h2><p>Somatic migration of Toxocara canis- and T. cati-larvae in humans may cause neurotoxocarosis (NT) when larvae accumulate and persist in the central nervous system (CNS). Host- or parasite-induced immunoregulatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis; however, detailed data on involvement of bioactive lipid mediators, e.g. oxylipins or eico-/docosanoids, which are involved in the complex molecular signalling network during infection and , are lacking.To elucidate if T. canis- and T. cati-induced NT affects the homeostasis of oxylipins during the course of infection, a comprehensive lipidomic profiling in brains (cerebra and cerebella) of experimentally infected C57BL/6J mice was conducted at six different time points post infection (pi) by liquid-chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Only minor changes were detected regarding pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (cyclooxygenase pathway). In contrast, a significant increase of metabolites resulting from lipoxygenase pathways was observed for both infection groups and brain regions, implicating a predominantly anti-inflammatory driven immune response. This observation was supported by a significantly increased 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE)/ ratio during the subacute phase of infection, indicating an anti-inflammatory response to neuroinfection. Except for the specialised pro-resolving mediator (SPM) neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which was detected in mice infected with both pathogens during the subacute phase of infection, no other SPMs were detected.The obtained results demonstrate the influence of Toxocara spp. on oxylipins as part of the immune response of the paratenic hosts. Furthermore, this study shows differences in the alteration of the oxylipin composition between T. canis- and T. cati-brain infection. Results contribute to a further understanding of the largely unknown pathogenesis and mechanisms of host-parasite interactions during NT.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26975982>Metabolites Associated With Circulating Interleukin-6 in Older Adults.</a></h2><p>Circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in older adults, but mechanisms are unclear. In the current study, we used an untargeted metabolomic approach to develop an improved understanding about mechanisms related to circulating IL-6 in older adults.Serum IL-6 values were log-transformed to normalize its distribution. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression was used to examine the association between 324 serum metabolites with log IL-6. Backward elimination linear regression was used to develop a metabolite predictor set representative of log IL-6.Thirty-six metabolites were significantly associated (p < 0.05 and q < 0.30) with log IL-6 in 73 older adults (average age, 78 years). Metabolites related to tryptophan metabolism (kynurenine, 3-indoxyl sulfate, indoleacetate, indolepropionate, C-glycosyltryptophan), infectious burden (C-glycosyltryptophan, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, 1-methylurate, N-formylmethionine, N1-methyladenosine, 3-indoxyl sulfate, bilirubin (E,E), indoleacetate, γ-CEHC, N-acetylneuraminate), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A expression (kynurenine, 3-indoxyl sulfate, indoleacetate, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, bilirubin, 1-methylurate) were positively associated, whereas metabolites related to CYP-mediated ω-oxidation (adipate, 8-hydroxyoctanoate, azelate, sebacate, undecanedioate, γ-CEHC), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) activation (13 + , bilirubin, 5-oxoproline, cholesterol, glycerate, uridine) were negatively associated with log IL-6. The use of backward elimination regression identified tyrosine, cysteine, uridine, bilirubin, N-formylmethionine, indoleacetate, and 3-indoxyl sulfate to collectively explain 51% of the variance inherent in log IL-6.These data suggest roles for tryptophan metabolism, infectious burden, activation of host defense, and detoxification through CYP1A-mediated pathways in mechanisms related to elevated , whereas CYP-mediated ω-oxidation and PPAR-α activation may be related to decreased  in older adults.© The Author 2016.
